HEADLINE: The Cities And Their New Elite 

BYLINE:  By EMILY EAKIN 

 BODY:
Should Pittsburgh recruit gay people to jump-start its economy? Should Buffalo -- another fiscally flat-lining city -- give tax breaks to bohemians? As policy prescriptions go, these sound absurd. But according to a new theory devised by Richard Florida, a professor of regional economic development at Carnegie Mellon University, towns that have lots of gays and bohemians (by which he means authors, painters, musicians and other "artistically creative people") are likely to thrive.
 To understand why gays and bohemians are linked to prosperity, Mr. Florida explains, you must first understand something else: the role of an emerging economic force that he dubs the "creative class" and that civic leaders in dozens of communities regularly fork over $10,000 to hear him discuss. 
 Comprising doctors, lawyers, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and computer programmers -- almost everyone, in short, who is paid to think for a living -- the creative class now accounts for nearly 30 percent of the workforce, Mr. Florida writes in his new book, "The Rise of the Creative Class: And How It's Transforming Work, Leisure, Community and Everyday Life" (Basic Books). That's double what it was 20 years ago and 10 times what it was at the turn of the last century. Already the dominant economic group, he argues, the creative class is likely only to grow as what it produces -- ideas, information and technology -- becomes an ever larger part of the national economy. "Creativity has come to be valued," Mr. Florida writes, "because new technologies, new industries, new wealth and all other good economic things flow from it." 
Mr. Florida, 44, is hardly the first person to stress the importance of this new group of creative types. The sociologist Daniel Bell predicted its rise 30 years ago, and social scientists have been writing about it ever since under labels ranging from "knowledge" and "information" workers to "symbolic analysts." Two years ago, the journalist David Brooks documented the creative class's bloated bank accounts and weakness for Starbucks and S.U.V.'s in his witty best seller, "Bobos in Paradise" (Bobos being affectionate shorthand for "bourgeois bohemians").
In short, as Paul Romer, a professor of economics at Stanford University put it, there is growing recognition that when it comes to economic growth, "the relatively well educated and relatively creative are disproportionately important." 
Where Mr. Florida adds a new twist, however, is to argue that while the creative class is unquestionably a blessing to the economy as a whole, at the regional level the picture is hardly so rosy. Heralding a "pattern of geographic and class segmentation far worse than any we've ever had," he says, the creative class may mean boom times for one city and obsolescence for another. The reason, he contends, is that this tattooed and espresso-sipping set is unusually finicky. According to conventional economic theory, workers settle in those cities that offer them the highest-paying jobs in their fields. But creative-class workers, Mr. Florida says, are more particular: they choose cities for their tolerant environments and diverse populations as well as good jobs. 
This is where gays and bohemians come in. Towns that have lots of them, Mr. Florida argues, are more likely to have creative-class workers, high-tech industry and, as a result, strong economic growth. Not because there are disproportionate numbers of gays and bohemians in high-tech jobs, he explains, but because their presence signals an open-minded and varied community of the sort that appeals to software engineers and entrepreneurs. (Race, he says, turns out to be less useful as a marker of tolerance because cities with great racial diversity overall are often highly segregated.) 
This, in essence, is Mr. Florida's "creative capital theory." As he put it during a recent interview in Manhattan, "You cannot get a technologically innovative place unless it's open to weirdness, eccentricity and difference."
To make his case, Mr. Florida draws on data from the United States Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics as well as a dizzying array of evocatively titled lists. His book includes a creative class index (ranking cities by the percentage of creative workers in their labor force); a high-tech index (ranking cities by the size of their software, electronics and engineering sectors); an innovation index (ranking cities by the number of patents per capita); a talent index (ranking cities by the percentage of college-educated people in their populations); a gay index (ranking cities by the concentration of gay couples in the population) and a bohemian index (a similar ranking of "artistically creative people"). Like Olympic decathletes, some cities tend to perform well by nearly every measure.Mr. Florida says the "most successful places" are the ones that combine all "three T's" -- tolerance, talent and technology.
Take San Francisco. Not surprisingly, perhaps, it ranks first on the high-tech index and the gay index, comes in fifth on the bohemian index and the innovation index and 12th on the creative class index. It was no accident, Mr. Florida contends, that Silicon Valley took root just a few miles away: "Silicon Valley was near San Francisco, where the geeky engineer with hair down to his waist and no shoes walks into a bar and no one blinks."
And given these scores, it's no wonder that San Francisco takes the top spot on the most important list of all: the creativity index, which ranks cities according to their overall performance and which Mr. Florida calls "a barometer of a region's longer run economic potential." 
Other cities on the creativity index are more surprising. Texas is not a state generally thought of as a bastion of tolerance or technological innovation. But three Texas cities -- Austin, Dallas and Houston -- rank among the list's top 10. (New York City placed a respectable ninth.)
Mr. Florida said even he was shocked by Texas's robust showing. "It's very impressive," he said. "My indicators are very strongly associated with employment growth, technological growth and population growth. Each of these cities has grown substantially. Austin is a growth miracle. It has a great university and has long been a lifestyle mecca for gays and bohemians. But 10 to 20 years ago, if anyone said 'Austin,' you would have said, 'Huh?' "
Most economists would agree, but that doesn't mean they buy Mr. Florida's creative capital theory as the explanation. "My view is that the best thing in terms of economic development is to invest in your centers of higher education," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, a company in West Chester, Pa., that tracks regional growth. "It's no surprise that Austin came up in the last 10 to 15 years. The University of Texas got all that oil money and invested it in technology." 
Moreover, he points out, Mr. Florida's theory fails to account for the extraordinary success of some non-high-tech centers like Las Vegas. More popular with gamblers and tourists than computer geeks, Las Vegas ranks a dismal 47th out of the 49 cities on the creativity index. Yet it had the fastest job and population growth of any major American city in the 1990's. 
Edward L. Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard, said that high numbers of skilled, creative people are clearly good for urban economies. But he was skeptical about tolerance. "I don't know that anyone has shown that tolerance is or isn't deterimental to city growth," he said. "If you wanted to predict growth in the 90's, you would look at warmth, skills and sprawl -- low-density car-driven culture." 
Despite such caveats, however, civic groups in several cities -- including Providence, R.I.; Memphis; Indianapolis; Phoenix; and Bellevue, Wash. -- have found Mr. Florida's ideas compelling enough to hire him as a consultant. 
And this spring, The Austin American-Statesman gave his theory an informal boost. Determined to find the best explanation for why the city's population doubled in the last 10 years, the newspaper asked Robert Cushing, a retired sociologist at the University of Texas in Austin, to test several academic theories: the "social capital theory" developed by the Harvard political scientist Robert D. Putnam, which says economic growth is tied to the amount of civic participation and social cohesion in a community; the "human capital theory" associated with Mr. Glaeser and the University of Chicago economist Robert E. Lucas, which says economic growth is driven by concentrations of educated people; and Mr. Florida's creative-capital theory. 
Mr. Cushing began with the social-capital theory. But using Mr. Putnam's own surveys, supplemented by census data, Mr. Cushing could find no positive connection between rates of civic participation and economic growth. "We came away with nothing," he said. "That doesn't mean there's nothing to the social-capital theory, but in terms of linking it to economic prosperity or urban growth, it was not the least bit helpful." 
Mr. Cushing went on to test the human-capital theory. But though he found an impressive correlation between a city's percentage of college-educated people and growth, he was not completely satisfied. "There are more than 100 university communities, and only 20 cities stand out as places in which it would appear that high-tech development is quite outstanding," Mr. Cushing said. "How do we explain Austin?" 
Finally, and with a good deal of doubt, he turned to Mr. Florida's theory. "When you hear about these cities that have gays or bohos, it doesn't sound scientific," he said. "It sounds gimmicky." To his surprise, the creative-capital theory turned out -- at least after preliminary testing -- to provide the best explanation for Austin's high-tech transformation. "I started the exercise very skeptical of the creative-class notion," said Mr. Cushing, whose findings are discussed in a continuing series of articles in the American-Statesman. "And was astonished by the results."

HEADLINE: An Escalating Blame Game Ensues Over the High Price of Auto Insurance 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
With costs soaring for auto insurance companies, New York is moving toward becoming the most expensive state in the country for coverage. But legislation intended to cut one of the biggest expenses -- fraudulent claims -- has stalled in Albany; adjournment of the state's Assembly is just weeks away, and the odds are rising against a compromise even as the problem worsens.
 Gov. George E. Pataki and other Republicans, Democrats, the top insurance regulator and the insurance companies themselves agree that new laws are needed to plug holes in the state's no-fault auto insurance system, which requires insurers to pay the first $50,000 in medical bills from injuries in an accident, no matter who is at fault. But the different players accuse one another of blocking a solution. 
 Some Democrats and consumer advocates say the insurers have not done enough themselves to address fraud, and have merely tried to pass on rising expenses to drivers while bolstering profits. 
The Democrats say they see no sign of compromise on the part of either Mr. Pataki or the Republicans in the Legislature. "There's been no effort by the administration whatsoever to bring the parties together on a legislative reform package," said Alexander B. Pete Grannis, the Manhattan Democrat and chairman of the Assembly Insurance Committee.
Some insurers and Republicans suggest that Democrats are blocking legislation to address the problem in hopes that the rising cost of auto insurance will become an issue they can use against Mr. Pataki, who is running for re-election this fall.
"It boils down to politics," said Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in Manhattan. "The Democrats control the Assembly and there's not a lot of incentive for them to make Pataki's life easier."
What most divides the sides is the Democrats' desire to have a consumer advocate in the State Insurance Department and to freeze rates and commit to a rate-reduction target. 
In the last year, several insurers, including Allstate, the leading company in New York, have raised rates an average of 10 to 15 percent. The insurers are also refusing to insure drivers they regard as likely to cost them money by filing an accident claim, a policy that forces tens of thousands of drivers to get mandatory coverage from the much more expensive state-run pool of last resort.
Black and Hispanic legislators charge that a preponderance of those rejected for standard coverage are minorities. The insurers concede that most drivers in the pool come from the most densely populated parts of the state, but they say their decisions on coverage are color blind. 
Political surveys suggest the issue has not become a major concern for most New Yorkers. Indeed, some drivers, like Dr. Jonathan Epstein, an emergency medical specialist in Manhattan, seem to be taking the price increases with a shrug. "If it goes up," he said, "there's very little I can do about it. I have to have a car and I have to have insurance."
But Abby Scala, an account executive at Kay Insurance Associates, one of the biggest brokers for auto and home insurance in metropolitan New York, said lots of other customers are beginning to rebel.
"My phone hasn't been this busy in 25 years," she said. "Almost everyone is calling when they get their renewal notices, asking us to shop around for better prices."
Most customers, she said, do not see auto insurance as a political problem, however. "They blame the insurance companies," she said. "They don't even think about the Legislature or the governor." 
Just across the Hudson River, prices in New Jersey have been the highest in the country for several years and have been a big factor in recent gubernatorial elections. The latest data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, an umbrella group of state regulators, put the average annual cost of insuring a car in New Jersey at $1,034 in 1999, $91 more than in New York and $351 more than the national average.
But Mr. Hartwig said that with prices declining in New Jersey as they are rising in New York, New York is likely soon to take the title of most expensive state. It may already have done so, he said; the statistics run two years behind the calendar, with the next report, for calendar year 2000, expected in mid- to late June.
Those figures will probably show New Jersey still in the lead because fraud costs were not significantly reflected in coverage prices in New York until 2001, Mr. Hartwig said. He estimated the average cost of insuring a car in New York in 2001 was $1,080, or $100 more than in New Jersey. But that is not official. And the headlines that come with becoming No. 1 may make a big difference politically.
There is nearly universal agreement on a need for stiffer criminal penalties for cheating on auto insurance claims and on giving insurers more time to investigate suspicions of fraud before paying claims. Such measures, officials and insurers say, could cut losses by up to $1 billion a year in New York. 
But the Republicans strongly oppose a proposal by Mr. Grannis to freeze rate increases for 18 months and then cut prices by up to 17 percent. They also say his proposal to establish a consumer advocate for insurance would merely create another layer of bureaucracy.
Gregory V. Serio, Mr. Pataki's top insurance regulator, and Republican legislators are against enacting rate-cutting provisions until there is evidence of savings. Mr. Serio faulted Mr. Grannis' proposed laws for not being as tough as those advocated by the governor and the Senate.
Even with the recent increases, Mr. Serio said, rates, in many cases, are not high enough to offset the insurers' losses. "A lot of companies are already in a position of rate inadequacy," he said. He said he worried that if companies were not making money, they would leave the state, as some have done in New Jersey. "We want to make sure we can keep the insurance companies in the market," he said, "but also bring some real rate relief to the public."
Mr. Grannis stressed that his rate cut would not be automatic. But he said the burden would be on the insurers to show why they should not reduce their rates.
"If we take $1 billion out of the cost," he said, "there clearly has to be a reduction for drivers, unless the company decides to pocket the difference, which is my worry."
Arguing for a consumer advocate, Mr. Grannis said New York regulators have tended to favor insurers over insurance customers.
Mr. Serio insisted that the Insurance Department, which is widely respected for its technical expertise, had never pulled its punches with the insurers. "Ask any insurance company," he said, "and they will tell you we don't rubber-stamp rates." 
But critics say Mr. Serio's office faces conflicting interests. "The Insurance Department has to wear two hats," said Russ Haven, legislative counsel for the New York Public Interest Research Group. "And that's always difficult. On one hand they have to look after the safety and solvency of the New York insurance industry. On the other hand they're supposed to protect New York drivers."

HEADLINE: Many Relatives, Wary and Anguished, Shun Sept. 11 Fund 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Nearly six months after the federal government opened its checkbook to the relatives of the 3,200 people killed or seriously injured on Sept. 11, fewer than 10 families have filed completed applications, illustrating the complex nature of the process, the anguish or wariness some families still have about settling a victim's financial affairs and lingering concerns about the government fund's fairness.
 In all, about 500 families have filed partial claims with the government's Victim Compensation Fund, many of which need to be verified or lack crucial information from employers and other sources. But even that figure has been smaller than expected, disappointing some supporters of the fund and surprising detractors, too. 
 Of those who have not filed, some say that they are not emotionally ready to translate personal devastation into actuarial calculations. Many say that the application form for death benefits, more than 30 pages long, is so complicated that it requires an armada of outside experts to complete. And some are waiting, anxiously, for other families to wade first into a multibillion dollar fund that has no precedent. 
"It's been slow because it's a new process, it's unfamiliar territory, and people are perplexed," said Kenneth R. Feinberg, the special master overseeing the fund. "But I'm using every device I know to ease the concern of people in grief. I tell them, 'You should file now, because you'll get your money sooner.' "
But the slow pace of applications is also heightening concerns that many families may reject the plan and choose to file lawsuits instead.
When Congress hastily passed legislation in September to create the fund as part of an airline bailout package, officials hailed the plan as a fast and straightforward alternative that would ease the trauma of thousands of families. In exchange for waiving their right to sue -- which some lawyers believe could be a protracted and even risky option -- families have been promised an average payment of about $1.5 million, within four months of their filing.
Now, however, as families grapple with the financial and legal minutiae associated with death, many are finding the fund to be opaque and overwhelming, confusing on one day and comforting the next. They also sense that the fund is a malleable work in progress, responsive to public pressure and subject to frequent clarifications.
Indeed, the House passed legislation last week that would make the American victims of the United States Embassies bombings in Africa in 1998 eligible for payments from the fund. Some senators are also seeking to include the victims of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, prompting speculation that the fund may become an entitlement program for all terrorism victims.
For the Sept. 11 cases, the deadline for filing a claim is still far off: December 2003. And despite the slow start, Mr. Feinberg predicts that 90 percent of the families will eventually sign up. Even so, he has redoubled his efforts in recent weeks to promote the fund by establishing more outreach offices and traveling to Los Angeles and San Francisco to meet with victims' families there.
"It's all part of an effort to ease the access of the claimant to a very unique program, which is unprecedented in history," Mr. Feinberg said. "We'll try to make it efficient and reasonable."
In December, Mr. Feinberg issued draft regulations detailing the mechanics of the fund. But after many families and officials criticized the regulations as stingy, Mr. Feinberg made significant changes in the final regulations, which were issued in March, to increase the payments.
Families of deceased victims can expect a minimum of $250,000 for anguish and loss, and thousands, if not millions, more for economic losses. The fund is expected to award $1.85 million to each family, though deductions from that amount for insurance payments, pensions and other government benefits should leave a net average, Mr. Feinberg predicted, of $1.5 million.
Over all, the fund is expected to cost taxpayers about $4 billion. But given the subjective nature of the fund, and the enormous discretion Mr. Feinberg has to evaluate claims case by case, many families want to see how he handles the first few cases -- and whether he amends the rules along the way.
"I knew from the beginning it would be a waiting game," said Stephen Push, whose wife, Lisa J. Raines, was aboard the plane that flew into the Pentagon. "I suspect that because Feinberg is worried that not a lot of people are signing up for the fund, he's going to make an effort to finesse some issues through his discretion."
When Mr. Feinberg announced his final rules on March 7, 366 claims had been recorded. Since then, there have only been about 130 more, or less than two a day, at a pace that essentially has not changed.
Of the 500 claims to date, about a third are from people who were injured. About 37 percent of the claimants, both survivors and injured victims, have signed up to receive advances of up to $50,000.
Fewer than 10 people have filed completed applications. They will probably be notified next week that the clock has started on their claims: a tentative award to be decided within 45 days, then the option of appealing that award at a hearing.
What may be more significant, though, is what Mr. Feinberg does with a dozen or so test cases that are expected to be filed in two or three weeks. The cases range from low-income families with extenuating personal circumstances to middle-class relatives of rescue workers whose awards would be slashed by generous pension plans to high-income earners whose pay far exceeded the $231,000-a-year cap that Mr. Feinberg has said he will use when calculating economic losses.
"The reason that people are not running to the fund," said Michel F. Baumeister, a Manhattan lawyer who represents more than 50 families, "is that they don't trust it will be fair."
Those who have filed claims have done so primarily because they want to end the process quickly, for intensely personal reasons.
Gwyn Adams, of Houston, lost her oldest son, Shannon, who worked at Cantor Fitzgerald. He was 25, and single, with no dependents. He was renting an apartment with two friends in Astoria, Queens, and was earning $52,000 a year. According to Mr. Feinberg's computations, his survivors would receive $1 million.
To Ms. Adams, the idea of haggling with the fund over the worth of her son's life was unsettling. She found a lawyer in New York, Roberta G. Gordon, who handled her claim without charge. Three weeks ago, she traveled to New York to complete the application in what turned out to be a marathon 11-hour meeting capped by a sobering trip to ground zero.
"I was dealing with all the paperwork, and I couldn't emotionally bury him until I had this done," she said. "That was my way to say goodbye."
Those who haven't filed are still weighing everything from which family member should file the claim to whether to sue the airlines whose plans were hijacked -- as a handful have done, so far.
One victim who has filed a lawsuit, Ellen Mariani, of Derry, N.H., said she found the concept of the fund offensive.
"I think it's a shut-up fund," said Ms. Mariani, whose husband, Neil, was aboard United Airlines Flight 175, which was flown into the World Trade Center. "As far as I'm concerned, they want to get this over with and done and under the rug, but that is not justice."
At the very least, many relatives say that they have been overwhelmed by the level of detail regarding taxes, insurance benefits, workers' compensation and more. For assistance, some families are turning to Trial Lawyers Care, a program established by the Association of Trial Lawyers of America to provide free legal representation to victims, or to aviation-disaster specialists like Kreindler & Kreindler, a law firm that is charging a 10 percent commission for representing claimants.
Some families are also recruiting economists, forensic psychologists and other experts.
"It's very complicated, and I couldn't figure it out," said Cella Woo, an accountant, whose husband, Elkin Yuen, was a broker at Carr Futures.
Indeed, many families, still overcome by raw emotion, say it is much more prudent to watch the fund evolve than to make a claim now. Last week, in fact, Gov. George E. Pataki signed legislation related to the fund that would, among other provisions, prevent insurance companies from cutting off workers' compensation benefits and exempt the awards from state and local taxes.
But until families feel confident that the fund is worth their toil, few see any incentive for acting anytime soon.
"The fund is like a big rhinoceros," said James P. Kreindler, whose law firm represents more than 170 families. "It's very hard to get moving, and the reason why is fear and confusion. But once it gets moving, it'll have a full head of steam."

HEADLINE: Top Democrat For Governor Of Hawaii Withdraws 

BYLINE:  By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: HONOLULU, May 31 

 BODY:
Democratic hopes for extending a 40-year grip on the Hawaii governor's office have been dealt a major setback.
 The party's leading candidate in this year's contest, Mayor Jeremy Harris of Honolulu, unexpectedly pulled out late on Thursday, saying that "a year of bad publicity," including unsubstantiated accusations of corruption, had cost him at least 30 points in the polls. 
 "I simply don't believe the race is winnable," he added. "But I do believe this is one of the most important races in the history of the state." 
His departure left stunned Democrats scrambling to find another candidate, and it gave a boost to the leading Republican contender, Linda Lingle, a former mayor of Maui. Four years ago, she came within 5,000 votes of denying a second term to Gov. Benjamin J. Cayetano, who cannot run again because of term limits.
"I'm still the underdog because I'm a Republican," Ms. Lingle said upon learning of Mr. Harris's withdrawal.
For the short term at least, it appeared that the state's lieutenant governor, Mazie Hirono, would be anointed the top Democratic candidate, based on name recognition if nothing else. Ms. Hirono was briefly a candidate last year, but when polls indicated she could not win she dropped out to run for mayor of Honolulu. On Thursday, 30 minutes after Mr. Harris pulled out, she jumped back in. 
Hawaii is perhaps the most Democratic state. Not only has the governor's office been in Democratic hands for 40 years, but both houses of the Legislature are controlled by Democrats and all four members of the Congressional delegation are Democrats, as are all members of the governor's cabinet.
Now, as Mr. Harris's sudden departure demonstrates, Democrats are in disarray. They face accusations that they have mismanaged the state's economy, ignored the needs of its schools, padded the bureaucracy and turned a blind eye to corruption. In recent years, as more and more independents have moved into the state and island customs have begun to break down, fractures have begun to show in the Democratic base, a once-solid bloc of Japanese-Americans, government employees and unionized workers.
Mr. Harris was struggling to hold onto the labor vote, having squabbled with unions over budget cuts and salaries. But his most serious problem was what he referred to as "bad publicity."
Accusations of corruption are an old story in Hawaii politics. But it was Mr. Harris's lot to have the headlines, mainly involving the jailing of Honolulu employees and officials, appear just as he was beginning his campaign for governor.
His name came up directly only once, when an investigation was begun to determine whether workers in his 1996 and 2000 campaigns for mayor had mishandled funds. He denied any wrongdoing and contended that the investigation was politically motivated. 
Mr. Harris said on Thursday that he had been hurt by a politically motivated lawsuit that caused him to suspend campaigning for two months early this year while it was being tried. The suit contended that under Hawaii law, a mayor must resign from office to run for another elective job in the state. The State Supreme Court held that since Mr. Harris was not officially a candidate at the time the suit was filed, the law did not apply. 
Corruption was an issue in the 1998 governor's race. Ms. Lingle said Mr. Cayetano had done nothing to rid government of dishonest officials. In the next breath she would accuse him of allowing the economic boom of the 1990's to bypass Hawaii. Four years later she is hammering the same themes, arguing that corruption and government inefficiency are worse than ever.
"Change is in the air, and this time around I'm going to win," she declared on Wednesday shortly after filing papers to run, a formality since she has been campaigning almost since the results of the last race were posted.
She has also spent much of the past four years serving as the state's Republican chairwoman, working hard to increase the party's numbers in the Legislature. There are now 20 Republicans in the 51-seat House, a gain of 8 during that period, and 3 Republicans in the 25-seat Senate, a gain of 1.
"I'm almost willing to bet that as the next governor I'll have at least one house of our Legislature to work with that's under Republican control," she said.
Dan Boylan, a University of Hawaii professor who analyzes the state's politics, said he believed that this year's election represented the "absolute best" opportunity Republicans have had to capture the governor's office since 1958, the year they last won it. "But keep in mind," he said, "that the demise of the Democrats, at last and finally, has been predicted many times before."

HEADLINE: A Changed Debate on Smoking Restrictions 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 31 

 BODY:
The State Senate plans to vote for the first time on a law that would ban smoking in restaurants statewide, except in bar areas and separately ventilated smoking rooms, said John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate Republican majority.
 The bill that reaches the Senate floor, however, may be less strict than a measure the Assembly passed this week. Some Republicans have raised concerns about how much business owners would have to spend to comply with new regulations. 
 Tobacco lobbyists have been working behind the scenes to kill the bill, and the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association is seeking amendments that would weaken the bill considerably. 
Yet at a time when smoking restrictions have become commonplace throughout the country, even tobacco lobbyists say that the new bill, called the Clean Indoor Air Act, is far short of radical. Already, more than 70 percent of New Yorkers live and dine under more restrictive local laws than the current state law, which requires nonsmoking sections in dining rooms and applies only to restaurants with more than 50 seats. 
The bill is intended to protect the state's thousands of restaurant workers from prolonged exposure to secondhand smoke, which the Environmental Protection Agency considers a Class A carcinogen, said the bill's Democratic champion, Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis.
The nature of the debate over smoking rules has changed significantly since the last big fight, when New York City passed its law in 1994. Philip Morris threatened to move its headquarters out of Manhattan. Scott Wexler, the head of the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association, predicted that restaurant business in New York City would drop by 25 percent. It did not, and many of the economic arguments against such laws have melted away, Mr. Grannis said. "Clearly the validity of the doom-and-gloom, anti-business stuff -- no one makes that argument any more," he said.
"The big difference has been the fact that the public now knows about the way the industry operates," said Blair Horner, the legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, which supports the bill. "They're reduced to being able to block things through sheer political power now, because they don't even have any arguments."
But to a degree, tobacco companies have succeeded at framing the debate as one of hardship to small businesses. A senior aide to Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, pointed to a provision that would require, for example, a partition or six feet of space separating the bar from the dining room. 
The bill's supporters, including the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association and the Medical Society of the State of New York, are scrambling to keep attention on public health. They are quick to point out that a restaurant owner could avoid the expense of installing partitions or ventilation systems by simply banning smoking altogether. "Our attitude is that this bill is already a significant compromise from what the standard should be," said Russell Sciandra, director of the Center for a Tobacco Free New York.
The bill's lead sponsor, Senator Charles J. Fuschillo Jr., said, "I feel very confident and satisfied with the bill in its current form," adding that restaurants could seek hardship waivers. 
But if the tobacco industry has lost the battle to convince the public that secondhand smoke is not a big concern, it has not abandoned its quest for influence. Since a lobbying scandal in Albany weakened the tobacco industry's power, some Democratic committees have refused to take money from tobacco companies. But the Republican Party and Republican committees received $50,000 from Philip Morris alone from May to September 2001, according to an analysis by Common Cause/New York, a citizens' lobbying group. 
Gov. George E. Pataki has not taken a position on the bill. Dr. Antonia C. Novello, the state health commissioner, has said regulating smoking is best left to local governments.
But there are other signs that the bill is gathering support. The fact that Senator Kemp Hannon, chairman of the Health Committee, allowed the bill to pass his committee was taken as a sign that he had gotten a green light from Mr. Bruno. 
At a hearing last week held by Senators Fuschillo and Hannon, the bill's co-sponsors, no tobacco company representatives took the microphone. Mr. Wexler, who says the restaurant and tavern association no longer receives money from tobacco companies, testified that he would simply suggest ways "to make the new law more workable for restaurant owners," including allowing a ventilated smoking area in the same room as nonsmokers. The bill's supporters termed his proposals "poison pills" that would weaken the bill to the point of ineffectiveness.

HEADLINE: Zimbabwe Acts to Obtain AIDS Drugs At Low Prices 

BYLINE:  By HENRI E. CAUVIN 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, May 31 

 BODY:
Desperate for cheaper AIDS treatments, Zimbabwe has declared its H.I.V. epidemic a national emergency, a move that allows it to sidestep patents on essential drugs and import generic substitutes.
 Advocates and experts say they believe that Zimbabwe is the first country to use international trade regulations devised to cut the costs of antiretroviral drugs for AIDS. 
 Zimbabwe has one of the highest rates of infection with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. The government's action may encourage other poor countries to follow suit, particularly in Africa, where most H.I.V.-positive people live, the advocates say. 
 Wary of antagonizing pharmaceutical companies and confusing international investors, many African countries have been reluctant to take advantage of the trade rules.
 The World Trade Organization's meeting last November in Qatar emboldened developing countries, demystifying the organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. Countries were told that they could decide for themselves what constituted a national emergency.
 At least 25 percent of Zimbabwe's adults are infected with the virus, so its need is acute. And with its international image sullied by two years of political turmoil, it had little to lose in declaring an emergency.
 Dr. David Parirenyatwa, the deputy health minister, said in a telephone interview that the country was committed to complying with its international trade obligations and wanted to work within the intellectual property agreement.
 The prices of patented drugs have moved them further and further out of reach of the public health system, Dr. Parirenyatwa said, even as the effects of the epidemic have made treatment an imperative. 
 "What we've found," he said, "is if we don't treat, we create more orphans, because the parents die and those who are working are less efficient because they are sick."
Last month Zimbabwe was awarded almost $23 million over the next two years from the new Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and Dr. Parirenyatwa said
 antiretroviral drugs like AZT and Combivir would be among the needs the money would be spent on.
 GlaxoSmithKline, the British pharmaceutical giant, manufactures AZT, Combivir and at least three of the eight other AIDS drugs under patent in Zimbabwe, according to the Consumer Project on Technology, a Washington advocacy group.
 A spokeswoman said that Zimbabwe had been offered the company's lowest price for its AIDS drugs, but that she could not say whether any drugs had been sold at that price.
 But even the marked-down price can still be far out of reach for poor countries. Ellen 't Hoen, of Doctors Without Borders, said that the world was starting to realize the stark limitations faced by many such countries -- and that the countries were starting to realize that though poor, they are not powerless.

HEADLINE: Despite Protest, Moody's Cuts Japan Rating 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 31 

 BODY:
Alarmed by Japan's climbing debt load, Moody's Investors Service lowered the nation's credit rating by two notches today.
 The move affected the rating on government and government-guaranteed bonds issued in local currency. At the new rating of A2, down from Aa3, bonds from Japan, the world's second-largest national economy after the United States, are now considered as risky as those of Cyprus, Latvia, Poland or Mauritius. 
 The Finance Ministry has been publicly battling with the main credit-rating agencies -- Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch -- since late April, when Moody's said it was considering a two-notch downgrade. The vice minister of finance, Haruhiko Kuroda, responded by assailing the three as ignoring Japanese financial strengths, including the world's largest pools of savings and foreign-exchange reserves.
The government's tone has sometimes been shrill enough to suggest that lawmakers are more concerned with national prestige than with finances. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, for example, has wondered aloud why Japan should be rated the same as some countries that it provides with aid.
But Moody's and many private economists say Japan's leaders are not doing enough to address the country's mounting problems. Moody's cited government indebtedness that is rising to "levels unprecedented in the postwar era in the developed world."
The national debt is expected to reach 139 percent of the gross domestic product this year, which would be more than twice the level in the United States. The country's banks have their own crippling debt problems, the pension system is grossly underfinanced, and the population is aging faster than any other.
Experts say the government's responses to these phenomena -- a cap on new bond issues; some spending cuts; talk of tax, pension and health care changes -- are too timid. But the finance minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, told reporters that "we won't be changing policy because of the downgrade."
Moody's acknowledged that the chances of a major bond crisis were remote, because domestic investors hold nearly 95 percent of the nation's debt. The cost of servicing all that debt is falling because the Bank of Japan has set short-term interest rates effectively at zero, and new low-rate bonds are gradually replacing older ones at higher rates. The central bank has also agreed to buy many new bonds itself.
Still, Japan's economy is not growing fast enough to generate the tax revenue needed to pay down the debt significantly. And the banking system's problems are being aggravated by deflation. 
"The banking problem is too complex for the government to think about," said Kazuhiko Ogata of HSBC Securities in Tokyo. "If the government is forced to pump more taxpayer money into the banks, politicians will have to take responsibility for their actions -- something they are unwilling to do."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares End Week Mixed on Worries Over World Events

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Pleased by encouraging economic reports but wary about world events going into a weekend, Wall Street backed away from a solid rally yesterday, leaving stocks mixed.
 Blue chips closed higher although they retreated from an earlier triple-digit advance. Technology gave back all its gains, turning negative. 
 The market's earlier gain was the first sign of life after a weeklong decline caused by a string of discouraging corporate earning reports. But analysts were not surprised by the pullback, with investors worried about the possibility of terror attacks and the conflict between India and Pakistan.
"It's end-of-the-week jitters," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. "There are enough things to worry about in the world that could go wrong." 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 13.56 points, or 0.1 percent, to 9,925.25, having gained as much as 130.36 points earlier. The advance broke the Dow's four-session 304-point losing streak.
The broader market was mixed. The Nasdaq composite index fell 16.19 points, or almost 1 percent, to 1,615.73, having climbed as much as 19.55 points earlier. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 2.48 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,067.14.
The market was encouraged by positive economic news -- healthy business activity in the Chicago area, a jump in worker productivity and an uptick in consumer sentiment -- but caution crept back into trading as the session wore on.
Among the gainers, Home Depot rose $1.54, to $41.69; Procter & Gamble climbed 80 cents, to $89.55; and UPS advanced $1.38, to $60.38, after Bear, Stearns raised its rating on the stock to buy from neutral.
But technology pulled back, with Microsoft falling $1.73, to $50.91, and Oracle declining 50 cents, to $7.92.
Analysts have been skeptical about the sustainability of any gains, especially as companies start issuing earnings warnings during the next month and also make predictions for the second half of 2002.
"There is a lot of news to come," said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert Baird & Company in Milwaukee. "The market is going to be very volatile to economic data for a while." 
Losers included companies that issued weaker-than-expected outlooks or earnings. Lowe's stumbled 73 cents, to $47.16, after projecting 2002 earnings below analysts' expectations.
Palm fell 62 cents, to $1.59, after announcing that revenue for the fourth quarter will miss expectations and keep it from posting a profit.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 5 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was light at 1.23 billion shares, up marginally from 1.22 billion Thursday. --------------------

Treasury Prices Drop
By Bloomberg News
Treasuries posted their biggest decline in two weeks yesterday after an index of Chicago-area manufacturing rose more than expected in May, adding to evidence an economic recovery is under way.
By late in the day, the 10-year note lost 5/32 , to a price of 98 23/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.04 percent from 5.02 percent on Thursday.
The 30-year bond dropped as well, off 10/32 , to 9619/32 . Its yield increased to 5.62 percent from 5.59 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of nine-day cash-management bills:

HEADLINE: Moody's Sees Risks in Threats to Landmarks 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
In another indication of financial concerns about the threat of terrorist attacks in New York and other cities, a leading bond-rating agency said yesterday that it was reviewing its ratings on $5 billion in loans on about a dozen big commercial buildings and groups of buildings, including the Rockefeller Center complex.
 Most of the buildings are in Manhattan, like the Conde Nast building at 4 Times Square. But also among them are the Columbia Center, the tallest building in Seattle, and the Sun America tower in Los Angeles. 
 The agency, Moody's Investors Service, said it regarded the buildings as potential targets and wanted to make sure they were sufficiently insured to protect lenders.
"There are a lot of people running around saying they have terrorism insurance," said Tad Philipp, a managing director at Moody's. "In some cases it is adequate; in other cases it's not."
Moody's did not provide details of coverage on individual buildings. But it said that in the reviews over the next few weeks those with inadequate coverage would have to either buy more insurance or face the likelihood of a downgrade in their loan ratings.
A downgrade would have immediate financial consequences. A lower rating, reflecting greater risk, would reduce the price of bonds. It would also require some pension funds and other institutional investors to sell their bonds, regardless of market conditions, if the ratings dipped below the minimum grade required by their investment standards.
Moody's said it was not suggesting that the buildings on its list were in imminent danger. "They are riskier than they were at the time they were originally rated," Mr. Philipp said. "Basically, they have a small chance of an event. But there would be fairly drastic consequences if an event occurs."
Before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, coverage against terrorism was included at no extra charge in most commercial insurance policies. After the attacks, the insurance companies withdrew the coverage. Some have gradually agreed to provide the coverage, but at much higher costs than for standard coverage. Brokers say up to $1 billion in coverage for a single building is now available. But many property owners have decided to save money and not buy the coverage. The decision by Moody's is expected to force them to reconsider.
Bankers, real estate companies, insurers and others in the financial services business have been urging Congress to provide for federal payment of most losses in the event of another terrorist attack. Though the House adopted a terrorism insurance bill late last year, the Senate has been unable to agree on the issue.
"If Congress were to come up with a backstop to make insurance more available, that would have a major positive effect," said Daniel B. Rubock, a vice president at Moody's.
Members of Congress have hesitated to act because economic disruptions have generally not been as severe as predicted. Steve Bartlett, the chief executive of the Financial Roundtable in Washington, an association of big banks, insurers and securities companies, said Moody's action was "a huge vote in favor" of federal assistance.
"This is further evidence that there is a huge problem," Mr. Bartlett said.

HEADLINE: Signs of Vigor For Recovery In 4 Reports On Economy 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31 

 BODY:
Manufacturing, which suffered the most in last year's recession, is on a firmer footing, reports showed today, and combined with sharp productivity gains and soaring consumer confidence, demonstrate the start of a sound recovery.
 "Overall, the numbers suggest that the recovery really is taking hold in the second quarter," said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson Associates. 
 Four reports helped to reinforce views, flagging in recent days, that the Federal Reserve might raise rates in August. The Fed is next due to discuss interest rates on June 25. 
Manufacturing in the Midwest jumped to a three-year high in May, according to the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago. Its index surged to 60.8, the highest since April 1999. Last month the index came in at 54.7.
May was the fourth consecutive month with a reading above 50, which points to an expanding regional manufacturing economy.
"The recovery in the manufacturing sector means that the weakest part of the U.S. economy is now on the mend," said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wachovia Securities.
The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured items in April posted their biggest rise since October 2001, gaining a larger-than-expected 1.2 percent, to $323.87 billion. Orders for machinery rose 4.5 percent, the most since March 2000, while orders for electrical equipment and appliances were up 9.6 percent. Demand for computer and electronic products was up 3 percent.
"The third cylinder of the economic engine -- capital spending -- has really begun to fire, and this is a signal of improving business confidence," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo.
There was other good news for the economy. A Labor Department report showed that productivity rocketed ahead in the first quarter, rising 8.4 percent as profit-seeking American businesses squeezed more out of their workers. This met expectations even though it was slightly below the previously reported 8.6 percent rise.
Consumers, too, are doing their bit for the recovery. Sentiment rose in May to its highest level in a year and a half. The University of Michigan's final May consumer-sentiment index rose to 96.9 from 93 in April, market subscribers said, beating expectations and slightly above the preliminary reading of 96 released two weeks ago.
"The fundamentals for consumer spending are pretty healthy," Mr. Sohn said, "so consumer spending will be another economic stabilizer."

HEADLINE: Pollyanna Meets Cassandra 

BYLINE:  By BILL KELLER; E-mail: billkeller@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Now that we've all had a good laugh at the spectacle of our fastidious treasury secretary touring African misery with a middle-aged rock star, now that we've snorted at Paul O'Neill and Bono in matching Ghanaian robes and tortured all the obvious U2 lyrics, it's time to ask whether anything is going on here besides soliciting MTV votes for the Republican Party.
 Before I try to answer that, a caveat. Whenever I set out to write something hopeful about the current administration, I hear a cynical voice whispering "Sucker!" in my ear. And on the subject of compassion, President Bush has more than the usual burden of proof. You don't need Ralph Nader to tell you this is an administration that has methodically exalted corporate power and fortified the obscene gap between America's rich and poor. So my credulity alarm tingles at the idea that the administration cares about the far more remote and powerless poor of Africa. 
 And yet, something interesting seems to be happening. Something we've seen before. 
In the early 90's an improbable consensus came together on the issue of America's own poorest citizens. After a period of fatalism that hit bottom with Charles Murray's classic indictment of welfare, "Losing Ground," some conservatives shook off the deep pessimism that had become an excuse for doing nothing and began asking what would work. Some liberals, in turn, took off their blinders about the failings of welfare. Bill Clinton brought forth a tough-minded law pushing welfare recipients into jobs.
Whatever you think of those welfare-to-work reforms, and most experts agree they did far more good than harm, that hard compromise changed the politics of poverty. As Jason DeParle, who covered all this for The Times, points out, the compromise created a belief that progress was possible, and thus took much of the poison out of the poverty debate. Suddenly there were serious, competing visions of how to help the poor -- and a shared assumption that this was actually a worthwhile thing to do.
Is something similar happening to our attitude toward the rest of the world's poor? Can we do for Congo what we did for Milwaukee?
On one side you have (to oversimplify a bit) the conservative Cassandras, defeatists, moral scolds and free-market zealots who believe that until poor countries get a grip on their own bootstraps, any amount of foreign aid will be money wasted. This idea flowered in the Reagan/Thatcher years, and led the major development lenders to a policy of "structural adjustment": If you want loans, shrink your government, cut your deficits and tighten your belts. And as for those people dying of AIDS and malaria -- not our problem. This approach was not only heartless but mindless; countries being eaten alive by disease, hunger and regional warfare were bad candidates for tough love. Their failures, of course, simply confirmed the pointlessness of aid. American donations shriveled, and not just under Republicans. During the Clinton years, our meager contribution to the world's poor dropped by nearly half. Nowadays your annual share of our aid to the 40 most pitiful countries is about the price of a fancy coffee and a pastry at Starbucks.
If there is a Charles Murray of this debate it is William Easterly, an apostate World Bank economist who wrote an authoritative book last year outlining the failure of foreign aid to generate economic growth. His skepticism has helped stimulate some conservatives to look for new ways up from despair.
On the other side you have (again, to oversimplify) the liberal Pollyannas, populists and romantics who regard aid as a simple humanitarian obligation, even a guilty debt we owe for our exploitation. Putting conditions on aid is a form of colonialism -- except for conditions that suit a liberal agenda, such as empowering women or protecting the environment. Development strategies that feature trade and global business play into the hands of multinational capitalists. If you just pump in the money, countries will get better.
What we are seeing now is an awareness among the Cassandras that foreign misery and chaos breed real dangers to our national interest; and among the Pollyannas, a recognition that more discriminating aid works better and does not necessarily amount to big-business imperialism. You have the Bush administration advocating debt relief and offering a little more money for the most desperate countries; you have Oxfam talking about the importance of lowering trade barriers as part of the war on misery.
It's too early to celebrate a consensus, but it is possible to see some points that might be part of a compromise leading to more help for countries in lethal distress.
One new common theme is a large-scale forgiveness of old debts -- in effect, allowing the poorest countries to declare bankruptcy. This is not the magic bullet the Bono-ites make it out to be, and in a sense it unfairly rewards countries that squandered their loans on corruption and patronage. But the loans are not going to be repaid anyway. The Bush administration and many liberals embrace this idea, along with an important corollary: Stop making these make-believe loans in the first place. Give grants instead, which don't carry burdensome interest, and save loans for countries that will actually repay them.
A second possible point of agreement is that we should no longer give money to governments we know will steal or misspend it. The late economist Peter Bauer famously described foreign aid as the phenomenon of taxing poor people in rich countries to support the lifestyles of rich people in poor countries. Even liberal aid economists, like Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, say that as a general rule, aid should go to foreign governments that are democratic (or at the very least, responsive), that live by the law and that have more or less free markets. These are the countries with a hope of turning aid into economic growth, which may ultimately get them off life support.
The tricky part is judging which countries qualify and, over time, measuring whether they are making good use of their aid. Mr. O'Neill talks about "productivity growth" as the litmus test of whether aid is effective, which sounds sensible in theory but a little simplistic. James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, notes that Mr. O'Neill seems to be setting a standard of effectiveness we don't even apply to our own government.
At the same time, there is enormous good that can be done in failing countries without sending money through their bad governments. As Mr. Sachs points out, relief agencies can immunize children even in war zones.
A third area of agreement is that aid should be more nimble and less bureaucratic. Mr. Easterly counts at least 10 annual reports that every World Bank country officer has to file on every project -- impact on the environment, on indigenous peoples, on waterways, etc. Now the World Bank and its meaner sister, the International Monetary Fund, are everybody's favorite scapegoats -- to the left, handmaidens of rapacious multinationals; to the right, an empire of waste. In fact, the bank does what the big donors, mainly Washington, tell it to do, and it has already begun some serious internal reforms. But it could use more competition. Mr. Bush has announced a $5 billion "Millennium Challenge Account," new grants to poor countries with good governments. We'll see if the U.S. can teach the World Bank some new tricks.
A fourth principle should be to separate aid from geopolitical expediency. We used to give money to corrupt thugs -- Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire and Daniel arap Moi in Kenya come to mind -- just because they were anti-Communist. Now we will inevitably give money to some unsavory autocrats for their cooperation against terror. But let's at least not do it out of the aid account. Let's put it in the homeland security budget, or somewhere else.
One other important component of a new middle ground is a recognition that trade is at least as important as aid. Mr. O'Neill was rightly chewed out at every stop on his Africa tour because the latest American farm bill, signed by Mr. Bush, lavishly subsidizes American-grown food that competes with farm products from the poorest countries. On that point you'll find Bono and Oxfam singing perfect harmony with the Wall Street Journal editorial writers. Rich countries spend $350 billion a year on farm subsidies -- six times what they spend on foreign aid.
Will Mr. Bush veto the next farm bill for the sake of free-market principles and a few million African lives? Not until Ugandans vote in Florida. So here's an easier compassion test: Once we've got American aid focused on things that work, let's double it. Then double it again. That would finally catch us up to France in terms of national generosity (Que Bono!) and leave a lot of cynics speechless.

HEADLINE: Enron's Ready Access 

 BODY:
Pressed by Congressional Democrats, the White House has begun disgorging new information about the administration's extensive contacts with Enron executives. Alberto Gonzales, counsel to President Bush, asserted recently that the evidence showed that officials had responded in "appropriate and responsible" ways whenever they were in touch with the giant energy company, which collapsed last winter. But Mr. Gonzales's comment reflects precisely what is wrong with this picture. In Washington it is considered perfectly "appropriate" for officials to grant access to a company that used vast campaign donations to influence policy. 
 The administration says there is no evidence that Enron appealed to White House officials during its financial crisis. Last fall the administration said that Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans had rebuffed Enron's requests for help. Quite properly, however, investigators are seeking evidence that Enron sought to influence policy in less explicit ways that would have helped its balance sheet. The administration's penchant for secrecy, including Vice President Dick Cheney's refusal to provide records of contacts with his energy task force, has not banished suspicions in this regard. Enron and its employees gave more than $1 million to Mr. Bush's campaign, the Republican Party and the Bush inaugural. The company jet was used by Bush aides in the campaign and the post-election dispute in Florida. 
 The most generous Enron donor was Kenneth Lay. The latest information shows that while Mr. Lay was Enron's C.E.O. he was practically a fixture at the White House, attending the inaugural, the Easter egg rolling, T-ball games and other events large and small. The Senate Government Affairs Committee, headed by Joseph Lieberman, would like to know more about Mr. Lay's role in lobbying for policy and personnel changes at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Tennessee Valley Authority. The commission was crucial to Enron's hopes to reduce or eliminate regulation in energy markets in California and elsewhere. The T.V.A. had fought with Enron over electricity contracts. Also, the administration supported Enron's position in opposing energy price caps during the California power crisis. 
The administration needs to be more forthcoming on the evolution of its energy policies as well, many of which mirrored Enron recommendations. The White House likes to point to the number of instances when it did not take Enron's view on energy. That's fair, but the public is entitled to all the information so that cases of undue influence can be identified and examined. The phenomenon of a wealthy company using its riches to influence government policy and protect itself from financial ruin needs to be understood in all its dimensions.

HEADLINE: COOKING 

BYLINE:  By Dwight Garner; Dwight Garner is an editor at the Book Review.

 BODY:
POTS and pans are a lot like sweaters, the novelist and food writer Laurie Colwin once wrote: "You may have lots of them, but you find yourself using two or three over and over again." Colwin might as well have been talking about cookbooks. It's never hard to tell, when you walk into someone's kitchen for the first time, which few have been put to good, honest use. (Ignore any pert titles, unblemished in their dust jackets, written by of-the-moment chefs -- those are up there for show.) The cookbooks that get used in my house tend to look like they've been pickled in malt vinegar and then shot from a cannon. They resemble scarecrows as much as they do books.
 The battered survivors on your shelves can be embarrassing. They're like looking at photo albums from that period, circa 1983, when your haircut was modeled on Bono's. One glance is all it takes to chart the sometimes sorry arc of your life in front of the stove. I own, to give just one example, a frightening number of well-thumbed Moosewood cookbooks (and books by their veggier-than-thou imitators). Did I really force my wife to eat that spinach-feta-chickpea mush I was so pleased with? And she hung around? 
 In recent years, I've fallen the hardest for cookbooks by people who can actually write -- books by people like Colwin, John Thorne and M. F. K. Fisher, for whom recipes are almost an afterthought. Literary snobs are nearly as bad as food snobs, and a decent style doesn't necessarily make for a decent recipe, but I can't help it. I'm the kind of food-book consumer who would rather know about Kingsley Amis's hangover cure (he recommends a rereading of "Paradise Lost," Book XII, lines 606 to the end) than the foolproof one suggested by a SWAT team of elite gastroenterologists. The prose in cookbooks has become even more important to me since I married into a food family. (In the 1970's and 80's, my father-in-law, a self-trained chef, ran restaurants in Aspen, Colo., and St. Helena, Calif., that foodies still remember.) With an expert in the family and a spouse who received a nearly full set of his culinary genes, we consult recipes a bit less often than most people, believing along with Colwin that a phone call to a brilliant friend or family member "beats a cookbook hands down: you can't cross-examine a cookbook." This season's best cookbooks aren't always the best written, but they're the ones we wanted to cross-examine the least.
Breakfast would seem like a logical place to begin, if a single cruel fact didn't stand in the way: it's the one meal few of us consult cookbooks to prepare. (Some mornings, just grinding your own coffee beans can feel like a stretch.) If you're among those who agree with A. J. Liebling that for serious eaters each day brings "only two opportunities for fieldwork" -- Liebling liked "a whacking lunch and a glorious dinner" -- let A REAL AMERICAN BREAKFAST: The Best Meal of the Day, Any Time of the Day (Morrow, $34.95), by Cheryl Alters Jamison and Bill Jamison, change your mind. The Jamisons are inquisitive guides through the world of breakfast foods past, present and future. They've done their homework; their book is littered with cheerful old menus (like the 1910 one from the U.S.M.S. St. Louis that features something called Yarmouth Bloaters) and well-chosen tips from antiquated cookbooks. The Jamisons can be sticklers -- I'm not sure they're ever going to persuade me to make my own cottage cheese or granola. But they also offer lots of unpretentious advice, like the best kind of store-bought English muffins (Wolferman's) or the smartest thing to order in a boring breakfast place (a BLT). This book may remind you of some seriously good, simple dishes (shirred eggs, multiple healthy varieties of hash). The Jamisons also smuggle in an absurd number of meat recipes -- notably a "Prime-Time Breakfast T-Bone" -- few of which, frankly, we're ever going to be in the mood to stare at (much less eat) at 9 a.m. Hence this book's not-so-dirty secret: almost everything in it, including the terrific pancake recipes, can make for a whacking lunch or a glorious dinner.
Summer's almost here, and so is the inevitable landslide of books about cooking meat over open fire. (Thoreau could have used this year's selection to build a cabin.) The only one of them that strikes me as essential -- even if you own their previous books -- is Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughby's LET THE FLAMES BEGIN: Tips, Techniques, and Recipes for Real Live Fire Cooking (Norton, $30). It's been 12 years since these guys (Schlesinger owns two restaurants in Massachusetts; Willoughby is executive editor of Gourmet magazine) published their classic, "The Thrill of the Grill"; their new book is, if anything, even tastier. Schlesinger and Willoughby are unfussy cooks who go for big, knock-you-down flavors. Better yet, if you're not a natural caveman, they persuade you that you can, under their tutelage, "go out in the backyard and act as if your awesome culinary performance is no big deal." They don't stint on the basics -- the equipment you need, how to build a proper fire -- and they have a nice, epigrammatic style: "When you're checking your food, remember that it is going to be underdone for a long time, perfectly done for just a minute and overdone for the rest of its existence." If you know all this stuff, just move to the recipes.
Most of them are pretty simple, largely because Schlesinger and Willoughby prefer last-minute rubs to overnight marinades. Everything we made from this book -- the cumin-crusted chicken breasts with orange-chipotle barbecue sauce, the Thai-style thin pork chops with a hoisin sauce glaze, the chipotle-grilled pork medallions with cilantro-peanut sprinkle -- is easier to prepare than it sounds, and is something we'll make again. We also liked the interesting vegetable and fruit concoctions that Schlesinger and Willoughby call "hobo packs": dishes you toss together, wrap in layers of foil and then bury in the coals to cook while your meat does. You will, however -- trust us -- feel like idiots when you're caught using the phrase "hobo pack" in front of dinner guests.
Two other meat books are worth knowing about. The first, Robb Walsh's LEGENDS OF TEXAS BARBECUE: Recipes and Recollections from the Pit Bosses (Chronicle, paper, $18.95), is a pleasantly nostalgic tour through that state's 'cue lore, with great photos and better recipes. (Lady Bird Johnson's barbecue sauce, included here, calls for a half-stick of butter; it's a knockout.) And I can't neglect to mention the only cookbook I've ever read that made me laugh out loud, and more than once: KILL IT & GRILL IT: A Guide to Preparing and Cooking Wild Game and Fish (Regnery, $21.95), by Ted Nugent and Shemane Nugent. Ted Nugent is, of course, the 70's-era gonzo rock star ("Cat Scratch Fever") who's become the Charlton Heston of the VH1 "Behind the Music" generation. You wouldn't want to actually cook from this book -- an alarming number of recipes call for Lipton onion soup mix and Accent seasoning. But it's worth a look, for the simple reason that it's a terrific parody, more incisive than you'd think, of those touchy-feely cookbooks that demand you know the personal history of every ingredient that enters your kitchen. Nugent agrees, except he demands that we become as intimate with our flesh intake as we are with our nuts and twigs. As he puts it, in tones that resemble "Diet for a Small Planet" until you get to the last line: "It is good to know exactly where one's food comes from. Hands-on cause and effect provides valuable lessons in environmental responsibility. You can't deny a gutpile." And here are Nugent's delirious (and pretty accurate) riffs on poultry, which I recommend reading while doing your best Yosemite Sam impression: "Free-range chicken ain't free and that ain't no range. Venison is free-range. Pheasant is free-range. The almighty Ruffed Grouse is free-range. I'm free-range. Chickens are incarcerated. . . . If it can't get away, it ain't free-range and I ain't interested." Someone give this man a show on the Food Network, if not MTV; he's 37 times more interesting than Ozzy Osbourne.
Life doesn't provide many opportunities to mention Ted Nugent and Alice Waters in the same sentence, so I'm doubly grateful that Waters has chosen this season to publish CHEZ PANISSE FRUIT (HarperCollins, $34.95), a book she's written with the cooks from her Berkeley restaurant in collaboration with Alan Tangren and Fritz Streiff. Like all of Waters's Chez Panisse books, this one is lovely to look at -- thanks to Patricia Curtan's delicate color relief prints -- and even more pleasant to read. (Though I could have done with fewer sentences of the "fruit teaches us the meaning of time and eternity" sort.) It was a bit early in the season to put "Chez Panisse Fruit" to proper use -- our farmers' market hasn't opened yet -- but I have a hunch that it may do for some kinds of fruit what Eric Schlosser's "Fast Food Nation" did for cheeseburgers.
Waters and company sort through every kind of fruit you've heard of (and some you haven't) and warn you about the varieties that have been ruined by either chemicals or the infelicities of mass production. You can almost read this book as poetry. Think watermelons are just watermelons? Let Waters tell you about Charleston Gray, Crimson Sweet and Jubilee. Or dates: she likes the Black Sphinx, the Medjool, the Khadrawy and the Zahidi. My only real complaint? In addition to the intuitive and accessible recipes, Waters's book is packed with advice about selecting fruit, yet it's too bulky actually to lug along to your market. All of her books are as much about good shopping as they are about good cooking. How hard would it be for the publisher to tuck a small detachable pamphlet -- Alice's Cliffs Notes -- into the paperback version?
Another book to keep handy this summer is Deborah Madison's LOCAL FLAVORS: Cooking and Eating From America's Farmers' Markets (Broadway, $39.95). Madison, the founding chef of San Francisco's celebrated Greens restaurant, is good company (I like her advice for telling who the real farmers are at your farmers' market -- look for the ones who seem really tired), and her recipes are just as agreeable. By necessity, we cooked mostly from her cold-weather chapters and can report that her leek, scallion and fennel gratin made a vegetarian dinner guest, as well as the rest of us, downshift into a Zenlike state of grace.
It's always fun to eat at Babbo, Mario Batali's earthy Italian restaurant in downtown Manhattan. For many home chefs, however, it may be somewhat less uplifting to cook from THE BABBO COOKBOOK (Clarkson Potter, $40). There are a few excellent and simple recipes here -- we loved the mustard-crusted salmon, to name one -- but quite a lot of them will be difficult to pull off unless you're unemployed and happen to live above a slaughterhouse. Batali is fond of dishes that call for items like caul fat or boar sausage or calf's brains or lamb's tongue -- or the beef cheeks that go into his justly famous beef cheek ravioli. (We like these things, too, but we're as disinclined to spring them on guests as we are to whip them up before an episode of "The West Wing.") The recipes that omit these sneaky bits -- I wonder what Ted Nugent does with his? -- often work some other kind of hard-to-find ingredient, like cardoons or fennel pollen, in at the last minute. The ones that don't do that frequently require some preparation a day or two in advance. There's nothing wrong with any of this -- we sometimes want our cookbooks to be challenging. But we rarely felt up for this book, particularly after encountering too many not-ready-for-Emeril-Lagasse lines like, "We like to get jiggy with strong flavors." In Italian, babbo means "daddy"; this book may simply make you want to cry "uncle."
After Mario Batali, picking up IN THE HANDS OF A CHEF: Cooking with Jody Adams (Morrow, $34.95), by Jody Adams and Ken Rivard, is like encountering Emma Thompson's cookbook after you've fought your way through Quentin Tarantino's. Adams is the co-owner and chef of Boston's Rialto restaurant, but this isn't really a restaurant cookbook; each of these recipes, she writes, "is something we do at my house." Everything we cooked from her book, from the iconoclastic salads (bibb lettuce with creamy mustard dressing and herb-stuffed eggs) and vegetable dishes (glazed carrots in honey and orange juice with black sesame seeds and mint) to several lovely duck preparations, was first rate. It would be swell if Adams would stop referring to sun-dried tomatoes as SDT's, though. Yikes. She makes them sound contagious.
This season's award for the cookbook that reads most like a work of agonized moral philosophy is DAMON LEE FOWLER'S NEW SOUTHERN KITCHEN: Traditional Flavors for Contemporary Cooks (Simon & Schuster, $26). Fowler, a former architect who is also the author of "Classical Southern Cooking," wrestles with Southern food the way James Agee wrestled with the plight of tenant farmers in "Let Us Now Praise Famous Men." He gives you the history of Southern cooking and its myriad influences while worrying about issues like: Are the words "new" and "Southern" oxymorons? Does Southern cooking, as a style, really exist? Can Southerners eat goat cheese without feeling wussy? How about appetizers? ("Southerners have not, historically, been a nation of grazers," he observes dryly.) Must all fish be fried? Do all salads have to include mayo and aspic? Fowler is aware that he can sometimes go a little overboard on the meta-think. After one ponderous section about Southern food lore, he admits: "Well, all of that may seem irrelevant when you are faced with a pork chop." The good news about his new book is that it will help you out when faced with a pork chop, or almost anything else. His pecan-crusted catfish is worth running out and making tonight; his veal stew is an elegant low-country masterpiece, and any chef who splashes this much bourbon around his recipes is welcome in our kitchen anytime.
Here's a lively and extremely uncomplicated cookbook that, almost overnight, became one of our favorites: THE JIMTOWN STORE COOKBOOK: Recipes and More from Sonoma County's Favorite Country Store (HarperCollins, $32.50), by Carrie Brown and John Werner, with Michael McLaughlin. Brown and Werner (her husband, who died before the book went to press) were New Yorkers who moved to Sonoma County and opened a general store in the early 90's. There's zero food theory here, just a lot of recipes that we felt like making more than once. Their terrific and simple "Indian Cashews" -- raw cashews roasted in a pan with spices and Worcestershire sauce -- are now something we have warm and ready before dinner parties; their maple-glazed meat loaf, which is baked while covered with thick slabs of bacon, almost made us crumple with gratitude; the grilled pork tenderloins with citrus glaze is a dish worthy of the best ones in "Let the Flames Begin" (we mopped up the leftover glaze with bread over the next two days); the roasted carrots with three kinds of ginger (fresh, crystallized and ground) is equally nifty. We're just sorry we haven't gotten around to their pan-fried Petaluma duck burgers -- yet.
A few final notes: THE ULTIMATE SHRIMP BOOK: More than 650 Recipes for Everyone's Favorite Seafood Prepared in Every Way Imaginable (Morrow, paper, $16.95), by Bruce Weinstein and Mark Scarbrough, sometimes made us groan -- it's full of lines like "everyone's crazy about shrimp" -- but it happened to arrive in our house at the same time that some obscenely fresh rock shrimp began turning up in our local fish market. Weinstein's recipes for shrimp chowder and shrimp frittata did them full justice. (Weinstein's book is also full of faded classics we'll probably never make but wish someone would share with us when they do: things like Shrimp Diane, General Tsao's Shrimp and Shrimp Newburg.)
Avoid Tamara Weiss's POTLUCK AT MIDNIGHT FARM: Celebrating Food, Family, and Friends on Martha's Vineyard (Clarkson Potter, $32.50), which arrives with a foreword by Carly Simon, unless you really need to know Mary Steenburgen's recipe for corn spoon pudding or are desperate to fix the fried chicken that William Styron claims Bill Clinton loved. Weiss's book is full of chatter like: "Oh, and Mike and Diane" -- that would be Mike Nichols and Diane Sawyer -- "are here and I invited them to come, too. Diane's bringing her favorite cherry pie. Is that O.K.?" This book makes Martha's Vineyard sound like a minimum-security prison for the criminally self-absorbed.
THE CHEESE PLATE (Clarkson Potter, $32.50), by Max McCalman and David Gibbons -- McCalman is the maitre fromager at the New York restaurants Picholine and Artisanal -- can occasionally read like an eighth-grade science textbook. ("Each and every fine cheese has its own distinguishable aromas and flavors. Where do they all come from and what causes them to develop?") But McCalman is so full of good advice about choosing and serving cheese that you'll envy him his rare and surely painful medical condition -- something he calls "cheese elbow." We should all be so lucky.
Finally, Pascale LeDraoulec's AMERICAN PIE: Slices of Life (and Pie) From America's Back Roads (HarperCollins, $23.95) tells the story of the author's road trip, from San Francisco to New York in a Volvo named Betty, looking for great pie recipes. LeDraoulec, the restaurant critic of The Daily News in New York, weighs her book down with too many tired observations of the I'm-off-to-find-America variety, and too many evocations of usual suspects like Kerouac and de Tocqueville. But the recipes she picks up, often from women with reassuring names like Edna and Dorothy Lou, are homey and idiosyncratic. The Turtle Pie recipe, which comes from an Abbeville, La., resident named Libby Bollino, calls for one and a half bags of caramels and a cup of chocolate chips, among other things. It made us feel like we'd been whacked over the head with a Milky Way bar -- and I mean that, I think, in a very good way.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL 

BYLINE:  By Maria Russo; Maria Russo is a writer in New York.

 BODY:
KEEPING alive the romance of travel is a tougher job than ever. Like a long, comfortable relationship, travel these days is all too easily taken for granted: its rhythms are well established, its pleasures familiar and predictable. Is there a spot left on earth that could possibly whisper into a traveler's ear, "You're the first; there's no one like you"?
 Tourism has become the world's biggest industry, and no one has felt the resulting loss of spontaneity and innocence more than travel writers. Certain notions sacred to the profession appear to be breathing their last: That you can still find some "authentic" contrast to our own overprocessed culture. Or that there's still a meaningful distinction to be made between "traveler" and "tourist." With even the remotest destinations featuring strategically located A.T.M.'s, we're all tourists now. 
 When the present state of a place leans toward the depressingly well trodden, one excellent plan is to indulge in a little mental time travel. The Australian writer Tony Perrottet's first book to be published in America, ROUTE 66 A.D.: On the Trail of Ancient Roman Tourists (Random House, $25.95), takes a running leap directly into the problem of centuries of tourist saturation. Perrottet, who now lives in New York, confesses that while he had always been fascinated by antiquity and wanted to visit Greece and Italy, he so loathed the idea of being part of a swarm of visitors that he "had been to just about every place on earth except the Mediterranean."
For someone who prided himself on originality, it was a problem: "How could you see anything new there?" But when he came upon a surprisingly abundant cache of material relating to ancient Roman tourism in the New York Public Library, he hatched a scheme to retrace the steps of ancient travelers, who, it turns out, were every bit as predictable and herd-bound as we are. As Perrottet points out, tourism can flourish only during periods of peace and prosperity. The Pax Romana lasted from 27 B.C. to A.D. 180, during which a mind-expanding -- and programmatic -- sojourn in Greece, Asia Minor and Egypt became practically de rigueur for wealthy young Roman men (and, very occasionally, women).
Perrottet's book is an appealing, if sometimes exhausting, mix of the zany and the arcane, juggling an energetic account of ancient Roman travel habits with a witty record of his own modern journey -- accompanied by his incredibly accommodating (and pregnant) girlfriend, Lesley -- from Rome to southern Italy, then on to Greece, Turkey and Egypt. The idea is to have a last travel blowout before becoming parents, a plan Perrottet feels has "a certain ring to it: heavy with child in the cradle of civilization."
His insistence on seeing what the ancients saw, no matter the filth, decay and craven commercialism obscuring most ancient sites, becomes a terrific running gag. Again and again, he beats his head against intransigent, indifferent or simply lazy local guides. One scuba impresario thinks he's crazy to want to attempt a dive in the Bay of Naples in the rain, but Perrottet won't be deterred, and when he finally sees, underneath a layer of "verdant slime," the remnants of the Roman resort of Baiae, he makes you understand his excitement: "Up on the surface, spitting out a laboratoryful of bacteria, I felt like -- at last! -- I'd beheld the Roman past directly."
"Route 66 A.D." is also, finally, a reflection on the inescapability of the travel industry, and Perrottet's journey seems to have left him with a sober yet optimistic perspective. He points out that while rampant tourism has helped speed the destruction of whole chunks of the ancient world, tourism tied to antiquity can also be a means of renewing a once grand, now scruffy city like Alexandria. While he finds that this ancient center of learning is visited mainly by Egyptian middle-class families looking for a seaside holiday, Perrottet also meets some ambitious young Alexandrians who are pinning their hopes on a new archaeological marine park that may attract "rich European tourists" to the city's submerged cultural riches. "It's archaeology in reverse," he decides. "The past is deftly salvaging the ruins of the present."
Frank Clifford is on a similarly high-concept trip in THE BACKBONE OF THE WORLD: A Portrait of a Vanishing Way of Life Along the Continental Divide (Broadway, $24.95). Clifford, the environment editor of The Los Angeles Times, set out to travel on foot, mule and horse (and now and then by truck) all 3,200 miles of a newly established trail along the Continental Divide, a geographical feature that is, as he puts it, "the part in the hair of a hemispheric watershed that reaches from Alaska to the Strait of Magellan." Clifford maintains that "it would be hard to find a route in this country that offers a more extensive immersion in time travel"; and while he knows plenty about the land, and shares this knowledge judiciously, his main goal is to come into contact with a Western way of life that has survived for centuries in the forbidding terrain near the divide. Now, however, a new economy built on tourism, real estate and recreation is encroaching on this wilderness, with ominous consequences.
Clifford writes with grace and poise about confronting natural hazards. (On horseback in northwestern Wyoming during a snowstorm, he's feeling sorry for himself and the wind-swept trees when an enormous pine suddenly "uproots itself and arcs noiselessly through the air" to land directly in front of him.) But he's more interested in human-created problems. Along the trail, he hooks up with a memorable cast of characters, including a proud old rancher who lives in the Tularosa Mountains of southwestern New Mexico with a dwindling herd of cattle; an impassioned Yellowstone Park ranger who has declared war on poachers and rogue hunting-tour operators; and a shrewd, voluble old surveyor who knows Wyoming's Teton Wilderness inside out after spending four years searching for his son's downed plane. Clifford lets all his traveling companions have a say about what's happening to the West, and so he documents with rare equanimity the politics of land, water, gun control, religious freedom, conservation and mining that have become more and more entrenched and vicious.
Ultimately, though, Clifford's subject is the wilderness ("the great clarifier," as he sees it) and the blend of fear and fascination it inspires -- which, paradoxically, threatens to obliterate its last vestiges. At the end of his trip, he makes his way through the Canadian Rockies with an ex-cowboy and environmental activist who tells him dolefully that "there's no good argument for wilderness. . . . If there were, we'd be winning." Yet Clifford's subtle and heartfelt book is itself an articulate brief for saving land that humans touch only lightly or not at all. "I cannot imagine that if the design of the world were ours to do over," he writes, "we would leave out wilderness any more than we could conceive of Athens without the Parthenon."
Another version of modern time travel animates Isadora Tattlin's CUBA DIARIES: An American Housewife in Havana (Shannon Ravenel/Algonquin, $24.95), an inspired record of four years in Fidel Castro's Cuba, where the past is present -- both tragically and hilariously -- at all times. Tattlin is the pseudonym of an American who, with her two young children, lands in Cuba because of her foreign-born husband's job as an energy consultant. (The book disguises many details, understandably if sometimes irritatingly, as when Tattlin refers throughout to her husband's native country as "X--.") Her position makes possible both an outsider's overview of a tattered but still vibrant culture and an insider's look into the stupefying complications of navigating its day-to-day life. She comes to realize that there is an art to survival in Cuba. "It's an elusive door you have to find," she explains, to locate "motivated Cubans, edible food and charm."
Written in a tone that moves between compassion and outraged incredulity, "Cuba Diaries" is organized as a series of vignettes of such unconventional (at least in Cuba) activities as building a swimming pool and taking a weekend excursion to the beach: in this case, the stunningly beautiful beach near Baracoa, where Columbus landed in 1492 and where the amenities haven't improved all that much. (The best hotel in town has water -- cold water -- for only an hour a day.) An almost surreal walk through a bustling, garbage-strewn, decaying yet still architecturally grand Old Havana calls to mind nothing so much as "Berlin, 1945." Early on, Tattlin realizes that a huge, decrepit, practically merchandise-free department store is "one of the weirdest places on earth . . . not so much because it is stuck in the 50's and is empty, but because it is open, staffed and routine."
Elsewhere, the weirdness approaches the pathetic -- women and children begging tourists for soap, a long line forming in front of a store that has received a shipment of talcum powder -- or the stomach-churning. A search for a "plausible" veterinarian to neuter a cat leads Tattlin to one apartment where the doctor, wrapped in a chenille bedspread, shows her his operating room, with "bloodstains on the walls and on books in bookshelves lining other walls," and another where the vet operates "on a carved mahogany coffee table, next to a Louis XVI-style display case." He assures her that he'll cover the table with a towel.
The book's high point is an appearance by Castro himself at one of the Tattlins' dinner parties, and by this point the bizarre aspects of the visit barely register. Before El Senor arrives, the members of his security detail demand that Tattlin show them the toilet paper he will be using -- they sniff disapprovingly when she tells them it's Cuban -- then instruct her to put it in a plastic bag, tape the bag shut and leave it beside a toilet that can be used only by Fidel. After dinner, he downs several Cognacs as he talks, uninterrupted, in bursts that last almost a half-hour at a time.
"Cuba Diaries" can be a little too free-form, but it's always striking -- above all, as a testament to the human capacity to endure and even flourish under terrible conditions. Food is often scarce for those who don't have dollars, but Tattlin's Cuba is full of art openings and mojito-filled parties where foreigners and Cubans debate world politics and watch painfully lovely sunsets. And, as deplorable as the unnecessary deprivations are, they also foster a moving, almost childlike sense of wonder. "How large the world is!" exclaims a deliveryman who comes into Tattlin's kitchen one day and beholds, with awe, a zucchini.
Even without being subject, like Cuba, to a time-stopping embargo, certain places appear to have changed so little over the centuries that they call out to a traveler who's eager to look back into history. Theresa Maggio's second book about Sicily, THE STONE BOUDOIR: Travels Through the Hidden Villages of Sicily (Perseus, $25), is a record of her rapturous quest for the kind of isolated mountain towns that "didn't rate a dot" on any map. Maggio's paternal grandparents emigrated to New Jersey from a Sicilian village called Santa Margherita Belice at the beginning of the 20th century. They never returned, but she has spent much of her adult life arranging long and short stints on the island they were pushed by poverty to forsake.
Maggio's Sicily is a place where "the bedrock hums with hidden energy." She is especially enamored of the old, now semi-abandoned towns in the fertile area sloping down from Mount Etna, in the eastern third of Sicily, and of a friendly town in the Madonie Mountains in north-central Sicily called Polizzi Generosa, where "my kitchen balcony hung out over a valley so deep it made me dizzy." Wherever she went, she looked for villages whose remoteness or indigence saved them from the wrecking ball of modernization and therefore still boasted buildings made of "creamy yellow sandstone, or black lava, or dense blue stones, or pink clay rocks."
At one point, Maggio spends a night in "the ultimate stone house," a cave in the Nebrodi Mountains in north-central Sicily, where the naturally temperature-controlled, often wood-paneled apartments are furnished with dining-room credenzas, VCR's and microwaves. These dwellings, like all the Sicilian homes Maggio visits, are cleaned furiously and proudly by members of a fierce army of Sicilian housewives. One tells Maggio that her cave was too dark until the morning "I sent my husband off to work, found his sledgehammer" and "made the window into a door."
Maggio mentions at the outset that her favorite movie is Giuseppe Tornatore's "Cinema Paradiso," which is fair warning that her sensibility is on the sentimental side. But if her passion for Sicily sometimes seems to threaten some kind of scary detonation ("This was my blood, conceived deep in a Sicilian mountain," she says as she drinks from a stream), there is no questioning her sincerity. Her book ends up delivering an economical, if episodic, trip through centuries of complicated Sicilian history.
The eloquent British travel writer H. V. Morton, who died in 1979, specialized in transforming a seemingly predictable journey into a fantasy trip back to the past. Learned without being pedantic, dignified but curious about all walks of life, Morton could have made the White Plains Mall seem well worth a visit. Da Capo Press is gradually reissuing paperback editions of his travel books with new introductions by contemporary writers: just out are IN SEARCH OF ENGLAND ($16), with an introduction by Jan Morris; IN THE STEPS OF ST. PAUL ($16), with an introduction by Bruce Feiler; and IN THE STEPS OF THE MASTER ($16), with an introduction by Richard John Neuhaus. It's both exciting and sad to see that Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, the author of "Italian Days" (among several other books), contributed a brief but characteristically intelligent and sumptuously written introduction to Morton's sweeping volume A TRAVELLER IN ITALY ($18). Harrison died in April -- this may have been among the last things she wrote -- but her prose is as unforgettable as ever. She praises Morton for writing books that are "complete and welcoming" and notes how contagious his exhilaration is. The same, of course, could be said of her.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN; 
Lake Champlain

BYLINE:  By JUDITH YARNALL; JUDITH YARNALL teaches at Johnson State College in Vermont.

 BODY:
Stretching 125 miles from southern Quebec to the tiny Vermont town of Benson's Landing, Lake Champlain is inland New England's answer to the Atlantic. Stay by it long enough, and your eye will expect tiers of mountains on the far side of large bodies of water. Seascapes may forever disappoint.
 The Adirondacks press close to Champlain's western shore. To the east, Vermont's slightly more angular Green Mountains hold off for 20-odd miles, creating a lush interval of flat to mildly rolling land that was once the bottom of the Champlain Sea. Now that the sea creatures have been reduced to tiny fossils still found within garden rocks, the area has become a boon to apple growers, dairy farmers and bicyclists. 
 The region is also home to Burlington, whose civic energy and natural beauty regularly cause it to be listed among America's most pleasant, livable small cities. Burlington has a vital downtown pedestrian mall (the Church Street Marketplace), a community boathouse and waterfront park triumphantly reclaimed from industrial decay, the state university atop a hill studded with homes of prosperous 19th-century lumber and marble barons, and a host of summer festivals. Together with Shelburne, seven miles south, it's the Champlain Valley's biggest cultural draw. 
Virtually anywhere by the lake, however, is a fine place to be in summer -- from the pastures and coves of the Champlain Islands in the midst of its broad northern expanse to the orchards of Shoreham near its slender southern tip. You may find a sandy beach, but more likely one made of smooth, flat pebbles -- some with zebra stripes of slate and quartz -- which fit beautifully in the hand. Best to wear water shoes, though.

Events
The Vermont Mozart Festival, July 14 to Aug. 4, (800) 639-9097 or www.vtmozart.com, has long been the area's premier summer celebration. This year's program of 24 performances -- by the Festival Orchestra, the Paris Piano Trio, and the violinist Hamao Fujiwara, among others -- includes a new Family Series. Several favorite sites (the South Porch at Shelburne Farms, Basin Harbor, Kingsland Bay) are by the lake and allow picnicking beforehand. Tickets vary from $22 to $35 for concerts; $3 per child at a Family Series event.
Tents for the Burlington Waterfront Art and Craft Festival, (802) 985-3648, fax (802) 425-3711, www.craftproducers.com, will occupy much of Waterfront Park at the foot of College Street from July 26 to 28. This juried show will present the work of 120 crafts experts, painters and photographers -- with music, wine tasting, cooking demonstrations and kids' events, too. Friday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; general admission, $6.
Those with a yen to see old-fashioned horse power will enjoy the Green Mountain Draft Horse Field Day at Shelburne Farms, (802) 985-8686 or www.shelburnefarms.org, on July 27 from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The $6 Shelburne Farms admission fee ($4 ages 3 to 14) gives you access to Field Day events as well as to walking trails on the estate designed in 1886 by Frederick Law Olmsted with Lila Vanderbilt Webb and her husband, Dr. William Seward Webb. Turn west onto Harbor Road at the light in the village's center.
The Green Mountain Chew Chew Food Fest, also at Burlington's Waterfront Park, June 21 to 23, (802) 864-6674, features local restaurants' fare and music by groups such as the Vermont Jazz Ensemble. Tokens are nine for $5, with all food items three tokens or less. Hours are 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday.
Kingsland Bay State Park in Ferrisburg will be the gorgeous site of the Champlain Valley Folk Festival on Aug. 2 to 4, (800) 769-9176 and www.cvfest.org. A celebration of Yankee, Quebecois, Celtic and bluegrass music, the festival will include workshops, dancing and performances by the Greenbriar Boys and more than 30 other groups. Admission is $25 (evenings or Sunday), $35 (all Saturday) or $65 (all weekend).
The Lake Champlain Maritime Museum, on the grounds of the Basin Harbor Club near Vergennes, (802) 475-2202 or www.lcmm.org, will hold its Annual Small Boat Show on July 6 and 7. This year's theme is the living tradition of boatbuilding in the Champlain Valley. Not only can visitors view and test unusual craft, they can see them being created in the museum's wonderfully resinous boat-building shed. Workshops on blacksmithing, framing, and paddlemaking will be going on all weekend. The museum admission fee of $10 ($5 for ages 5 to 17) gets you into grounds, show and main building, with its reconstructed Lake Champlain horse ferry and exhibits on the Battle of Valcour Island.

Sightseeing
There's no better place to fully sense the lake than the wind-swept deck of a ferry. The Lake Champlain Transportation Company, (802) 864-9804, runs three of the area's four ferries: between Grand Isle, Vt., and Cumberland Head, N.Y., outside Plattsburgh; between Burlington and Port Kent, N.Y.; and between Charlotte, Vt., and Essex, N.Y. The Charlotte crossing, at the lake's loveliest part, takes 20 minutes and deposits you in the small, architecturally interesting town of Essex, with restaurants near the dock. The round trip costs $13.50 for a car and driver, $4 for adults, $1 ages 6 to 12.
The fourth ferry, the 1759 Limited or Fort Ti, (802) 897-7999, runs on an underwater cable between Shoreham, Vt., and Ticonderoga, N.Y. -- next to the site where Ethan Allen and his Green Mountain Boys stormed the fort in 1775. Its short run occurs on demand, 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. in summer; $12 round trip for a car.
The second-best place for lake viewing is Mount Philo State Park in Charlotte, (802) 425-2390. A one-mile hike or drive from the entrance yields the sweep of the valley and Split Rock Point beyond. Other parks can't match Mount Philo's panorama, but they do offer good swimming places. Try Knight Point State Park on the causeway-connected island of North Hero, (802) 372-8389, or Sand Bar State Park in Milton, (802) 893-2525; they have sandy, gradual beaches ideal for young children.
Permanently docked at Waterfront Park, the barge that has been transformed into the Burlington Community Boathouse, (800) 458-9301 or www.windsofireland.com, rents small boats and books two-hour sailing cruises, captain provided, for $25 a person. The snack bar by the boathouse's upper sundeck is pleasant for lunch. The Burlington Bikepath, eight miles long, runs through the park just across the lawn from the boathouse.

Where to Stay
The Vermont Department of Tourism Web site, www.travel-vermont .com, lists most lodging places within the state. Although choices abound in the Burlington area, few are within the city itself. An excellent nearby alternative is the Heart of the Village Inn, 5347 Shelburne Road in Shelburne, (877) 808-1834, fax (802) 985-2870, www.heartofthevillage.com. This welcoming Victorian B & B, with nine spacious rooms, several in the carriage house out back, is restored with fine attention to detail and is an easy walk from the town's restaurants. Doubles begin at $115.
At opposite ends of the lake, the Shoreham Inn, near the town green since 1799, and the Shore Acres, a small resort on North Hero, offer distinctive accommodations at good value. Popular with bicycle tour groups, the Shoreham, (800) 255-5081, www.shorehaminn.com, has 10 large doubles filled with eclectic antiques -- and two carousel horses. All rooms are $95, including breakfast. Some nights the dining room is open, and if it's not, Middlebury is an easy drive.
Most of the 23 air-conditioned rooms at Shore Acres, (802) 372-8722, fax (802) 372-8314, www.shoreacres .com, have views of the lake and Mount Mansfield, as well as attractive watercolors by Vermont artists. Rates run $119.50 a double and include use of the docks, beach, tennis courts, pool and nine-hole pitch-and-putt course. The restaurant, open to the public, offers well-prepared American fare such as apple island chicken with a reduced cider sauce; dinner for two, with wine, about $75.
Budget: The Days Inn, well set back from traffic at 3229 Shelburne Road (Route 7) in Shelburne, (802) 985-3334, fax (802) 985-3419, has 58 well-maintained rooms and an outdoor pool. Rates for doubles vary from $62 to $85.
The EconoLodge is across the road at No. 3164, (800) 825-1882, fax (802) 985-3377, also with an outdoor pool. Its 53 rooms include doubles from $55 to $125, but its two-room suites with kitchenettes, on the back lawn, are more enticing for $80 to $165.
Luxury: The Basin Harbor Club near Vergennes, (800) 622-4000, fax (802) 475-6545, or www.basinharbor .com, has been delighting its guests for several generations. This 700-acre resort, opposite scenic palisades on the New York side, has 38 rooms and 77 one- to three-bedroom cottages, some set among shoreline cedars. Amenities include five tennis courts, an 18-hole golf course, a 40-foot excursion boat, lake and pool swimming, and all-day programs for kids (with a water trampoline for the rambunctious). Summer rates are American Plan, ranging from $230 to $460 a couple a day. Basin Harbor's dining room, requiring coats and ties, is open to nonguests by reservation; the flat fee for a dinner of several courses is $35, excluding wine. The resort's less formal Red Mill offers a cafe menu.

Where to Eat
The finely prepared French food, soft lighting and quiet atmosphere of Cafe Shelburne, 5573 Shelburne Road (Route 7) in the village, (802) 985-3939, never disappoint. Specialties include lobster bisque and sole with a saffron sauce. A three-course dinner for two with wine is about $110.
Most of the many restaurants in the Church Street Marketplace in Burlington have outside tables as well as pleasant interiors. Look for Leunig's Bistro at 115 Church, (802) 863-3759, by now a Burlington institution, where you can dine seriously on French and Italian fare, order off the cafe menu, or read a newspaper by the antique mirrored bar; dinner for two with wine runs from $45 to $80.
Sakura, two blocks away at 2 Church Street, (802) 863-1988, has delicious, delicately prepared Japanese food at reasonable prices. Especially appealing are dinner boxes, offering a choice of sushi, tempuras, and other specialties. Dinner for two with Japanese beer, about $50.
The elegant dining room of the Inn at Shelburne Farms, 1611 Harbor Road, (802) 985-8498, once the Webb family's lakeside "summer cottage," takes reservations for breakfast Monday through Saturday, brunch on Sunday, and dinner daily. On a terrace overlooking English gardens, you can choose from a menu highlighting organic produce, herbs, baked goods and cheeses produced or grown on the estate. Among the entrees is pan-roasted venison accompanied by a ragout of fiddlehead ferns, morel mushrooms and baby turnips. A three-course dinner for two with wine is about $120. Should you not want to go home, there are 24 fresh, antique-filled rooms upstairs, ranging in summer from $100 to $325 a night.
Gillian's, 97 Falls Road, Shelburne, adjacent to the village green and open until 9 p.m., (802) 985-2830, is an upscale diner. Dinner entrees like maple walnut chicken run about $11; wine is available.

HEADLINE: Ports That Reflect a Grand Era 

BYLINE:  By JAKE MILLER; JAKE MILLER writes for children about science, history and the outdoors.

 BODY:
OUT of the thick fog swirling around Winter Island, a lone brown pelican soared into sight, flew silently past the small sailboats anchored offshore and disappeared back into the mist. Nearby, a solitary fisherman cast his line at the foot of the Fort Pickering Lighthouse as small waves lapped the rocky beach.
 Winter Island, a five-minute drive from downtown Salem, Mass., is a city park where you can launch a boat or explore the Civil War-era earthworks of Fort Pickering. But just up the shore from the park, there's a coal-fired power plant and a municipal sewage treatment facility. 
 New England has always had a complex relationship with the sea. For centuries the ocean has served as a source of great wealth for merchants and fishermen. Even in today's tourist-driven economy, the sea is as much hardscrabble workplace as playground. In a pair of day trips from our home in Boston last September, my wife, Rose, and I explored the wharves and waterfronts of Salem and Gloucester, Mass., two places where this heritage can still be seen. 
From the 1640's until the early 19th century, Salem was one of the most important trading ports in America. The Central Wharf of the Salem Maritime National Historic Site is the home of the Friendship, a reproduction of a three-masted East Indiaman that was originally completed in 1797. Construction on the new Friendship began in 1996.
Crews of carpenters and riggers are still outfitting the ship, and visitors can go aboard to watch their progress and to get an inkling of what it felt like to sail to China or Russia on a vessel powered by nothing but muscles and wind, hemp rope and canvas sails. The main mast is nearly as tall as a 10-story building, but the cramped spaces of the 'tween-deck seemed like an awfully small place to live with a dozen other souls for months at a time.
Park rangers are stationed on the ship to answer questions. The ranger we spoke with was eager to talk about Salem's history of privateers, the government-licensed pirates who operated as a sort of freelance American navy during the Revolutionary War and seized cargo from British ships. The ranger deferred one of our questions about some of the Friendship's ropes -- Kevlar coils thicker than my forearm, dyed black to resemble traditional tar-coated hemp lines -- to the master rigger, who happened to be working on board at the time. As we talked, he pointed out the splintered section of the main mast, which had recently been struck by lightning.
After lunch at the nearby Lobster Shanty, a typical seaside snack shack, Rose and I headed around the corner to the Peabody Essex Museum on Essex Street. Founded in 1799 by Salem's merchants at the height of the China trade, the museum celebrates the intersection of New England and the cultures of the world. Merchant ships like the Friendship made their owners wealthy by hauling cargoes of luxury goods from around the world back to Salem. The museum has a stunning permanent collection of Chinese export goods, including porcelain bowls still wrapped in their original straw packing material.
One gallery is dedicated to Cleopatra's Barge, a pleasure boat built in 1816 for George Crowninshield Jr., a shipping merchant. The Peabody Essex also features temporary shows, and on our visit we saw an enchanting exhibition of American needlework art with 19th century embroidery by schoolgirls and sailors as well as work by contemporary textile artists.
Ready for a break from the galleries, we were happy to find the museum's Asian Garden, a welcome, leafy retreat. A helpful, knowledgeable museum cashier later outlined a walking route for us through one of Salem's architecturally rich neighborhoods where mansions sprouted in the 18th and 19th centuries. We walked by dozens of gorgeously preserved homes just a few blocks from the museum. One of the true gems was the formal garden at the Peabody Essex-owned Ropes Mansion, where three gardeners tended the beds of hollyhocks, sunflowers, and dahlias with blossoms the size of my head.
Salem's luxurious homes and gardens are shining reminders of a maritime prosperity that has since faded. International commerce dried up fast during the Napoleonic wars and the War of 1812, and Salem's port never recovered. Nevertheless, the waters off New England continued to provide a bountiful living -- not from trade, but from fish. After all, when the Pilgrims arrived in Massachusetts in 1621 they weren't just searching for religious freedom -- they also came looking for cod. Gloucester was one of the Pilgrims' first fishing stations. More than three centuries later, although the fisheries have been in serious decline for years, Gloucester is still very much a commercial fishing town. 
Walking along the town's waterfront from St. Peter's Park to the Harbor Loop, we saw lobster boats, trawlers and long-liners (commercial fishing boats) moored alongside whale-watching vessels and windjammers. The buoys and floats on the working boats are so colorful that it's easy to forget that they're not decorations but serious tools used every day to wrest a living from the sea.
That's why, in spite of its name, the Cape Ann Historical Museum is as much about Gloucester's living relationship to the sea as it is about the past. The first floor of the museum features the sublime landscapes and maritime paintings of Fitz Hugh Lane. Painting in the mid-1800's, Lane captured real moments and accurate details of the architecture and rigging of the ships he painted. In one work, a schooner awaits a pilot to take it out to sea; in another, a ship rolls in the raging sea. 
Upstairs galleries detail the history, culture, politics and ecology of fishing in Gloucester. The exhibit opens with a series of genre-bending impressionistic wildlife specimen paintings of commercially exploited fish species. Painted in 1995 by a local artist, Debbie Clark, each image is accompanied by legal, ecological and biological information. Farther on, there are displays chronicling changing fishery regulations, a statue of the Virgin Mary cradling a Gloucester schooner (originally displayed at Our Lady of Good Voyage Roman Catholic Church, a traditionally Portuguese church in Gloucester) and a collection of oars decorated for the feast of St. Peter.
We bought sandwiches at Virgilio's Bakery and Deli on Main Street, a few blocks from the museum, and then drove to Halibut Point State Park and Preserve on the other side of Cape Ann. After our picnic, we walked down to the rocky shore and sat in the sun. Just offshore, a lobsterman in orange bib pants tended his traps. Each lobsterman's traps are marked with a buoy in a distinctive color pattern. Most old-timers still prefer combinations of traditional greens and reds, while up-and-comers often choose more striking neon colors.
Halibut Point isn't named after a fish. It got its name from the fleets of schooners that used to "haul about" off shore to round Cape Ann. Thousands of those ships were built in the nearby town of Essex at the mouth of the Essex River. Our next stop was the Essex Shipbuilding Museum, on the site of a boatyard that has been in use since 1668. Our tour began with a 1940's docu-drama video with a contrived story about shipbuilding but fantastic footage of a wooden-hulled, diesel-powered fishing schooner being built by hand, with axes and adzes.
After the video, a guide led us around the museum grounds. We walked through the shipyard itself, past a rusty band saw and piles of wood scraps. To encourage traditional boatbuilding, the museum rents space here to private individuals working on wooden boats. In the museum's hands-on educational center, I used a heavy mallet and something that looked like an overgrown apple-corer to turn a scrap of wood into a treenail, a wooden peg that would have been used to fasten planks to a ship's frame. We saw the salvaged remains of the Evelina M. Goulart, one of only seven old Essex-built schooners still in existence, awaiting restoration in drydock. There was also a small house full of antique tools and maritime models.
Back in the shipyard, our guide pointed out the old door of the rustic paint shed. For generations, the men cleaning their brushes in the shed had flicked paint on it, and the paint had dried in layers creating thick, flowing streams of color. Like the floats on a long-liner or the sleek hull of an Essex schooner, it was never meant to be a work of art. But it was.

HEADLINE: His Really Big Show 

BYLINE:  By Adam Shatz; Adam Shatz last wrote for the magazine about the economist Glenn Loury.

 BODY:
On a cool, drizzly spring evening, Okwui Enwezor is sitting in La Frasca, an intimate Italian restaurant in Kassel, Germany. People at neighboring tables, mostly fair-skinned, stare at him as if he were a matinee idol. Enwezor, a tall, long-limbed Nigerian who moves with balletic grace, takes this in stride, nonchalantly ordering a bottle of Champagne. He sticks out here, and not just because he is the best-dressed man in a small provincial city. Kassel is the home of Documenta, the most prestigious exhibition of contemporary art in Europe and perhaps the world, and Enwezor, the show's artistic director this year, has become one of the town's most famous residents. "The Germans are very inward-looking," he says, when I remark upon the startling effect he has on the room. He gazes around him at the sea of blond hair. "You can't really find a cosmopolitan city in Germany, not even Berlin." 
 Enwezor is one of the most influential and controversial curators on the international art scene, but he stumbled into his profession virtually by accident. He has no background in art history and has never held a full-time museum job. He was born 38 years ago in a small city in Nigeria, and his only degree is a B.A. in political science from a college in New Jersey. While living in Brooklyn, he made a name for himself as a poet and supported himself as a waiter and security guard. It wasn't until the mid-90's, after he started up a hip African arts magazine, that museums began asking him to curate shows. Enwezor comes, in short, from a very different place, geographically and intellectually, than most of his curatorial peers. 
 Far from being intimidated by his lack of traditional credentials, however, Enwezor has been emboldened by it. He says he is trying to redefine the ideas of what it means to be a curator, of what kind of work belongs in an art show and of what a museum exhibit is supposed to accomplish. The aim of curating, he argues, is not to be a taste maker but to "produce knowledge" -- not just of art, but of the world in which it is made. As he puts it, "I can't really explain why instead of preparing the next Documenta, I'm not working at the U.N." Enwezor is probably the only curator who has ever been compared to Kofi Annan, and it's not only because he is an African. He sees himself less as a curator than as a free-floating cultural ambassador who just happens to be doing his work in museums. 
Everyone in the art world has an opinion about Enwezor. Glenn D. Lowry, the director of the Museum of Modern Art, calls him "an extraordinarily intelligent and insightful man who has opened many people's eyes." Enwezor's admirers think his exhibits are both thought-provoking and beautiful. But his critics find his taste in art bland and politically doctrinaire, and they argue that it converges all too neatly with the art establishment's radical-chic proclivities. According to the influential and outspoken art critic Dave Hickey, Enwezor is "a perfect product of the system" -- a postcolonial radical who, deep down, shares the values of his Old World peers. "Here's a critic with third-world roots and a party-line Northern European vision of art practice," Hickey says. "It's basically a Protestant view of art, and it's less concerned with art than with the ideas that inform it." 
Complaints have arisen over Enwezor's managerial style, which is messy at best and tyrannical at worst. As one of his friends told me, "Okwui is lucky to have always had people, primarily very capable women, who create order in the midst of whatever chaos he's constructed." But Enwezor has a rare talent for the curatorial theater of promotion. He talks up each of his shows as if it were epoch-making, and Documenta XI, which opens later this week and which he has transformed from a single-site exhibition into a worldwide "constellation" of seminars and happenings, is no exception. As one curator puts it, "Okwui has been able to theorize his practice in a way that makes him seem very grandiose." 
Enwezor is also adept at playing the part of the hypersophisticated expatriate African intellectual. Both his admirers and his detractors evoke not so much a real person as a character of the times -- a curator so demographically perfect, and so polished, that he would have to be invented if he didn't exist already. "If I called central casting and said, 'Send me an international curator,' they'd send me Okwui," Hickey told me. David A. Ross, the former director of the Whitney Museum and a fan of Enwezor's, agreed: "You couldn't have created a fictional character better than Okwui." 
When we had dinner at La Frasca, Enwezor radiated serenity. He chatted authoritatively about German philosophy, Arabic poetry and Italian wines. (He wasn't happy with the bottle we were drinking.) He ordered his meal with curatorial precision: an arugula salad, followed by half-portions of pasta with prawns and sauteed sea bass. ("Am I the only one taking half-portions?" he asked, as if he were disappointed by my lack of creativity.) He seemed a man entirely at peace with himself, unburdened by doubts. "I've always had an incredible sense of my place in the world," he told me, folding his arms around his chest. You would never have guessed that he faced a punishing deadline, with less than two months to go before Documenta opened, or that he had an appointment after dinner: a meeting with advisers in a Documenta van, parked by the side of the road, that would last until 3 in the morning.
Enwezor, a strikingly handsome man, cut an impossibly cool profile in his loose-fitting, black Yves Saint Laurent coat, dark Raf Simons slacks and squeaky leather shoes, which were custom-made at a fashionable London shop. ("Okwui has always had this regal sense of entitlement," a friend says.) He carries two cellphones, a Kassel number and a New York one. His wife, Muna el Fituri, an art therapist who is raising their daughter in their loft in SoHo, is a Libyan-Polish woman raised in France. A product of British boarding schools, Enwezor speaks in a formal, almost aristocratic style, spreading out his syllables in a charmingly affected way. He is the ultimate cosmopolitan, and his nomadic lifestyle embodies the very kind of globalism that he has championed in the art world since he burst upon the scene a decade ago. 
Documenta, which takes place every five years or so, is often described as the Olympics of contemporary art, the show that everyone in the art world has to attend if they want to keep up with what's new. Historically associated with the European and North American avant-garde, it helped make the reputations of artists like Gerhard Richter and Bruce Nauman in the 1960's and 70's. In his proposal, Enwezor argued that it was time for the show to move beyond Kassel, indeed beyond Europe. And move it is exactly what he has done, turning Documenta into a traveling international symposium on art, politics and culture. 
Working with a team of six curators, he has divided Documenta XI into five "platforms." The Kassel exhibit -- the biggest, most sprawling show in Documenta's history -- is the only platform concerned with what most people think of as art. The other platforms, which took place over the last year and a half in Berlin, St. Lucia, Vienna, New Delhi and Lagos, brought together high-profile academics to talk about truth and reconciliation commissions, the future of democracy and other lofty themes. Thomas Wagner, an art writer for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and one of Enwezor's toughest critics, has mocked the platforms as a wasteful series of didactic seminars in cultural studies -- the "International Enwezor Tours," he sneers. 
At first glance, Documenta XI seems like a nostalgic return to the banner-waving days of early-90's political art. Wagner has said as much, lashing out at Enwezor for being "interested in art only insofar as it can be attached to topics that circulate in the debates of certain in-crowds." And sure enough, there's no shortage of race-class-and-gender work in Documenta XI, which includes some of that school's most celebrated representatives, notably Mona Hatoum, a London-based Palestinian conceptualist, and Renee Green, a black American installation artist. Conspicuously absent from Enwezor's list, moreover, are white male art stars like Richter, Richard Serra and Matthew Barney. The subjects addressed by the show are almost relentlessly topical: the Rwandan genocide, Palestinian history, United States-Mexico border tensions, racism in Europe and labor disputes in South Africa. More than half the artists on Enwezor's list come from the developing world, and while many of these artists, like Hatoum and Green, have big careers on the international scene, a handful don't even make art, in any traditional sense of the word. 
Huit Facettes, for instance, is a group of Senegalese visual artists who conduct workshops in rural villages. Most of their work comes in the form of slides, videos and photographs documenting the workshops. Le Groupe Amos, an association of ministers, lawyers, doctors and professors in the Congo, makes videos, radio broadcasts and pamphlets promoting human rights, sexual equality and nonviolence. There's not an artist among them. 
Enwezor often talks about his commitment to "work that wages a productive resistance" to the culture industry. But the most intriguing question about him is whether his radical approach is actually establishment-approved. In the art world today, the language of rebellion is in many ways the language of power and ambition, and Enwezor is especially masterly at blurring the lines between the two. Though he speaks in insurgent rhetoric, he is part of an increasingly influential group of international curators, a new establishment that is beginning to feel its influence and to propose its own canon of artists. He is both an outsider and an insider -- or rather, he's an insider precisely because he is an outsider. As Thelma Golden, the deputy director of the Studio Museum in Harlem, put it, "The outside is the new inside." 
What's new about Enwezor is the way he bridges the gap between the art world's two self-appointed vanguards -- one aesthetic, the other ideological. One camp believes that art's future lies in discovering new forms of beauty; the other has argued, no less passionately, that beauty is a bourgeois ruse, that art's future lies in radical political engagement, in breaking down the walls between the museum and the world outside. Enwezor transcends this divide, or carefully walks its fault line, by spotlighting work in which protest and visual pleasure are often deeply interwoven. The political artists Enwezor champions are just as preoccupied with the formal design of their art as with getting their message across. And though Enwezor may utter the word "connoisseur" as if it were a relic of a naive, bygone age, he curates his shows with the kind of painstaking attention that connoisseurs bring to objects they love. 
Enwezor's vision of the world, and of art's place in it, is rooted in his personal history and in the history of his nation. The themes in Documenta XI -- ethnic and social conflict, forced migration, political instability, urban unrest -- are ones that have shaped his own life. Enwezor was born into a prosperous Ibo family in Calabar, a small city in southeastern Nigeria. During the Biafran War, which broke out in 1967, the family moved 45 times. "Through these moments of extremity, of deterritorialization," he says, "I learned what it means to be the Other, even within the rooms of one's own home." After the war ended, in 1970, the country's oil boom began, and Enwezor became aware of a wider world beyond Nigeria. "It became clearer and clearer that one's milieu was international," he recalls. (Enwezor has a habit of referring to himself as "one.") 
In 1982, after a semester at the University of Nigeria, Enwezor moved to the Bronx, where he shared a comfortable one-bedroom apartment with a Nigerian friend. While working toward a bachelor's degree in political science at Jersey City State College, he wrote experimental poetry and hung out below 14th Street with writers, artists and musicians. He began paying close attention to the white club that calls itself the art world, and like any shrewd intellectual -- or businessman's son -- he quickly identified the gaps in the field. There was almost no African art to be found in New York's galleries, even though, as he knew, some of the most exciting artists at work were Africans. 
Rather than wait around for the art world to catch up, Enwezor started a magazine. Teaming up in 1993 with two fellow African critics, he launched Nka from his Brooklyn apartment. It soon became trendy to read Nka, or to at least know of it, and the magazine's success raised the profile of its stylish, forceful editor, who began to turn up at panel discussions on contemporary art, and, no less important, at parties and openings. 
"I never really set out to be a curator," Enwezor says. "But once I started publishing my magazine, I knew very clearly what interventions had to be made." Nka gave him the confidence to curate his own shows, and museums began lining up to give him the opportunity. Most institutions lacked the vaguest idea about art in post-independence Africa, and they were desperate for a guide, preferably a native informant, even if he wasn't professionally trained. After putting on a couple of small museum shows, Enwezor had his breakthrough as a curator of "In/sight," a ravishing exhibit of 30 African photographers that opened in the spring of 1996 at the Guggenheim Museum. 
Though Enwezor was untested, timing worked in his favor. The Guggenheim was scheduled to present "Africa: The Art of a Continent," a survey that was controversial because it included little work from the 20th century. When the show opened at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, it drew fire for ignoring contemporary African art. Enwezor and his fellow curators adroitly positioned themselves in their talks with the Guggenheim as a way to fill the gap created by the arriving show. Perhaps to insulate itself from charges of neocolonialism, the museum embraced his proposal. 
A landmark exhibit despite its intimate scale, "In/sight" heralded a new vision of African art -- a uniquely African vision -- through a distinctly nontraditional medium. The show led directly to Enwezor's appointment as curator of the Johannesburg Biennale, as well as to "The Short Century," his highly praised traveling exhibition on postwar African art and politics. Nine months after the Biennale, he was named artistic director of Documenta XI, beating out several candidates with distinguished careers in major museums. 
Enwezor's rapid ascent through the ranks of the art world has provoked a fair amount of grumbling from those he has passed by. The fact that he is a powerful black man in a field with very few black power brokers adds to the tensions surrounding him, but that is only part of the picture. Enwezor has a distinctly postcolonial understanding of race and a manner of negotiating conflict that makes him something of an enigma to many of the people he encounters. "People in the art world misinterpret him as arrogant because they've never met an African who is assertive," says Salah Hassan, an art historian at Cornell University and a founder of Nka. 
On June 8, when Documenta XI officially opens, Enwezor will be at the peak of his influence in the art world. Yet the show also renders him more vulnerable than ever. He will not be the first Documenta curator to come out of the experience feeling depleted because of the grueling labor it involves and the controversies it invariably generates. Many people in the art world regard Documenta as a career-capping event. It is enshrouded in superstitions, the cruelest of which is that once you've done Documenta, you're creatively spent. "No one survives Documenta," Enwezor told me.
After Documenta closes in September, Enwezor will find himself in a difficult and fascinating predicament. By directing the show, Enwezor has fulfilled every curator's dream, which leaves him in a bit of a bind as he considers his next move. It is hard to imagine him running a museum in the Netherlands, as his Documenta predecessor Catherine David is doing; that wouldn't satisfy his global ambition. Then again, there aren't many art-world jobs that would. When I asked him if he'd consider taking a full-time job as a curator in a museum, he nearly lost his cool: "If you're asking me whether I want to go waste my time in a museum with a show every five, six years, the answer is no, I do not. I have no interest in standing on line." He would almost certainly be interested in directing a major institution, but in order to do that, he may, paradoxically, have to temporarily abandon the art world, so that he can reclaim his outsider status. 
One way of doing that would be to make his mark in Africa. He talks about establishing a think tank somewhere in West Africa -- an international global situation" where artists, historians and social scientists could trade ideas about the kinds of issues discussed in Documenta's platforms. He's extremely vague -- deliberately vague, one suspects -- about where he wants to do this and what he hopes to accomplish. Enwezor could well grow tired of curating art shows and recast himself as an activist, as Huit Facettes and Le Groupe Amos have done. When you ask Enwezor's friends where they see him in 10 years, their answers are more direct -- and still more grandiose. Isaac Julien, an artist in Documenta XI, told me he could easily imagine Enwezor as secretary general of the United Nations. Golden said, "I wouldn't be shocked if he ran for president of Nigeria." Judging by the career he has made for himself so far, he'd be a very savvy campaigner.

HEADLINE: Democrats Say No To Assembly Veteran 

BYLINE:  By STEWART AIN 

 BODY:
ASSEMBLYWOMAN Earlene Hill Hooper insists that a personal grudge against her by a prominent Nassau Democrat was the reason she was denied the party's nomination last month for an eighth term in the 18th Assembly District. But Seretta C. McNight, who won the nomination, said that party leaders simply believed it was "time for a change."
 Democratic leaders said they could not recall when a longtime incumbent had been denied the party's designation. Ms. Hooper is challenging Ms. McNight, a former president of the Roosevelt School Board, in the Sept. 10 primary. Ms. McNight has unsuccessfully run for three offices, twice for the County Legislature and once for the State Senate. 
 Jay Jacobs, who became party chairman in October 2001 after successfully managing Thomas R. Suozzi's primary victory for county executive, said he had done as much arm-twisting as possible in Ms. Hooper's behalf.
"I wanted Earlene Hooper to win and to win for the speaker," he said, referring to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who actively supported Ms. Hooper. "But we believe in running an open and fair convention. Those are my values and principles, and I can't compromise them to unduly pressure the convention. I wouldn't do it -- not that anybody was asking me to do it."
Mr. Silver said he supported Ms. Hooper and believes she will win the primary because "she's a friend, a supporter and is right on the issues in her district."
He credited her with pressing the state to take over the failing Roosevelt School District and with getting an additional $6 million in aid each year for the district. "She insisted on the $6 million and would not permit a state takeover of the district without it," Mr. Silver said. 
"She was pushing Mills to do what had to be done," he added, referring to Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner.
Mr. Suozzi, who won Ms. McNight's support in his primary race against Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, said that he believed Ms. McNight was "a good person and an effective community advocate."
But Mr. Suozzi said he was supporting Ms. Hooper because "she can get things done in Albany and deliver for the people in Nassau County."
Asked what he thought about Ms. McNight's winning the party's designation, he said: "As Hooper says, everyone is entitled to run, and this is a Democratic system. Primaries are not necessarily a bad thing. I didn't get my party's nomination, and I won the primary."
Ms. McNight, who won the designation by a vote of 124 to 103, got all of the 58 weighted votes from Roosevelt. 
Perre Smalls, a Democratic zone leader in Hempstead, where Ms. Hooper lives, said the vote in his district was 38 to 0 for Ms. McNight. 
"I didn't play a part in the process," Mr. Smalls said. "I told the people that they could make their own decision, and the people clearly stated that they were not happy with the leadership. They said they plan to challenge everybody who does not serve their interests."
Mr. Smalls added that Ms. McNight won their support because "she talks of empowerment, and that resonates with that area."
Ms. McNight, 43, said she decided to run after conducting what she described as a "listening tour" of the district. "When you are as active in our community as I am, it is easy to gain access and to listen to the concerns of residents," she said. "I knew how dissatisfied I was with respect to the leadership that had been lacking in our community, so I wanted to reach out and go to the people to see if they had the same experience."
Ms. McNight said that many people thought that Ms. Hooper was "inaccessible." 
"And then there were the conditions in the 18th with our educational system, with seniors and employment and economic development," she added. "I found that there were a whole lot of folks who thought like I did -- that it's time for a change, time for representative government."
Ms. Hooper, who was first elected in March 1988, accused Hezekiah Brown of mounting a campaign to deny her the nomination. Mr. Brown, the deputy county executive for general operations, "has been displeased with me on a personal level for over a decade," Ms. Hooper said. 
"Mr. Brown has a personal issue with Earlene, not the Assemblywoman Earlene," Ms. Hooper continued. "Mr. Brown said I have done things to him, but he has not told me what they are."
Asked to comment, Mr. Brown said: "I don't care to respond. I don't think I should make a statement."
Ms. Hooper said Mr. Brown "organized a small group of disgruntled Roosevelt citizens, and they, with their weighted votes, denied me the party designation."
"The group from Roosevelt is comprised of those persons who were removed from the Roosevelt School Board in 1996 and 2002," she said.
Ms. McNight was president of the Roosevelt board in 1996 when she and the rest of the board were removed by the state as a result of legislation Ms. Hooper sponsored. A state panel then ran the district until new elections were held a few months later. Ms. McNight, along with other ousted board members and former board members, were barred by the legislation from running.
Roger Corbin, Democrat of Westbury, a member of the Nassau County Legislature, said the Hooper-McNight race was shaping up as a grudge match with Ms. McNight blaming Ms. Hooper "for all the ills of Roosevelt."
Ms. Hooper said the fact that Roosevelt residents passed the school budget on May 21 was proof that her stands on the school district have support in the community. 
"I just delivered $12 million to the Roosevelt School District this year, and three schools at no cost to the community that by law must be ready for occupancy by Aug. 15, 2005," she said. "This was my idea, my legislation, and I fought for it alone. I call that leadership based on efficiency and experience. Look at the results. The people said yes to the school budget because they knew that the assemblywoman had kept her word."

HEADLINE: A Recovery, Such as It Is, Is Here 

BYLINE:  By IRA BRESKIN 

 BODY:
RECENT statistics suggest that the economic downturn on Long Island, a soft landing if ever there was one, is slowly heading out to sea. But analysts are generally predicting more months of doldrums before the local economy picks up any real speed.
 "The Long Island economy has managed to avoid the brunt of the recent recession exacerbated by 9/11," said Irwin Kellner, a professor of economics at Hofstra University and chief economist at North Fork Bank. 
 Long Island had a net increase of 8,400 jobs for the 12 months ended April 30. In comparison, Long Island created an average of about 6,700 new positions in 2001 and 27,900 in 2000, said Gary Huth, the State Labor Department's analyst in Hicksville. Concurrently, the unemployment rate has fallen. In April, the last month for which statistics are available, the Long Island jobless rate was 3.8 percent, down from a peak of 4.6 percent in February. 
The Island is doing even better in relative terms. The national unemployment rate in April was 6 percent, the highest in almost eight years. New York City's unemployment stood at 7.7 percent.
But even if the Island is stronger than most places, its performance remains anemic when compared with the stellar gains it posted just a year ago. The Island's recent modest payroll gain pales against the 14,000 jobs it added during the first quarter in 2001 and the 26,800 added the year before. And April's 3.8 percent local jobless rate was uncomfortably higher than the 2.6 percent posted in April 2001.
"Our feeling is that things are not that rosy," said Diane Cahill, the director of the Long Island Federation of Labor's Workforce Development Center, a job-training agency in Farmingdale.
Pearl Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, the leading local business group, said that even now, "this economy is slowing down, when measured in a historic context." But she concurred with Dr. Kellner that the Island's economy "appears to have escaped much of the fallout of the national recession."
"What helped us in this recession was the diversity of our economy." she said, referring to Long Island's success in the past decade in replacing thousands of high-paying, highly cyclical defense-related jobs with comparable-paying ones in service industries.
Matthew Crosson, the L.I.A. president, said the 27,000 Long Islanders now employed in defense-related jobs represent only 2.2 percent of the 1.2 million local work force, down from 7.3 percent a decade ago.
Long Island is essentially using these newly created service-industry positions as a shock absorber to soften the impact of the jobs and income lost by residents who worked locally and in New York City, Dr. Kamer said. Nassau County was hurt more by the World Trade Center attack because it has more city-bound commuters than Suffolk County, she added.
While there is no accurate accounting for the income drain on Long Island tied directly to the World Trade Center attack, that loss was meaningful to a local economy that was already slowing down, said Steven Cochrane, director of regional economic analysis for economy.com, an economic research company in West Chester, Pa.
The modest decline in business experienced this year by the Long Island Rail Road -- in terms of commuter ridership, or the number of monthly or weekly commutation passes sold, and total revenue -- reflects the trend. Through April, commuter ridership declined by 5 percent and and total revenue by 2.8 percent, compared with the same four months in 2001, the railroad said. And both declines were slightly steeper than the L.I.R.R. predicted when formulating its 2002 budget.
In the manufacturing sector, the experience of Formed Plastics, a small, privately held maker of specialty products in Carle Place, seems typical.
"We're not seeing many new projects or new designs going forward," said Patrick Long, the company's president.
Much of his business, he said, was from customers finally restocking after drawing down inventory that accumulated in the wake of the World Trade Center attack.
"A lot of people don't have much confidence in the economy," he said.
But other local industries, including information technology and travel and tourism, appear to be slowly emerging from a prolonged slumber that dates to the onset of the recession in early 2001.
Ed Avizur, the president of A.B. Computer Systems in Melville, said several customers decided recently to proceed with projects stalled since mid-2001.
"It is not like 2000 yet, but it's getting better," Mr. Avizur added.
But companies that cut technology staff following the onset of soft demand that predated the Sept. 11 attack have not rushed to fill vacant positions. The A.B. Computer unit that places programmers in temporary assignments regularly gets about 25 unsolicited resumes each week. That's more than five times the number received about 18 months ago, before the high-tech bubble burst, Mr. Avizur said.
Executives in the local travel and tourism industry, one of region's biggest economic contributors, predict a strong second half, said Michael Hollander, the president of the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau in Hauppauge.
He said industry revenue this year would increase by about 4 percent over 2001.
The rosier predictions for this summer come in part because of -- not despite -- the World Trade Center attack. Mr. Hollander said the soft economy and recent concerns about airplane security and safety should make vacations to more expensive and more distant locations less attractive, thus increasing the appeal of Long Island for the 20 million potential tourists living within 300 miles of the Island.
Still, industry revenues for the first half will be off by 5 percent to 8 percent from year-ago levels, Mr. Hollander predicted. The decline would be worse if not for the $100 million boost to the tourism industry from the United States Open golf tournament that's scheduled to be played next week at Bethpage State Park, and from the Belmont Stakes on Saturday, when attendance is expected to be up 20 percent because the Triple Crown will be at stake.
Some economic indicators have sailed along with hardly a hint that the go-go 90's are gone-gone. Undaunted Long Island consumers increased sales tax revenues by 4.4 percent during the 12 months ended April 30, according to Dr. Kellner. He said the comparable figure from 2001 was a 5.1 percent increase.
The median selling price of a single-family home on Long Island soared to $293,000 in April, a 26.2 percent increase from a year earlier, according to the Long Island Board of Realtors. 
Stated another way, housing prices have effectively doubled since 1995, Dr. Kellner said.
The downside: a lack of affordable housing, especially for working-class families.
Long Island commercial property managers are faring much better in this recession than the major one from 1988 to 1992 because they curbed speculative overbuilding, Dr. Kamer said.
Only about 2 percent of the total square footage in Nassau County was available for sublease during the first quarter, and the 183,000 square feet under construction "is not excess supply, even in this soft economy," she said.
Office vacancy during the first quarter stood at a manageable 9.3 percent in Nassau County and 14.2 percent in Suffolk, according to Cushman & Wakefield data.
That translates into office rental rates averaging a respectable $28.85 per square foot in Nassau and $26.39 in Suffolk, Cushman & Wakefield said. 
Also giving the the local economy a boost has been $2 billion in rate cuts provided by the Long Island Power Authority since 1998. The stimulus came in the form of a one-time rebate and an average $21 per month in savings for each of the 800,000 households LIPA serves. The lower power costs are the equivalent of an ongoing 2 percent bonus, Dr. Kellner said.
But it has not been enough to kick the local economy out of low gear. Dr. Kellner predicted that Long Island would increase total employment 0.8 percent this year and 1.5 percent next year. "Whatever the number, the total is well below historic standards," he said.
Dr. Kamer offered a similarly lukewarm general outlook. "A relatively tepid U.S. economic rebound during the remainder of this year is likely to limit regional employment and income growth," she wrote recently.
Mr. Cochrane of economy.com predicted a slow takeoff for Long Island, with total employment rising by 0.6 percent in 2002 and 1.1 percent in 2003, with personal income growth of 1.5 percent this year and 3.7 percent in 2003.

HEADLINE: Reinventing the Inventor 

BYLINE:  By BETH PINSKER 

DATELINE: PRINCETON 

 BODY:
FROM its gilded perch on Route 1 in Princeton, the Sarnoff Corporation looks essentially the same as it has since 1942, when its legendary founder, David Sarnoff -- who changed the world with the invention of the television -- broke ground on a campus for his engineers.
 But the venerable company that perfected the television and developed myriad other gee-whiz innovations of the 20th century like the liquid crystal display and the electron microscope is poised to reinvent itself as it moves through the 21st century -- phasing out its long history of doing research and development on contract for others. 
 What this will mean for Sarnoff -- or at least its executives hope -- is greater efficiencies and more revenue. What it portends for New Jersey, and more specifically a Route 1 dotted with high-tech businesses, is more ominous. Many of the state's pharmaceutical, communications and consumer electronics companies depend on Sarnoff to develop components for their own products. In addition, for the last few years Sarnoff has also been attracting a lot of venture capital and spending a good deal of its own money on spinoff ventures -- most of which will be quieted under the new plan. 
To help push through a 10-year plan to refurbish and transform Sarnoff's 600-square-foot headquarters into a 3.5-million-square-foot technology campus, the company has named a new chief executive, Satyam Cherukuri, who has been with the company 13 years. Taking over for James E. Carnes, who announced his retirement in April after 33 years with the company, Mr. Cherukuri has announced a plan to restructure the company, which had an average revenue of $120 million over the past three years and employs 650 people.
Neither the old way of research and development on contract or the new way of creating spinoff companies was bringing in sufficient revenue to keep the operation humming. So Mr. Cherukuri has been given a mandate to lead the company to greater profits.
For one thing, Mr. Cherukuri said in a recent interview, he planned to move the company from its historical research-and-development mode and turn it into a more client- and consumer-friendly entity -- and then apply to everyday products its innovations in bioscience, communications technology and home electronics.
"We have experimented with different business models over the years, especially in the late 90's as the tech market was superheating," said the 44-year-old Mr. Cherukuri. "Essentially, what we're trying to achieve here is to figure out how we can bring technology to address real needs, and how do we identify those needs better."
Until now, Sarnoff has been divided into research divisions based on such areas of technology as semiconductors, communications and biotechnology -- each with its own subdivisions for marketing and each with a plan to spin off companies to manufacture the products developed.
Through the 1990's, Sarnoff created two dozen such companies, like Orchid BioScience, a genetic analysis company just down the road, which went public in May 2000. Most of the other companies -- like Diva, which markets video-on-demand systems to cable companies, and e-Vue, which specializes in MPEG encoding for multimedia streaming -- are still privately held. It even sold a few ventures, like Delsys Pharmaceutical and Agilevision, to other investors.
But under Mr. Cherukuri's plan, all the technology divisions at Sarnoff will be merged into one unit, and all marketing and sales -- which will become the primary focus of the company -- will be bundled under another unit.
To be sure, the proposed expansion -- which encompasses several new buildings as well as parking garages clustered on 89 acres in the middle of the 336-acre property -- must still overcome several hurdles. It has already drawn its share of raves for the jobs it can generate and criticism for the disruption in the quality of life it may cause when lumped with other projects planned along the Route 1 corridor.
As now envisioned, the technology campus is to comprise as many as 22 buildings with laboratories, offices and hotels as well as services like a day care center and health club. Its anchor is to be a 750,000-square-foot headquarters for Sarnoff, including space for some spinoffs as they are developed. There are also plans for satellite campuses of Stevens Institute of Technology and the New Jersey Institute of Technology. 
"It's more management, less technology," said Mr. Cherukuri, who sees his company initiating "innovation services consulting" -- something akin to management consulting in the financial sector.
Simply put, more Merrill Lynch, less Texas Instruments.
"Sarnoff is a critical organization in the state because of the major research it does, and for what it has done the past couple of years of incubating companies," said Caren Franzini, the executive director of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, which provides money and assistance to high-tech companies.
Ms. Franzini said she saw the future in terms of partnerships between big companies like Sarnoff and small, new companies that might never raise the capital needed to get a larger company off the ground.
But Maxine Ballen, head of the New Jersey Technology Council, a trade association for high-tech companies (of which Sarnoff is a member), said she hoped for a return to the investment of the past few years.
"I understand the need for caution is born out of the times," Ms. Ballen said. "But I hope Sarnoff will continue that mission to incubate as many new ideas as possible and still operate with an entrepreneurial bent."
That may not be so easy, given that research laboratories are costly to operate, and the returns so uncertain. When Mr. Sarnoff started his research division in the 1930's, it was part of the Radio Corporation of America; since he he also ran RCA, the David Sarnoff Research Center essentially received unlimited funds from the company.
At that time, Mr. Sarnoff wanted to develop a system for broadcast television, and he was going to spend whatever it took to do that. Over the last century, that is the way most of the country's consumer electronics research labs have operated and the way the few left -- like Lucent Technologies, Bell Labs or IBM's Watson Lab -- still do.
But after General Electric bought RCA in 1987, the new company cut the Sarnoff Corporation loose. SRI International, a nonprofit organization in California that was a research arm for Stanford University until 1970, decided to pick up the tab and make Sarnoff a wholly owned subsidiary. As a result, Sarnoff, with all of its employees, is now designated as a for-profit division, and they have to find a way to make that profit to stay afloat.
The tricky part is this: Sarnoff's profits can be limited because the company itself it is not a manufacturer. Rather, its bread and butter is contract research for the government, developing such things as lasers and satellite communications. It gets a fee for this work, and also gets to develop consumer applications of whatever it invents, but Sarnoff does not just come up with products and make them on its own.
When Sarnoff develops products and solves technology glitches for commercial ventures like DirecTV and Motorola, it is paid a flat fee while the other companies usually retain the patents. For instance, although Sarnoff helped develop the system for HDTV, companies like Sony and Panasonic actually produce the sets and reaps the revenue.
During the 1990s, with many start-up companies posing increasing competition, the kind of structure under which Sarnoff was operating was by its very nature denying it the kind of profits it could have been reaping -- particularly for the kind of Internet and biotech products on which the company was working. Suddenly, the marketplace was amassing huge amounts of venture capital, not funds for research and development. Anyone with a seemingly good idea could raise a great deal of a capital through a public offering, and then figure out how to make a product to sell.
Sarnoff had always worked the other way -- coming up with the actual products and then seeing what the company, or others, could do with them. Sarnoff had to come up with a new way to get its piece of the action, and to attract skilled workers in the age of stock options.
But as soon as Sarnoff caught on to the new economy, the rules changed again because the high-tech economy fell apart -- made worse in the aftermath of the tragedy of Sept. 11. Not only was there no venture capital, there was far less money for research and development.
"This was especially dire in New Jersey," said Michael Mufson, the executive vice president of Commerce Capital Markets, "because there was little investment by the state and local companies. That hurt the New Jersey technology corridor."
Mr. Mufson said that while money was starting to flow again, it was now going in a different direction.
"Venture capitalists are really looking at product development and marketing, and looking very little at the research," he said. "This is a very practical approach in an environment that is constrained."
It is at this crucial juncture that Mr. Cherukuri is starting the company on yet a new path, one that he says follows in the spirit of the legendary Mr. Sarnoff, who had the vision to see how important television would be long before anyone else.
"The Internet bubble hurt us," said Mr. Cherukuri. "The companies we founded and continue to found are solid companies, fulfilling lasting unmet needs. But the bubble confused everyone, and you couldn't separate the wheat from chaff."
And the chase for money continues. "We have been primarily a techno-snob organization," he said. "Technology was in the driver's seat at all times. Going forward, we'll still have technology as our niche and entree into markets, but we want to be driven by clients and the marketplace."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Charleston, Staten Island; 
Neighborhood That Grew From a Clay Pit

BYLINE:  By JANICE FIORAVANTE 

 BODY:
THE mid-19th century was a time of intense development on Staten Island, as manufacturing flourished in several areas. On the southwestern shore along the Arthur Kill, clay deposits attracted a Manhattan brick manufacturer, Balthazar Kreischer. In 1854, he founded a brickworks factory and clay mining business that also produced tile and terra cotta.
 The town that grew around the plant became known as Kreischerville. Mr. Kreischer built an estate house there and matching homes for his two sons, who became partners in the firm. Four workers' houses and the home of one of the sons, Charles Kreischer, which is on Arthur Kill Road near Kreischer Street, still exist and are New York City landmarks. 
 At the height of its operation in the late 1890's, B. Kreischer & Sons employed more than 300 workers and turned out more than three million bricks yearly. Kreischer brick, which continued to be produced until the 1930's, was used on major building projects throughout New York. Kreischer decorative terra cotta was used in the building of Barnard College around 1900. 
The name Kreischerville fell victim to anti-German sentiment during World War I, and the community took the name Charleston, using the first name of the owner of the Charles Kreischer mansion.
The neighborhood is now the scene of intense debate over 130 acres of city-owned land. Originally called the Charleston Retail Site, the 130 acres are now referred to as Bricktown. Many in the community, with the support of the borough president, James P. Molinaro, and other elected officials, have opposed plans to use all the land for a shopping mall and have instead fought for using the property for other public purposes as well. 
"The community wants to use the land for a school and for recreation and only some retail," said Marie Bodner, district manager of Community Board 3. "It's raw virgin land, and the community wanted to be involved upfront in the planning process."
The current plan, which is being advanced by the city's Economic Development Corporation, is for the Blumenfeld Development Group to use 42 acres for a mall with three major stores -- such as Home Depot, Target and possibly Kohl's -- and the rest for ball fields and passive recreational land and a site for a school building in the future. "We'd also like to see senior housing there -- 100 homes on 10 acres" of the 130 acres, Mr. Molinaro said. The existing proposal is a compromise as many in the community do not see a need for a mall and worry about the impact of added traffic.
The plan was approved this week by the Department of City Planning and still needs the endorsement of the mayor and the City Council.
Charleston is one of the few areas of Staten Island that has not experienced intense housing construction in the past 15 years. That is mainly because much of the area is zoned for commercial use. So, although there is much open space, in some places auto body, trucking and bus companies are built right next to, behind or across from residences.
"There's been a great deal of interest in residential housing for Charleston, but builders find that they'd have to get a zoning change to do it," said Doug Brooks, director of the Staten Island borough office of the Department of City Planning.
Adjacent to the Bricktown site is five acres for which a four-story condominium complex for residents 55 or older has been proposed, according to Diane Rivela, a broker at Century 21 Raritan Bay. She is also working with the company, Staten Island Properties, that is seeking to build the housing. "We're currently awaiting approvals from the Department of City Planning and the New York City Landmark Commission," she said. 
A one-and-a-half acre section of the property has landmark status and includes the vacant Kreischer house, which is to be refurbished as a community center for a 100- to 115-unit town house complex. According to Mr. Brooks, it is easier to get approval from the Landmarks Commission for such a project than to rezone property from manufacturing to residential.
The community is a clash of cultures. Some areas have a touch of Wild West feeling -- there are several stables that board horses. The Equestrian Friends of Clay Pit builds and maintains bridle paths around Charleston and in Clay Pit Ponds State Park Preserve. Dorothy Perosi, the group's president and owner of West Wind Equestrian Center, said money is raised through horse shows, donations and grants. She noted that while there are still 350 horses on Staten Island, this is far less than the 3,200 to 3,500 that were there in 1985. 
THE clay pits that originally attracted Balthazar Kreischer are the basis of a New York state park called Clay Pit Ponds State Park Preserve, the city's only state park preserve. It is a 260-acre nature preserve with wetlands, sand barrens, streams and woodlands, picnicking and hiking on designated trails, as well as more than five miles of bridle paths.
Outside the park, some residents complain about traffic related problems: narrow streets, speeding tractor trailer trucks and inadequate parking. Employees of businesses in the area often park alongside residents' property because few sidewalks exist, sometimes leaving muddy tire tracks in lawns.
"I don't mind good neighbors who respect our rights as residents with children and build sidewalks and off-street parking, but many businesses don't provide parking for their workers," said Andrea DiVito, a resident of 20 years who lives with her husband and two children in a 110-year-old, three-bedroom Queen Anne house on Winant Place, across from the Free Magyar (Hungarian) Reform Church, also a New York City landmark.
Many of the early residents of Charleston in the 19th century were Germans, and there was an influx of Hungarian immigrants in the 20th century. Today the mixture includes large numbers of families of Italian and Irish heritage as well.
Most the homes in the area are single-family houses: detached colonials, Victorians, ranches, raised ranches and even French mansard homes. Homes built in the past several years tend to be either large $500,000-and-up custom detached homes or a few enclaves of semidetached houses in the $200,000 to $300,000 price range.
"Charleston is lush, clean, with plenty of trees -- a neighborhood where split-rail fence exists alongside guard rails from the service road," said Maureen Seaberg, a sales associate at Sun Properties of New York Inc. 
One unusual business is the Colonial Rifle Range, which has existed for 70 years on Arthur Kill Road, one of the community's main thoroughfares even though it is a winding road with just two lanes. 
Allen Alishahi, a broker at Sun, estimated that one-third of Charleston is parkland, one-third industrial or commercial properties and one-third residences.
Like many in the community, he said that since manufacturing no longer thrives in the area, he believes a zoning change to residential is inevitable. Builders are buying land and waiting, Mr. Alishahi said.
While there are homes in the area that are more than 100 years old, a significant portion of Charleston consists of residences that are 70 to 80 years old and are priced from $179,900 for a ranch house to $580,000. 
The only school within Charleston was formerly known as P.S. 4 and is now an annex to P.S. 25, a special education school in neighboring Pleasant Plains. 
The school, which has nine classes for ages 10 to 21 years old, teaches students educational subjects and such daily living activities as cooking, cleaning, shopping and going to the library.
MOST elementary students from Charleston attend P.S. 56, which has 788 students. The four-year school is one of only two in Staten Island that has a Scitech program in math, science and technology, which encourages learning by designing and building. While 73 percent of students in Grades 3, 4 or 5 meet or exceed standards for math, 76.3 percent meet or exceed standards for English Language Arts.
Two intermediate schools serve most public-school children from the neighborhood in Grades 6 through 8. I.S. 34, Totten Intermediate School, which has 1,243 students, was converted in 1972 from the former Tottenville High School. "Our team teaching program allows four teachers to collaborate in English, social studies, math and science in an interdisciplinary fashion," explained Jeff Preston, the principal. 
A literacy block stretches English an extra period to include reading instruction. "Our reading score rank has jumped a point since adding this," Mr. Preston said. Of the eighth graders, 62 percent meet or exceed state standards in English Language Arts, while 46.2 percent meet or exceed standards in math. Its offerings include two computer labs and such nonacademic subjects as stained glass making and digital photography as well as a hand-bell orchestra program.
At Paulo Intermediate School, I.S. 75, which has 1,596 students, the programs include an interactive research lab in the library, stagecraft, TV production, drama and creating original operas. Other activities include a math team, chess club and marching band. Of its eighth graders, 56.9 percent meet or exceed English Language Arts standards, while 53.3 percent meet or exceed math standards, putting it in the top 20 percent of middle schools citywide.
There are 3,800 students attending Tottenville High School. Of 720 graduating seniors last year, 90 percent attended four-year college, 4 percent went on to two-year colleges and 3 percent entered technical schools. The school has 29 classes in various advanced placement subjects, a marching band that has participated in Yankee World Series parades, and the New York City Public Schools Athletic League champion baseball team in 2001.

Nature gradually transformed the pond into a marsh filled with wildlife like red-tailed hawks, turkey vultures, opossums, fence lizards and blue herons.The clay mined there, formed some 135 million years ago, yielded fossils of redwoods, amber and maples. Samples are housed in the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences in St. George. In the rest of Charleston, arrowheads and other native American artifacts were still being discovered in recent years.Other reminders of the past persisted almost until the present day. "As recently as a couple of years ago, there were outhouses standing behind the Kreischer workers' houses," said Marie Bodner of Community Board 3.

HEADLINE: Practicing Without a Net 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN WARNER 

 BODY:
DOCTOR, heal thyself. Again.
 With the failure of the state's largest medical liability insurer, doctors in New Jersey -- already facing staggering rate increases from 10 percent to more than 50 percent -- must rescue their troubled malpractice insurance market once more if they ever want to pick up another scalpel. 
 Physicians are being asked to help finance several insurance schemes to restore competition and stability to the market in which about half the state's 24,000 doctors have lost coverage in the past year.
In the hardest-hit specialties -- neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery and obstetrics -- more and more doctors are planning to move to another state or simply retire early rather than pay rates that in some instances have reached $100,000 a year. And many obstetricians are going so far as to drop obstetrics from their practice to focus solely on gynecology.
In truth, not many patients will shed a tear just because doctors are being forced to dig deeper into the pockets of their well-turned trousers -- in some instances, up to their elbows -- to pay for insurance. Starving doctors are hard to find. Yet while the doctors will be the ones to feel the pain first, it is the patients who will do the real suffering, perhaps in the form of higher fees, and in declining health care as more doctors hang up their surgical gowns. 
"Patients are not going to be able to go to the doctor of their choice," said Dr. Robert Rigolosi, who in May took over as president of the state medical society. "The doctor is not going to be practicing. Lots of the older ones are very popular with their patients, but their hands are tied. They just can't afford to stay in practice."
In May, the MIIX Group, which insures 9,000 doctors -- or 37 percent of all the physicians in New Jersey -- announced it would shut down operations after losing $200 million in little more than a year. Founded in 1977 during an earlier malpractice crisis, MIIX was founded with the help of doctors who had stepped up to contribute the initial capital for the insurer, known then as the Medical Inter-Insurance Exchange, with loans that were later paid off.
For now, the company has set aside $1.2 billion in assets to satisfy any claims arising from current or old policies.
While MIIX's case may be unusual, Larry Smarr, president of the Physician Insurers Association of America, said that many of the underlying issues were affecting medical malpractice insurance all over the country.
Mr. Smarr said the size of claims paid out had been increasing for a decade, noting that according to the association's database of 180,000 claims, the average payout increased 6.8 percent a year in the 1990's.
Of those, he said, doctors would be likely to prevail in 70 percent of the claims, including those that were settled. "It's a lottery system for the lawyers," said Mr. Smarr. "They don't win often, but when they do, they win big," sharing damage awards with their clients.
The cost to defend a case averages $22,967, but that goes up to $85,718 when there is a trial, encouraging many insurers to settle for economic reasons.
Yet Dr. Fred Silverberg, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Chatham, said that doctors were somewhat to blame for rising claims payouts because they often asked their insurer to settle rather than risk a huge judgment.
"Once you settle a claim, you almost become uninsurable the following years," he said. "It's a Catch-22. You either gamble and try to win the case and possibly lose everything, or you settle and you have unaffordable premiums in the coming years."

Malpractice Coverage Required
Like death and taxes, malpractice coverage is one more certainty for doctors. According to state law, all doctors licensed to practice medicine in the state must either be covered by a malpractice policy or have at least a $500,000 line of credit.
In New Jersey, doctors and patients are not the only ones having to contend with MIIX's collapse. Shareholders who have seen the value of the stock slump from $13 earlier this year to $1.50 last week, an all-time low, are irate. But it was in February that the value of the shares dropped precipitously as MIIX's solvency was questioned by the state as well as by private rating companies.
The largest group of shareholders are doctors, who control 45 percent of MIIX stock, said Patricia Costante, the company's chief executive, many of whom received their shares when the company when public in 1999. The Medical Society of New Jersey owns an additional 6 percent, and the rest is controlled by outside investors and institutions.
The company, which has close ties to the medical society, performed well enough through much of the 1980's and early 90's. But by the end of the decade it was in trouble after it embarked on a rapid national expansion and went public at the height of the stock market boom.
At the same time, several strong competitors began grazing on MIIX's home turf -- though Mr. Smarr described MIIX's moves as the most "extreme" -- driving down prices when they all grabbed for a share of the lucrative market as judgments in liability cases began to rise.
When the stock market soured, several of the newer companies pulled out, allowing MIIX and the others left standing to raise rates -- nearly twice as much in some cases.
But for MIIX, it was too late. The company agreed to wind down its business over the next six or seven years under the supervision of the state Department of Banking and Insurance. Now, MIIX plans to set up a new company based on the old privately held, doctor-financed model.
"We believe the formation of a new company supports the interests of New Jersey physicians by maintaining market stability," said Ms. Costante.
To make it work, the new company needs to raise $30 million in loans from doctors and commercial banks if it is to meet its goal of getting up and running by Aug. 1. But many doctors are dubious, given the demise of the original company.
" 'Good luck' is all I can say," said Dr. Silverberg, who is leading a drive to self-insure the state's obstetricians, a specialty that has been particularly hard hit by the rate increases because of the liability risk in delivering babies. "I think a lot of the doctors put a lot of money into MIIX, and because of what has happened just in the last three years, I don't think they're going to do that again."
Others -- acknowledging their lack of a very good second choice -- say they will go along.
For instance, Dr. Bernard Saccaro, a Rochelle Park rheumatologist who is chairman of the medical society's liability crisis task force, said he and his partners had already decided to lend money to the new company.
After all, Dr. Saccaro reasoned, it was one way to guarantee coverage.
"We were happy with them for many years," he said. "It was a really nice company to work with."
Rather than point to MIIX's ill-timed expansion, Dr. Saccaro said the company should be judged more on its previous 20-year record.
"They really got their heads handed to them," he said. "But we have assurances that will not happen again."

Costs Can't Be Passed Along
His optimism is not entirely misplaced. After all, doctors say the situation is not as dire as it was in 1977, when a similar sharp increase in claims and malpractice awards drove private insurers out of the market, pushing up rates and leaving many of them without coverage.
However, these days doctors they are not as able to pass along the rising cost of insurance.
"The difference is that because of the H.M.O.'s and cuts in Medicare, we cannot pass the increases along to consumers," said Dr. Saccaro.
For many doctors, if passing along the added costs is not an option, relocating to another state may well be.
Dr. George Ajjan, president of the Womens' Healthcare Group, in Teaneck, who is director of obstetrics and gynecology at Holy Name Hospital, said premiums for his practice would more than double next month, to $440,000 from $200,000.
So far, Dr. Ajjan said, he had let six office workers go this spring. Still, he said he did not expect sympathy from the public.
"People don't care about doctors or their salaries," he said. "The issue is, we can't stay open. It's going to restrict access to care. It's going to change the way OB is delivered to the population, and they're not going to like it."
Indeed, in Tenafly, Dr. Vladimir Klinsky's six-person obstetrics and gynecology practice broke up earlier this year because of soaring insurance rates. Dr. Klinsky said he had several claims against him and had so far been unable to get new insurance -- at any price -- to replace his current insurer, Zurich Insurance, which plans to pull out of New Jersey later this year.
To keep a lid on costs -- particularly in the field of obstetrics and gynecology -- Dr. Klinsky said that many practices would insure only one doctor for obstetrics, and that person would handle all the deliveries while the others in the practice would monitor the pregnancy.

Making Up for Fewer Doctors
"People will be working harder and probably making more mistakes," said Dr. Klinsky, who now delivers about 100 babies a year. "The patients will not be able to choose. They will see one doctor, then be delivered by someone they don't know."
In other instances, he said, practices might begin to rely more on midwives, though a midwife still needs to be backed up by an insured doctor.
"Two of my claims are from backing up midwives," Dr. Klinsky said. "I won both of the cases, but that doesn't matter. I can't get any insurer to talk to me."
Whether the new MIIX will be able to fill the void is now up to potential lenders and state regulators, who will have to approve the company's business plan.
Of its initial $30 million investment, the new company expects to write premiums for 2,400 doctors. It will pay a fee to the managers of the old MIIX to run the new company as well as other fees to the new one -- MIIX Advantage -- for use of the company name. In addition, it hopes to gain renewal rights to MIIX's customers when their current insurance lapses.
Doctors will be asked to make loans based on the risk associated with their specialty, ranging from $5,000 up to $25,000 for obstetricians and neurosurgeons. The loan requirement is the same for all doctors within a specialty regardless of past claims against them.
Based on market research, said Ms. Costante, MIIX's chief executive, 40 percent of the state's doctors would join MIIX Advantage.
"It's a very difficult market right now for New Jersey physicians," she said. "It's a market where not many companies are eager to write a lot of premiums."
Before anything happens, however, the plan must be approved by the state Department of Banking and Insurance. And even if approved, the plan will cover only about half of the doctors who had been insured by the old MIIX by virtue of its smaller size, leaving another 4,500 without coverage, said Elizabeth Ryan, general counsel to the 106-member New Jersey Hospital Association.
"Obviously there has been an abundance of concern expressed by providers about availability and affordability," said Peter Hartt, a spokesman for the state Department of Banking Insurance. "As a general proposition, we certainly think that the more healthy players there are in the market, the more those concerns are addressed."
Mr. Hartt said there currently were 15 companies authorized to write medical liability insurance in the state, including a unit of Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company of Warren Buffett, which came into the market in May.
The second-largest medical malpractice insurer in New Jersey, with 36 percent of the market, is the Princeton Insurance Company, which has stepped up its business. Several other companies are also pushing in, and in some cases, doctors are considering self-insurance plans.
But there are other dangers lurking. Joseph Roethel, an assistant vice president at A. M. Best, a company that rates insurance companies, warned that established firms could cherry-pick doctors with the least risk, leaving a newly created MIIX with a greater share of high-risk doctors, further complicating its ability to manage successfully. 
But Ms. Costante said MIIX officials did a review of renewals last fall, leading them to believe that doctors from across the claims spectrum would agree to underwrite the new company, not just those with no other options.
Still, Ms. Ryan disagrees.
"MIIX's plan is ambitious, and it will still leave a lot of doctors uninsured,' she said. "We will have whole groups of doctors unable to practice in the state of New Jersey."
That is hardly surprising. According to a recent survey by the association, Ms. Ryan said, hospital malpractice insurance, which covers hospital staff, increased 152 percent from 1999 to 2002, for an average of $942,000 a year.
As for the new company, shareholders asked Ms. Costante in a recent conference call whether it should be run by former MIIX management. Some doctors said they were concerned about the role that members of the Medical Society played on the MIIX board.
"They're part and parcel of the same thing," said Dr. Klinsky of Tenafly. 'It's really pathetic."
Dr. Silverberg of Chatham, who signed with MIIX as his first medical liability insurer in 1986, echoed that sentiment.
"I felt that any company endorsed by the medical society was a company I wanted to be with," he said. "I've almost felt betrayed when the company was sold to the public because even though there were still doctors on the board, its mission changed."
But Dr. Rigolosi, the new president of the medical society, defended having society members on the MIIX board, saying they had their hands tied by securities regulations.
"I don't think they could have said to us things that were happening," he said. "More importantly, MIIX had served us well. Up until December or January nobody was complaining. The problem lies with the system all the malpractice insurers were having problems. It wasn't limited only to New Jersey."
Indeed, about 60 percent of all medical liability insurance in the United States is written by doctor-controlled companies, said Mr. Smarr, of insurers association.
Nonetheless, at the medical society's annual meeting last month, a resolution was passed forbidding members of the MIIX board from being trustees of the Medical Society of New Jersey.
For now, while much time and energy is going into the formation of a new company, finger-pointing for the demise of the old one is still the focus of many who are trying to sort out what happened to avoid a similar fate in the future.
Mr. Roethel said MIIX's problems began with the timing of its rapid expansion into other states.
Led by the company's former chief executive, Daniel Goldberg, MIIX entered Pennsylvania in 1991 and Delaware in 1996, eventually writing policies in 25 states.
Mr. Goldberg then took the company public in 1999, though he was dismissed in November of that year after the police found marijuana plants growing in the attic of his house in Bucks County, Pa. He subsequently pleaded guilty to the drug charges. Since then, two other chief executive officers resigned, including one who served for a little more than a month last fall, before he was replaced by Ms. Costante.
"In 1999, the new management team quickly recognized there was a problem and began to look carefully at re-underwriting and re-pricing," Ms. Costante said. "We believed going into 2002 that we had successfully completed that initiative. But at the same time we were starting to feel good about the business. We began to see a tremendous amount of claims activity from 1996, 1997 and 1998."
Rather than patch up one bad situation after another, Mr. Smarr said that federal and state legislators needed to address the root causes of the recurring malpractice insurance cycle.

Measure Is Aimed at Easing Crisis
In April, a bipartisan group introduced federal legislation in the House aimed at easing the current crisis modeled largely on a measure that took effect in California 26 years ago.
The proposed legislation includes standard statutes of limitation, limits on lawyers' contingency fees, limits on punitive damages, periodic payments for future medical expenses, and a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages in states that do not already have one.
Currently, 21 states have a cap on noneconomic damages for pain and suffering in medical liability cases. While New York, Pennsylvania and Connecticut do not have caps, New Jersey does. But Bruce Wilson, the director of government relations for the Physician Insurers Association of America, said it was rarely used.
As for the Medical Society of New Jersey, Dr. Rigolosi said his group had come up with a set of legislative priorities, including a cap on noneconomic damages, pretrial panels to screen frivolous suits, limits on the time in which a suit can be brought and a proposal -- already before the State Senate -- that would require expert witnesses in a medical injury trial to live in New Jersey and practice in the same field as the doctor being sued.
"A lot of the expert witnesses are doctors from out of state, Texas in particular, who are solely out for the money as professional expert witnesses," said Dr. Rigolosi. "If a doctor is a member of the community, I think it would important to their reputation."
While the legislation makes it way through the system and doctors scramble to cover their assets, others make their way as best they can.
Dr. Osmundo Saguil of Cherry Hill decided to stop delivering babies after his insurance premium increased to $83,000 from $33,000.
"It's a sad time for me," said the 66-year-old doctor. "I wasn't planning to give up OB. I thought it would be another two years. I still like what I'm doing, but not with this premium."
He put it like this: "I've delivered babies of babies that I delivered. I'm at that level now. I'm going to miss those. But I'm done. I'm closing shop."

HEADLINE: SENIORITY; 
In Search ofa Bridge to Medicare

BYLINE:  By FRED BROCK; Fred Brock is an editor at The Times. His column on the approach and arrival of retirement appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: fbrock@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
LAST year, I wrote about people who want to retire before they turn 65 -- meaning that they don't yet qualify for Medicare -- but have no retiree health care benefits from their employers.
 A reader wrote to tell me that I had certainly identified a problem but had been a little short in specific solutions, other than paying for private insurance, if you can get it. 
 Well, there still aren't a lot of options. But with a little research, many people can come up with relatively affordable coverage for those years until Medicare kicks in. 
According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit and nonpartisan policy organization in Washington, some 23.4 million Americans are in the 55-to-64 age group. Four million of them, or about one-sixth, are retired. Of those retirees, 56.8 percent have coverage through their former employers, 13.7 percent buy individual polices and 17.2 percent have no health insurance. The remainder fall into other categories -- having coverage under Medicaid, for example. 
Whatever you do, don't try to get by without any insurance. Better to keep working, no matter how much you want out, because one serious health problem could put you on the welfare rolls. Paul Fronstin, an economist and director of the health research program at the institute, says people who go without insurance are "playing Russian roulette with a catastrophic illness."
Less than one-third of companies, mostly big ones, provide health benefits to retirees. In 1993, 46 percent did. A 1985 federal law, often referred to as Cobra, gives workers the right to continue their policies for up to 18 months, but only by paying the full premiums. After that, if you're not 65, you're on your own.
What happens next depends to a large degree on where you live. The states have varying laws that govern access to health insurance. 
Twelve of them -- Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah and Vermont -- have what are known as guaranteed-issue laws. While details may vary, the laws generally mean insurance companies that offer individual polices have to sell you insurance regardless of pre-existing conditions, although there can be waiting periods if you are not switching from current coverage. Generally, the insurers can't raise your individual rates, only the overall rates. Usually, they also can't cancel your policy unless they pull out of the market.
But because the insurers in these states have to take on all comers, regardless of health, the policies can be very expensive. They are especially so in states like New York and New Jersey, which use so-called community rating systems. That means everyone's premiums are the same, regardless of age. In some other states, the young are charged less, the older more.
"The trick is to balance affordability and access," said Robert Meehan, vice president for consumer and commercial markets at Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey. "If anybody can buy, then affordability goes off the chart."
But if you live in one of these 12 states, you can at least get insurance with some legal protection. If you live elsewhere, your rates can be lower, but access might depend on your health and the vagaries or absence of state law. In some cases, you may be forced into state-financed high-risk insurance pools that can carry high premiums.
Some health care advisers suggest looking for a high-deductible major medical policy that can be considerably less expensive. The assumption is that if you are retiring early, you probably have enough savings to take care of minor and routine care. What you really need is protection against a catastrophic illness.
Horizon of New Jersey, for instance, offers such policies, one with an annual deductible of $10,000 a person and $20,000 a family. After that, you would have to pay 50 percent of your bills, until you laid out $5,000. Then the insurance would pay 100 percent. That means you might have to spend up to $15,000 for health care in a given year.
The rate for this plan is only $369.21 a month for a couple with no children. Horizon's H.M.O., with a $30 co-payment for doctor visits, would cost the same couple $829.44 a month. A traditional fee-for-service plan that pays 80 percent of medical bills and has a $500 annual deductible would be $3,313.60 a month.
In fact, if you are in pretty good health, a major medical policy like Horizon's might be better than Cobra coverage for 18 months, which in many cases can run close to $1,000 a month for a couple.
It's important to shop around and to compare the details. A helpful Web site is eHealthInsurance.com. It provides rate quotations and benefits from several companies.
DON'T count on any help soon from Congress, where this is not viewed as an important issue -- at least not yet. The baby boomers could change that.
"Sometimes even a vocal minority can change things," Mr. Fronstin said. "In the case of the boomers, they're such a large group that if they organize they can have an impact on policy like a Medicare buy-in."
He was referring to a failed 1998 proposal by President Bill Clinton to allow uninsured Americans, 55 to 64, to pay to enroll in Medicare.
One glimmer of hope is AARP. It is studying the possibility of offering health insurance to its members, along with other kinds of insurance it already offers, including Medigap, to supplement Medicare coverage.
Roberta Milman, the organization's director of health products, said AARP was very much aware of the issue and its growing importance as the 70 million or so baby boomers begin to retire. "It's one of our top priorities," she said.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION; 
Fallback Schools No More

BYLINE:  By WENDY GINSBERG 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
FOR 17 years, Deborah Stuby has watched thousands of Morris Hills seniors head to New Jersey's 10 state colleges and universities. Yet as one of the school's most experienced guidance counselors, Ms. Stuby has been noticing something new and unnerving: Fewer of her students are getting accepted to state schools, where admittance was once considered a sure thing.
 The numbers tell most of the story. 
 The New Jersey Association of State Colleges and Universities, which does not include Rutgers University, said there were about 41,000 applications for September admission -- the most ever received for the 9,000 total slots at its nine member colleges and universities. Since most students apply to more than one in-state school, the association estimated there were about 20,000 high school seniors vying for those 9,000 slots.
"The requirements were formerly a little more flexible," said Ms. Stuby. "Now they're all looking for a strong SAT, and the student pool is just larger."
The chief reasons for the increasing number of applicants are a growing student population and an increasing number of adults choosing to return to college. Indeed, New Jersey is the only state in the Northeast showing rapid growth. And with the exception of a few Western states, it has one of the fastest-growing student populations in the country. Those increases have made it difficult for the state schools to keep up with demand as enrollment has remained relatively stagnant.
These days, one of the schools in demand is Rowan University, which had 7,000 applications for 1,200 seats this coming fall, up almost 13 percent from the previous year.
"This is the largest ever," said Joe Cardona, a spokesman for Rowan University in Glassboro. "This is a phenomenon that has built on itself over the last few years."
The numbers were even more striking at some of the other universities. At Jersey City University, for instance, applications were up 20 percent, and at William Paterson University they rose 18 percent.
What's more, there is little relief in sight. According to estimates by the State Commission on Higher Education, about 70,500 seniors will graduate from the state's high schools this year, and by 2009 that number is expected to reach 95,000.
Yet because state financing of those colleges and universities is allotted annually in a lump sum rather than on a per-student basis, the schools are limited in what they can do to meet the increased demand.
Mr. Cardona said that while the financing allowed for small rises in enrollment, much of the money was instead used to refurbish existing buildings or add computers and software. "You end up with this balancing act with how many students you can afford versus how many students you have," he said.
At Rutgers -- which with 38,147 undergraduates is by far the largest school in the state -- applications rose by 7 percent this year, and over the past five years, that number increased by 23 percent. Yet enrollment has only grown by half a percent since 1996 at its existing campuses.
"It's just more difficult to get into college right now," said Carol Strowbridge, head of the guidance department at Randolph High School, in Morris County. "We feel bad for the kids about this because there aren't really a whole lot of options for the average or below-average students at the state schools in New Jersey right now."
In recent years, more than 300 students have graduated from Randolph each June, of which about 60 usually applied to Rutgers; this year, Ms. Stuby said, 88 applications were sent out.
While the saturation in New Jersey has in the past forced many students to look to colleges in New York, Pennsylvania or Maryland, the state Commission on Higher Education predicted that out-of-state opportunities might soon diminish as well.
"We've been working for three years to educate the public about the capacity crisis," said Paul Shelly, a spokesman for the New Jersey Association of State Colleges and Universities. "It's been almost two decades since our colleges received any incentive to expand."
This year has been particularly difficult for the state's colleges and universities. Almost immediately after he took office in January, Governor McGreevey -- in an effort to erase a huge budget deficit -- called a special meeting with officials of the state's colleges and universities to tell them he was cutting their public financing by 5 percent.
Last month, many college and university representatives testified before a legislative committee that tuition at some schools could soon rise by as much as 15 percent -- putting the state schools out of reach for many families.
"Parents just aren't willing to go bankrupt to put their children through school," Ms. Stuby said. "If the finances aren't going to work out, if there's no money, you're in trouble."
In the face of this mounting pressure, the state Commission on Higher Education is predicting that full-time student enrollment will increase almost 19 percent by 2010, something for which it has no specific remedy.
"At this point, growth is so extraordinary," said Jeanne Oswald, deputy director of the commission. "The state needs to make some tough decisions."
And it must do so quickly.
"We weren't fully aware of how seriously this was going to affect the administration," she said. "But we knew it was going to come head on in an economic crisis. Demand has really gone through the roof."

HEADLINE: What's Your Opinion? He Knows 

BYLINE:  By MARGO NASH 

 BODY:
PEOPLE often ask Dr. Frank Newport for his opinion, but he isn't talking. 
 "My wife gets mad sometimes because people will say, 'Hey, what do you think about Bush?' and I say, well, 46 percent of Americans think this, and they say, 'No, I want your opinion.' " 
 Dr. Newport, the editor in chief of the Gallup Poll, decides which questions the Gallup Poll will ask, how they will be asked and what the answers mean. 
"I just like to tell people what other people think," he said. "My opinion is really kind of trivial, compared to our ability in a democracy to really understand the opinions of Americans." 
No one has sampled American opinions more often. Dr. Newport's polls have covered three presidential elections, the Persian Gulf War, the O. J. Simpson trial, President Clinton's impeachment and Americans' reactions to the Sept. 11 attacks.
Dr. Newport, 53, the editor of the Gallup Poll Monthly magazine and a weekly e-mail newsletter, has broadcast more than 1,000 segments on CNN from the Gallup Organization's studio at its Princeton offices.
"His stuff is very helpful in covering a story about public opinion," said Michael Jones, a coordinating producer for the CNN Radio Network. "He is kind of refreshing. He talks like a regular Joe. You know how polls can be convoluted? He does a good job breaking down the nuts and bolts."
Dr. Newport, who earned a doctorate in sociology, is relaxed and genial. With just a hint of native Texas drawl, he presents results of CNN/USA Today/Gallup Polls and other Gallup polls 5 to 10 times a week on television and radio broadcast on over 1,900 stations worldwide. 
"Test, 1, 2, 3. I'm Dr. Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Poll," he announced recently during a rehearsal for a radio segment. "There's still a glass ceiling for many women in the workplace. But more women are making it to the upper ranks of management. Would you rather work for a man or for a woman? Well, I'll have the answer of the American public on today's Gallup Poll Report." 
After a minor bobble in the run-through -- "Oops, sorry" -- he delivered a flawless, unscripted report about the poll, including the news that women were more likely than men to say they preferred to work for a man. 
The Gallup Organization has been doing polls for CNN and USA Today since 1992. Three years ago, CNN and Gallup decided to broadcast poll results linked to breaking news from the Princeton studio.
"Too many poll results aren't reported adequately," Dr. Newport said. "You would see: 'A new poll says that 77 percent of people approve of George Bush.' Next news story."
"But you need context for that," he said. "Is the 77 percent approval rating for Bush good or bad? I'm able to say, historically that's excellent, still lower than X, but still much higher than Y."
People seem to appreciate the format, but there will always be someone who wants to shoot the messenger. 
"When we show a poll that is very positive to George W. Bush, the Democrats will write and say, 'Your polling can't be right.' " But during the Clinton impeachment, he said, when Gallup polls, like others, showed that a significant majority of Americans wanted Clinton to be impeached but to stay in office, "we heard from lots of Republicans who said, 'Your polling can't be right. I know dozens of people I talk to every day. All of them want Clinton out of there.' "
That, he said, is the "great virtue" of polling. "We are doing scientific random samples so we can say we don't have to rely on who you happen to know."
Since the Princeton broadcasts began, splashier charts and graphs have been added, and news anchors now ask Dr. Newport questions.
Dr. Newport's career has zigzagged between broadcasting and polling since he majored in broadcasting at Baylor University. After earning advanced degrees in sociology, he taught at the University of Missouri. He also produced segments for the campus radio station and was an analyst for the local NBC television affiliate. 
After working as a radio talk show host in Houston, Dr. Newport joined a Houston marketing and research company. The company merged with what became the Gallup Organization, and in 1990, Dr. Newport moved to Princeton.
The Hopewell Township resident said some of his most devoted viewers and listeners were immigrants. 
"The guy at the Exxon Station is from Ghana, for example. He watches CNN religiously, and the guy I go to at the Chinese restaurant in our town," he said. "I think it's because they are more internationally minded. I don't know if marketing research would bear that out, but it's interesting anecdotally."

An Idea, at Least, Amid the Job Hunting

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton; This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
YOU work your whole life in this city, filling out your taxes and voting, and when you need help, you don't get it."
 Those words belong to Carmen Torres, who spent 22 years working as a clerk on Wall Street before being laid off last fall. She has not been able to find another job, and fears that her unemployment insurance benefits may have just run out. 
 You'll hear the same sad refrain from Milind Shah, a former dot-commer whose benefits will run out in two months. And from Clayre Schneiweis, who until October had been working in New York City for El Al, the Israeli airline. And from Orlando Godoy, Rene Sauve, Sultan A. Salim and James S. Johnson, all of whom worked at Windows on the World, none of whom has been able to find a new job. 
All of them want, quite desperately, to be employed. Failing that, they would like another couple of months of unemployment benefits, which will start running out in two weeks for thousands of New Yorkers. 
And so all of these jobless workers, and hundreds of others, have joined the New York Unemployment Project, a nonprofit group that is trying to persuade state officials to give the jobless 13 more weeks of unemployment benefits, an idea that does not seem to be on Albany's radar right now.
Jonathan Rosen, the director of the project, said that such an extension would cost about $235 million, which he contends could probably be covered by money already in the state unemployment insurance trust fund.
Unemployment insurance typically runs for a maximum of 26 weeks, but in March, President Bush authorized a federally financed 13-week extension. Right now, more than 230,000 New Yorkers from across the state are collecting regular benefits, and almost 137,000 are collecting extended benefits, according to the New York State Department of Labor. 
The whole point of unemployment insurance is to tide over unemployed workers until they can find new jobs. But right now, there are an awful lot of unemployed people, and a lot fewer jobs than just a year ago.
About 263,000 people in New York City are actively looking for work, a 43 percent increase from a year ago, according to the labor department. The unemployment rate in the city has zoomed to 7.7 percent, from 5.5 percent a year ago.
Meanwhile, there are now about 107,000 fewer jobs in the city than a year ago, according to a government survey of employers. The biggest losses have been in business services (Mr. Shah, the computer expert); brokerage firms (Ms. Torres, the Wall Street clerk); air transportation (Ms. Schneiweis, the airline worker), and food service (the Windows on the World crew).
Sitting in the unemployment project's office on the Avenue of the Americas last week, these jobless workers described the frustrations of their fruitless hunts for work. All have been attending job fairs, which entails standing in lines for hours to watch their resumes disappear into huge stacks. At least one is living off credit cards; others are borrowing from family and friends. 
Mr. Sauve, who is 59 and lives in Manhattan, says he has given out 200 resumes, and has even had some phone interviews. "But the minute I show up and they see how old I am. . . ." he said, shrugging. "I tell you, if I didn't have a rent-controlled apartment, I'd be homeless."
Ms. Schneiweis, who is 49 and lives in Queens, is getting by on her unemployment and the money she got from selling her two-year-old Honda. "I'm willing to start at entry level, but they won't take you," she said.
Things aren't much better for younger workers like Mr. Shah, 27, who says that he has given out resumes and canvassed his friends and connections to try to find a job. "But most of my connections are unemployed, too," he said, adding that his wife still has a job, "so I won't be out on the street, but it's very scary."
Tell that to Mr. Salim, 36, whose family includes his 2-year-old daughter and elderly father. When his benefits run out in about a month, he said, "I have no idea what I'm going to do." 
Mr. Johnson, 43, is taking computer classes, but still longs for his old "sweet job" as a bartender at Windows. He still has a card in his wallet from the restaurant, where at least 70 workers died. And while he's sad and angry that he and so many of his co-workers are still unemployed, he reminds the others that "some of them are not here to complain."

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS; 
Hilary Glazer, Craig Bromberg

 BODY:
Hilary Haika Glazer and Craig Bromberg are to be married today in New York. Rabbi Elliot K. Ginsburg will conduct the ceremony.
 The bride, 37, is the executive producer for an online professional continuing-education division of Scholastic Inc., the publisher, in New York. She graduated from Clark University. She is the daughter of Roseline Glazer and Dr. William Glazer of Menemsha, Mass., on Martha's Vineyard. 
 Her father is the president of Glazer Medical Solutions, a psychiatric education consulting company based in Menemsha, and an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Her mother is a freelance writer. 
The bridegroom, 44, is an editorial consultant in New York who edits DigitAll, a quarterly magazine about digital culture created for Samsung, the Korean electronics company. He was the founding editorial director of Pathfinder, the former Time Warner online venture. He graduated with honors from Oberlin College and received a master's degree in the history of political thought from the London School of Economics and Political Science. 
He is a son of Penny Bromberg and Dr. Marvin Bromberg of New York. His mother is a patient representative at North Shore University Hospital in Manhassett, N.Y. His father, a dentist, has a private practice in New York.
Mr. Bromberg first saw Ms. Glazer in September 1999 as she was singing in the choir during Rosh Hashana services at Congregation B'nai Jeshurun.
"I noted a pretty woman with long straight hair singing alto," Mr. Bromberg remembered, "but I was too shy to ask who she was."
When he saw her sing again at Rosh Hashana services the following year, Mr. Bromberg asked a friend if she knew the singer. When the friend said she did, Mr. Bromberg asked the friend to find out if she was single, and if so, to ask if he could meet her. 
Weeks went by with no reply. Mr. Bromberg assumed Ms. Glazer was not interested in him. He wasn't far off, but it wasn't personal.
Ms. Glazer explained: "I had been on a million blind dates, and friends had always tried to fix me up. So I had given up on that part of my life, figuring romance would happen when it would happen."
Then, in November 2000, Mr. Bromberg came across Ms. Glazer's picture and profile on Match.com, an online dating service, and sent her an e-mail message through the Web site. 
"I had canceled my subscription in March, and was shocked when I got the e-mail from the company," she recalled. 
Ms. Glazer was taken with its contents. "His e-mail was incredibly vulnerable and direct," she said. "In this crazy dating scene, where everyone hides from one another, he took a chance." She added, "It was just so magical."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UPPER EAST SIDE; 
Seeking Je Ne Sais Quoi Along Madison Avenue

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ 

 BODY:
On a typical summer evening, illegal tables and chairs spill from a smattering of small restaurants onto the sidewalks of Madison Avenue.
 In 1980, the city banned sidewalk cafes along Madison Avenue and in nearly four dozen other areas in the borough, along with four areas in Brooklyn and four in Queens, to accommodate pedestrian traffic. But in recent months, restaurateurs, hit by the sagging economy and decreasing tourism, have sought to overturn the 1980 prohibitions and make it easier to apply for a license to operate a sidewalk cafe, which can take more than a year. 
 "If you're allowed to have a restaurant, why can't you have a sidewalk cafe?" said Steve Wygoda, an architect who, on behalf of restaurateurs, has asked the mayor to review the city's policy. 
Restaurant owners also complain that haphazard enforcement has given lawbreakers an unfair advantage. 
"When one person doesn't do it, he is put at a disadvantage, businesswise, because sidewalk cafes attract people into a restaurant," said Kevin B. McGrath, a lawyer representing a growing number of East Side restaurants seeking a change in the sidewalk cafe rules.
An owner may be fined $100 per day; repeat offenders may have outdoor furniture seized. But given the extra revenue additional tables can bring, some owners consider penalties part of the cost of doing business.
Cafe Nosidam, a restaurant at Madison Avenue and 66th Street whose sidewalk tables have been mentioned in the Zagat survey, has been penalized 10 times since 1994. 
"It is a matter of survival," said Dean Racanelli, a co-owner. "I would not be able to pay the rent if I didn't have them."
In 2000, New York's 21,670 food service operations produced revenues of $9.5 billion. Restaurateurs argue that the city could use a fresh infusion of cash. The cost of a license for a typical cafe -- there are only 500 in the city -- would bring the city about $2,000 a a year.
Finally, there is the question of style. Paolo Della Puppa, an owner of Via Quadronno, an Italian restaurant at East 73rd Street and Madison Avenue, said,, "This is the part of New York City that should look like Paris." ERIKA KINETZ

Handshakes All Around or Business Leaders

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL 

 BODY:
When the century-old Bronx Chamber of Commerce gradually lost membership and died a slow death in the 1990's, the borough also became the only one without a private umbrella organization representing its business community. The Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation picked up some of the slack, as did organizations like the South Bronx Board of Trade and the Hunts Point Chamber of Commerce. But the lack of a chamber of commerce was troubling. 
 "You're talking about a borough of well over a million people," said Fred Siegel, a history professor at Cooper Union who studies city issues. "The Bronx is largely bereft of a significant private-sector economy, that's what it says." 
 Now, business leaders, politicians and others, including many who don't agree with Mr. Siegel's grim assessment of the local business picture, are creating what is tentatively being called the New Bronx Chamber of Commerce. At the forefront is Elias Karmon, 92, who opened his first Bronx business, Hollywood Clothes, in 1940. Mr. Karmon, president of the old chamber from 1978 to 1981, holds no title and promised to step aside once the organization gets off the ground.
"We'll run a chamber like a chamber should be run," he said, recalling how the old organization helped defeat an increase in the sales tax proposed by Mayor Robert F. Wagner in the 1950's.
John Collazzi, co-publisher of The Bronx Times-Reporter, is also involved. 
"A couple of organizations are doing good work," he said. "But the Bronx has some issues that need to be addressed as a borough." High on his list is a hotel to keep some of the borough's six million tourists a year around for longer than a trip to the zoo.
The group, which has been officially incorporated, held a breakfast meeting at Monroe College in the Fordham section on May 22 that attracted about 75 people, including the borough's president, Adolfo Carrion. A smaller group will meet this week to work on bylaws.
But the chamber has critics, like Andrew Wolf, publisher of The Bronx Press-Review. Mr. Wolf is concerned about the participation of organizations and businesspeople he says are politically connected. "A chamber of commerce has to bubble from the business community up," he said, "not from the politicians down." SETH KUGEL

Ailing Mom-and-Pop Enterprises Get Big Brothers

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
Tomato sauce pours as slowly as molasses for Pasquale Di Tillio and his pizza parlor at 8 Cortlandt Street, a skip from ground zero. 
 "I'm down to 50 pies a day," said Mr. 
Di Tillio, who assigns partial blame on new building security that could turn a pizza cold. "Before it was over 100." 
 Then a customer phoned with an unusual order. Len Adams, who owns a recruiting firm with four employees on lower Broadway, announced that he would begin holding weekly pizza parties in his office to help the parlor out.
"It's small, but it's something," Mr. Adams said. 
Such acts of kindness, small and large, have multiplied under a new matchmaking program, Adopt-a-Company, that pairs struggling mom-and-pops in New York City with civic-minded businesses. 
Since the city's Economic Development Corporation announced the program in April, more than 350 shops have been adopted.
Most of the matchmaking is being done through a Web site, www.adopt-a-company.org. 
Few strings are attached: the adoptee must have fewer than 50 employees, and be adversely affected by Sept. 11. The sponsor can donate whatever is deemed helpful. 
Most pairings seem natural. Logistics Solutions, a high-tech consulting firm, is offering referrals to Transition Networks, a Web design startup at 11 Broadway.
Some adoptions appear odd, as in the case of Proskauer Rose, a large law firm, which is furnishing legal help to a family business on Warren Street called the Fountain Pen Hospital.
But these pairs may have closer interests than at first appear.
"I have an antique fountain pen that I inherited and use for special signings," said Steven Krane, a Proskauer partner who regularly brings his instrument to the store. "You want your pen to glide across the paper." DENNY LEE

O Ye of Much Faith! A Triple Dose of Trouble

BYLINE:  By LAURIE GOODSTEIN 

 BODY:
THE past eight months have not been easy for believers. Roman Catholics learned that some of the princes of their church protected priests who sexually abused children. Muslims have seen their scholars condemned and their scriptures deconstructed for signs that Islam encourages terrorism. Jews in Europe have suffered a wave of anti-Semitic attacks as world opinion hardened toward Israel. 
 This is a rare moment in history, like a planetary alignment: three world religions simultaneously racked by crisis. 
 The nature of the trouble for each is different, but adherents of all three feel suddenly embattled and isolated. Atheists say "I told you so" and even some people of faith are asking whether there isn't something in the nature of religion itself that ends in corruption. 
"This is so unusual as to defy any cyclical theory," said Alan Wolfe, director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. "Historians always say that everything goes through cycles, and that nothing is new. I'm saying, this one is new."
Distinctive elements of all three religions have become a focus of criticism and a cause for humiliation, shame or defensiveness. 
Revelations that Catholic cardinals, archbishops and bishops helped hide the abuses of pedophile priests and even moved them into new parishes have put a harsh spotlight on the faith's hierarchy and its celibate male priesthood -- the very attributes that distinguish Catholicism from other Christian denominations.
For Muslims, the crisis is one of doctrine. The 19 Muslims who crashed airplanes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and rural Pennsylvania on Sept. 11 set off the ideological equivalent of a house-to-house search for militants in Islamic schools, mosques and media. The Koran, which Muslims believe is the word of God as dictated to the Prophet Muhammad, is being picked apart for evidence that its passages advocate violence and intolerance. Some Muslim scholars and centers of learning are now under scrutiny for incubating militants. Leaders and scholars of other religions are asking why Islam never went through a modernizing Reformation that would lend it the tolerance that Christianity has embraced.
For Jews, the anguish is over a central part of their identity: their state and homeland of Israel. They have been battered by international condemnation and self-doubt to a degree not seen since the period following the massacres by Israeli-backed Lebanese militias in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps 20 years ago. Their crisis is not one of faith or doctrine, but of the viability of Israel -- and this for a people who since the sixth century B.C. have been reciting the psalm, "If I forget thee O Jerusalem, let my right hand wither."
THE triple shock may be hitting even harder because religion had been on a high. Ecumenism was in the air. In the last presidential election, both the Democratic and Republican candidates flaunted their reliance on Jesus. The country nearly elected Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, an observant Jew, as vice president. And the nation seemed to be relishing its religious diversity, with Hindu temples rising in the suburbs, Ramadan celebrated in schools and the Dalai Lama on best-seller lists. 
"A lot of people thought that the religions of the world, in the era of the United Nations, would begin to find measures of accord," said Martin E. Marty, a religious historian and emeritus professor at the University of Chicago. "Vatican II was a great document of affirmation of other religions, as was the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago. People in liberal pluralistic cultures thought this is a contagion that will spread, and will go with globalization." 
Interfaith events still occur, but now the focus is on religion as a conflictual force. A typical event, "Beyond Violence: An Interfaith Dialogue," was announced for next month at the Kirkridge Retreat and Study Center in Bangor, Pa.
"Sometimes we feel as Muslims that some people were looking for an opportunity to attack Islam, and they got one, and they are using it to the best," said Naeem Baig, secretary general of the Islamic Circle of North America. The critics ignored the historical context, said Mr. Baig, that Muhammad was not only a spiritual leader but the military leader of a nation often under attack. "Jesus, peace be upon him, never ruled a country," he said. 
Every year some Catholic bishops meet with Muslim leaders for an interfaith exchange. At this year's gathering, at the Brooklyn archdiocese in April, the Muslims commiserated with their Catholic counterparts, said Mr. Baig.
"We told them, now the whole press is attacking Catholicism. Right now you look at any priest, and the first thing that comes to mind is, is something wrong with him or not. And as Muslims, we feel the same way," Mr. Baig said. "People are staring at me and they are thinking I am some terrorist. We told them, we understand what you are going through."
And the Jews, who despite an identity forged as a persecuted people, have been stunned at the depth of animosity directed at them as Israel struck back militarily at the Palestinians. 
"At first when it was only political, most Jews were able to essentially ignore it as yet another chapter in the conflict between the Arabs and the Israelis," said Yosef I. Abramowitz, a writer and founder of Jewish Family & Life, a multimedia network based in Newton, Mass. "Then when the anti-Semitism began spreading like wildfire, every Jew begins to take the conflict personally. So there's been a wake-up call." 
In addition to attacks from outside, Jews are themselves at odds, with some condemning those who suggest that the Palestinians may have legitimate concerns or that Israel may be, in any way, in the wrong. 
This confluence of crises is "highly unusual" but not without precedent, said Karen Armstrong, a scholar of Catholicism, Judaism and Islam, and author of "A History of God." But she had to reach a long way back -- from 800 to 200 B.C., a period of tremendous violence and upheaval on many continents, including China, India and the Middle East.
 IN the midst of that ancient upheaval, she said, great spiritual thinkers forged the basic ideologies of most major religious traditions, from Confucianism and Taoism in China to Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism in India, to monotheism in the Middle East. The German philosopher Karl Jespers named that era the Axial Age because it was the axis of religious development. 
"Those times were extremely violent and disturbed, and this made people question everything from scratch," Ms. Armstrong said.
"We've been undergoing our own sort of axial age, economically and technologically," she said. "But we've not begun to meet this challenge in religious terms. We could use this suffering to create wonderful new religious systems, as the Buddha did, or we could retreat into the spiritual barbarism of hatred."
As Professor Marty pointed out, the average person relates to religion not as a source of strife, but as a quiet, healing force, personified by the pastor who reconciles a divorcing couple, or the chaplain who delivers last rites to the dying. 
"We're seeing now that religion is not an innocent force in the world," he said, "but it shares the same problems as the rest of the world.

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY; 
Ubiquitous Ads Devalue All Messages

BYLINE:  By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AT a gas station the other day, I saw an advertisement attached at eye level near the fuel hose. I have also seen ads on shopping carts and heard commercials on the phone when a business puts me on hold. And I begin each day at my computer beneath an avalanche of e-mail sales pitches for laser printer cartridges, low-interest mortgages and cut-rate Viagra.
 As I'm deleting all this junk, I sometimes think of William Forster Lloyd, the English economist who, in the 1830's, described the problem of the commons. "Why are the cattle on a common so puny and stunted?" Lloyd asked. "Why is the common itself so bare-worn, and cropped so differently from the adjoining enclosures?" 
 His answer was that it was in the interest of everyone using the common pasture to exploit it maximally. Each herdsman could benefit by adding another cow, but when all the herdsmen acted this way, as they inevitably would, the benefit of the commons was lost to everyone. 
Modern-day business fails to recognize the level of abuse to which it is subjecting the commons of consumer consciousness. For example, the average child sees more than 20,000 commercials a year, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
Total advertising spending in this country is about $100 billion a year, or something approaching $400 for every man, woman and child. May I suggest that diminishing returns are starting to set in here? Besides, the commercial media culture supported by this spending is itself probably undermining the spending power of consumers. Leon Botstein, president of Bard College and the author of "Jefferson's Children: Education and the Promise of American Culture" (Doubleday, 1997), wrote in the journal Daedalus about the effect of television on education. He asserted that "the simplification and standardization of language" restricts people's range of expression and even thought. In other words, the commercially inspired fare that now prevails certainly isn't making people smarter. In its absence, productivity, and thus purchasing power, would probably increase. 
In the face of these trends, signs of advertiser desperation abound. Television executives worry about new technologies that allow people to skip commercials, and the Internet is littered with increasingly frantic pop-ups and other sales pitches. 
As the costs go down, the number of pitches multiplies -- something that Lloyd might have predicted. Every morning, from all over the globe, the e-mail comes pouring in. Never before have cut-rate ink-jet cartridges been so readily available to me, to say nothing of golden investment opportunities, luxury travel and products to enhance the libido. I get a good volume of legitimate e-mail, yet some days the spam (unsolicited commercial speech, if you're squeamish) outweighs it by 10 to 1.
Perhaps the most serious sign of desperation is the reincarnation of advertising's "hidden persuaders," this time as a pack of executives and consultants who specialize in Jungian analysis, semiotics and other such recondite arts. These concepts are applied to such questions as how to more effectively sell breakfast cereal and soft drinks.
Naturally enough, marketers have burst the bounds of traditional advertising in favor of product placements in movies and the like. Bulgari even paid the writer Fay Weldon to write a novel featuring the company. Even if the boundaries of acceptable advertising expand, the commons of consumer consciousness will not. The more consumers are battered by this ceaseless marketing assault, the less value each advertising dollar will have. 
One proven approach to better stewardship of the commons is to place a cap on use and to allow users to buy and sell their allocations. This is hard to do, of course, so something like more traditional regulation might make sense. In New York State, the no-calls registry, for those wanting to avoid telemarketers, is a good model. And at the minimum, business should mobilize all the lobbyists at its command for a federal ban on junk e-mail like the one that suppressed junk faxes years ago.
But the larger issue may have to resolve itself. Increasingly, the most desirable consumers will opt out by ignoring commercial radio and television and hiding behind technologies that exempt them from the onslaught, until advertisers are left with something like Lloyd's barren commons all over again, applied to consumer consciousness: scrawny companies feeding off overgrazed pasture. It's not a pretty picture for anyone.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Neil J. Hennessy; 
Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
NEIL J. HENNESSY, who runs the $310 million Hennessy Cornerstone Growth fund, relies on a computer model that, he says, gives his shareholders the consistency they crave.
 "Three years ago, the baby boomers were getting high returns on the money in their 401(k) plans," Mr. Hennessy said from his office in Novato, Calif. The bursting of the dot-com bubble shocked many investors, he said, adding, "Now, they want money managers to use a more formula-based investing strategy." 
 To pick the fund's 50 stocks, Mr. Hennessy uses a formula and doesn't veer from it. The fund's quantitative approach, outlined in the fund's prospectus, cannot be changed without shareholder approval.
The fund returned 22.8 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with 5.2 percent for its group of funds that buy small growth stocks, and a 5.3 percent loss for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc. The fund gained 16.7 percent in the last 12 months, versus losses of 10.8 percent for its group and 13.5 percent for the S.& P. 500.
Mr. Hennessy, 46, is president of Hennessy Advisors, which acquired the fund's predecessor, O'Shaughnessy Cornerstone Growth, in June 2000. Hennessy Advisors manages an additional $50 million in three other mutual funds. 
His computer model screens 9,700 United States companies with market capitalizations of more than $172 million. But small companies tend to meet the model's criteria more closely; the average market cap of the fund's companies is $950 million.
The model identifies companies with price-to-sales multiples below 1.5. "I'm not going to pay more than $1.50 for $1 of sales," Mr. Hennessy said. "Our discipline helps us avoid situations like the dot-com blowup."
Over all, the price-to-sales ratio of the portfolio companies was 0.829 when the stocks were bought, compared with 1.64 for the benchmark Russell 2000 index.
He uses the price-to-sales multiple instead of price to earnings, he said, because earnings are more subject to manipulation. "You can fool around with earnings all day long," he said, "but sales are a true number that gives an accurate picture of a company's growth."
The computer model also favors companies with per-share earnings growth during the previous 12 months. The final screen looks for increasing stock prices over the last 3, 6 and 12 months.
Mr. Hennessy reruns the computer screens once a year, sometime between October and February, replacing the laggard stocks with others that meet his criteria. He plans to keep shares until at least the next rebalancing, barring unusually high redemptions by investors or problems like misstated financial results by a company.
He says he never visits companies, talks to companies' management or reads Wall Street analysts' research. But he spends considerable time, he said, talking to shareholders by phone, discussing the reasons behind the fund's investment strategy.
In January, Mr. Hennessy added to the fund's holdings of the Tractor Supply Company, based in Nashville. Over all, he has paid an average of $42.13 a share; the stock now trades at $55.88. 
The chain sells farm-related products as well as light truck equipment, work clothing and other merchandise. When he bought the shares in January, Tractor Supply's price-to-sales ratio was 0.38.
ALSO in January, Mr. Hennessy added to his holdings of Lands' End, the direct marketer of traditionally styled casual clothing and luggage. At the time, the company s price-to-sales ratio was 0.93.
He has paid $49.87 a share, on average, for the position; the stock closed on Friday at $61.93. Lands' End is being acquired by Sears, Roebuck in a deal that is expected to close in the middle of this month.
He bought shares of NVR Inc., based in McLean, Va., in January 2001. NVR builds single-family homes as well as town houses and condominiums and offers mortgage-related services to its customers. He paid $213.73, on average, for the shares; they now trade at $331. The company's price-to-sales multiple in January was 0.59.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Film Noir Lite; 
When Actions Have No Consequences

BYLINE:  By ROBERT SKLAR; Robert Sklar, a professor of cinema studies at New York University, is the author of "Movie-Made America : A Cultural History of American Movies."

 BODY:
AN S.U.V. sits at a deserted intersection as the traffic light turns red to green to red. Outside, a squat building with a neon sign: Police. Inside the car, a calculating couple -- a wife and a husband planning to escape a murder charge.
 This is the final scene of the new film "Unfaithful." In traditional film noir thrillers, shared knowledge of criminal acts might initially draw a couple together but ultimately, inevitably, drives them apart. Relationships cannot survive, the movies said, where there can be no trust. Yet, in Adrian Lyne's film, the violent acts only serve to rekindle a marriage's intimacy. 
 "We can disappear," the wife says. "Raise the money. Sell everything. Leave the country." She pictures a Mexican beachfront hideaway: "People do it all the time." Living in comfort on a Westchester County estate, this is certainly a couple with the means to turn escape fantasies into reality. But even more comfortable is the wife's assumption that running away from murder and personal crisis is a no-cost proposition, other than in money. Guilt, responsibility, retribution, society's judgment -- these concepts seem like quaint notions from olden days. They hardly come to mind.
With "Fatal Attraction" in 1987 -- another film about adultery, murder and the survival of a marriage -- Mr. Lyne gained a reputation as a filmmaker with a feel for America's zeitgeist. Though "Unfaithful" is based on Claude Chabrol's New Wave classic "La Femme Infidele," Mr. Lyne offers a fresh take, attuned to contemporary mores. For the most significant change lies in how things turn out. In Mr. Chabrol's film, murder may have strengthened the marital bond, but the husband is firmly in the grip of the authorities. Even in the permissive 60's, murderers had to pay.
Getting away with murder represents a key divergence from the French source, and, in turn, from the film noir works that were Mr. Chabrol's inspiration. But an even greater divergence stems from the psychological characterization of the couple.
Diane Lane plays a suburban housewife, more bored than she realizes, who falls into an affair with a French hunk who sells antiquarian books from a Soho loft. Richard Gere as her husband, a businessman who applies family values at his firm, tracks down his wife's lover and, in a fit of delirium . . . Then he wraps the lover's body in a rug and dumps it in a landfill.
What's remarkable is the tenuous link between conduct and its consequences. There's no clear sense that he'll ever pay a price for his violent act, even if they never end up as bronzed beachcombers. But what about in their private heart of hearts? She's been lewdly cavorting south of Houston Street and brazenly lying about it. He's displayed not only a murderous impulse but also a clear-headed capacity to cover up his crime. Since when was the revelation of deviousness the basis for rebuilding trust?
In film noir, treachery brought couples together in mutual desperation while also cleaving their partnership with the wedge of mistrust. In Billy Wilder's "Double Indemnity," lovers played by Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray ultimately turn their murderous passion on each other. In "Out of the Past," Jacques Tourneur's 1947 film starring Jane Greer and Robert Mitchum, betrayal builds on betrayal until their obsession ends in yet another double demise.
Perhaps such moralistic endings were forced on filmmakers by the rules of the Production Code then in effect. But the emotions engendered had little to do with moral rules. These movie characters were playing out the larger struggles of the era. Film noir had its roots in the despair of the Great Depression, the anguish of World War II, the anxiety of the postwar nuclear era and the confrontation with Communism. Betrayal and mistrust dominated the headlines and shaped the fictional stories that transformed public concerns into popular entertainment.
No aspect of film noir's social meaning has been more examined than its view of women. The genre's men, however complicit in transgression, were victims. Women were the villains. They lured and deceived men, turning them into criminals and outcasts. Stanwyck's character in "Double Indemnity" and Greer's in "Out of the Past" were more than duplicitous: they became, to those they ensnared, irredeemably evil. They deserved to die.
When Rita Hayworth sang "Put the Blame on Mame" in the 1946 film "Gilda," peeling off her long black gloves, the message was literal. Film noir's femmes fatales endangered men through their willfulness and freedom. Film noir in this sense conveyed postwar American culture's injunction to women to give up the independence gained during wartime and return to domestic life and economic reliance on men.
Mr. Lyne's direct link to this portrayal of women is Glenn Close's character in "Fatal Attraction," the femme fatale (and independent professional woman) transformed into devouring monster. If "Unfaithful" holds clues to the contemporary zeitgeist, what's striking in this framework is that Ms. Lane's housewife, despite her transgression and deceptions, is neither caricatured nor condemned. While her husband is clearly hurt when he learns of her betrayal, the film's emphasis lies on the potential damage she might cause to her own life by straying. In fact she has cut off the affair -- with a voice mail message -- before her husband arrives at the lover's doorstep.
It's the lover who suffers the most grievous harm. But, as a conspicuous womanizer, he comes as close to villainy as the film ventures, and there's a sense he has only himself to blame. Even more than in last year's "In the Bedroom," where a distraught father takes vengeance on a killer the legal system fails to punish, in "Unfaithful" getting away with murder produces surprisingly salutary effects.
Film noir may have gone too far in its condemnation of women and in its downbeat warnings against stepping outside society's conventional bounds. But "Unfaithful" offers almost the opposite message.
If the film doesn't quite arrive at an old-fashioned Hollywood happy ending, it permits its only lightly troubled couple to grow closer together through transgression and violence, with no clear price to pay.

HEADLINE: A Collision On Risks Of Energy Trading 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
JONES MURPHY might not have noticed what his colleagues at the Williams Companies were doing if they had not been gloating.
 Mr. Murphy, previously a Wall Street executive, had recently been hired as the director of emerging products at Williams's headquarters in Tulsa, Okla., to help manage its trading risks. He was on the company's trading floor when he heard a commotion at the desk of Blake Herndon, director of risk management. 
 "I went over to ask what was going on," Mr. Murphy recalled of that day in December 2000. "Blake laughed and said they were going to corner the market for natural gas and run it up for December closing, which means delivery in January." 
Williams is the second-largest owner of natural gas pipelines in the country, and Mr. Murphy, who is no longer with the company, says he thinks that an examination of trading records would show that the company succeeded in driving up natural gas prices in California.
Executives at Williams dismissed the allegation as impossible. Mr. Herndon said: "It is comical to think that anyone could corner the gas market in California. I think this shows the lack of understanding of how these markets work. These are just not cornerable markets."
In any case, prices spiked in December, when the state's gas-fired power plants were running full-tilt, records of the California Public Utilities Commission show. Mr. Murphy said he was told by Mr. Herndon that Williams probably made "hundreds of millions of dollars" from its strategy. It was at the top of its game.
But now, Williams is teetering. Its share price has plummeted 71 percent from its high of $48.77 three years ago as investors steer clear of energy companies. It took a $2.05 billion charge against its 2001 earnings because of costs linked to a former communications business that is now in bankruptcy protection. Standard & Poor's lowered Williams's credit rating last week to one notch above junk status, and Moody's Investors Service is reviewing whether it should cut its rating. Williams is scrambling to pare its $13 billion of debt and shore up investor confidence, announcing last week that it plans to sell as much as $1.5 billion in equity and $3 billion in assets over the next year.
Adding to Williams's woes are several regulatory investigations, including one by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and an accusation by creditors of the communications spinoff, the Williams Communications Group, that Williams loaded up the new company with excess debt.
The California attorney general's office is investigating whether natural gas prices were manipulated during the state's energy crisis, which stretched from the summer of 2000 into 2001. But it declined to say if Williams, which controls significant natural gas pipeline capacity into Southern California, is under investigation.
Williams denies that it did anything illegal in California or anywhere else. "There has been any number of investigations, and Williams has fully cooperated," said William Hobbs, president of the energy marketing and trading unit at Williams. "We have provided piles and piles of documents, and no one has come back and said that Williams has done anything wrong."
The company did refund $8 million to California last year as part of a settlement agreement with federal regulators who were investigating whether power was withheld in the state to drive up the price of electricity. Williams did not acknowledge any wrongdoing.
Like the country's other major power traders, Williams has struggled to avoid the taint of malfeasance ever since Enron's problems began to become known late last year. But successive revelations about how many energy trading companies work -- from the use of creative accounting to show increasing profits to their use of fictitious trades to fatten revenue -- have peeled away the industry's denials to reveal uncomfortable similarities between some other energy companies and the bankrupt Enron.
WILLIAMS has been among the most adamant in asserting that it is nothing like Enron and that it has been unfairly tarred with the same brush. "Williams is, was and always has been the 'anti-Enron,' " Williams said in a statement on Friday.
Mr. Hobbs emphasized the difference between his company's practices and the market manipulations that Enron employed. "Williams is not doing those things," he said. 
But Mr. Murphy and others who worked for the company, as well as some investors who have taken a close look at Williams's financial statements, assert that it has much more to answer for than the problems already apparent to investors and analysts. Like Enron's, Williams's profits skyrocketed from 1996 to 2001 -- by 97 percent for Williams, according to a presentation the company made to analysts last year. But those gains seem to be largely on paper, critics say. They contend that the results were based on the company's optimistic projections about how much it would make on long-term contracts and the practice of booking years' worth of projected profits immediately, through mark-to-market accounting.
The company suffered considerable losses when the California utilities crumbled and when Enron filed for bankruptcy protection, said Mr. Murphy, who was in charge of developing financial instruments to mitigate Williams's trading risks until he was dismissed in December 2001. He is now looking for work.
Williams said Mr. Murphy initially seemed impressive, which is why it hired him. But the company said it later became clear that he lacked understanding of the company's business, and that his "unfounded and evolving criticisms of Williams's energy marketing and trading business emerged only as he realized his employment was in jeopardy and subsequent to his termination."
E-mail messages sent months before Mr. Murphy was dismissed show that he and other Williams employees repeatedly and urgently warned Williams executives that the company had to reduce its trading risks, especially with shaky counterparties like Enron.
But those warnings were apparently ignored, Mr. Murphy and others said. Blinkered by arrogance and an ignorance of the financial sophistication required to trade electricity, critics say, Williams executives thought the company and the deregulated power sector would thrive uninterrupted. Reducing risks, or hedging, takes away from the bottom line, the critics added.
"Not hedging properly is the same thing as inflating profits," said James Chanos, president of Kynikos Associates, a New York short seller, "because hedging has a cost." His company has sold Williams stock short, anticipating further declines.
The latest wave of investor concern and regulatory scrutiny roiling the power industry arises from questions about the ethics and profitability of electricity trading. Enron released memos a few weeks ago detailing methods that its traders used to manipulate electricity prices in California in 2000. Other energy companies have acknowledged that they tried similar tactics, while some -- including Dynegy, CMS Energy and Reliant Resources -- have said that they had made questionable power trades that inflated revenue. Williams denied making such trades and has not been accused of doing so.
Enron effectively invented energy trading, and some companies have tried to distance themselves from Enron by playing down the importance of their trading operations.
Last Tuesday, Dynegy executives said most of the company's cash flow comes from hard assets, like pipelines and power generation, not trading. On Wednesday, the El Paso Corporation announced that it would cut its trading operations drastically. Moody's said last week that electricity trading might not be an investment-grade business.
Electricity trading is a riddle to outsiders, given its complexity and the proprietary models that each company uses to value its trades. But as investors and analysts more closely examine power companies, they have come to realize that the mark-to-market style of accounting used for trading gives companies great leeway to inflate profits and that trading may actually be a money loser.
"We have yet to see proved after the Enron collapse that anyone made money in pure trading," said Robert McCullough, managing partner at McCullough Research, an energy consulting firm in Portland, Ore. "They made money in the California crisis, but in the absence of that, is anyone making money in trading?"
THAT question is crucial to Williams because energy trading is such a big part of its business. In the first quarter, marketing and trading contributed $271 million to Williams's operating income, or 42 percent, before one-time charges and taxes, the most of any business unit. But a close look at its cash-flow statement shows that energy marketing and trading did not generate cash; Williams, however, said that it did.
The paradox stems from the fact that the cash Williams expects from those contracts might arrive 10 or 20 years in the future, but the profits are booked to the bottom line now, under the mark-to-market accounting that Williams and other energy companies use for their trading operations. Among the largest power traders, Williams had the greatest share of profits -- 37 percent -- attributable to mark-to-market accounting, according to a February report by the investment bank ABN Amro.
The importance of trading to Williams is evident in an e-mail memo sent on Wednesday to employees of the company's energy marketing and trading business by Mr. Hobbs, the unit's president. In it, he listed steps the company might take to restore its credit rating, which directly affects profitability. "All of these efforts," he wrote, "are designed to increase liquidity, improve cash flows and provide a sufficient enough credit rating for E.M. and T. to realize the tremendous business opportunities that are ahead of us."
Because Williams's energy contracts extend far into the future, the markets for them are illiquid and opaque. In that case, independent accountants say, a company should calculate the value of the contracts based on conservative models and assumptions. The models at Williams, according to Mr. Murphy and others, were designed primarily to show that the company would make sizable profits from the contracts.
"There was the hubris of the deal makers," said one former Williams employee who insisted on anonymity. "They would do a 20-year deal in 2000 and based on the forward curve, mark-to-market says you just made $350 million. You are king; you made a seven-figure bonus.
"But if the deal goes in reverse and starts to lose money, you don't give the bonus back," the former employee added. "You can figure out a way to game the system internally and convince your guys that the price curve should be better."
Mr. Murphy said that traders and marketers -- not independent economic analysts -- set the forward price curves for power. Traders and marketers have a vested interest in making optimistic forecasts because their bonuses are based on the income they generate for the company. 
"They would just make an economic argument for what the price of 40-year power was and draw a smooth curve," Mr. Murphy said. Enron Energy Services engaged in similar practices before the company collapsed, former employees have said.
Executives at Williams denied that they improperly accounted for the profits and potential cash flow from its contracts, citing reports by equity analysts that have called them among the most conservative companies on this count. "There is nothing nefarious or devious about the valuation of long-dated positions through market data," the company said on Friday.
Another accounting approach that Williams used was the so-called competitive deal basis, Mr. Murphy and others said. Future prices for power would be set according to deals competitors were striking or even discussing and on other deals that Williams was negotiating, too. It was immaterial if the transactions actually occurred, as long as the forecast of power prices would show that Williams could immediately book a substantial profit on paper, Mr. Murphy and others said. 
"There was a total lack of transparency," Mr. Murphy said. "And there was a desire to keep it untransparent because they were doing this funky competitive deal stuff."
Williams said it uses competitive prices only to validate its economic models, not as the basis for assumptions.
AS Williams built its trading business, company executives realized that they needed to manage financial risks in the new electricity marketplace. So in August 2000, Williams hired Mr. Murphy, wooing him from a job as an assistant vice president for the hybrid derivatives group at Bank of America by promising wide latitude to manage the credit, currency and interest rate risk that the company encountered in trading. If not properly managed, those risks could lead to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.
Williams portrays itself as the industry leader in risk management. The phrase is ubiquitous in its pitches to investors.
Mr. Murphy saw a different picture. Williams, he said, had failed to reduce financial risks across the board, but when he offered his ideas, he was turned away. An astrophysicist trained at the California Institute of Technology and speaks with a blunt confidence that comes from his education and his New York upbringing, Mr. Murphy was an outsider among the oil-patch veterans at Williams. He recalls being told many times that as a Wall Streeter, he understood little about trading natural gas and power, though firms like Goldman, Sachs are among the biggest in the business.
Mr. Hobbs concurred that Mr. Murphy was an outsider, and said that explains the outlandishness of his accusation about cornering the natural gas market in California. "I think you are dealing with an employee who is not informed," he said, "and that explains why he is no longer with Williams."
But Mr. Murphy countered that the company was just not willing to listen to people who questioned the status quo. "They were so entrenched in their ways, and there was such deep ambivalence," he said. "It went against their egos to surrender the power to take care of these risks."
Those risks were alarming, Mr. Murphy said. In September 2000, Mr. Murphy said he noticed that Williams had bet on a fall in interest rates and did not hedge, or set up counterbalancing contracts to neutralize risk, in case they did not drop. Interest rates did fall, and Williams made huge profits. But Mr. Murphy tried, unsuccessfully, to convince Williams that it could not have a position on the direction interest rates would go without mitigating the risk that they might move the opposite way.
"That they're holding such speculative positions, they should have had to report that to investors," he said. "Banks don't let traders run such naked positions -- just betting that rates will fall."
In fact, that successful bet accounted for much of Williams's reported 2001 profits from energy trading. In a July 30 e-mail message that Mr. Murphy made available, Zahid Ullah, a former consultant to the trading arm, discussed interest-rate risk with Mr. Murphy and concluded that the sharp fall in rates accounted for more than $100 million in profit for the energy marketing and trading unit last year. That was 7.8 percent of the unit's total profit.
Williams said it does not report results by commodity, which would include interest-rate risk.
In the early fall of 2000, Mr. Murphy said, he also warned the company about the rapidly deteriorating finances of the California utilities to which it had sold power, the Pacific Gas and Electric unit of the PG&E Corporation and the Southern California Edison unit of Edison International. Pacific Gas has since gone bankrupt. Mr. Murphy saw that the utilities' debts to Williams were growing, and he thought that Williams should hedge against the risk of their bankruptcy. "But the contention of the higher-ups was that they would get it back," he said. "They told me those companies were too big to fail."
After the utilities crumbled, the company did manage to get back a big part of the money. But in a presentation Mr. Murphy made for the company on Oct. 8, 2001, the total owed to Williams by California utilities was $812 million. The company said on Friday that to date, California utilities owed it $217 million, and that it expects to be paid in full.
In an e-mail message on Nov. 29 to Stephanie Cipolla, the head of human resources at the energy marketing and trading unit, Mr. Murphy wrote: "We're getting up to over a year now, and this money has cost us something like 50 million interest costs on funding the 800 million hole in our balance sheet. I would have hedged that risk for much less than a 50 million bonus, honest."
The company faced the same choices a year later, in the fall of 2001, when Enron began to falter. But the California debacle seemed to have taught Williams nothing, Mr. Murphy said in an interview and in e-mail messages to colleagues.
Mr. Murphy said he pointed out to his superiors that Enron's creditworthiness was eroding. The signs of it were in the yield on the company's debt, which was as high as 16 percent at the time, far higher thanyields of more stable companies. In one November e-mail message, Mr. Murphy recounted "an awful meeting Oct 28th, where I basically fought a lonely battle to hedge, slow pay and otherwise protect the company against Enron's deteriorating situation."
Mr. Murphy said Mr. Herndon and Mike Selman, vice president for portfolio management at the energy marketing and trading unit, countermanded his orders to hedge Enron's credit risk. In an Oct. 26 e-mail message to Rod Sailor, assistant treasurer at Williams, Mr. Murphy said he was nervous about Enron, adding: "Also you said something like, 'The stock and their bonds would have to go a LOT lower to consider hedging Enron's credit.' There's not a lot of room left from here to liquidation levels, so are you basically saying you don't want us to hedge at all?"
In his e-mail response three days later, Mr. Sailor confirmed Mr. Murphy's supposition: "Yes, we should be concerned; and yes; we should continue to monitor the situation; and yes, their credit is deteriorating, but right now they're rated higher than we are and are still investment grade."
THE company said that no one saw Enron's bankruptcy coming until it was too late, and that by this time Williams had mitigated this risk in other ways. Williams said its exposure to Enron was relatively small compared with that of other companies.
In the fourth quarter of 2001, Williams was owed more than $91 million by Enron, which accounted for a charge of 12 cents a share to Williams's quarterly earnings of $2.35 a share.
Mr. Murphy was offered a demotion in early December. He refused to accept it and was fired.
He said that there was one instance in his time at Williams when he felt that a top executive supported him. Mr. Murphy said that after Andrew Sunderman, the trading unit's chief financial officer, found out about Mr. Herndon's natural-gas tactic, he warned against being too greedy. "Sunderman told Blake and me: 'Pigs get fat. Hogs get slaughtered,' " Mr. Murphy recalled recently.
Mr. Sunderman said he would never have talked about natural gas trading with Mr. Murphy.

Tensions in a Week of Dispirited Trading

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
After a long string of losses, a few bargain hunters finally emerged on Wall Street at the end of last week. But most investors were too busy worrying about corporate earnings, terrorism threats and rising tensions between India and Pakistan to have much of an appetite to buy stocks. 
 In a week shortened by the Memorial Day holiday, share prices retreated, reflecting these domestic and global concerns. Investors were also concerned that many sectors of the market, especially technology, were overvalued, and that the economic recovery may be starting to slow, analysts said. 
 The market began to rally on Friday after the Labor Department said first-quarter productivity grew at an annual rate of 8.4 percent, its best showing in 19 years. 
 But the Dow Jones industrial average, up as much as 130.36 points on Friday, ended up only 13.56 points. It closed the week at 9,925.25, down 1.8 percent, or 179.01 points. The Nasdaq composite index fell 45.76 points, or 2.8 percent, to 1,615.73. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 16.68 points for the week, or 1.5 percent, closing at 1,067.14. 
 The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 5.04 percent from 5.14 percent.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Mildred Wirt Benson, the woman who wrote most of the original Nancy Drew mysteries under the pen name Carolyn Keene, died at 96 last week.
 Her teen-age detective, a plucky strawberry blonde with a blue roadster, emboldened millions of little girls to think they could outwit the world. The successors of the pretty young sleuth who always tripped up the bad guys are legion: Sarah Michelle Gellar in "Buffy," Jennifer Garner in "Alias," Jill Hennessy in "Crossing Jordan" and, most famously, the crackerjack F.B.I. agent Clarice Starling, the dot-connecting nemesis of Hannibal Lecter. 
 If the spirited Nancy Drew had grown up, she would probably have ended up a dispirited whistle-blower. 
That's what happens to women of ingenuity and integrity in macho organizations -- from Sherron Watkins at Enron to Coleen Rowley at the F.B.I. -- who piece together clues and ferret out criminal behavior and management cover-ups.
First, their male superiors tell them to shut up. And if the women point fingers anyhow, they end up being painted by their status-quo colleagues as wacky, off-the-reservation snitches with dubious futures.
Even though the F.B.I. chief, Robert Mueller, praised Ms. Rowley during his press conference on Wednesday, street agents, or "brick agents" as those who hit the bricks are called, whisper that her days are numbered.
"I think your statements demonstrate a rush to judgment to protect the F.B.I. at all costs," she told her boss in a classic understatement. She shot her 13-page memo not only to Mr. Mueller, who immediately tried to bury it with a "classified" stamp, but also to two lawmakers on a Congressional intelligence panel. Some of her colleagues say that the F.B.I. culture disdains such out-of-school disclosures and predict that she will be shunned and isolated.
By contrast, Kenneth Williams, the prescient Phoenix agent who did the vivid memo about Osama's thugs congregating at flight schools, stayed inside the family. He was the organization guy who went through channels and put the bureau in the best light before senators.
If it were not for Coleen Rowley's courage, Mr. Mueller and other Bush officials would still be insisting they couldn't possibly have known or imagined or hindered the terrorists' grand plan. And, of course, two months ago Rummy and Ari Fleischer were insisting that Al Qaeda was crippled and on the run.
Now we know the truth: The 9/11 terrorists could have been stopped, if everyone in the F.B.I. had been as hard-working and quick-witted as Special Agent Rowley. Or if the law enforcement agencies had not been so inept, obstructionist, arrogant, antiquated, bloated and turf-conscious -- and timid about racial profiling. As The Economist notes, "There is a big difference between policemen picking on speeding black drivers and spies targeting Arabs who might harbor plans to set off nuclear bombs."
So now comes John Ashcroft, saying that everything will be fine because the F.B.I. has begun Googling and dropping in unannounced at the SuicidePilots.com chat room.
And now comes Mr. Mueller with his big blue charts, acting as though national security is a marketing problem. All that was missing from the director's presentation was a new logo. How about a swoosh on F.B.I. badges: Just Do It.
Last on his top 10 list of priorities was "update technology." That's not going to be so easy, given that the agents still can't even use their e-mail with agency computers. Perhaps it would be easier to just shut down the F.B.I. and reboot with a lean, mean domestic counterterrorism machine.
I'm sick of all these colliding flow charts and color-coded warnings. I want to see some agents lose their jobs. Let's start with the counterterrorism whiz who told Ms. Rowley that her team could not get a search warrant because Zacarias Moussaoui had such a common name in France. Bye-bye.
Or the counterterrorism braniac who found the Minneapolis and Phoenix warning memos in his In Box and put them in his Out Box. Get lost. (There's an accounting job waiting for you at Halliburton.)
The president should snap out of his jet lag, summon his national security team (Tenet and Rove) and issue a single remorseless instruction: "Bring me the head of Osama bin Laden. Or Bob Mueller."

HEADLINE: Commencement Speeches; 
Along With Best Wishes, 9/11 Is a Familiar Graduation Theme

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
Nearly everyone who worked the commencement speech circuit this spring talked about Sept. 11, whether it was the horror of that morning and its aftermath, or the lessons learned by both the nation's government and its citizens. 
 Tom Ridge, whose cabinet-level position as director of homeland security did not exist at this time last year, was in hot demand, as were writers like Anna Quindlen and Tom Wolfe, who were expected to put the fall's extraordinary events into perspective. 
 But like purveyors of comfort food at a roadside diner, the authors, politicians, entertainers, historians and business leaders also served up heapings of timeless advice and anecdotes, recounting their own experiences as young people entering the adult world.
The rationale behind the selection of some speakers was not immediately obvious, at least to some students. The actor Alec Baldwin was tapped to speak at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, partly because he and the institute's president, Joyce F. Brown, knew each other as alumni of New York University, according to a school spokesman. 
Moreover, when Dr. Brown's husband, H. Carl McCall, who is now seeking the Democratic nomination for governor of New York, was running for re-election as state comptroller in 1998, Mr. Baldwin gave at least one speech on his behalf that was harshly critical of Gov. George E. Pataki.
"Growing up in New York," Mr. Baldwin told the institute's graduates on May 24, "I remember F.I.T. as that place that prevented me from driving crosstown when I headed west on 27th Street."
Terrifying times often call for soothing voices, and there was probably none more reassuring than that of Fred Rogers, who stopped taping "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" last year after 33 years, but who still lives on in reruns, as well as in the memories of many of this year's graduates. 
"I'd like to give you the words of one of our 'Neighborhood' songs," he told the seniors at Chatham College in Pittsburgh on May 19, as if they were suddenly 4 years old again and sitting in front of their television sets. "Hopefully it says what those who really love you are feeling about you today."
It's you I like.
It's not the things you wear.
It's not the way you do your hair.
But it's you I like.
The way you are right now.
The way down deep inside you.
Not the things that hide you.
Not your caps and gowns -- they're just beside you.
But it's you I like.

I'm a local girl. I grew up down the street and around a few corners. When I was growing up on Long Island, I never expected to go to college. . . . The real world for me was a job at the Doubleday factory here in Garden City. I was hired to file, and I was advised I had better be fast out in the real world. The year was 1969, and at that time employees in my office could not go to the rest room without permission. Our coffee break was announced by the ringing of a bell.
Women were expected to wear skirts, hosiery, sensible shoes. There was to be no talking. There was to be serious filing.
I lasted until lunch. 
At noon, I walked away from my job at the factory and drove directly to Adelphi's admission office. I began as a nonmatriculated student, but I finished my course work in three years and went to the writing program at Stanford University. It was a thrill when I sold my first novel, but it wasn't the defining moment of my life. Coming to Adelphi was the most important day in my life.
It is particularly satisfying that my next novel will be published in the summer of 2003 by Doubleday.

Someone once asked Woodrow Wilson when he was president of Princeton University what the function of a liberal education ought to be. And Wilson replied, "To make a person as unlike his father as possible."
What he meant, I think, is that a liberal education ought to make a person independent of mind, skeptical of authority and received views, prepared to forge an identity for himself or herself, and capable of becoming an individual not bent upon copying other persons -- even persons as persuasive and influential as one's father.
The kind of liberal education to which Wilson referred is more necessary today than ever because the qualities it nurtures are more imperiled than ever.
We are immersed in a dot-com digital culture, a social environment of constant stimulation significantly influenced by the mass media and other unrelenting prescribers of opinion and feelings. But it is not the media alone who are to blame for the accelerated tenor of our lives.
Telephones, television, VCR's, fax machines, computers, the Internet, e-mail, cellphones, beepers and all these forms of instant communication too often create a bewildering barrage of noise and frenetic movement. It is almost as if we have surrounded ourselves with such technology in order to avoid suspended moments of silence and contemplation. 
If we are to succeed in preserving our individuality against such technological tyranny, we need to slow the tempo of our lives and extend the span of our attention. We need to emphasize a form of humane education that helps students to establish a rich interior life and an enduring openness of mind. A sturdy, private self where moral self-examination can occur.

For all the terrible suffering they caused, the attacks of Sept. 11 did have one good effect. Americans remembered how blessed we are, and how we are united with all people whose aspirations to freedom and justice are threatened with violence and cruelty. 
We instinctively grasped that the terrorists who organized the attacks mistook materialism as the only value of liberty. They believed liberty was corrupting, that the right of individuals to pursue happiness made societies weak. They held us in contempt.
Spared by prosperity from the hard uses of life, bred by liberty only for comfort and easy pleasure, they thought us no match for the violent, cruel struggle they planned for us.
They badly misjudged us.

For molecular biologists, it is an exciting time. The next great challenge is to sort through the vast store of genetic data and find ways to use the information for the benefit or our health and to discover fundamental principles that govern all living things, including our evolution as a species.
But all this new scientific information is raising profound ethical questions . . . Do we, for instance, want to be able to order new organs online? Or perhaps offer them on eBay to the highest bidder?
Will each of our individual genetic imprints enter the public domain like Social Security numbers, and become available to lending institutions and health insurance companies, not to mention thieves, con artists and, heaven forbid, even telemarketers?
We have always struggled with the questions of when life begins and when it should end. But now we have the prospect of a new questions: Will life end? Or in a few generations, will we be fighting over Thanksgiving drumsticks with our great-great-great-grandchildren? And which unfortunate relative gets stuck with cooking for such an event?

Every day, billions of people around the world make choices as to what they will wear, what car they will drive. They choose shoes, paintings, refrigerators, boats, furniture, linens, dishes. They make a statement to the best of their ability, and within the boundaries of their own tastes and budgets, about who they are. And, may I dare say, most of them are not creative people. They just don't have that gene. They haven't developed that muscle.
So the uncreative people of the world rely on the creative people of the world to help them.

Every single person in here and on this stage today still uses the understanding that there is a Caucasian race, that there is an Asian race, that there is an African race, and an indigenous race. Well, I'm here to tell you, you should have never invited me if you didn't want to learn one thing today. And that's that there's only one race, and that's the human race. Period. 
I've spent my entire adult life trying to realize how in the world are we ever going to come together when we keep on using the word "race" as a cultural determinant? How can we even look at one another and understand our unity of humanness when we consider ourselves different races? . . . Why was it started? We all know why.
Because it's easier for me to kill you because you're a different race, and for you to kill someone else because they're a different race.

Your school year began in a most horrific way. The events of Sept. 11 only serve to reinforce how precious these protections are, how important you are in the life of our nation, in the life of our world. More than 3,000 people died that day. Most were Americans, but they died with people from 50 other countries ranging from Chile to Zimbabwe. That's why they called it the World Trade Center. Among the Americans were blacks, whites, Latinos, Asians, Christians, Muslims, Jews -- as diverse in death as we are in life.
One of those who escaped from the World Trade Center said: "If you'd seen what it was like in that stairway, you'd be proud. There was no gender, no race, no religion. It was everyone helping each other."
But away from that stairway -- in America's streets -- there is gender, there is race, there is religion.

As you leave this holy place, I want to remind you that your talents are absolutely necessary in a profane world. Just as I believe cloistered nuns and monks balance the frenzied pace of life, and protected wetlands stabilize the ecosystem, artists create a safe place for unsafe ideas in our world.
Postmodernist irony may have collapsed along with the World Trade Center towers, but the role we play in creating metaphor, defining space, real and imagined, commemorating losses and victories, and articulating the unconscious can never be underestimated. Not enough artworks can erupt out of our psyches in response to 9/11.
My friend Mary Judge lost her brother that day. . . . When she visited ground zero, she told me she felt as if she had entered hell. Surprisingly, she was comforted when she saw a Martin Puryear sculpture that had miraculously survived. In the midst of the carnage, art endured and gave her hope.

If you should come to Washington, you will find the most beautiful city in the world now marred by ugly barriers and concrete barricades. For security reasons, Pennsylvania Avenue is blocked off to traffic around the White House. The Capitol is barricaded off like the palace of a tinhorn dictator. Soon hidden cameras will follow your every move if you should choose to walk among the monuments that are symbols of our freedoms.
We tolerate all this as necessary. But we must never accept it as the way it must always be.

Tom Ridge

When you first arrived here several years ago, people were debating whether the technology-driven new economy had rendered the business cycle a thing of the past. As you leave, the debate is over whether our economy can return to where it was before 9/11.
We've been down this path before. In the year that many of you were born, another set of graduates sat in these seats and celebrated their achievements in a world that had also been shaken to its very foundation. Entire industries, regional economies and a way of life were transformed seemingly overnight. It was a time of long lines, both at the gas pumps and the unemployment offices. It was a time when we were told we must lower our expectations. Our nation's crisis of confidence reached all the way to the top. Pundits even began to suggest that the job of leading this nation was too big for one individual.
You know, that sounds a little bit familiar. I've heard the same thing a few times myself. In fact, I went on Lexis-Nexis to find out how many times the media has used the words "impossible job" or "task" in the same sentence as "homeland security."
Seventy-three references popped up.

When I quit The New York Times to be a full-time mother, the voices of the world said I was nuts. When I quit it again to be a full-time novelist, they said I was nuts again. But I am not nuts. I am successful on my own terms. Because if your success is not on your own terms, if it looks good to the world but does not feel good in your soul, it is not success at all.
Look at your fingers. Each one is crowned by an abstract design that is completely different than that of anyone in this crowd, in this country, in this world. They are a metaphor for everything. Each of you is as different as your fingertips. Why should you march to any lockstep? Our love of lockstep is our greatest curse, the source of all that bedevils us.
It is the source of homophobia, xenophobia, racism, sexism, terrorism, bigotry of every variety and hue, because it tells us there is one right way to do things, to look, to behave, to feel, when the only right way is to feel your heart hammering inside you and to listen to what its timpani is saying.

Rudolph W. Giuliani

Before Sept. 11 we were living like there was a cloud, a veil in front of our eyes. We didn't see what was going on in the world clearly or precisely enough. We didn't understand that there was the kind of hatred for what we are and who we are that could inspire a monstrous attack like that. Maybe we partially understood it, maybe we understood it somewhat, but we didn't understand it with the full drama with which we should have understood it. And now we do. And in a way, just like human beings grow up and mature as they understand the realities of life, nations grow up and mature when they understand the realities they actually face. And now we're doing that.
We're facing the reality, and you're much stronger for it, both emotionally and in practicality, than you were before.

Man's view of himself is changing very rapidly. Within the next 20 years I think you'll feel its effects. After Darwinism, after Freudianism, there's now a tremendous influence of neuroscience. It's a very exciting field. It would be very tempting to go into, but if I may reduce with terrible reductiveness the bottom line of neuroscience, it is that let's not kid ourselves. We're all concatenations of molecules containing DNA, hard wired into a chemical analog computer known as the human brain, which as software has a certain genetic code. And your idea that you have a soul or even a self, much less free will, is just an illusion.
Your fate is preordained and if we had . . . enough data and sufficient parallel computers, we could predict everything you're going to do, including the fact that within the next 20 seconds you'll touch your forehead. 
Somehow it reminds me of this marvelous song by the Bloodhound Gang, which says: "You and me baby, we ain't nothin' but mammals. So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel."

Uh-oh, here comes the advice.
Do not descend too deeply in specialism in your work. Educate all your parts. You will be healthier.
Don't confuse success with excellence. The poet Robert Penn Warren once told me that "careerism is death."
Travel. Do not get stuck in one place. Visit Appomattox, where the country really came together. Whatever you do, walk over the Brooklyn Bridge.
Give up addictions. Try brushing your teeth tonight with the other hand. 
Try even remembering what I just asked you.

There were two pieces of advice my father always gave me: be honest and be a good employee. The fact is, there is no difference between individual values and corporate values. Good ethics are good business.
What we want from our friends -- honesty and integrity, energy and optimism, commitment to family and community, and hard work and high ethical standards -- are the same qualities we need from American business.
A year before George Bernard Shaw died, he was asked by a journalist to name a famous deceased man -- a statesman, artist, philosopher, writer -- whom he missed the most. Shaw replied, "The man I miss most is the man I could have been."

Have you heard the story that came out of the Seattle Special Olympics? 
For the 100-yard-dash there were nine contestants, all of them so-called physically or mentally disabled. All nine of them assembled at the starting line and at the sound of the gun, they took off. But one little boy didn't get very far. He stumbled and fell and hurt his knee and began to cry. 
The other eight children heard the boy crying. They slowed down, turned around and ran back to him -- every one of them ran back to him. One little girl with Down syndrome bent down and kissed the boy and said, "This will make it better." The little boy got up, and he and the rest of the runners linked their arms together and joyfully walked to the finish line. 
They all finished the race at the same time. And when they did, everyone in the stadium stood up and clapped and whistled and cheered for a long, long time. People who were there are still telling the story with obvious delight. And you know why? 
Because deep down we know that what matters in this life is more than winning for ourselves. What really matters is helping others win, too, even if it means slowing down and changing our course now and then.

Whatever future you're building, don't try to program everything. Five-year plans never worked for the Soviet Union -- in fact, if anything, central planning contributed to its fall. Chances are, central planning won't work any better for any of us.

HEADLINE: Africa Creeps Along Path to Democracy 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS with NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: GAO, Mali 

 BODY:
The elders danced in their fraying turbans as the opposition party's candidate for president campaigned across the swirling sands of the Sahel. On Election Day, the old men and other opposition supporters turned out by the thousands to vote for change in one of the poorest countries in the world.
 What happened in the election here in West Africa early in May made few headlines in the West. The army did not send troops into the shabby cities nor did tanks roll through windswept villages when the ruling party lost the presidency after 10 years in power. 
 Instead, governing party leaders took a step that was notable for its seeming ordinariness: they held a news conference at the local convention center and conceded defeat. It was a sign of changing times. 
Imperfectly, reluctantly, tentatively, democracy is inching across a continent better known for wars, disease, corruption and repression. Since 1990, 42 of the 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa have held multiparty elections, the World Bank says. Not since Africans began shaking off colonial rule more than 40 years ago has the continent witnessed such broad political change.
It was Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator of Zaire, who famously declared, "Democracy is not for Africa." In the early 1980's, he did not seem far off course. Only four countries were holding multiparty elections then on a continent dominated by autocrats and military juntas.
Today, despite common complaints of vote rigging and political intimidation, most Africans have the right to choose their leaders at the ballot box. Over the last two years, governing parties in four nations -- Senegal, Mauritius, Ghana and Mali -- have peacefully handed power to opposition party rivals.
In some ways, the political transformation in Africa resembles the faltering transition that began in Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In both regions, some nations are moving forward as others stumble. In both places, people are watching with ambivalence and anxiety as political and economic changes are sometimes accompanied by corruption, crime and deepening poverty.
For many ordinary Africans, the tangible benefits of the political change remain elusive. 
National leaders in Zimbabwe, Kenya and the Congo Republic have been accused of manipulating the electoral process to maintain a veneer of legitimacy while continuing to persecute or sideline their critics.
And, at least so far, democracy has often been followed by a period of deteriorating living standards. 
Many Africans are now freer but poorer than they have been in decades.
The long economic decline has been linked to poor leadership, falling demand for Africa's commodities and the reluctance of Western governments to open their markets to African products. Market reforms adopted by many of the newly elected governments have not yet eased poverty. Foreign aid to Africa, which soared during the cold war when the Soviet Union and United States competed for allies among the continent's dictators, has dropped to its lowest levels. Disillusionment is growing against those African leaders and Western nations whose commitment to African democratization seems unsteady.
But Africa's much-publicized failures obscure the evolving political landscape after a decade when millions of first-time voters cast ballots from the deserts of Mali to the green hills of South Africa.
South Africa, Mozambique and Senegal are among those countries taking steps forward, even as others falter. "The popular perception of even quite well informed people in the U.S. is to write Africa off, but it's not universally bleak," said Michael Bratton, a political scientist at Michigan State University who has analyzed African elections.
The development of flawed democracies is still considered progress to people carrying the physical and mental scars left by authoritarian regimes.
In May, thousands of jubilant voters in Sierra Leone cast ballots for president in the country's first elections since its civil war, which lasted throughout the 1990's. In Lesotho, which was battered by an attempted coup in 1998, citizens peacefully elected a new Parliament that same month.
With the longstanding leaders of Mozambique, Namibia and Angola announcing that they will not run for re-election, more political transitions seem likely.
Here in Mali, where shepherds chase skinny goats across the parched earth, people still grumble about hunger and political corruption. Many complaints of voting irregularities and vote rigging were lodged, mostly against the governing party; the Constitutional Court threw out more than 500,000 votes in the first round of voting.
But there is also talk among villagers of meetings with the mayor and praise for the new wells, clinics and schools that have come since military rule ended in 1992.
"Justice prevails a little more," said Sulamo Djiguiba, a wizened old man who was contemplating democracy on Election Day. "During the military regime, soldiers would just come and arrest us and make us work for the army or on their farms. Now that doesn't exist. We are free. We can go where we like."
Ansema Djiguiba, 25, agreed. "The mayor and his representatives come and we have the right to talk about our needs without fear," he said. "They have dug wells for us. Some villages have schools. But we are still asking for more help. Many people are still hungry."
In June, African leaders will discuss the continent's progress when they meet in Canada with leaders of big industrial nations. The aim is to persuade Western governments to increase foreign aid and investment for Africa's fledgling democracies.
The presidents of South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal and Algeria say that a new generation of African leaders is committed to good governance and respect for human rights. In a plan called the New Partnership for Africa's Development, these four presidents have promised to create a peer review system to ensure African compliance with democratic principles.
The plan has been praised by President Bush and the prime ministers of Britain and Canada, but it is unclear how widely it will be embraced on this continent, where reform-minded leaders and autocrats coexist uneasily.
"We must not be complacent," said Ibrahim Gambari, the United Nations special representative for Africa, who is from Nigeria. "There are still 17 ongoing conflicts. Africa is still the poorest continent in the world, the biggest sufferer of H.I.V. and AIDS, the continent with the most external debts and the least foreign investment. But we are lot more hopeful than we were 5 or 10 years ago."
In the early 1980's, such hope was unimaginable. The continent was dominated by military juntas, one-party states and white-minority governments, with only Mauritius, Gambia, Senegal and Botswana holding multiparty elections.
But change was coming. The cold war was ending along with foreign sponsorship of Africa's dictators. Economic discontent was encouraging new opposition movements. By 1990, when Benin became the first African country to move from dictatorship to multiparty democracy, election fever was growing.
From 1990 through 1994, 54 elections were held in 29 countries and about half were deemed free and fair by official election observers, according to Professor Bratton's analysis. Eleven sitting presidents were voted out of office during that first flurry of elections. Three more presidents decided not to seek re-election.
So dramatic was the rush to adopt democratic forms of government that some academics describe this period as Africa's "second independence."
All across the continent, from post-apartheid South Africa to newly democratic Nigeria, new newspapers and political parties have emerged, exposing corruption and incompetence and widening the space for dissent.
The enthusiasm has faded in many countries as many elected leaders have found themselves confounded by entrenched poverty, ethnic tensions and corruption. Some presidents have continued to repress journalists and political rivals, leaving people to question the differences between dictatorship and democracy.
But in a recent survey of public opinion in 12 African countries, coordinated by professors in South Africa, Ghana and the United States, 70 percent of the respondents said democracy was "always preferable" to nondemocratic forms of government.
On Election Day in Sierra Leone, the exhilaration was palpable at a camp for those with hacked-off limbs, the injuries that defined the horrors of that country's civil war. Among them was Lamine Jusu Jarka, whose hands were cut off in a rebel attack in 1999.
Mr. Jarka voted by stamping his ballot sheet with an ink-stained toe.
"This morning, I am voting for the future," he said.
But the Afrobarometer survey also captured the disillusionment over the failure of the new political system to deliver economic benefits to the masses.
While more than 80 percent of respondents said democracy should deliver jobs and access to education, nearly half said their living standards were getting worse, not better. The World Bank says the per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa -- about $474 a year -- is less today than it was at the end of the 1960's, measured in today's dollars.
What ordinary people know is that they went hungry under authoritarian rule and still go hungry.
Mali's president, Alpha Konare, was praised in Western capitals for stepping down after two terms in office. But at home, where 70 percent of the population is poor, some people say hardships have worsened since he was elected in 1992, in a vote that ended military rule.
"Unemployment is growing and the economic situation is still very bad," said Abdoulaye Diarra, 48, an electrician who voted for the opposition. "Under the military regime, at least your money was worth something."
In Nigeria, where democracy returned in 1999 after 16 years of military misrule, rising lawlessness and government corruption have overshadowed real advances in personal freedom.
"Is this the dividend of democracy we are talking about?" someone scrawled on a wall in a burned-out neighborhood in Lagos, which was riven by ethnic killings this year. "We want a military regime for peace and stability."
Many of the states that have emerged from authoritarian rule depend on Western governments to cover the costs of their elections and ordinary budget items. Democracy in these places remains fragile.
Even in Africa's most stable and prosperous countries, like South Africa, competitive multiparty systems are still struggling to emerge.
Meanwhile, Africans are increasingly arguing that selective criticism from the West only encourages tactics like vote rigging and other irregularities.
In the Congo Republic, with rich oil reserves, an election in March went almost unnoticed. Only one real candidate -- President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, a longtime ally of French and American oil companies -- stood on voting day.
A new residency law effectively barred two candidates from running; the sole remaining competitor, Andre Milongo, a former prime minister, dropped out two days before the vote, saying the elections were rigged.
"On the one hand, the West is always talking to us about democracy," Mr. Milongo said. "On the other hand, it did not support the democratic process here. It's empty talk."
But in Mali, the opposition defeated the governing party in May by snaring 70 percent of the vote. The winner, Gen. Amadou Toumani Toure, is revered for toppling the country's dictatorship in 1991.
General Toure knows the challenges ahead. On the campaign trail, he sipped tea with elders and listened to jobless students. He told them their vote still mattered, even if democracy had not brought everything that everyone had hoped for.
"I don't say democracy can solve everything," he said on his campaign stop here. "But it's better than anything we have seen so far."

HEADLINE: SOCCER; 
Legacy of World Cup May Be the Stadiums Left Behind

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SAPPORO, Japan 

 BODY:
With blasts of compressed air, the 2.5-acre soccer field levitates four inches. Then, like a giant green tray, the expanse of grass slowly rolls into a silvery, flying-saucer-shaped stadium. Inside, computer commands have folded away baseball bleachers like steel origami, part of a recent practice run for the first World Cup soccer game here, on June 1.
 About 200,000 curiosity seekers have already taken the tour of Sapporo's futuristic baseball and soccer stadium. Whether the visitors will keep coming after Asia's first World Cup is a bigger question. Sapporo's dome cost about half a billion dollars, but the city has only a soccer team whose games are sparsely attended and has yet to sign a baseball team. 
 Japan and South Korea, the co-hosts of the World Cup finals, the world's biggest sporting event, have gone on the biggest stadium building spree in the Cup's 72-year history. Japan has spent about $4.6 billion to build six stadiums and to refurbish four. South Korea has spent about $2.7 billion to build 10 stadiums. 
In contrast, France, the last World Cup host, built one new stadium and refurbished the rest. The United States, the host in 1994, took a page from the money-making 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and largely converted existing stadiums, often by taking down football goal posts and drawing soccer lines on the fields.
"What Japan has built for the World Cup is absolutely fiscal insanity," said Marty Kuehnert, an American sports consultant and broadcaster based in Tokyo. "We will see most of these new stadiums go belly up."
Nikkei Business, a killjoy publication that looks at ventures in Japan like an old-fashioned accountant, sourly commented that the new stadiums "might just as well be ruins in the Egyptian desert."
But during their one month in the sun, these stadiums will also display the latest in stadium architecture and design to nearly three million ticket holders and to billions of television viewers around the globe.
Kobe's Wing Stadium has a computer-controlled water pipe system to regulate water, oxygen and fertilizer. Miyagi's stadium, designed to resemble a 16th-century Japanese samurai helmet, provides an in-house group-hearing-aid system for designated seats. Oita's stadium, known as the Big Eye, has a Teflon membrane translucent roof that retracts in 20 minutes.
In South Korea, officials spurned Seoul's Olympic Stadium as a leftover from the 1988 Summer Olympics. Instead, for the World Cup's opening game, on May 31, they spent $185 million to build the Seoul World Cup Stadium. With a new subway line serving this 65,000-seat, kite-themed stadium, officials are billing it as "Asia's largest soccer stadium," ignoring a 100,000-seat stadium in Pyongyang, North Korea, and a 72,370-seat stadium in Yokohama, Japan, site of the World Cup's final game, on June 30.
Elsewhere in South Korea, the port of Inchon has a new stadium designed on the lines of a ship's sails; Taegu's new stadium looks like a giant eye looking into space; Suwon's stadium resembles the wings of a bird poised to take flight; the steel cables of Chonju's stadium suggest the stringed zither of traditional Korean music; Sogwipo's stadium echoes its island's volcanic craters; and the contours of Kwangju's arena resemble breasts.
Architectural reveries aside, South Korea's stadium strategy is to announce to the world that that fast-developing country is knocking on the door of the first world club. Branding itself as "Asia's most-wired nation," South Korea wants to impress the world with its high penetration rates for cellphones and high-speed Internet lines. South Korea wants to tell the world that Samsung's DVD players are now on a par with Sony's, and that Hyundai's cars are on a par with Toyota's.
For Japan, long one of the world's richest nations, the coming-out party was the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Its public-works spending spree, in spite of an aging, shrinking population, is dictated largely by a politically powerful parliamentary lobby known as the "construction tribe." Construction spending per soccer game has averaged nearly $150 million. Examples of the spending:
*In Saitama, an hour north of Tokyo, the prefectural governor expanded the original seating capacity of its stadium by 50 percent, to 63,700, gambling that his suburb would win the championship game. Although $640 million was spent, the final game went to Yokohama.
*In Miyagi, a 49,000-seat stadium was built in a remote location accessible from the prefectural capital by taking two trains and a 10-minute bus ride. That showcase cost $585 million.
*In Oita, promoters boast that the 43,000-seat Big Eye cost $464 million. Local tax critics note that the J-League soccer games have been averaging only 3,000 fans.
Defenders of the stadium construction say that the World Cup will implant soccer in a country where its roots are shallow.
"The World Cup presented the perfect opportunity for us to develop an infrastructure for soccer," Junju Ogura, vice president of the Japan Football Association, said at a recent Tokyo news conference. "After the World Cup, J-League teams will use the stadiums as their home fields."
Sapporo, site of the 1972 Winter Olympics, is one city that may be able to manage its stadium without enormous losses. In an area that gets an average of 15 feet of snow every winter, Sapporo's dome now allows for year-round baseball. A major tourism destination, this northern city of 1.8 million people is now on Japan's "dome tour" for pop music concerts, a circuit for the nation's most popular groups, who book concerts at the five cities with covered stadiums.
"In Hokkaido, there was absolutely no big facility that could attract large numbers of people," Ryoji Matsushita, managing director of the Sapporo Dome, said, referring to Japan's northernmost island, which has about 5.6 million people.
Many of the new stadiums will depend almost entirely on soccer ticket sales to pay their multimillion-dollar annual maintenance costs. To carry the load, Japan's 10-year-old professional soccer league looks puny. Last year attendance at J-League games averaged about 16,000, about one-third of capacity at most of the new stadiums. 
Reflecting surveys indicating that baseball and sumo wrestling are Japan's favorite sports, Japan today exhibits little World Cup soccer fever. In South Korea, where baseball is also king, professional soccer generally draws only about 3,000 people to a game.
"There is little prospect for these stadiums to be managed adequately after the World Cup," predicted Masayuki Tamaki, a veteran NHK television sports commentator.
While soccer stadium construction may not respond to popular demand, it does respond to parliamentary demand. The $4.7 billion in soccer stadium construction took place over the last five years, at a time when Japan was mired in two economic recessions. Arguably, the recessions would have been deeper in areas that received hundreds of millions of dollars in stadium investments.
Kiyoko Hayakawa, a kiosk vendor at Sapporo's main railroad station, expressed some of the good feelings here about the new stadium. "My son won a free ticket to a soccer game," he said. "When I saw him so happy, I thought the dome was worth it."
But, one day, the bill will come due. This year, Japan's government debt approaches 140 percent of the G.N.P., the highest ratio of any major economy in the world. With Japanese government bonds already receiving the lowest rating of the world's major developed nations, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the bonds two notches on Thursday.
But few people think that a New York ratings agency can scare the "construction tribe" of the Liberal Democratic Party.
Robert Whiting, an American who has written several acerbic books about baseball in Japan, said of the stadium-building frenzy: "In order to keep the construction state going, the L.D.P. is going to have to issue new contracts -- to tear the stadiums down."

If Washington Woke Up, He Wouldn't Sleep Here

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: KINGSTON, N.J., June 1 

 BODY:
It's hard to imagine anyone, let alone George Washington, sleeping at Rockingham, the 288-year-old clapboard mansion that served as his final headquarters toward the end of the American Revolution.
 Like some beached and eviscerated whale, the house sits along the main road here with one facade stripped of its double-height balcony and another sheathed in jarring white plastic. Carpenter bees are boring into the pea-soup green siding, water is collecting in the basement and splotches of mildew are spreading through the plaster and oak ballroom where Martha Washington entertained James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson and members of the Continental Congress. 
 After three moves, this was supposed to be the new and improved setting for Rockingham, which Revolutionary War historians say is one of the most important and underappreciated relics from the nation's struggle for independence. Washington lived here for three months in 1783 and wrote the farewell address he gave to his army, an event that set him apart from Old World military men whose battlefield victories often led to a lifetime of institutionalized power. 
But after funding the recent $3 million move and restoration -- a project 10 years in the making -- the state abruptly pulled the second half of its grant earlier this year, citing its gargantuan budget deficit. The timing could not have been worse for the brittle structure, which had just been moved 2.2 miles from its previous home, a cramped parcel prone to the aftershocks from blasting at an adjacent quarry.
Although contractors had set the house on its new foundation, and although $50,000 was set aside by the state last week to stabilize the structure, the outstanding $1.8 million would have paid for a fully restored balcony, kitchen and roof, as well as electricity, plumbing and ventilation. By now, the museum should have been opened, drawing armies of schoolchildren to the 1,200 colonial-era exhibits now being stored in a $3,000-a-month warehouse in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. 
"This was supposed to be a step up for Rockingham but now it's in jeopardy of being lost forever," said Anne Wooley, a member of the Rockingham Association, a private group that has seen the house through a number of near-death experiences. "If only we could have looked into the future, we would have stayed where we were."
As she spoke, Ms. Wooley's fingers traced a series of cracks in the plaster that she said have widened over the winter and spring. Last week, volunteers bought an emergency generator for the house and installed dehumidifiers to help stanch damaging moisture.
"This is akin to a doctor prepping a patient for surgery, making the incision and then walking away," said James Farrell, the association president. "The procedure will prove fatal to the patient."
Preservationists and history buffs are dumbfounded by a bureaucratic decision that places a rare piece of American history in peril.
It was only last October that a bevy of politicians flocked here for the rededication, gathering under a great white tent as the Rev. Samuel Hugh Moffett, a descendant of Rockingham's 18th-century owners, offered a benediction that asked God to bless a house which "sheltered one of the greatest of thy gifts to our nation: our first president."
Eyes welled up as his words turned to the events of Sept. 11, five weeks earlier. "In a time of the falling of great towers," he said as an unexpected tempest pulled at the tent's moorings, "let this little treasure of a house stand strong, a symbol that we are still the land of the free and the home of the brave."
It is not that Rockingham has been singled out by Trenton. The Division of Parks and Forestry, which oversees historic sites, lost its entire $16.5 million capital budget for next year. By contrast, state funding for arts and culture was cut 10 percent. Most agencies were hit with reductions in the single digits.
Pat Huizing, executive director of New Jersey Preservation, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the fate of Rockingham and other landmarks reflects the state's ambivalence toward its past.
"We're just focused on the newest and the latest," she said. "But we're really missing the boat by neglecting our history. Heritage tourism is a terrific economic opportunity that is really being overlooked."
Until last week, a letter-writing campaign by Rockingham's defenders had little impact. But late Friday, after a reporter called the Department of Environmental Protection, the commissioner, Bradley M. Campbell, phoned to say his agency had decided to release $50,000 for emergency stabilization work. The rest of the money, he said, would have to wait for better economic times.
While Mr. Farrell was pleased to learn about the allocation, he said the money would not end Rockingham's precarious dispiriting state of limbo. Even if the worst deterioration is halted, the house will remain closed to the public for months, perhaps years.
"To have such a rich symbol of the freedoms we enjoy so neglected. . . ." he said, his voice trailing off. "After all the effort that was made, it's just a shame."

HEADLINE: Downturn and Shift in Population Feed Boom in White-Collar Crime 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 1 

 BODY:
The bursting of the stock market bubble, combined with the changing face of the American population, has led to a surge in business fraud and corruption prosecutions and investigations.
 Even as the rate of murder, robbery, assault and other types of violent and property crimes has declined or flattened in the last decade, there has been a marked increase in accounting and corporate infractions, fraud in health care, government procurement and bankruptcy, identity theft, illegal corporate espionage and intellectual property piracy, federal and state officials say. 
 With increasing frequency, white-collar corruption seems to be the crime of choice of the baby boom generation.
A week does not go by without news of investigations of blue-chip and start-up companies, the most prominent recently include Adelphia, Enron, Global Crossing, Kmart, Qwest Communications International, Schering-Plough, WorldCom and Xerox. Many of those companies' accounting firms are also facing intense scrutiny, perhaps most notably Arthur Andersen, which is in the middle of a criminal trial in Houston. 
Corporate corruption cases are inevitable during the trough of the boom-bust economic cycle, when disgruntled investors and company whistle-blowers work with prosecutors and the support of an outraged public to unveil the excesses of market euphoria. The phenomenon last occurred during the savings and loan crisis a decade ago, but it also happened after a wave of corporate scandals in the 1970's, and to a lesser extent during the Great Depression.
But this wave is different. Some statistics indicate that these fraud cases were actually on the rise during the boom cycle, and criminal law experts say that the nature and types of these crimes differ significantly from those of earlier periods.
And while the sociology of crime is imprecise, experts attribute that changing nature of crime to demographic shifts and economic forces.
"There have always been crooks, and Enron's chief executive hasn't gone to Sing Sing as the head of the New York Stock Exchange did in 1938," said Alfred D. Chandler Jr., the Pulitzer Prize-winning business historian at Harvard, referring to Richard Whitney, the patrician president of the exchange who went to prison wearing a three-piece suit for market abuses originated in the 1920's. "But there are critical differences between what we are seeing now and what we have seen earlier."
For one thing, technological advances like the Internet have contributed substantively to the rate of financial crime cases. Equally important, in the last decade demographic changes, like the aging and growing prosperity and education of the population, have played a role.
"What we are seeing in a variety of areas is fraud on the rise at the same time other crimes are going down," said Joseph T. Wells, a former F.B.I. agent and founder of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, which trains members of government, corporations and accounting firms in ferreting out fraud. "There are at least two reasons. Crime is largely a factor of age, and fraud is the crime of choice of the older perpetrator, so as the society ages, you have, and should continue to see, an increase in fraud cases.
"A second reason is that the education level of society has come up in the last 20 years, and the message is clear in the mind of the better-educated public that if you want to commit a crime, fraud is the way to go," he added. "The take is better, and the punishment generally is less."
Peter Goldmann, editor of White Collar Crime Reporter, a trade publication for lawyers and investigators, said, "White-collar crime is spinning through the roof. It's spinning new varieties daily and the incidence and amounts of money being stolen are incredible."
Some experts also point to changes in the way top executives are paid -- especially the proliferation of potentially valuable stock options -- that have created new and perverse incentives for senior executives to manipulate financial statements for their personal short-term gain.
"The temptations created by stock options are much greater for earnings manipulation," said Samuel L. Hayes III, an emeritus professor of investment banking at Harvard who sits on several corporate boards. "There are greater benefits that accrue to management." By contrast, Professor Hayes said, there were few prosecutions during the 1920's because few laws were available to prosecute the kinds of abuses that contributed to the Depression. "It was more of the Wild West," he said.
The government does not keep precise statistics on white-collar crime, primarily because there is a debate about what constitutes such crime, and general statutes prohibiting mail and wire fraud, perjury and obstruction of justice are used against corporate offenders as well as street criminals. Nonetheless, there are indicators of the trend beyond the daily drumbeat of headlines: 
*Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, reports that a record number of accounting and financial reporting cases have been opened in the first quarter of this year. Following the implosion of Enron last winter, the agency received a record number of tips from corporate insiders and investors about accounting and financial reporting violations at other companies. Inquiries have opened involving the large accounting firms and many of their clients, including Computer Associates International, Dynegy, Elan, Enterasys Networks, Halliburton, Kmart, Microsoft, Nvidia and WorldCom.
*Michael Chertoff, head of the criminal division at the Justice Department, says he has similarly seen a sharp spike in accounting and disclosure cases in recent months along with a general rise over the last few years in other kinds of white-collar cases ranging from health care fraud to theft of trade secrets.
Mr. Chertoff said that the biggest increases in investigations of possible accounting fraud have been in the telecommunications, software and energy areas and that violations appear to have been motivated by the "tremendous pressure to meet revenues and earnings projections."
Other Justice Department officials say bankruptcy fraud and whistle-blower lawsuits involving government fraud, like procurement fraud, have also been on the rise. 
*Criminal cases involving white-collar crime are often accompanied by civil actions brought by the government and private parties that are tracked by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, and they show a marked increase. While the number of federal civil lawsuits in the United States dropped from 1997 through Sept. 30, 2001 by 21,120, to 250,907, the number of government and private lawsuits for securities fraud and other types of financial violations more than doubled in the same period, rising to 3,538 from 1,669. Virtually every other type of civil lawsuit has dropped. 
*A whole new host of financial crimes has arisen with the proliferation of the Internet, from identity theft to software privacy and e-mail Ponzi schemes. Federal and state officials have responded by devoting teams of new investigators and prosecutors to combatting such abuses.
*Private groups report significant increases in areas like accounting fraud. Beyond the well-known cases involving large publicly traded companies, they say, there has been a sharp increase in frauds related to efforts to borrow money from banks and investors.
Because not every fraud is detected, it is hard to know whether there are more instances of fraud or the enforcement level is increasing, though experts say the heavier caseload is indicative of broader trends.
"While the statistics are hard to come by, we are seeing what appears to be bigger and more frequent frauds," said W. Steve Albrecht, associate dean at the Marriott School of Management at Brigham Young University. 
"People commit fraud because of three factors: financial pressure, the perception of an opportunity, and rationalizing it as O.K. This is the fraud triangle," he said. "All three of these elements have been increasing. Being at the down part of an economic cycle exacerbates the problem, but we were seeing a lot of it in the good times as well."

HEADLINE: David Cohen Is Dead at 80; Led Chain of Bargain Stores 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
David Cohen, who led John's Bargain Stores to the top rungs of discount retailing in the 1960's, died on Thursday at his home in Medford, N.Y. He was 80.
 The cause was lung cancer, his wife, Blanche, said. He also had a home in Delray Beach, Fla. 
 John's Bargain Store -- with its big red sign and white lettering -- was once a nearly ubiquitous presence in the New York metropolitan area, particularly in low-income sections. It grazed the low end of retailing, relying on paying cheap rent for locations few other retailers wanted, as well as on buying merchandise that could be startlingly inexpensive, often because the manufacturer had overestimated demand. 
"Give us your mistakes and we'll make them pay," was a company slogan. A company maxim was that the best places for stores were areas with few new automobiles but many used baby strollers.
At its peak in the mid-1960's, John's had 527 stores along the Eastern Seaboard and in Puerto Rico.
"Our plan is to blanket the United States with John's units and to ultimately have more stores in operation in this country than Woolworth's," Mr. Cohen said in an interview with Women's Wear Daily in 1964.
A Woolworth spokesman had said, "We wish them luck."
Three years later, John's was in full retreat, the victim of over-expansion, shoplifters and, most important, the yearlong absence of Mr. Cohen, who had nearly died in an automobile accident. In 1967, the company sought protection under federal bankruptcy laws. By the early 1970's, with new ownership, it had disappeared.
David Cohen, who always said his family was too poor for the luxury of middle names, was born on Sept. 2, 1921, at a hospital on Rockaway Beach. He was the fifth and totally unexpected child; his mother had thought she had a tumor. When she went to the hospital to have it treated, he was born, making him the only one in his family to be born in a hospital. 
His father, Harry, began as a peddler with a horse and wagon and moved on to running games of chance on the Rockaway Beach boardwalk. In winter, he would buy the merchandise of a company going out of business and rent a store to sell the goods.
This led to his getting his own store in South Ozone Park, Queens. For some reason, he named it John's, although there was no John in the family. People began calling it Cheap John's, partly because it was competing with two neighboring stores, Cheap Sam's and Cheap Charlie's.
Young David was needed to work in both his father's endeavors, and kept transferring from school to school. As a sixth grader, he dropped out to go to work full time.
In late August 1940, he had his first date with Blanche Schwartz, bringing along a shoebox model of the discount stores he hoped to open. They were married on Dec. 31 of that year.
Working with his siblings -- Benjamin, James and Stella -- David, as chairman and president, expanded their father's concept into more and more stores. Their father died in 1963 at 75.
At first, the children bought odd lots and surplus goods from manufacturers, but as the company grew, increased bargaining power let them order new products.
The company placed larger orders for single items than any other chain in America, ordering 250,000 dozen of an item at once.
After buying more cheaply, it also tried to sell more cheaply, or at least to undercut the competition. Its markup of 32 percent was 8 percentage points below that of most other stores. John's also routinely bought things out of season: after Christmas, it filled its bins with toys; ski caps were sold in the summer and swimming suits in winter. For customers, part of the fun was never knowing what they would find.
The company also economized by using newspaper ads that covered large numbers of stores, thereby cutting the cost per store. It accepted delivered orders at warehouses, meaning distributors did not have to make drops at individual stores.
But real estate was the most important factor. Mr. Cohen sought out locations that other stores considered unprofitable and then drove a hard bargain. He learned that former supermarkets were a good size, and also that supermarket owners who had moved to larger stores nearby often offered cheap rent to prevent another supermarket from opening.
A story he loved to tell involved the lawyer for a wealthy property owner who disapproved of renting to John's because he considered it declasse. The client overruled the lawyer, declaring that she was a faithful John's customer.
Mr. Cohen is survived by his wife; his brother, James, of Hollywood, Fla.; his sister, Stella Tobin of Lynbrook, N.Y.; his daughter, Shirley Schefter of Bellmore, N.Y.; his sons Howard of Oceanside, N.Y., and Allen of Maine; six grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.

PERSON: Flora Lewis 

HEADLINE: Flora Lewis, Astute Observer of World Affairs for The Times and Others, Dies at 79 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

 BODY:
Flora Lewis, a correspondent and columnist who explained international politics to readers of The New York Times and other publications for nearly 60 years, died early Sunday morning at her home in Paris. She was 79.
 The cause was cancer, said her son, Lindsey Gruson. 
 Heads of government and ordinary readers in the United States and Europe, where she lived for much of her career, looked to Flora Lewis's columns not only for her access to people in high places, but also for the dogged reporting and the sophisticated analysis that resulted. 
Much of her work, done when foreign policy was made by men who thought women had no place in the world of diplomacy, revealed deep knowledge of history inflected by the experience of living through some of the most turbulent events of an epochal century. 
She was in Eastern Europe in 1946 after the Communists took over, and she was there again for the Polish and Hungarian uprisings against Communism in 1956. 
"They had been called the 'captive nations' by the West," she wrote in one of her four books, "Europe: Road to Unity," published in 1992 by Simon & Schuster. "It was time to pull down the jail."
Polish Communists reacted to the uprising in their country by reinstating Wladyslaw Gomulka as party chief, defying threats of military intervention from Moscow. Gomulka had been jailed while Stalin was the Soviet leader. "It was the first time there had ever been a direct threat of confrontation between two Communist armies," Miss Lewis wrote of the events in Warsaw. "And it turned out to be the first time that Moscow backed down." 
Then, turning to another armed confrontation that devolved into tragedy in Hungary, she wrote: "Urgent appeals were broadcast to the Western countries for help. None came, only encouraging commentaries telling the overwhelmed Hungarians to keep up their struggle."
Soviet troops crushed Hungary's fight for freedom in 1956, but more than three decades later, in 1989, Miss Lewis witnessed the collapse of Communism there and all over the European Continent. 
"The new era starts now," she wrote in the Foreign Affairs column of The New York Times in 1990, after German unification emerged from the wreckage of the Communist empire. "The decisions being taken will hold for a long time, perhaps as long as the cold war lasted. This sense of novelty, of the fateful moment with all kinds of uncertain implications, accounts more for the unease, I think, than the behavior of Germany from Bismarck to 1945."
In 1980 Miss Lewis became the third in a line of foreign affairs columnists of The New York Times, following Anne O'Hare McCormick and C. L. Sulzberger, and held that position until the end of 1990. She remained a senior columnist of The Times until 1994, and after the newspaper ended that arrangement, she continued writing columns regularly for The New York Times Syndicate and The International Herald Tribune in Paris, right up to this spring. 
On the reporting trail or behind a typewriter -- she never learned to use a word processor, or wouldn't -- Miss Lewis was a formidable presence. Fiercely competitive, she would try to outthink and outwrite the competition on the job, and she could outdrink and outsmoke it off the job. No matter what the hour, her news antennae were always on. 
Miss Lewis began her newspaper career in 1942 with The Associated Press in New York and Washington. Over the decades, she worked in Europe and Latin America for European and American newspapers, including The Washington Post. Her first column was published and syndicated by Newsday in 1966. She joined The Times in 1972 as bureau chief in Paris and later became the paper's European diplomatic correspondent as well.
"This has always been a problem of mine, this tendency to spread myself too thin," Miss Lewis self-deprecatingly told Esquire magazine in 1980, after she had left reporting to be a columnist again. "I dabble. I'll write about a gastronomic binge, I'll write about NATO, I'll do an interview with Nureyev, I'll do a political piece. I don't know a hell of a lot about anything."
Her journalism won her many awards, including one for distinguished diplomatic reporting from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Affairs. She was also given honorary doctorates by the University of California at Los Angeles, Columbia, Princeton, Mount Holyoke, Bucknell, Muhlenberg and Manhattan Marymount.
Flora Lewis was born in Los Angeles on July 29, 1922, the daughter of Benjamin Lewis, a lawyer, and the former Pauline Kallin, a pianist. A precocious child, Flora graduated from high school at 15 and entered the University of California at Los Angeles. She earned a bachelor of arts degree three years later, in 1941, graduating summa cum laude and as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. 
After receiving a graduate degree at the Columbia University School of Journalism the following year, she became a reporter for The Associated Press. She worked in New York City for an Associated Press service aimed at British subscribers, later covering the Navy and State Departments in Washington until 1945, when the agency sent her to London.
There, in 1945, she married Sydney Gruson, a correspondent in The Times's London bureau. Over the next two decades, the couple worked -- for separate newspapers -- in London, Jerusalem, Prague, Warsaw, Geneva, Bonn, Paris and Mexico City. Her articles also appeared in many European publications, among them The Observer, The Economist and The Financial Times in London and France-Soir in Paris.
"I worked for everybody," she said, including The New York Times Magazine, but not for the newspaper itself. The Times's rules then barred her from being hired as long as her husband also worked there.
So in 1956, when Mr. Gruson was The Times's correspondent in Warsaw, Miss Lewis was hired by The Washington Post. Her extensive reporting of the Polish Communists' attempt to liberalize their government that year won her an Overseas Press Club award for best interpretation of foreign affairs. 
Later she reported from Bonn, Eastern Europe and London for The Post and in 1965 was chosen to open the paper's bureau in New York City. A year after that, Mr. Gruson was transferred to Paris to run the International Edition that The Times was publishing there. Miss Lewis went with him and began writing her syndicated column for Newsday, calling it "Today Abroad."
Newspapers were mostly a man's world, as shown by the way The New York Post announced that it was acquiring her column in 1967. "She can arrive home after a hectic day of reporting at the United Nations, and within minutes she's an excellent hostess and a marvelous companion to her husband," The Post reassured its readers. By that time, Miss Lewis and Mr. Gruson were the parents of three children. When asked how she managed both family and career, Miss Lewis would sometimes joke, "By neglecting both." 
For her column, Miss Lewis roamed the globe, reporting on the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and making five trips to Vietnam during the fighting there. "By the time I got to Vietnam," she said, "I found the battlefield stories no longer very interesting. I was tired of reading about bullets that whoosh and marines screaming in anguish, and I didn't want to write it yet again."
It was not until 1972, after she and Mr. Gruson separated, that she joined The Times. (They were later divorced.) The Times's executive editor, A. M. Rosenthal, who had said, "Flora is the world's greatest correspondent," named her to head the Paris bureau.
Mr. Gruson, who later became a senior executive of The Times and a member of its board of directors, died in 1998. Their daughter Sheila Gruson died in 1999. Miss Lewis is survived by her son, Lindsey Gruson, a former reporter for The Times who operates a marketing company, Stet Inc., in South Kent, Conn., and a daughter, Kerry Gruson, a member of The Times's bureau in Miami.
In a spacious apartment near the French Parliament, Miss Lewis, a stylish but conservative dresser with memorably blue eyes, entertained the political and journalistic elite of Paris for more than a quarter of a century.
Her first major assignment for The Times was the secret peace talks in Paris between Henry A. Kissinger and the North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho, which produced a short-lived cease-fire in Vietnam in 1973.
Mr. Rosenthal asked her in 1976 if she would become chief of the Washington Bureau in the event that another correspondent he had already asked, Hedrick Smith, turned down the job. If he had, Miss Lewis would have been the first woman in the post, but Mr. Smith accepted.
Miss Lewis was amused but also insulted by the overture. "It was as though he had said, 'If my fiancee jilts me at the altar, will you stand in?' " she later told Nan Robertson, a former Times reporter, who described the incident in a 1992 book, "The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and The New York Times" (Random House). 
Mr. Rosenthal, Miss Lewis learned later, was infuriated to find her quoted in the book. But the point she wanted to make was that, as she put it, "No man would ever have offered another man a job in that way." 
Instead, Mr. Rosenthal made Miss Lewis European diplomatic correspondent, assigning her to pull together "a whole range of subjects -- party and ideological trends, the Common Market, diplomatic initiatives." In that role she covered the emerging European Economic Community, now the European Union. "The salient fact about Europe remains the nation-state," she wrote in her book "Europe" in 1992. "There is a sense of shared Europeanness which has waxed and waned in the last two generations, but it is still secondary to the sense of unique nationality which began to arise after the Renaissance and the decline of feudalism." 
As she put it, "It is the same old Europe, and it changes every day."
Not long ago, recalling the years when she traveled the world as a correspondent and a columnist, she said: "There are stories you work on where you know this is really big, important history, and they are almost always bad news, disasters or tragedies. But covering President Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 was different -- there was an atmosphere of such joy and delight, both in Israel and in Egypt, that it was an inspiring experience."
"I've gone as far as Tokyo, Havana, Cape Town," she told Esquire in 1980. "I've spent almost my entire adult life abroad, and I find that in some ways I've become something of a foreigner myself. I keep telling myself that at some point I'd like to get over that."
Yet her columns had a distinctively American voice.
"The old idea was that history was about kings and popes and wars; people, yes, but only the few who held dazzling power," she wrote in her last regular column for The Times at the end of 1990. "More and more people are coming to realize that they can choose their history. What a wonderful time to have been able to watch up close!"

HEADLINE: Pentagon Official Seeks Support for Moderate Muslim Nations 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, June 1 

 BODY:
The Pentagon's second-in-command sought to rally support in Asia today for moderate Muslim nations and their people who find themselves "on the front lines of the struggle against terrorism."
 Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy defense secretary, said the United States and its allies in the region "have an obligation" and "a self-interest" to support tolerant Muslims who champion democratic practices. "When we help give them moral and material support against the opposition they encounter, we are indeed helping lay the foundation for peace," he said. 
 Speaking at the three-day Asia Security Conference here, Mr. Wolfowitz said the region's long-term stability rested on several pillars, including continued American engagement.
But Mr. Wolfowitz, a former ambassador to Indonesia, put special emphasis on strengthening ties with certain Muslim nations, including many in Asia, because "they represent some of the most moderate and tolerant traditions in Islam.
"These voices are essential to bridging the dangerous gap that now exists between the West and the Muslim world," said Mr. Wolfowitz, reprising a theme he first voiced publicly last month in Monterey, Calif.
But here on the other side of the Pacific, where nearly half of the world's one billion Muslims live, Mr. Wolfowitz's remarks carried added resonance. This tiny city-state has Malaysia and Indonesia as neighbors, two countries with huge Muslim populations that are both in the throes of combating terrorist cells.
As he did in the Monterey speech, Mr. Wolfowitz paid tribute to moderate Islamic countries like Turkey, Morocco and Jordan.
His speech today, delivered to more than 150 defense officials, legislators, academics, industry executives and journalists gathered by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, carried the cold-war echo of an ideological battle. "This larger war is a struggle against the enemies of tolerance and freedom, against the enemies of modernity and secularism, of pluralism and democracy, and real economic development," he said.
In the campaign against terror, many Asian allies have helped, he said. Japan has provided transport planes and has led the effort to mobilize reconstruction aid for Afghanistan. Australian commandos have fought in eastern Afghanistan. New Zealand has provided logistical support. The region has overcome historical animosities and complex territorial disputes, he said.
While Mr. Wolfowitz did not lay out the detailed, long-term American strategy for Asia that some experts had hoped for, he offered suggestions of how some areas might evolve.
For example, Mr. Wolfowitz provided a relatively upbeat assessment of how an increasingly powerful China could play a positive role in the region. "We can be much more hopeful of a positive outcome in China's case because all of the countries of the region are prepared to welcome a strong Chinese role in a constructive regional order," he said.
Mr. Wolfowitz said that he and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had discussed several defense-related issues with Vice President Hu Jintao of China at the Pentagon recently. Those talks produced an agreement to send Peter W. Rodman, an assistant secretary of defense, to Beijing this month to discuss increased military-to-military contacts.

HEADLINE: BRIEFING: STATE FINANCES; 
GROWING DEFICIT

BYLINE:  By Karen DeMasters 

 BODY:
 The state's financial problems got even worse last week as John E. McCormac, the state treasurer, announced that declining tax revenues in April have put another $589 million hole in the budget for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30. The state has already closed a $2.9 billion budget gap for this fiscal year. The readjusted deficit will require the use of $400 million from the state surplus, an additional $64 million in budget cuts and $125 million borrowed from the Unemployment Insurance Fund before the end of the month, Mr. McCormac said.

HEADLINE: Global Education: Reach Ever Higher 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Amartya Sen is correct to point out the value of basic education to economic and human development ("To Build a Country, Build a Schoolhouse," Op-Ed, May 27). The United Nations' goal of achieving universal basic education, though important, is not ambitious enough. 
 Secondary education is also essential if the benefits that Professor Sen describes, particularly for young women, are to be realized. Evidence shows that secondary education postpones the age of marriage and provides young women with better knowledge of their bodies and the importance of family planning.
Secondary education also provides young women with advanced skills necessary for narrowing gender gaps in the labor force. More study is necessary to identify thresholds at which additional years of education translate into specific health, economic and demographic benefits. 
The American Academy of Arts and Sciences is assembling an international team of experts to undertake this work. But we know enough to be sure that secondary education should not be neglected.

An Idea, at Least, Amid the Job Hunting

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
"YOU work your whole life in this city, filling out your taxes and voting, and when you need help, you don't get it."
 Those words belong to Carmen Torres, who spent 22 years working as a clerk on Wall Street beofre being laid off last fall. She has not been able to find another job, and fears that her unemployment insurance benefits may have just run out.
 You'll hear the same said refrain from Milind Shah, a former dot-commer whose benefits will run out in two months. And from Clayre Scheiweis, who until October had been working in New York City for El Al, the Israeli airline. And from Orlando Godoy, Rene Sauve, Sultan A. Salim and James S. Johnson, all of whom worked at Windows on the World, none of whom has been able to find a new job. 
 All of them want, quite desperately, to be employed. Failing that, they would like another couple of months of unemployment benefits, which will start running out in two weeks for thousands of New Yorkers.
 And so all of these jobless workers, and hudreds of others, have joined the New York Unemployment Project, a nonprofit group that is trying to persuade state officials to give the jobless 13 more weeks of unemployment benefits, an idea that does not seem to be on Albany's radar right now.
 Jonathan Rosen, the director of the project, said that such an extension would cost about $23 million, which he contends could probably be covered by money already in the state unemployment insurance trust fund.
 Unemployment insurance typically runs for a maximum of 26 weeks, but in March, Presiden Bush authorized a federal financed 13-week extension. Right now, more than 230,000 New Yorkers from across the state are collecting extended benefits, according to the New York State Department of Labor.
 The whole point of unemployment insurance is to tide over unemployed workers until they can find new jobs. But right now, there are an awful lot of unemployed people, and a lot fewer jobs than ust a year ago.
 About 263,000 people in New York City are actively looking for work, a 43 percent increase from a year ago, according to the labor department. The unemployment rate in the city has zoomed to 7.7 percent, from 5.5 percent a year ago.
 Meanwhile, there are now about 107,000 fewer jobs int he city than a yea ago, according to a govenment survey of employers. The biggest losses have been in business services (Mr. Shah, the computer expert); brokerage firms (Ms. Torres, the Wall Street clerk); air transportation (Ms Schneiweis, the airline worker), and food service (the Windows on the World crew).
 Sitting in the unemployment proect's office on the Avenue of the Americas last week, thse jobless workers described the frustrations of their fruitless hunts for work. All have been attending job fairs, which entails standing in lines for hours to watch their resumes disappear into huge stacks. At least one is living off credit cards; others are borrowing from family and friends.
 Mr. Sauve, who is 59 and lives in Manhattan, says he has given out 200 resumes, and has even had some phone interviews. "But the minute I show up and they see how old I am. ..." he said, shrugging. "I tell you, if I didn't have a rent-controlled apartment, I'd be homeless."
 Ms. Schneiweis, who is 49 and lives in Queens, is getting by on her unemployment and the money she got from selling her two-yuear-old Honda. "I'm willing to start at entry level, but they won't take you," she said.
 Things aren't much better for younger workers like Mr. Shah, 27, who says that he has given out resumes and canvassed his friends and connections to try to find a ob. "But most of my connections are unemployed, too," he said, adding that his wife still has a job, "so I won't be out on the street, but it's very scary."
 Tell that to Mr. Salim, 36, whose family includes his 2-year-old daughter and elderly father. When his benefits run out in about a month, he said, "I have no idea what I'm going to do."
 Mr. Johnson, 43, is taking computer classes, but still longs for his old "sweet job" as a bartender at Windows. He still has a card in his wallet from the restaurant, where at least 70 workers died. And while he's sad and angry that he and so many of his co-workers are still unemployed, he reminds the others that "some of them are not here to complain."

HEADLINE: The Nation: African Genesis; 
Flirting With Free Markets

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia 

 BODY:
AFTER the horrific human suffering and wrenching transitions that have accompanied Africa's passage through colonialism, the cold war, brutal regional conflicts and the ravages of AIDS, the continent is starting to face another, potentially more positive challenge: how to become part of the global economy.
 In many ways, Africa is the final frontier for market-based capitalism. The American-style doctrine of free trade, flexible workers and respect for the power of international financial markets has already spread, with varying degrees of success and support, from the richest nations into Southeast Asia, Latin America and the states of the former Soviet Union. It is even sowing seeds in China. 
 For decades, Africa has been a bystander. Following the independence movements of the 1960's and 70's, many African nations had barely functioning economies and subsisted largely on handouts and loans from Europe, the United States and Japan. The continent's only consistent exports were oil and coffee, both of which were subject to destabilizing price swings. 
Corruption was rampant. Natural resources like diamonds became the object of violent struggles. Sub-Saharan Africa's only industrialized economy, South Africa, was isolated by anti-apartheid sanctions.
Many of those problems remain acute. And even in countries that are enjoying peace and relative political stability, poverty is still crushing. Ethiopia's annual economic output per person is about $100, the lowest in the world among countries that try to measure such things and just over a fifth the average for sub-Saharan Africa. Its rate of infant mortality is nearly 30 percent higher than in the other poor nations of Africa.
But a growing number of African nations have the luxury of shifting their attention from mere survival to trying to create jobs and wealth, a process that since the collapse of Communism has tended to go hand in hand with the spread of democracy. As they make that transition, they are in many cases abandoning their assumption that aid from wealthy nations is the solution and are looking for a toehold in an unforgiving global marketplace that tempts, intimidates and frustrates them.
The developmental economist Jeffrey D. Sachs said the most likely centers of growth for Africa were the big coastal cities like Accra, Ghana; Abidjan, Ivory Coast; Dakar, Senegal; and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. He and other economists said the turning point would come when Africa could start attracting foreign investment, of which it currently gets but a trickle.
To move beyond its reliance on agriculture, economists say, Africa will ultimately have to do what other developing regions of the world have done and build a base of manufacturing around its low labor costs, luring jobs away from the developed and more-advanced developing nations.
Only a few decades ago, many African nations were Soviet clients with planned economies. In a sign of how ideology is being turned topsy-turvy, Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi -- a former Marxist rebel -- scolded the United States and Europe last week for failing to live up to their own free-market principles just when Africa was heeding their call to begin integrating with the global economy.
SPEAKING to the African Development Bank the day before the arrival here of Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and the rock star Bono, who were visiting Africa on a fact-finding tour, Mr. Meles said it was "clearly and blatantly hypocritical" for the United States to have enacted legislation this spring that raises subsidies for domestic farmers. By granting them a further cost advantage through such subsidies, he said, both Europe and the United States were undermining Ethiopia's efforts to lift itself out of poverty by exporting agricultural products.
It was a message that Mr. O'Neill also heard in Ghana, Uganda and South Africa over the last two weeks. Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni, said his country was ready and willing to move beyond a relationship with the rich nations built on what amounts to welfare in return for a fair shot at selling its goods in the world's biggest markets, including the United States.
"The relationship has been parasitic," Mr. Museveni said after meeting with Mr. O'Neill last week. "The relationship is now becoming symbiotic."
When asked about an issue that Bono has worked hard to promote, further cancellation of debts owed by the poorest nations to the richest, Mr. Museveni said that it would be helpful but that only access to international markets would allow Uganda to replicate the kind of growth that developing nations like South Korea began achieving in the 1960's.
But in making the comparison to South Korea, Mr. Museveni raised another question that both African and American officials are just starting to talk about: What brand of capitalism should Africa pursue as it wades into global competition?
Even the biggest proponents of market forces say it could be a mistake to impose the American model wholesale on Africa. "We have to be very careful in what we do in the United States not to be cavalier in saying, 'Just be like us and everything will be O.K.,' " Mr. O'Neill said.
Africans sometimes look more to Asia than to the United States in thinking about how to advance their development plans. The model for development in much of Asia has included heavy government involvement in nurturing industries and companies that could become globally competitive and stimulate job growth. But the Asian model has had problems of its own. It was only four years ago that a financial crisis that started in Thailand spread through most of Asia and ultimately around the world. And Japan's success was built in part on protectionism that would not be tolerated by today's world trading system.
MR. MUSEVENI said blind faith in the market -- or in any other economic doctrine -- would be foolish for African leaders, who are grappling with legacies and immediate problems that are almost unimaginable in the developed world. "The whole evolution of economic thought in 500 years shows that pure models always run into problems," Mr. Museveni said. "The market has to be the decisive arm of the economy, but government has to be stimulative and assistive."
Then there is the question of whether unfettered markets can create jobs and hope quickly enough that people in developing countries will be willing to put up with the ugly side of capitalism, including the exploitation of low-wage labor.
There is also a heated debate over whether governments have an obligation to put sorely needed spending on health and education ahead of the fiscal austerity often demanded by the International Monetary Fund and other development groups as a sign of commitment to reform. "O'Neill and the conservatives stress only the market solutions," Mr. Sachs said, "without understanding or acknowledging the urgent social investments that need to accompany any economic reform program." 
Uganda's finance ministry is embroiled in a dispute with the health ministry over whether the economy would be harmed if the country got a big infusion of foreign money to help battle AIDS. The finance ministry's thinking, which was dismissed by Mr. O'Neill as ridiculous, is that a wave of foreign money to help limit the AIDS epidemic would drive up the value of the currency and make Uganda's exports less competitive -- and that Uganda might therefore have to consider turning down the money.
But the fact that the dispute is taking place at all is a sign of how the economic message fed to African leaders by the rich nations is being taken so seriously that it is sometimes taken to extremes. Whether Africa can ultimately get the balance right -- and get the right kind and amount of American support -- will go a long way toward determining whether hundreds of millions of Africans will ever see a brighter future.

Blame Game

BYLINE:  By William Safire 

 BODY:
'Playing the Blame Game" was the headline in Newsweek about the furor over pre-Sept. 11 warnings of potential terrorist attacks. The same week's issue of Time featured an article by an anonymous F.B.I. man headed "An Agent Speaks Out Against the 'Blame Game."'
 Senator Hillary Clinton of New York, just before saying "I and others are raising legitimate questions" about the "Bush Knew" headline in The New York Post, was careful to say she did not "favor people who jump to conclusions, point fingers, play the blame game." 
 This followed an exchange between Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and the White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, which concluded with Senator Feinstein clearly illustrating the pejorative nature of the rhyming compound noun: "It is my hope that the administration and Congress can work together to solve the critical security problems facing our nation, rather than playing the blame game." Obviously, working together is positive and blame-gaming is negative. 
What is this new national pastime? Who thrust it on the political scene and when?
The coiner -- or at least, the political popularizer -- was President Ronald Reagan in a television address to the nation on Oct. 14, 1982. He had been accused of not doing enough to stop the rise in unemployment and counterattacked in strength: "The pounding economic hangover America is suffering from didn't come about overnight, and there's no single, instant cure. In recent weeks, a lot of people have been playing what I call the 'blame game."'
Note the placement of quotation marks in the text and the assertion of authorship of "what I call." Reagan, as a coiner should, immediately provided the word-picture that made the meaning clear: "The accusing finger has been pointed in every direction of the compass, and a lot of time and hot air have been spent looking for scapegoats."
James Reston of The New York Times knew a catchy phrase when he saw one and titled his next column "The Blame Game." He blazed back: "The president's speech was a clever and brilliant example of 'the blame game' he deplored. . . . The whole thrust of it was to avoid responsibility for the economic recession and unemployment, and to blame the Democrats in particular and the tragedy of history in general."
The trick in playing the game, as this illustrates, is to play to win by denouncing the playing of it by the other side, thus associating oneself with a voter's self-deluding self-image as a reasonable and nonpartisan person who hates bickering. The astute player of the blame game thereby avoids the easily seen-through paraleipsis of "I refuse to get down in the gutter with my opponent by reminding you of his prior convictions as --" etc. 
Finger-pointing Senator Clinton was quoted above as looking with disfavor on "people who jump to conclusions, point fingers. . . . "
Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, agreed with that noble concept, telling Wolf Blitzer on CNN, "We do have to pull together and not point fingers."
The finger referred to in this metaphor is neither the wagging finger of the scold nor the lickin' finger of the taster; it is the pointing finger of the accuser. In current use, and especially in its sense of "the action taken in a blame game," the figure of speech most often used is a compound gerund.
Only five weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, Time magazine headlined "U.S. Intelligence: Let the Finger-Pointing Begin." This used the locution in a rare positive sense, as an activity to be encouraged. Last month, however, the same magazine returned to the more frequently used derisive sense: "Behind All the Finger-Pointing."
In its literal sense, the phrase is tracked by the O.E.D. to Charles Whitehead's 1842 novel, "Richard Savage: A Romance of Real Life": "There was my devilish mother in a side-box, gay and giggling, finger-pointing." The metaphoric extension -- to the meaning of "accusing, often unfairly" -- is tougher to find. Fred Shapiro of Yale, compiling the hungrily awaited Yale Dictionary of Quotations, has dug up this citation from a 1941 Social Forces magazine, in which Northerners are excoriated for pointing self-righteously at the South for its lynchings while segregation and race riots take place in the North: "This finger-pointing is not only unnecessary, but false."

DOT-CON
What does a gestalt-driven columnist have to do to fit blame game with finger-pointing to reveal a linguistic pattern in the coverage of the pre-Sept. 11 intelligence failures? The only applicable cliche: I must connect the dots.
Interviewing Vice President Dick Cheney on Fox News last month, Tony Snow asked, "Why didn't we connect the dots?" Later on in the same program, Mara Liasson, a reporter, observed: "Everybody has said we had a lot of information. . . . We couldn't connect the dots. What are the dots?" In The Washington Post, Mary McGrory noted the brush-fire use of the phrase: "Ashcroft does not connect the dots, as we say all the time now."
The origin appears to be in a game run in newspapers early in the 20th century, based on a children's game played long before. A field of apparently random dots is displayed and numbered, and the dots are joined by the player in numerical order. Sometimes, clues to running lines between the dots are given below. As the game is played, the short lines begin to take the shape of an object, and lo! A pattern or image leaps up from the page.
"In the analysis of intelligence data," an unrevealable source tells me, "bits of disparate information are assembled in files, or computerized, or just laid out on a table. The analyst must grade the fragments for reliability, specificity and importance, and then -- in what is sometimes an intuitive leap -- see a pattern begin to form, with gaps of intelligence that the analyst requests be filled in by elint electronic intelligence or humint human intelligence, clandestinely obtained . Outsiders call this connecting the dots." What do the spooks inside Langley call it? "Can't say. Somebody would connect the dots."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
A Little Bit Of Inflation Could Go A Long Way

BYLINE:  By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
EVERYBODY knows it's possible to have too much of a good thing. Too much rich food leads to indigestion; too many e-mail messages can drive you to the delete button.
 The same is true of the Federal Reserve's long crusade to eliminate inflation from the American economy. That campaign, begun courageously by Paul Volcker in 1979 when prices were spiraling higher at double-digit rates and carried on brilliantly by Alan Greenspan over the last 15 years, is one of the great success stories of economic policy, helping to lay the foundation for much of the prosperity of recent years. 
 But enough is enough.
The danger is not just that the economy could fall into a deep deflationary pit, as it did in the Depression or as Japan's economy is doing today. The Fed will do everything in its power to prevent that. The more subtle risk is from the conventional view -- particularly among bond market vigilantes -- that zero inflation is the ideal and should be pursued without question. That stern attitude blocks the modest upward creep in the overall price level that is needed to properly grease the wheels of commerce.
Some Fed officials, even those long identified with a hawkish anti-inflationary stance, have begun to recognize this danger.
"I always think of myself as pretty resolute when it comes to inflation," Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in a mid-May talk. "But perhaps a little bit of inflation," he added, "is a little bit safer than zero."
William McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was even more explicit about his willingness to tolerate a small amount of inflation. Not long ago, when consumer price inflation was running at 1.4 percent, he said, "If that's not price stability, what is?"
This unusually candid talk, coming from central bankers inculcated by their own code of silence never to say a kind word about inflation, is a positive sign. But even an inflation rate somewhat higher than today's would be nothing to fear. Indeed, it would be welcome.
Already, inflation, by just about every important indicator, is low and headed lower.
"One is a lovely number," James Glassman, senior economist at J. P. Morgan Securities, wrote in a recent report. "Most measures of inflation have eased into a range that brackets 1 percent annually. Only the core C.P.I. inflation rate stands apart from the crowd of inflation measures, but it too is easing slightly from last year's 2.7 percent."
With inflation so low, however, prices for most goods are still falling. The only signs of price increases are in housing and in services, particularly for medical services where past gains from managed care are beginning to erode. As a result, corporate profits in many sectors remain depressed, retarding the revival of investment needed to sustain a healthy economic recovery.
It is important to remember that a market economy works through price fluctuations that respond to changes in supply and demand. In the absence of inflation, the only way to signal relative differences across the full range of goods and services is for some prices to fall in absolute terms even as others are rising.
A modicum of inflation allows this price signaling to occur without squeezing so many producers to cut prices. As long as the central bank does not allow it to get out of control, this kind of modest upward price movement creates an environment more conducive to economic growth than a determination to squelch inflation at all cost.
FORTUNATELY for the economy, Fed officials are recognizing that overall price stability is not an unalloyed virtue. "Policy actions," said Myles Zyblock, a Brown Brothers Harriman economist, "appear to have shifted from one of restraining price increases to reflating demand."
And with inflation tame, Mr. Glassman said, "the Fed will have little fear of allowing the economy to regain its stride."
What's good for the economy, though, will probably not help the stock market regain its vitality. Indeed, perhaps the greatest single prop underlying the almost uninterrupted market boom of 1980's and 90's was the secular decline in interest rates that accompanied disinflation. Not only did corporate profits rise sharply, but investors found it easy to value stocks at unprecedented multiples to earnings.
That movement has now run its course. "A flattening-out of inflation trends," Mr. Zyblock wrote in a recent investment report, "suggests that the up trend in price-to-earnings ratios that began in the early 1980's is over."
But don't cry for your lost investment gains. Given a choice, a thriving Main Street beats a swaggering Wall Street anytime.

HEADLINE: What If Investors Won't Join the Party? 

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
BY many measures, the United States economy is rebounding smartly from its desultory performance in late 2001. But even as economic output surges and corporate profits appear once more to be rising, one closely watched indicator of economic oomph remains depressed: the broad stock market indexes. All of the big-company indexes, the ones that reflect what investors are most likely to own through mutual funds, are still down for the year. 
 Because stocks normally begin to rise well before evidence of an economic recovery drives up to the door, many investors are baffled by the fact that the market is in reverse. And they are angry, after already enduring two years of losses in the major indexes. 
 Stocks may bounce back during the summer, of course, as investors gain their footing in unstable times. Indeed, on Friday, stocks rose slightly after the University of Michigan monthly consumer confidence report showed confidence rising in May to its highest level since December 2000. 
But if stocks remain stuck in their underlying slump, consumers may rein in their spending, which would damage a fragile economic recovery. Even more ominous, if investors shun stocks for a prolonged period, companies will find it much more difficult and costly to raise the capital they need to expand their operations and increase revenue and profits. That possibility is worrying leaders of corporate America.
"The fundamental issue we're dealing with is uncertainty," said Samuel J. Palmisano, president and chief executive of I.B.M. "It is both geopolitical uncertainty in the aftermath of Sept. 11 and the war on terrorism, and market uncertainty in reaction to the flame-out of the dot-coms and Enron."
That instability is depressing business investment and weighing down the stock market, Mr. Palmisano said. Investors are not only focusing on fundamentals like a company's ability to generate cash, he explained, but they are also demanding sound strategy, skilled management and by-the-book accounting from companies. "It is incumbent on business leadership to demonstrate that," Mr. Palmisano said, "so our credibility will not be questioned." 
Terrorist threats and fears about the possibility of nuclear war between Pakistan and India have definitely added to market jitters. A decline in the value of the dollar may be hurting stock prices because it encourages foreign investors to repatriate some funds they have held in dollar-denominated assets like stocks. And what looked like a recovering economy early in the year may falter over the summer or fall, causing what economists call a recessionary double dip. 
But another factor weighing on stock prices may not be as evident as tensions in South Asia and the Middle East yet is every bit as menacing to investors. This is investors' growing sense of mistrust in the nation's capital markets and the role they play in helping to generate growth and prosperity. 
The steady stream of accounting scandals, corporate chicanery and questionable practices at Wall Street firms is taking a toll on investor confidence -- and that has major implications for the stock market as a whole. 
Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier and former American ambassador to France, says investors' belief in the integrity of the financial markets has been severely damaged in the last year. 
"Our system of market capitalism requires a high level of Protestant ethic," he said. "You need a regulatory system on one hand and a very strong ethic on the other, and within those guideposts you can let the market hopefully promote growth and wealth creation. But if either the regulatory or ethical base begins to erode, then you've got some real problems. And I think that is where we are right now." 
NOT all stocks are down, by any means. Shares of medium-sized companies have been strengthening, perhaps reflecting a belief among investors that because these companies were more obscure, their managements did not feel the need to resort to aggressive accounting to meet or beat their financial forecasts and prop up their stocks. The Standard & Poor's midcap index of 400 companies is up 4 percent since the beginning of the year.
But larger stocks -- and the investors who own them -- have definitely felt the pain. The S.& P. 500 has lost 7 percent of its value this year while the Dow Jones industrial average is flat. The Nasdaq composite, where many investors have been hit hardest, has lost 17.2 percent of its value and is trading 68 percent below its 2000 peak. 
With returns like these, it is perhaps not surprising that the number of investors who say that now is a good time to invest has dropped to levels not recorded since September 2001, according to the investor optimism poll conducted monthly by UBS and Gallup. 
The results of the May poll also indicate where investors think the market is most vulnerable. Their largest concern is dubious accounting practices: 84 percent feel that this issue is punishing stock prices, ranking it ahead of conflict in the Middle East and terrorism. Almost two-thirds of those polled say conflicts of interest between brokerage firms' research departments and investment banking activities are hurting the investment climate. 
The poll results also show how much damage the Enron eruption has done to investor confidence. Nearly three-quarters of investors surveyed -- 71 percent -- said they believe questionable accounting practices are widespread in business, up from 62 percent in February. 
As a result, 40 percent of the 1,002 investors responding to the poll say they are less likely to invest in stocks or mutual funds. That figure was 34 percent in February.
It appears unlikely that investor confidence will jump anytime soon. Jason Trennert, managing director and investment strategist at the I.S.I. Group, a brokerage firm in New York, said regulatory investigations into the business practices of brokerage firms were a cloud over the industry that was not going away. 
"You're going to continue to see things coming out every day that question how Wall Street does business, and that is not helpful for investor confidence," he said. "Longer term, reforms will be positive to the extent that it will make investors more confident, but the investigations will be a heavy headwind for investor confidence." 
Judging from the e-mail messages he has received recently from investors, David M. Blitzer, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's, said investors appeared deeply frustrated today.
"In the scandals of the last year, a few people have gotten rich and most investors have gotten poorer," Mr. Blitzer said. "I think they want a sense that it is a fair game and that everybody has an equal chance to win or lose. People seem to feel that for the matter to be settled, somebody is going to have to go to jail." 
Mr. Blitzer said he is amazed at the number of investors who have stayed in the market throughout the crashing fall of the Internet and telecommunications stocks and, now, almost daily reports of fresh accounting fiascos at big public companies. He fears that if significant changes are not made to restore investor confidence, many will drift away from stocks. 
Volume figures show that this drift has begun, at least among individual investors. While trading volume is still high on the New York Stock Exchange, average daily trades at Charles Schwab in April came in at 192,900, down from 235,000 a year earlier. In March 2000, when the market peaked, Schwab clients conducted 420,100 trades daily.
Mitchell H. Caplan, president of the E*Trade Group, characterized many of his firm's customers -- particularly those with more than $100,000 in investable assets -- as frozen. "People are trying to figure out what to do and more often than not they are going to cash," he said. 
James B. Stack, president of InvesTech Research in Whitefish, Mont., recently returned from the Las Vegas Money Show, a four-day conference where purveyors of investment information make presentations to individual investors. Mr. Stack met hundreds of investors at the show and has concluded that most of them are only now beginning to realize that the $5 trillion they have lost in stocks is not coming back anytime soon, if ever.
"What was lost in paper wealth was real money," Mr. Stack said. "It may not have been booked profits in investor portfolios, but it was perceived as retirement funds. The pain of today is going to evolve into anger; unfortunately, along the way comes mistrust. They're asking: 'Who's telling us the truth? Who's giving us the real numbers?' "
One measure of wealth noted by Moody's Investors Service shows how much poorer consumers are today than they were just two years ago. In the first quarter of this year, real liquid financial assets per worker were down an estimated 24 percent from the high of early 2000. Americans are still 36 percent wealthier than they were from 1991 through 1995, but the recent decline is troubling nonetheless. 
"Real wealth might seem ample compared to its historical trend," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's. "But an extended slide by equity prices could be damaging. Consumer confidence would suffer, and businesses would be less inclined to pursue expansion amid slumping equities. Declining share prices would curb both capital spending and hiring activity."
PERHAPS reflecting their fears about investment prospects, consumers are less confident about the possibilities for income growth than they have been in recent years. In a recent confidence report cited by Moody's, tracking the first five months of 2002, only 21 percent of respondents expect higher incomes in six months. That is below the 25.7 percent average from 1996 to 2000 and below the 23.9 percent of a year ago. 
The trouble with the current market malaise may come down to this: While nobody wants a frightened investor class, few think that its suspicions or frustrations are irrational. "As the average investor learns more about the shenanigans that went on, he is going to get mad and he has every right to be mad," Mr. Stack said. "You hate to see it because the small investor is paying the steepest price, not because they lost the most but because they lost the greatest amount of what they could not afford to lose."

HEADLINE: Wary of Risk, Slow to Adapt, F.B.I. Stumbles in Terror War 

BYLINE:  By DAVID JOHNSTON and DON VAN NATTA Jr.; Lowell Bergman, Carl Hulse, Neil A. Lewis and Jo Thomas contributed to this report.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 1 

 BODY:
When the director of the F.B.I., Robert S. Mueller III, acknowledged on Wednesday that the agency had missed warning signals on terrorism, he stunned many Americans. But his statement was not news to some veterans of the agency -- or lawmakers who now say they treated the F.B.I. with too much deference for too many years. 
 These officials say the F.B.I., despite efforts to strengthen its counterterrorism programs over the last decade, and despite hefty increases in its budget, never developed a nimble enough structure, analytic capability or sense of mission to foil terrorist plots before they were carried out. 
 Interviews with nearly two dozen current and former F.B.I., Justice Department and intelligence officials, many of them at a senior level, suggest that Mr. Mueller faces many hurdles in fulfilling his promise to transform the agency's rigid, risk-averse culture into the kind of terror prevention agency he foresees. Some officials even question whether the bureau can be salvaged, or whether it should be broken apart so that the government can create a domestic intelligence agency separate from the F.B.I. 
"There's got to be follow-through on this reorganization," said Robert S. Bryant, a former deputy F.B.I. director. "This isn't a law enforcement issue. We are at war. We've got to get more information. There has to be discipline to stay at it and pull it all together from the F.B.I. and other sources in the government." 
In announcing the reorganization this past week, Mr. Mueller said the bureau would hire 400 more analysts, including 25 officers to be borrowed from the Central Intelligence Agency. He also announced plans to establish "flying squads" of terrorism experts based at F.B.I. headquarters, who would feed intelligence to field offices. 
In an interview today, Mr. Mueller said the changes would vastly enhance the F.B.I.'s ability to thwart terrorists. He offered no assurance that the bureau would ever eliminate all terrorist threats.
Still, he said his reorganization proposal -- unlike past restructuring efforts -- had a better chance of success because the hijackings drove home the realization that change cannot wait.
"It's a combination of circumstances, but I'm certain that Sept. 11 has had a dramatic effect on every member of the F.B.I. to do everything we can to prevent any additional terrorist attacks," he said. "So there is an openness and willingness to change and a new understanding of the threats we face in the future."
Agents realize, Mr. Mueller said, that the old criteria for success within the F.B.I. no longer apply.
"We've come to understand that we are not going to be judged in the future by how many successful prosecutions we have of terrorists, but will be judged by our capacity to prevent additional terrorist attacks," he said. "It's picking up information that may assist in preventing terrorist attacks and moving it to where it can help."
Hiring hundreds more agents, analysts and linguists may be the easiest fix. Far more difficult, many officials say, is the challenge of remaking the F.B.I.'s dysfunctional bureaucracy.
"Twenty-five years ago, the thought was you had to tame down the F.B.I., they were out of control," one retired senior F.B.I. official said.
"But in the last 15 years, we have become a very docile, don't-take-any-risks agency, particularly at headquarters. And if you make a mistake and it blows up in your face, then your career is shot, because basically it's one strike and you are out of the F.B.I. All that has to change."
One indicator of the paralytic fear of risk-taking was how F.B.I. headquarters responded to the memorandum written last July by an agent from Phoenix. The agent, Kenneth J. Williams, urged a broad survey of American aviation schools based on his concern that Middle Eastern men, possibly connected to Osama bin Laden, were training at a flight school in Arizona.
But officials at headquarters rejected his proposal. Mr. Mueller has said that the plan was deferred for lack of resources. But other officials pointed to another reason: the worry that such an effort might be criticized in Congress as racial profiling. Mr. Williams's idea died, until after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The problems have been apparent for years. In 1999, the chief of the F.B.I.'s counterterrorism unit, Dale Watson, concluded that too few agents around the country were working to thwart terrorism. In March 2000, he convened a meeting at headquarters of the agents in charge of all 56 field offices. Some agents called the meeting "Terrorism 101" or "Terrorism for Dummies." 
Mr. Watson and other senior officials were startled to learn how little some bureau offices around the country, operating independently of headquarters, had done to investigate terrorism.
Even after the meeting, in the months before Sept. 11, senior agents at headquarters were reduced to repeatedly cajoling the special agents in charge of the field offices to work harder on counterterrorism inquiries. They even threatened to withhold managers' raises and bonuses if they did not pay more attention to the problem.
Beyond the issue of whether the agency can fix itself is a political question.
Will Mr. Mueller, a former United States attorney, and his top deputies maintain the support of the Bush administration, particularly in the face of skeptical Congressional inquiries into what they knew and when they knew it in the weeks and months before Sept. 11?
The F.B.I.'s current state -- so unready, so unprepared and so unable to assess the accumulating warning signs of the hijackings -- is the result of years of neglect by the successors to J. Edgar Hoover, who ran the agency for 48 years. Each director missed repeated opportunities to change a law enforcement agency that many critics believe was better suited to catching criminals of the Bonnie and Clyde era than trying to prevent crimes plotted by Osama bin Laden's terrorism network.
Current and former F.B.I. agents have long believed that one of the bureau's great weaknesses is its failure to properly analyze the immense amount of information that it collects, and to share it among its field offices. That, too, must change, former agents say.

Counterterrorism
Warnings of Danger And a Step Not Taken
The sweltering day in September 1993 that Louis J. Freeh was sworn in as director of the F.B.I. was triumphal. The agency had just emerged from one of the most wrenching periods in its history -- marked by the fatal confrontations at Ruby Ridge, in Idaho, and the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex. Now a former F.B.I. agent was taking over an agency that in the years after Hoover had been managed, and in some ways mismanaged, by outsiders.
Finally, agents in the field could look at their new boss as one of their own.
Eight years later, when Mr. Freeh stepped down, a stewardship that had begun in hope and jubilation ended in frustration. By the time he retired in the summer of 2001, Mr. Freeh had become the most powerful director since Hoover, but he left the F.B.I. badly damaged.
Lawmakers in both parties clamored for change at an agency they attacked as ineptly managed, resistant to change and unwilling to admit mistakes. Mr. Freeh also lost the confidence of some of his own troops.
The F.B.I. had been attacked as heavy-handed in its investigative tactics in the case of Wen Ho Lee, a nuclear scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. The bureau was deeply embarrassed by the arrest of Robert P. Hanssen, a senior counterintelligence agent, as a Russian spy. It could not even keep track of its own records and disclosed that it had failed to turn over thousands of pages of internal documents to the defense team for Timothy J. McVeigh, the convicted Oklahoma City bomber who was executed last year.
Mr. Freeh tried to strengthen the agency's counterterrorism efforts. Throughout the 1990's, the F.B.I.'s spending on counterterrorism tripled and the number of agents assigned to terrorism cases increased 250 percent. The bureau established a counterterrorism center and created an operating division to combat domestic and international terror. In 1996, Attorney General Janet Reno ordered what officials said was the first full briefing on the threat posed by Osama bin Laden. At that time, the bureau was not qualified to deliver it. The briefing was given to Ms. Reno by the C.I.A. instead.
Last summer, Attorney General John Ashcroft rejected the bureau's plea for more money for counterterrorism. In a Sept. 10 submission to the Bush administration's budget office, Mr. Ashcroft refused to endorse an F.B.I. request for $58 million for 149 new counterterrorism field agents, 200 additional analysts and 54 additional translators. 
He also proposed a $65 million cut for a program that would have given state and local counterterrorism grants for equipment and training. After Sept. 11, Mr. Ashcroft proposed $2 billion for F.B.I. counterterrorism measures.
In a statement today, Barbara Comstock, the Justice Department's director of public affairs, said that the rejected $58 million request represented "only a little over 1 percent" of the Justice Department's recommended $3.8 billion for the F.B.I. in the fiscal year, and was "only a fraction of the budget which aids in preventing terrorism."
She said that the Sept. 10 memorandum, a preliminary submission on the budget for the fiscal year that will begin next October 1, included "an overall $660 million increase in funding for items that assist in combating terrorism," such as technology to improve the analysis of intelligence.
By the mid-1990's, a few voices in the F.B.I. were warning that the United States faced a grave danger. Intelligence reports indicated that veterans of Afghanistan's war to expel the Russians had spawned a new generation of Islamic militants financed by anti-American extremists like Mr. bin Laden. These young men were unfazed by the threat of prosecution and imprisonment.
In 1998, Robert S. Bryant, then the deputy director, wrote a report titled "F.B.I. Strategic Plan: 1998-2003, 'Keeping Tomorrow Safe.' " In the report, Mr. Bryant declared that counterterrorism was a "tier one" program that needed to get the highest priority and the most resources within the F.B.I. The bureau, he said, must focus its efforts on "foreign intelligence, terrorist and criminal activities that directly threaten the national or economic security of the U.S."
"These offenses fall almost exclusively within the jurisdiction of the F.B.I.," Mr. Bryant wrote. "Issues in this area are of such importance to U.S. national interests that they must receive priority attention."
The bureau's leaders tried to get up to speed on the terrorism threat, but officials say several restructuring plans failed to make the bureaucracy more adept or responsive.
One idea was to establish an office of intelligence at F.B.I. headquarters. "This will send an important signal to F.B.I. managers at all levels and assist in the development of an F.B.I. culture that values and effectively uses intelligence," one report said. But the proposed consolidation of power in Washington alienated and angered many agents from field offices around the country, where the power had resided.
"More and more authority was taken over by headquarters, less and less was given to the field agents, and more and more field agents resented headquarters and believed they didn't support them," a former F.B.I. official said.

Cultural Collisions
A Growing Budget, But No Strategy
Another former top F.B.I. official said counterterrorism was always seen as secondary to more glamorous bank robbery and public corruption cases. "The counterterrorism guys never arrested anyone, never stopped anything," the official said. "It was hard to keep score on their effectiveness."
In private memorandums, some obtained this week by The New York Times, senior F.B.I. officials acknowledged that their counterterrorism program was deeply troubled and largely ineffective.
An internal memorandum, dated Aug. 22, 2000, from Mr. Watson, then in charge of counterterrorism, to Thomas J. Pickard, the deputy director at the time, acknowledged the F.B.I.'s lack of coherent prevention strategy.
"While the F.B.I. has traditionally relied on an approach that focused generally on the identification, penetration and neutralization of terrorist organizations," Mr. Watson wrote, "the bureau has not developed a 'grand strategy' in which resources and programs are systematically directed toward progressively reducing and neutralizing and ultimately eliminating the terrorist threat to U.S. interests."
Officials in the administration of President Bill Clinton said that the F.B.I. under Mr. Freeh was difficult to manage because he took the bureau's traditional independence too far. His effort to forge alliances with Republicans in Congress, a step that angered Mr. Clinton, drove a wedge between the president's national security staff and the F.B.I.
At the same time, the F.B.I. clung to its old case-by-case operational methods, which meant that counterterrorism agents operated in much the same way they had during the Hoover era. Agents prevented unfolding plots on occasion, but only if investigators stumbled across a lead in the course of a specific case.
Mr. Freeh did not respond to a request for an interview this week.
Each terrorist act in the 1990's brought a renewed spate of high-level F.B.I. meetings and budget requests to Congress. The Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the Khobar Towers attack in Saudi Arabia in 1996, the East Africa embassy bombings in 1998 and the suicide explosion on the Navy destroyer Cole in Yemen in October 2000 all led to new infusions of money from Congress. By the time Mr. Freeh retired, the F.B.I.'s budget had grown 58 percent, to $3.4 billion during his tenure, but at its core the agency remained unchanged.
Still, associates of Mr. Freeh said he deserved credit for some changes. He traveled widely and increased the number of overseas F.B.I. offices to 44 from 22. These legal attaches made contacts with foreign security services that were invaluable after the hijackings, but were not given the job of gathering information about terror threats.
But even as Mr. Freeh extended the F.B.I.'s reactive ability around the world, associates said he focused on specific cases and paid too little attention to building the bureau's ability to collect and analyze intelligence.
He assumed direct responsibility for the F.B.I.'s investigation of the Khobar Towers bombing in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in July 1996, which killed 19 American airmen.
He flew frequently to Riyadh, often frustrated by the Saudis' lack of cooperation. The case seemed to fascinate him. He spent hours poring over interview reports and meeting with agents on the case. Some subordinates said it typified Mr. Freeh's willingness to immerse himself in specific cases, even if it meant paying too little attention to larger structural issues and law enforcement priorities.
Some analysts and linguists were hired, but in the macho culture of the F.B.I., they were dismissed as desk-bound pencil-pushers. They were passed over for promotions and wrote reports that often went unread. Unlike the C.I.A., the F.B.I. did not recruit a professional group of highly trained analysts with access to senior agency officials.
The agency also had serious cultural problems. Some agents complained about Mr. Freeh's frequent lectures on personal conduct, saying it contributed to a risk-averse climate that discouraged innovation. The bureau's internal affairs unit, the Office of Professional Responsibility, became a much-feared inquisitor, sometimes damaging careers over minor offenses like using a bureau car for personal matters. 
"He focused more on what agents were doing personally than on investigations," a former senior F.B.I. official said. "It became the Federal Bureau of Internal Investigation of its own people, as opposed to a bureau committed to investigating and stopping terrorism. The priorities were out of whack."
Officials at F.B.I. headquarters accepted promotions with mixed feelings, fearing that a mistake could mean a Congressional inquiry and a quick end to their careers. It was easier to reject an untested investigative proposal from a field office than to take the inevitable blame if the idea failed or was criticized by Congress.
Agents also complained that the agency's analytical problems were made worse by an antiquated computer system. For instance, agents cannot send e-mail messages from their desktop computers; they must use personal laptops to send them. 
Year after year, senior officials said, Congress refused to spend the hundreds of millions needed to upgrade the F.B.I.'s computer system. Congress, wary after spending hundreds of millions on failed computer systems for other agencies, wanted the bureau to ensure that the system would work. Three years ago, the bureau hired a former I.B.M. executive to set up a system, but agents say it is still years away from completion.

Congress
Kid-Glove Treatment On Capitol Hill
For decades, the F.B.I. has held the upper hand as lawmakers, mindful of its public stature as well as the real power it can wield, have been reluctant to criticize its operations but eager to lavish spending on it. 
The bureau's budget has more than doubled in less than a decade, from $2.06 billion in 1994 to the $4.2 billion it is requesting for 2003 -- and, given the current climate, likely to get. 
"It is an agency which, even when it has been severely criticized, almost routinely gets more budget appropriations than it asks for," said James X. Dempsey, deputy director of the Center for Democracy and Technology and a veteran observer of the F.B.I.'s operations on Capitol Hill. "And even serious problems like those revealed in the Waco and Ruby Ridge fiascos or the lab scandal yield no legislative limits or legislative reforms."
Besides the coming Intelligence Committee hearings on the Sept. 11 attacks, the Senate Judiciary Committee this week will continue the F.B.I. oversight hearings it began last summer. The latest session is scheduled for Thursday as the committee chairman, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, a Republican critic of the bureau, seek to remedy what they contend is a failure by Congress to scrutinize the bureau.
Though Congress has initiated inquiries into specific F.B.I. actions in recent years -- notably a series of hearings on the 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian compound and 1995 hearings investigating the shootings during the 1992 siege at Ruby Ridge -- Mr. Leahy said regular oversight has been almost nonexistent.
"These are the first systematic oversight hearings there have been in decades," Mr. Leahy said, adding that the sessions had uncovered widespread F.B.I. computer inadequacies and found that the agency was "not used to anybody asking questions."
Mr. Leahy and Mr. Grassley have offered legislation that would institute significant changes at the F.B.I. and give its inspector general new power and resources to conduct internal investigations. The legislation was adopted by the Judiciary Committee, but Mr. Leahy said it was being blocked in the Senate by an anonymous "hold" placed on it by a Republican senator.
Mr. Grassley said Congress has had the bureau on a "long leash" for years, perhaps because of fear of retaliation. "If people believe it, you can see why there's not proper oversight," he said.
The roots of any fear -- and of Congress's deferential treatment -- date to the days of J. Edgar Hoover, who compiled files on members of Congress and did not hesitate to use the information as leverage to achieve his political and legislative ends.
William G. Hundley, a Washington lawyer who oversaw organized crime investigations at the Justice Department in the 1960's, said he witnessed that tactic. He said he once learned that two members of Congress had taken Cadillacs from men trying to promote their business interests, but Hoover told the lawmakers that they were about to be investigated, and the cars were returned before the investigation could begin.
In recent years, lawmakers and aides say, the bureau has had a more conventional approach, cultivating lawmakers through exclusive briefings or working publicly with a politician when constituents are victims of high-profile crimes.
Mr. Dempsey said another way the bureau ingratiates itself is to "detail" personnel to assist the staffs of Congressional committees, at the F.B.I.'s expense.
Mr. Freeh was popular with Republicans on Capitol Hill because of his support for a special prosecutor to look into allegations of fund-raising improprieties at the Clinton White House. One lawmaker said Mr. Freeh's stature clearly "insulated" the F.B.I. from Congressional criticism.
Mr. Leahy said he was not certain whether the inquiries into the Sept. 11 attacks would be the genesis of a new relationship between Congress and the bureau but added that he hoped one was emerging.
"There is no institution of our government that should be above question," he said.

The Field Offices
Anger and Frustration Toward Headquarters
Mr. Mueller is now trying to force the F.B.I. to shed its traditional case-oriented approach to its job. In its place, he hopes to build what amounts to a new agency, a Federal Bureau of Prevention whose central mission is to collect, analyze and act on information that will help prevent attacks.
But it is uncertain whether Mr. Mueller, or anyone, can reorganize an institution whose agents have been trained to solve crimes.
One of the most difficult challenges facing Mr. Mueller is a widespread perception in the bureau's 56 field offices that headquarters does not support their efforts.
That anger was seen last month when Coleen Rowley, the senior Minneapolis agent, wrote a letter to Mr. Mueller complaining that headquarters had repeatedly stymied requests from agents in her Minneapolis office who were seeking a search warrant to examine the contents of Zacarias Moussaoui's computer, in the weeks before Sept. 11. Ms. Rowley said the F.B.I. was hamstrung by a hypersensitive "circle the wagons" culture when responding to criticism.
This week, Mr. Ashcroft changed the attorney general's surveillance guidelines, which will allow special agents in charge of field offices to begin criminal investigations without the express approval of headquarters.
"Saying that the folks in the field are right, that they could have superior insight or knowledge, is a dramatic change," said David J. Garrow, a legal historian and professor at Emory Law School. "It's actually a revolution in transferring initiative in the F.B.I. to the field rather than the traditional way."
Sanford J. Ungar, the president of Goucher College and an authority on the F.B.I., said it was easier to change the bureau's priorities than its culture.
"The reason the F.B.I. is doomed to have this happen over and over again has something to do with this F.B.I. culture," Mr. Ungar said. "If you want to get ahead in the F.B.I. you don't rock the boat, you don't challenge headquarters, don't present a lot of new ideas." 
Despite all the talk of counterterrorism efforts in recent years, a retired special agent in Phoenix, James H. Hauswirth, wrote to Mr. Mueller last December that counterterrorism was "the lowest investigative priority in the Phoenix division," government officials said.
A perceived lack of investigative zeal at headquarters has startled agents in field offices, around the country, several former F.B.I. officials said.
"These problems have become legendary -- the lack of analysis by headquarters, the lack of support from headquarters, the lack of ability to get things approved by headquarters," one former official said. "Hopefully it will change, but the agents around the country are demoralized. It could take years to fix."

F.B.I. vs. C.I.A.
An Uneasy Alliance Of Longtime Rivals
When agents in the Minneapolis bureau last summer contacted the Central Intelligence Agency for help in evaluating whether Zacarias Moussaoui was a terrorist, they discovered this did not sit well with their superiors in Washington.
They were reprimanded by officials at F.B.I. headquarters, who said they had committed a breach of protocol.
But former Justice Department officials say that the reaction demonstrated as much as anything the difficulty the two agencies have long had in working with each other. 
What really bothered F.B.I. headquarters, one law enforcement official said, was having agents cooperate with the C.I.A. in ways headquarters might not be able to control.
The two agencies have been across-the-river rivals for decades. The enmity dates to the creation of the C.I.A. in 1947.
In the early years, the rivalry was rooted in the starkly different cultures of the agencies. F.B.I. agents felt that they were looked down upon as policemen by the C.I.A. officers with their more worldly, sophisticated air.
In 1970, two years before his death, J. Edgar Hoover broke off all liaison with the C.I.A., insisting that his agents could communicate only by memorandums cleared by him. This breach was caused when the C.I.A. refused to tell the bureau the name of an F.B.I. agent who had talked to the C.I.A. without Hoover's permission. 
Even so, the C.I.A., prohibited by its charter from conducting investigations in the United States, relied on the F.B.I. to help it with counterintelligence investigations. 
Two modern spy cases embarrassed each agency in turn and gave the other a moment of triumph.
When Aldrich H. Ames, a C.I.A. officer, was arrested in 1994 for spying for the Russians, the F.B.I. officials were lauded for cracking the case. They said the insular atmosphere at the C.I.A. allowed Mr. Ames to get away with his betrayal, and they were confident they would no longer be excluded.
The wheel turned in February 2001 when Mr. Hanssen, a veteran F.B.I. agent, was arrested on charges of spying for the Russians for two decades.
In announcing changes at the bureau this week, Mr. Mueller became the latest director to promise cooperation between the two agencies. The first step, he said, would be to have 25 C.I.A. officers detailed to the bureau to help with intelligence analysis.
An autopsy on the performance of both agencies will begin on Tuesday inside S-407, the electronically impenetrable hearing room of the Senate Intelligence Committee, where, behind soundproof double doors, members of the House and Senate intelligence panels will begin their official inquiry into lapses before the Sept. 11 attacks. 
The lawmakers will seek to unravel why the F.B.I., with telling clues in its possession, could not put together the Sept. 11 puzzle in time. Some bureau veterans say they already know at least part of the answer.
"The F.B.I. is the greatest in the world at investigating a crime after it happened, but it is not equipped to prevent crimes," one former senior official said. "It wasn't in the 90's, it wasn't on 9/11.
"We didn't know what we knew."

 CORRECTION:
A caption in a picture grouping on Sunday recalling notable criminal cases, with an article about the F.B.I.'s efforts to transform itself to fight terrorism, misstated the crime for which Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in 1953. It was conspiracy to commit espionage, not the passing of secrets to the Soviets. Another caption referred incompletely to the bureau's role in the case of Al Capone. While the bureau investigated him, Capone's conviction for tax evasion was based largely on the work of Treasury agents.

Too much online data may come to mean less online data.

BYLINE:  By Rebecca Fairley Raney 

 BODY:
CAN the easy distribution of data promised by the Internet actually bring the type of scrutiny that ultimately leads to less information being available?
 That is the question being raised by a new law called the Data Quality Act, which requires the government to set standards for the accuracy of scientific information used by federal agencies. It is the latest move from Washington highlighting the balance of risks and rewards when disseminating information on the Internet. 
 The law, which takes full effect on Oct. 1, creates a system under which anyone could point out errors in documents; if an error is confirmed, an agency would have to remove the data from government Web sites and publications. 
The Data Quality Act, along with recent efforts by government agencies to scrub their Web sites of information to guard national security, indicate a substantial shift to a more conservative culture of information, said Darrell West, a political scientist at Brown who tracks government information on the Web. 
Though the Internet created fewer fortunes than had been expected, it did deliver riches of information, creating an age of government disclosure not seen before. Not so long ago, the mantra was openness; some legislators even scrambled to get lists of campaign contributors into cyberspace where the voters could see.
But that age may be over.
"The open-access people just put things online and worried about the consequences later," Professor West said. "Now we're hitting the consequences." 
The Center for Regulatory Effectiveness, a primary backer of the Data Quality Act, has already started requesting changes in government information that is published in print and online.
This year, the center requested that the United States Global Change Research Program withdraw dissemination of the National Assessment on Climate Change on the basis of "numerous data quality and scientific flaws," according to a letter posted on the group's Web site.
The center also asked the Environmental Protection Agency to modify its Web site on global warming to reflect the scientific uncertainties about global climate change.
William Kelly, western representative for the center, said the poor quality of federal data created problems for everyone who used it, from regulators to consumers.
"With the blossoming of the Internet, it's turned into a huge problem for industry," Mr. Kelly said. "Agencies were encouraged to post virtually everything on the Internet. It wasn't such a problem when people had to go through a Freedom of Information Act request."
Some watchdog groups say that agencies need to create policies on how to treat information on the Internet, arguing that otherwise, haphazard decisions would lead to more restrictions.
"The problem is, it's much easier to make decisions about taking down information," said Ari Schwartz, associate director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit group in Washington. "The policy seems to be, take everything down, and we'll make decisions later." 
Employees of the Interior Department learned the consequences of that approach earlier this year, when a federal judge ordered all the department's computer communications shut because its Web sites were vulnerable to hacking. Agencies fielded complaints from a wide range of people, from those planning vacations to national parks to those seeking the status of bird species. Most of the its Web sites have since been restored. 
Removing information from Web sites became more of a government interest after Sept. 11, as agencies took down information they thought might be useful to terrorists. 
A nonprofit group in Washington called OMB Watch is trying to assess just how much information agencies removed from public Web sites under the new directives. The group sent requests under the Freedom of Information Act to a dozen agencies in January. So far, only the Environmental Protection Agency has sent back a list.
According to OMB Watch, E.P.A. officials have restored much of the information that they withdrew from its Web sites last fall, including pages dealing with watersheds in New York City and the Envirofacts database, which allows users to retrieve information about air pollution, chemicals at government and business installations, water pollution and grants. 
Responses to the group's inquiry indicate that other agencies may have removed a significant amount of information from the Web. The Energy Department, according to OMB Watch, reported that it had stacks of information waiting to be organized before it could be sent. 
"We have nothing we can nail them down on, and we have no index of what they had in the past," said Sean Moulton, a senior policy analyst with OMB Watch. He said the directives to remove data and the new data-quality guidelines were part of "an overarching mosaic that is about restricting information and removing information from public access."
"Unfortunately," Mr. Moulton said, "Sept. 11 is being utilized as a pivot point for industry to push an agenda they already had." 
OMB Watch has advocated creation of an office that would oversee what data agencies publish online and the security measures they use. 
But even when done with care for quality and security, publishing on the Internet can still bring unexpected trouble to agencies.
Five years ago, the Social Security Administration set up a service on its Web site that let individuals look up their income histories and check what benefits were available. People had to enter five pieces of information: full name, Social Security number, date of birth, place of birth and mother's maiden name. 
"By requiring those five items, we felt that was adequate security. It was addressed," said Mark Hinkle, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration.
That is more information than most people need now to check their bank accounts online, but the agency received a letter from several senators with concerns that hackers could steal individuals' personal information from the site.
Though no fraud was ever reported, the agency took down the database. Now, Social Security sends earnings records each year by mail.

Study Finds Some Setbacks for Broadband

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

 BODY:
The economic downturn, the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the effects of last year's terrorist attacks have sharply slowed the adoption of broadband services, postponing the point at which these services will be widely accepted, according to a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
 The study, to be published tomorrow, estimates that access to broadband will remain limited until 2006, far later than analysts had anticipated. Only after that point will it begin to reach enough households to gain the critical mass that is the necessary underpinning for companies to make a profit from multimedia downloads, online games and other types of customized content that rely on broadband. 
 "Everyone, including us, was off the mark," said Kevin K. Carton, head of the global entertainment and media practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers. "When you combine the severity of the economic cycle, the dot-com bust and the impact of Sept. 11, it puts a hole in the period from 2000 to 2002 that blows all projections off the map. It is as though life skipped a beat for at least one year."
By 2006, Mr. Carton said, he expects there to be enough of a broadband backbone to handle the customized content that will be the main source of revenue to the companies the offer multimedia services. Broadband provides faster connections to the Internet and can transmit greater amounts of data than can traditional Internet access, or narrow band, as it is called.
PricewaterhouseCoopers expects the number of broadband subscribers in the United States to grow to 35.3 million by 2006, from 9.4 million in 2001, roughly equaling the number of narrow-band subscribers by then.
Any delay in reaching a mass audience could spell bad news for companies like Vivendi Universal and AOL Time Warner, which have bet that people will be increasingly willing to pay for customized content piped into their homes. 
To be sure, the entire global entertainment and media industry hit a speed bump last year. Growth in 2001 was just 1.5 percent, after averaging 7 percent in each of the four previous years. PricewaterhouseCoopers expects growth to increase, but not to the levels seen in the late 1990's. Compounded annual growth through 2006 is expected to average 5.2 percent, making the industry a $1.4 trillion powerhouse, up from $1 trillion in 2001.
Part of that growth will come from a recovery in advertising spending, which after shrinking 4.8 percent in 2001, according to the study, will begin growing again this year.

HEADLINE: Small Catches, Low Prices and Imports Bedevil Louisiana Shrimpers 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: CUT OFF, La. 

 BODY:
The shrimp season was just a week old, but it might as well have ended already.
 Kirk Williams, 38, a fifth-generation fisherman, had been out for six days on the briny bayous, bays and old oil-field canals that tint the map of Lafourche Parish a watery blue. He returned with just 7,800 pounds of shrimp in the hold of his 55-foot trawler. 
 Last year, he caught 17,000 pounds on opening day alone -- and prices have plummeted to about half what they were then.
His buddy Michael Gros, 43, gave up after hauling in just 3,700 pounds of shrimp, then kept his catch on ice for three days, hoping the market price would rise at least to a subsistence level. It did not. 
"I don't know why I'm going to go back to work," Mr. Gros said. "I don't see the point. I might as well just sit here and let the bank come take everything I got."
Buffeted by stiff winds and unwelcome trends, the 18,000 or so remaining shrimpers of Louisiana's Cajun country are facing prices at the pier that are lower than they have been in decades. Demand for shrimp has suffered along with the restaurant industry through the nation's economic hangover and the post-Sept. 11 plunge in travel and entertainment spending. But imports from aquaculture ponds in the Pacific Rim and Latin America continue to flood the domestic market.
Even a brewing storm here over imported Asian shrimp found to be contaminated with a dangerous antibiotic, chloramphenicol, could end up hurting the domestic shrimpers, they fear.
Chloramphenicol is used in treating diseases like anthrax and typhoid, but is banned from agricultural use in the United States and many other countries because it can cause leukemia in children and aplastic anemia, an often-fatal blood disease, in adults. Some foreign aquaculture farms, particularly the ones in China, use the drug because the shrimps are grown densely in ponds and are susceptible to disease outbreaks.
Here down the bayou, news of the shrimp scare surfaced several weeks ago when a local shrimper saw an item about chloramphenicol in a frozen-foods trade journal. Word quickly spread over VHF radios and cellphones, and before long, Louisiana's agriculture commissioner, Robert Odom, had sent his own inspectors to test imported shrimp at grocery stores.
Some results were positive for chloramphenicol, and Mr. Odom issued an emergency order requiring tests of all Chinese shrimp and crawfish sold in the state. But Mr. Odom said he had also found traces of the drug in some boxes of shrimp labeled "Product of Louisiana," meaning that somewhere along the line processors may have mixed foreign shrimp with the local catch. No one knows whether the result will be a rally in prices for American shrimp caught at sea, or a shift away from the seafood altogether.
"I'm afraid of that double-edged sword," said Bobby Samanie, a shrimp processor along Bayou Grand Caillou in nearby Terrebonne Parish. "It could maybe help us with the Chinese thing, but it could also lower our demand."
Whatever the outcome of the problem, it is not likely to avert what is looking more like the nearing end of a cherished way of life for many Louisiana shrimpers.
The market share of American shrimp caught at sea -- about 20 percent of domestic consumption -- is only going to keep falling, experts say. Richard Gutting, the president of the National Fisheries Institute, the umbrella trade association for the seafood industry, said that the annual catch in the Gulf and Atlantic will, at best, remain stable, and more likely decline, over time.
By contrast, the aquaculture industry has taken off in dozens of countries, primarily in Asia and Latin America, but increasingly in the United States as well. "From a strategic standpoint, there's a question as to whether or not the domestic shrimp fleet can survive," Mr. Gutting said.
People are increasingly asking that question in the houses-on-stilts, double-wide trailers and well-kept ranch houses in Cut Off, Larose, Dulac, Chauvin and other bayou communities in Louisiana.
The other day, Mr. Gros and Mr. Williams tied their boats together so they could shoot the breeze during the four-hour cruise down Bayou Lafourche, across the East-West Canal into the open waters of Caminada Bay and on, finally, to Dean Blanchard's seafood pier on Grand Isle. There, they would haggle over the average size of their catch, seeking the higher prices that are paid for a count of fewer shrimps per pound. 
They talked of the federally mandated turtle-exclusion devices that they say mainly serve to catch debris, tear up $1,200 nets and let shrimps swim free. They lamented how shrimpers, as low on the political food chain as their prey, would never get the trade protections that farmers, sugar refiners and steel mills enjoy. 
As Mr. Williams eyed a global-positioning screen and turned the wheel with his bare feet, Mr. Gros explained the unforgiving economics of their business.
The rhythms of nature are such that the first two weeks of the brown-shrimp season, in May, and the first two weeks of the white-shrimp season, in late summer, are when a shrimper can hope to make most of his money. Mr. Gros said his average gross in May was $30,000; this year, he said, a shrimper would be lucky to get $12,000.
That number shrinks quickly, he said. Fuel, at 81 cents a gallon, costs $6,400 a month. Mr. Gros pays his one deckhand 20 percent of the sale price of their catch, but also charges him half the $2,100 they will spend for groceries and ice. All told, Mr. Gros said he would be lucky to take home $2,150 for this May. 
As if the long-term economic challenges were not enough, a rare May cold front blew the better part of the brown shrimp crop out into the Gulf -- beyond the reach of inland fishermen like Mr. Gros and Mr. Williams -- barely a week before the start of the fishing season.
Then, recently, the northerly winds did it again.
"That's like if you're a sugar cane farmer ready to harvest, and a hurricane comes in and flattens out your cane," said Mr. Williams, 38, whose great-great-grandfather was throwing seines from a sailboat in these waters as early as the 1840's.
For his part, Mr. Blanchard, the owner of the pier in Grand Isle and four others like it, said that he and other seafood processors and packers were in the same boat as the shrimpers who supply them.
Mr. Blanchard, who sends trucks to the Fulton Fish Market in New York and to distributors across the country, cut his markup recently to 17 cents a pound from 25 cents -- "to try to give the boats a little more money," he said.
He has also lent fishermen the cost of fuel and ice as well as money for boat repairs, just to keep them bringing him a product to sell. A year ago, Mr. Blanchard said, he wrote off $400,000 in such loans, "and I've already got another $150,000 out now."
Mr. Gros and Mr. Williams pulled up to Mr. Blanchard's pier as the sun melted into Caminada Bay, watching warily as Mr. Blanchard's crew picked out their shrimps.
In the end, Mr. Gros's catch was graded at 60 to 70 pieces per pound, for a price of 95 cents, a dime more than he had expected a day earlier. But the same size shrimp had brought $1.55 a year earlier, he said. Mr. Williams made off with $6,500.
Mr. Gros was left with just $3,450, and clinging to his latest dream -- of uniting Louisiana's shrimpers into a political force that could one day win the tariffs or price supports to fight the rising tide of imports. A defunct group, the Louisiana Shrimpers Association, is being revived, and Mr. Gros and other shrimpers have begun setting aside a penny for every pound they catch.
Did Mr. Gros think it had much chance of succeeding? "No," he admitted. "But we've never been back against the wall, either. We've never had our families watch us starve."

DEAR DIARY:
At the playground at Horatio and Hudson Streets, my attention was caught by a couple looking up at some rags and string flapping at the top of the 30-foot-high wire fence. I moved closer, as did a man sitting alone on a bench. Pausing at the foot of the fence, he took off his sneakers and started to climb.
 I heard the word "pigeon" and could just make out the bird hanging by its feet, enmeshed in the string and exhausted. The climb was unimaginably difficult, and one slip could have been fatal. Another man, who stood looking up, kept on intoning: "Take it slow. Take it easy." 
 But as the climber found toehold after toehold and moved away from the ground, we were all silent. He reached the top and gathered the pigeon in his hands. I could see him stroking the bird to calm it before he started to unpick the tangled string with one hand.
The fence vibrated with his efforts to stay balanced. We, anchored to the asphalt, were spellbound, our hands clenched into fists. After a long minute, the bird was free. The man obviously could not carry it down with him. He paused, extended his arm and flung the pigeon out and into the air. It flew to the building opposite and watched the man climb down, put on his sneakers and walk off along Hudson Street, deaf to our cries of praise and thanks. Serena Bass

Dear Diary:
As an avid Central Park birder, I'm always on the lookout for the unusual. Recently, after two hours of early-morning birding, I reluctantly headed from the park when my ears caught the sound of a cellphone ringing.
I looked into the bushes where the sound was coming from but saw no one.
Then my eye caught a perky little catbird running through its repertory of bird songs. Knowing that it is a mimic, I listened carefully, trying to pick out the different songs. I heard it imitate a white-throated sparrow, a house finch, a song sparrow, and then the clear ring of a cellphone. My mouth dropped open in disbelief. I listened again and, sure enough, heard the catbird repeat bird song, bird song, cellphone and on and on. The little guy made my day. Barbara Saunders

Dear Diary:
A friend, driving in Manhattan, found himself in urgent need of a bathroom. He spotted a Starbucks and what seemed to be an empty space in front. When he got out of his car he saw why the space was empty: a clearly marked No Parking sign and a police officer standing next to it.
"What's the fine for parking here?" he asked the officer.
"Fifty-five dollars," the officer replied. 
"Well, it's worth it," my friend said. "I have to go."
When he came out a few minutes later, the officer was standing next to his car. There was no ticket on the windshield. 
"I waited until I saw you coming out," the officer said with a smile. "If you had a container or a paper bag, I would have given you a ticket. But you didn't and were obviously telling the truth, so I didn't. Have a nice day."
My friend did. Harold Faber

Jeffery Renard Allen, an author, was reading one of his short stories aloud at a benefit for The Antioch Review at the Dactyl Foundation on Grand Street in SoHo when the dreaded happened -- a cellphone rang and rang.
The cellphone have-nots in the audience looked around, their stares wildly disapproving. The haves looked guilty as they scrambled for their purses or dived into their backpacks. To no avail. The phone kept ringing. Mr. Allen gamely kept reading. Everyone looked at everyone else. It was hard to concentrate on the story, steamy as it was. A couple of people doublechecked.
Suddenly Mr. Allen stopped in midsentence, having finally identified the culprit cellphone. "I'm sorry," he said. "It's mine."

THE GRAND CENTRAL SHUFFLE
Each early morning as I dash through Grand Central Station
The subway's transformed, in a figment of my imagination
The commuters become dancers engaged at a ball
Each of them heading to their own curtain call
Some do the shuffle, the tango, ballet
Waltzing through the terminal in their own unique way
Naysayers will whine "overcrowding, it's dirty"
But to me it's the hottest ticket in New York City
No room for amateurs, the floor's dominated by pros
Avoiding collision, as they move to and fro
Two steps to the left and one sharp to the right
In this repertoire, no one's polite
Each man's for himself, you must get out there and move
It's eat or be eaten, everyone's got something to prove
If life is a stage and there's no dress rehearsal
One thing I've learned to be universal
New Yorkers can dance, everyone plays a part
Is it art imitating life or life imitating art?

Dear Diary:
Not long ago, my Audi was stolen. Fortunately, it was found the next day. Soon after, I received a package from the car thieves, who had gone through my briefcase and removed all the documents important to me and mailed them to me. The package included my passport, tax information, notes on meetings, reports and my address book. They sent it to my home, postage due, with my office as the return address, so no matter what the Postal Service did, I would ultimately get the package.
When I got the car back, I found that one item they had taken was a cassette lecture series titled "The Legacies of Great Economists." As car thieves go, they showed themselves to be committed not only to client service, but to higher education as well. Hunt Taylor

HEADLINE: U.S. SEES PROBLEMS IN CLIMATE CHANGE 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
In a stark shift for the Bush administration, the United States has sent a climate report to the United Nations detailing specific and far-reaching effects that it says global warming will inflict on the American environment.
 In the report, the administration for the first time mostly blames human actions for recent global warming. It says the main culprit is the burning of fossil fuels that send heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. 
 But while the report says the United States will be substantially changed in the next few decades -- "very likely" seeing the disruption of snow-fed water supplies, more stifling heat waves and the permanent disappearance of Rocky Mountain meadows and coastal marshes, for example -- it does not propose any major shift in the administration's policy on greenhouse gases. 
It recommends adapting to inevitable changes. It does not recommend making rapid reductions in greenhouse gases to limit warming, the approach favored by many environmental groups and countries that have accepted the Kyoto Protocol, a climate treaty written in the Clinton administration that was rejected by Mr. Bush.
The new document, "U.S. Climate Action Report 2002," strongly concludes that no matter what is done to cut emissions in the future, nothing can be done about the environmental consequences of several decades' worth of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases already in the atmosphere.
Its emphasis on adapting to the inevitable fits in neatly with the climate plan Mr. Bush announced in February. He called for voluntary measures that would allow gas emissions to continue to rise, with the goal of slowing the rate of growth.
Yet the new report's predictions present a sharp contrast to previous statements on climate change by the administration, which has always spoken in generalities and emphasized the need for much more research to resolve scientific questions.
The report, in fact, puts a substantial distance between the administration and companies that produce or, like automakers, depend on fossil fuels. Many companies and trade groups have continued to run publicity and lobbying campaigns questioning the validity of the science pointing to damaging results of global warming.
The distancing could be an effort to rebuild Mr. Bush's environmental credentials after a bruising stretch of defeats on stances that favor energy production over conservation, notably the failure to win a Senate vote opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to exploratory oil drilling.
But the report has alienated environmentalists, too. Late last week, after it was posted on the Web site of the Environmental Protection Agency, private environmental groups pounced on it, saying it pointed to a jarring disconnect between the administration's findings on the climate problem and its proposed solutions.
"The Bush administration now admits that global warming will change America's most unique wild places and wildlife forever," said Mark Van Putten, the president of the National Wildlife Federation, a private environmental group. "How can it acknowledge global warming is a disaster in the making and then refuse to help solve the problem, especially when solutions are so clear?"
Scott McClellan, a White House spokesman, said, "It is important to move forward on the president's strategies for addressing the challenge of climate change, and that's what we're continuing to do."
Many companies and trade groups had sought last year to tone down parts of the report, the third prepared by the United States under the requirements of a 1992 climate treaty but the first under President Bush.
For the most part, the document does not reflect industry's wishes, which were conveyed in letters during a period of public comment on a draft last year.
The report emphasizes that global warming carries potential benefits for the nation, including increased agricultural and forest growth from longer growing seasons, and from more rainfall and carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.
But it says environmental havoc is coming as well. "Some of the goods and services lost through the disappearance or fragmentation of natural ecosystems are likely to be costly or impossible to replace," the report says.
The report also warns of the substantial disruption of snow-fed water supplies, the loss of coastal and mountain ecosystems and more frequent heat waves. "A few ecosystems, such as alpine meadows in the Rocky Mountains and some barrier islands, are likely to disappear entirely in some areas," it says. "Other ecosystems, such as Southeastern forests, are likely to experience major species shifts or break up into a mosaic of grasslands, woodlands and forests."
Despite arguments by oil industry groups that the evidence is not yet clear, the report unambiguously states that humans are the likely cause of most of the recent warming. Phrases were adopted wholesale from a National Academy of Sciences climate study, which was requested last spring by the White House and concluded that the warming was a serious problem.
A government official familiar with the new report said that it had been under review at the White House from January until mid-April, but that few substantive changes were made.
Without a news release or announcement, the new report was shipped last week to the United Nations offices that administer the treaty and posted on the Web (www.epa .gov/globalwarming/publications /car/).
A senior administration official involved in climate policy played down the significance of the report, explaining that policies on emissions or international treaties would not change as a result.
Global warming has become a significant, if second-tier, political issue recently, particularly since James M. Jeffords, the Vermont independent, became chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee last year. Mr. Jeffords has criticized the president's policy.
The new report is the latest in a series on greenhouse gases, climate research, energy policies and related matters that are required of signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was signed by Mr. Bush's father and ratified by the Senate.
The convention lacks binding obligations to reduce gas emissions like those in the Kyoto Protocol.
Mr. Bush and administration officials had previously been careful to avoid specifics and couch their views on coming climate shifts with substantial caveats. The president and his aides often described climate change as a "serious issue," but rarely as a serious problem.
The report contains some caveats of its own, but states that the warming trend has been under way for several decades and is likely to continue. 
"Because of the momentum in the climate system and natural climate variability, adapting to a changing climate is inevitable," the report says. "The question is whether we adapt poorly or well."
Several industry groups said the qualifications in parts of the report were welcome, but added that the overall message was still more dire than the facts justified and would confuse policy makers.
Dr. Russell O. Jones, a senior economist for the American Petroleum Institute who wrote a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency a year ago seeking to purge projections of specific environmental impacts from the report, said it was "frustrating" to see that they remained.
"Adding the caveats is useful, but the results are still as meaningless," Dr. Jones said.

HEADLINE: A Couture Icon In an Overhaul Finds FewAds In Harsh Times 

BYLINE:  BY DAVID CARR 

 BODY:
Glenda Bailey, whose July issue of Harper's Bazaar promises "689 Fashion Hits," can come up with a million reasons why her magic will work on the troubled magazine she edits -- and she manages to squeeze in approximately half of them in a frenetic one-hour interview.
 "Harper's Bazaar had lost its way," she said, speaking last Friday on the anniversary of her hiring. "It was a blank canvas." 
 Ms. Bailey, who had never edited a fashion magazine before her bosses at Hearst Magazines moved her over from Marie Claire, has been busily filling in the blanks. Save for her use of gigantic numbers on the cover, she has produced a neoclassic fashion magazine that features elegant typography, few celebrities and pure fashion bathed in white space. 
But so far advertisers are staying away in droves from her rejiggered Harper's Bazaar. The magazine, squeezed both by an advertising recession that punishes category laggards and a revolution among women's magazines, remains mired at the bottom of the fashion magazine world.
Media buyers say Hearst has been wheeling and dealing on ad rates, but Harper's Bazaar's ad pages are down 25 percent through the first half of 2002, compared with the similar period last year, according to Media Industry Newsletter. Conde Nast's Vogue, edited by Anna Wintour, is down less than half that. Time Inc.'s InStyle, increasingly a player in fashion and beauty advertising, is down 14.4 percent. Only Hachette Filipacchi Media's Elle has performed worse than Harper's Bazaar.
The leadership at Hearst Magazines continues to stand behind their editor. "We believe that Glenda Bailey is an extraordinary editor and over time, she can help us turn this around," said Cathleen P. Black, president of Hearst Magazines.
It was the success Ms. Bailey had running the British and American versions of Marie Claire, lippy, occasionally bawdy women's magazine, that convinced Hearst executives to replace Kate Betts at Harper's Bazaar, a 135-year old piece of American fashion iconography. In Ms. Bailey's five years at the American version of Marie Claire, circulation rose from 609,000 to nearly 930,000.
Hearst executives hoped that Ms. Bailey's instinct for discerning the needs of readers, along with a penchant for wowing advertisers, could stanch the financial hemorrhaging at Harper's Bazaar. The magazine suffered, along with the health of Liz Tilberis, its editor through much of the 90's, who died in 1999 of ovarian cancer. Hearst's last attempt at fixing it, the hiring of Ms. Betts from Vogue, resulted in a magazine that Hearst executives viewed as needlessly austere.
Ms. Bailey may not have the typical fashion-magazine resume, but she is a tremendously savvy editor and a student of Harper's Bazaar's history. (And she does hold a bachelor's degree in fashion from Kingston University outside London.)
Ms. Bailey says she believes that by letting the magazine logo carry most of the color on the cover's always-white background, she can rebuild the name Harper's Bazaar into a meaningful brand for the fashion-aware. The former queen of the busy magazine cover now abhors clutter.
"I don't have to chase sale figures," Ms. Bailey said. "We need to produce fashion coverage that appeals to sophisticated tastes. It's a very specialized audience."
Rather than choosing to use her populist instincts to give Harper's Bazaar a radical makeover, Ms. Bailey has built on Bazaar's legacy in couture to make a magazine that is more about the clothes and accessories than the women who wear them.
Ms. Bailey's professional heritage is most apparent in the by-the-numbers approach she has taken since the redesign of the magazine in February. The June cover of Harper's Bazaar features a massive "759 New Looks" headline, not to be confused with May's "573 Fashion Pieces" and April's "619 Best Fashion and Beauty Buys."
"There is a very serious journalist who comes up with those counts," Ms. Bailey says with a laugh before returning to her message. "We are in the business of building a brand and those numbers are meant to convey that we have many, many ideas in Harper's Bazaar."
There has been a fair amount of joking about Ms. Bailey's numerical fixation at competing magazines -- some of which use numbers, but more chastely. Some in the fashion industry appreciate the numerology.
"I think that Glenda has made a serious attempt to organize the current chaos in fashion," said Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys. "When she writes about 563 ideas, there are actually 40 million ideas and she is focused on editing them down to a more manageable level."
And Ms. Bailey's decision to hire Stephen Gan, a former creative director of the fashion and art magazine Visionaire, has brought her immediate credibility on the runway. Observers in the fashion world say he has made the magazine more dynamic and colorful without injuring Bazaar's elegant visual legacy.
But much of the fashion community is wondering whether the magazine she was brought in to fix is even repairable in such a difficult environment.
"Business is tough, it hasn't bounced back," said Kal Ruttenstein, the fashion director of Bloomingdale's. "We are trimming expenses, and one of the first expenses to be trimmed is always magazine advertising."
"I think that Glenda is very talented, but the problem is that she is up against Anna Wintour, an icon whom designers worship," he added, referring to the editor in chief of Vogue. "Anna is really at the top of her form right now and putting out a great magazine."
Harper's Bazaar finds itself boxed in in other ways, too. Time Inc.'s fizzy mix of celebrity and couture, has all but redefined the category, making it more difficult for pure fashion magazines like Harper's Bazaar to compete. More recently, Conde Nast's Lucky has further democratized fashion by featuring moderately priced merchandise in accessible ways.
"The consumer is a little too smart these days to be told what to do," said Barbara Cirkva, executive vice president for fashion for Chanel. "I think Glenda has picked up on that. Bazaar has a nice tone and is not dictating choices."
Hearst executives insist that a more accurate reading on the effect of Ms. Bailey's changes will come in the fall fashion season, when they hope ad spending will rebound. They point to advertisers like L'Oreal, which will be will running a 14-page insert in the September issue. And, the executives said, since Ms. Bailey introduced her redesigned magazine, it is selling more than 10 percent better on the newsstand than last year. But others at Hearst say that the newsstand performance, a telling gauge of a magazine's appeal to readers, is up nominally at best.
Sitting in her 37th-floor office, below a rack of past covers she is very pleased with, Ms. Bailey said there is still tweaking to be done. The outsized numbers might have to go. 
"It's not a perfect marriage, but Glenda has every right impulse," said someone who has edited a fashion magazine. "She is digging out from a very deep hole and it still looks and feels very much like a work in progress. She could still pull it off.
"There is no one in this business who is more ambitious or focused than Glenda," she said. "Taking over Bazaar was the fulfillment of a life's dream, and she is not going down without a huge fight."

PERSON: Flora Lewis 

HEADLINE: Flora Lewis, 79, Dies; Keen Observer of World Affairs 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

 BODY:
Flora Lewis, a correspondent and columnist who explained international politics to readers of The New York Times and other publications for nearly 60 years, died early yesterday morning at her home in Paris. She was 79.
 The cause was cancer, said her son, Lindsey Gruson. 
 Heads of government and ordinary readers in the United States and Europe, where she lived for much of her career, looked to Flora Lewis's columns not only for her access to people in high places, but also for her dogged reporting and the sophisticated analysis that resulted. 
Much of her work, done when foreign policy was made by men who thought women had no place in the world of diplomacy, revealed deep knowledge of history inflected by the experience of living through some of the most turbulent events of an epochal century. 
She was in Eastern Europe in 1946 after the Communists took over, and she was there again for the Polish and Hungarian uprisings against Communism in 1956. 
"They had been called the 'captive nations' by the West," she wrote in one of her four books, "Europe: Road to Unity," published in 1992 by Simon & Schuster. "It was time to pull down the jail."
Polish Communists reacted to the uprising in their country by reinstating Wladyslaw Gomulka as party chief, defying threats of military intervention from Moscow. Gomulka had been jailed while Stalin was the Soviet leader. "It was the first time there had ever been a direct threat of confrontation between two Communist armies," Miss Lewis wrote. "And it turned out to be the first time that Moscow backed down." 
Then, turning to another armed confrontation that devolved into tragedy, in Hungary, she wrote: "Urgent appeals were broadcast to the Western countries for help. None came, only encouraging commentaries telling the overwhelmed Hungarians to keep up their struggle."
Soviet troops crushed Hungary's fight for freedom in 1956, but more than three decades later, in 1989, Miss Lewis witnessed the collapse of Communism all over Europe. 
"The new era starts now," she wrote in the Foreign Affairs column of The New York Times in 1990, after German unification emerged from the wreckage of the Communist empire. "The decisions being taken will hold for a long time, perhaps as long as the cold war lasted. This sense of novelty, of the fateful moment with all kinds of uncertain implications, accounts more for the unease, I think, than the behavior of Germany from Bismarck to 1945."
In 1980 Miss Lewis became the third in a line of foreign affairs columnists of The New York Times, following Anne O'Hare McCormick and C. L. Sulzberger, and held that position until the end of 1990. She remained a senior columnist of The Times until 1994, and after the newspaper ended that arrangement, she continued writing columns regularly for The New York Times Syndicate and The International Herald Tribune in Paris, right up to this spring. 
On the reporting trail or behind a typewriter -- she never learned to use a word processor, or wouldn't -- Miss Lewis was a formidable presence. Fiercely competitive, she would try to outthink and outwrite the competition on the job, and she could outdrink it off the job. No matter what the hour, her news antennae were always on. 
Miss Lewis began her newspaper career in 1942 with The Associated Press in New York and Washington. Over the decades, she worked in Europe and Latin America for European and American newspapers, including The Washington Post. Her first column was published by Newsday in 1966. She joined The Times in 1972 as bureau chief in Paris and also became the paper's European diplomatic correspondent.
"This has always been a problem of mine, this tendency to spread myself too thin," Miss Lewis self-deprecatingly told Esquire magazine in 1980, after she had left reporting to be a columnist again. "I dabble. I'll write about a gastronomic binge, I'll write about NATO, I'll do an interview with Nureyev, I'll do a political piece. I don't know a hell of a lot about anything."
Her journalism won her many awards, including one for distinguished diplomatic reporting from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Affairs. 
Flora Lewis was born in Los Angeles on July 29, 1922, the daughter of Benjamin Lewis, a lawyer, and the former Pauline Kallin, a pianist. A precocious child, Flora graduated from high school at 15 and entered the University of California at Los Angeles, where she earned a bachelor of arts summa cum laude and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. 
After receiving a graduate degree at the Columbia University School of Journalism the following year, she became a reporter for The Associated Press. She worked in New York City for an Associated Press service aimed at British subscribers, later covering the Navy and State Departments in Washington until 1945, when the agency sent her to London.
There, in 1945, she married Sydney Gruson, a correspondent in The Times's London bureau. Over the next two decades, the couple worked -- for separate newspapers -- in London, Jerusalem, Prague, Warsaw, Geneva, Bonn, Paris and Mexico City. Her articles also appeared in many European publications, among them The Observer, The Economist and The Financial Times in London and France-Soir in Paris.
"I worked for everybody," she said, including The New York Times Magazine, but not for the newspaper itself. The Times's rules then barred her from being hired as long as her husband also worked there.
So in 1956, when Mr. Gruson was The Times's correspondent in Warsaw, Miss Lewis was hired by The Washington Post. Her extensive reporting of the Polish Communists' attempt to liberalize their government that year won her an Overseas Press Club award for best interpretation of foreign affairs. 
Later she reported from Bonn, Eastern Europe and London for The Post and in 1965 was chosen to open the paper's bureau in New York City. A year after that, Mr. Gruson was transferred to Paris to run the International Edition that The Times was publishing there. Miss Lewis went with him and began writing her syndicated column for Newsday, calling it "Today Abroad."
Newspapers were mostly a man's world, as shown by the way The New York Post announced that it was acquiring her column in 1967. "She can arrive home after a hectic day of reporting at the United Nations, and within minutes she's an excellent hostess and a marvelous companion to her husband," The Post reassured its readers. By that time, Miss Lewis and Mr. Gruson were the parents of three children. When asked how she managed both family and career, Miss Lewis would sometimes joke, "By neglecting both." 
For her column, Miss Lewis roamed the globe, reporting on the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and making five trips to Vietnam during the fighting there. "By the time I got to Vietnam," she said, "I found the battlefield stories no longer very interesting. I was tired of reading about bullets that whoosh and marines screaming in anguish, and I didn't want to write it yet again."
It was not until 1972, after she and Mr. Gruson separated, that she joined The Times. (They were later divorced.) The Times's executive editor, A. M. Rosenthal, who had said, "Flora is the world's greatest correspondent," named her to head the Paris bureau.
Mr. Gruson, who later became a senior executive of The Times and a member of its board, died in 1998. Their daughter Sheila Gruson died in 1999. Miss Lewis is survived by her son, Lindsey Gruson, a former reporter for The Times who operates a marketing company, Stet Inc., in South Kent, Conn., and a daughter, Kerry Gruson, a member of The Times's bureau in Miami.
In a spacious apartment near the French Parliament, Miss Lewis, a stylish but conservative dresser with memorably blue eyes, entertained the political and journalistic elite of Paris for more than a quarter of a century.
Her first major assignment for The Times was the secret peace talks in Paris between Henry A. Kissinger and the North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho, which produced a short-lived cease-fire in Vietnam in 1973.
Mr. Rosenthal asked her in 1976 if she would become chief of the Washington Bureau in the event that another correspondent he had already asked, Hedrick Smith, turned down the job. If he had, Miss Lewis would have been the first woman in the post, but Mr. Smith accepted.
Miss Lewis was amused but also insulted by the overture. "It was as though he had said, 'If my fiancee jilts me at the altar, will you stand in?' " she later told Nan Robertson, a former Times reporter, who described the incident in a book, "The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and The New York Times" (Random House, 1992). 
Mr. Rosenthal, Miss Lewis learned later, was infuriated to find her quoted in the book. But the point she wanted to make was that, as she put it, "No man would ever have offered another man a job in that way." 
Instead Mr. Rosenthal made Miss Lewis European diplomatic correspondent, assigning her to pull together "a whole range of subjects -- party and ideological trends, the Common Market, diplomatic initiatives." In that role she covered the emerging European Economic Community, now the European Union. 
"The salient fact about Europe remains the nation-state," she wrote in her book "Europe" in 1992. "There is a sense of shared Europeanness which has waxed and waned in the last two generations, but it is still secondary to the sense of unique nationality which began to arise after the Renaissance and the decline of feudalism." 
As she put it, 'It is the same old Europe, and it changes every day."
Not long ago, recalling the years when she traveled the world as a correspondent and a columnist, she said: "There are stories you work on where you know this is really big, important history, and they are almost always bad news, disasters or tragedies. But covering President Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 was different -- there was an atmosphere of such joy and delight, both in Israel and in Egypt, that it was an inspiring experience."
"I've gone as far as Tokyo, Havana, Cape Town," she told Esquire in 1980. "I've spent almost my entire adult life abroad, and I find that in some ways I've become something of a foreigner myself. I keep telling myself that at some point I'd like to get over that."
Yet her columns had a distinctively American voice.
"The old idea was that history was about kings and popes and wars; people, yes, but only the few who held dazzling power," she wrote in her last regular column for The Times at the end of 1990. "More and more people are coming to realize that they can choose their history. What a wonderful time to have been able to watch up close!"

HEADLINE: Russia's Role in Iran and Iraq 

BYLINE:  By Stephen Sestanovich; Stephen Sestanovich is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and professor of international diplomacy at Columbia.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush and President Vladimir Putin of Russia made a little history when they signed the Treaty of Moscow to cut the nuclear arsenals of both nations. Yet the principles they agreed on were little different from what Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin had agreed on countless times in the past: nuclear arms reductions, cooperation between Russia and NATO, solidarity against 21st century threats, increased trade and investment, and so on. What the new leaders add is the political strength and authority to make these ideas real. Seventy-percent approval ratings have their uses.
 Now Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin have to turn to problems on which their predecessors could not agree. Iran and Iraq top the list. Mr. Putin is politically stronger than Mr. Yeltsin ever was, and he may be more willing to accommodate the United States on these issues, too. But it won't be easy. Organized Russian trade and economic interests -- as powerful a force in Russian policy today as ideology was in the past -- stand in his way. 
 Iran and Iraq have created problems in Russian-American relations for years. In the last decade both have had good relations with Russia while the United States has considered them enemies. American officials have long complained that Russian diplomats shield Iraq from pressure in the United Nations. And George Tenet recently told Congress that Iran still gets "significant" Russian help on long-range missiles and nuclear weapons. 
President Bush has two advantages in pushing for Russian cooperation that President Clinton did not have. The new amity between Moscow and Washington, which Mr. Putin surely wants to preserve, gives him reason to help us. And Mr. Bush's strong rhetoric makes plain that for him Iran and Iraq stand above all other problems. 
So Mr. Putin is repositioning himself -- but only a little. Russian diplomats, who last year blocked revisions to the international sanctions imposed on Iraq, have joined with the United States to put a revised program in place. Where they used to say Iraq needs assurances that sanctions would be lifted if Iraq met international demands, the Russians now emphasize Iraq's obligation to show that it has no weapons of mass destruction. Russian commentators say the Kremlin knows how stupid it would be to wait too long to switch sides.
Russia's handling of Iran also hints at change. After Mr. Bush's "axis of evil" speech in January, Mr. Putin quickly canceled a visit to Moscow by the Iranian foreign minister. Recently he broke with Tehran on territorial control of the Caspian Sea, siding for the first time with other energy-producing states in the region. And in Moscow, Mr. Putin offered what President Bush called "comforting" assurances about safeguards for the nuclear reactor Russia is building in Iran in the Persian Gulf city of Bushehr.
These steps are a start, but they do not wrest control from Russian domestic interests that benefit most from keeping Russian policy on Iran and Iraq as it is.
Russian companies have by far the largest share of Iraqi trade under the United Nations' oil-for-food program, and Iraqi officials admit this favoritism has only one purpose: to buy Russian support. Saddam Hussein has also offered Russian companies the rights to vast future energy development projects -- worth, Russians boast, as much as $60 billion.
That's why Russian oil and gas companies and major exporters to Iraq want Mr. Putin to maintain Iraq's favor by making sure that inspections do not threaten Saddam Hussein. Meanwhile, the Russian nuclear-power industry wants him to keep Iran's favor by making sure restrictions at Bushehr do not block covert nuclear cooperation. So far both groups are getting what they want.
Russian officials tell Americans they are ready to discuss ways to insure that the Bushehr reactor doesn't help Iran's nuclear weapons program. But the offer is irrelevant as long as Russia provides Iran dangerous nuclear assistance outside of the Bushehr project -- and denies it. The Bush administration may not be willing to put up with double-dealing on this issue for very long. 
Mr. Putin can't be happy with the box he is in. If he yields to pressure from Mr. Bush, he gives an opening to critics who say he lets Washington push him around. But rejecting American concerns, which some of his advisers clearly favor, takes the shine off a relationship that is now the centerpiece of Russian foreign policy.
Still, he may feel a little less squeezed by Mr. Bush than he did before the recent summit. In Moscow, President Bush showed that he is not demanding an immediate solution on Iran and won't berate Mr. Putin about it in public. And Russia is under less pressure on Iraq while the United States weighs its options for dealing with Saddam Hussein.
Yet Mr. Putin can't draw much comfort from this reprieve. Having seen the Clinton-Yeltsin relationship decline, he knows the difference between a real partnership and one that limps along with key geopolitical issues unresolved. 
There is a way to ease Mr. Putin's predicament that could help him avert a clash with Washington without seeming to embrace American policy outright: He can close the gap between Russian actions and Russian rhetoric.
If Russian diplomats became unyielding advocates of an exhaustive and unconditional inspections regime in Iraq -- and showed they meant it -- they would not be doing Washington's bidding but carrying out their own stated policy. And if Mr. Putin stopped letting the Russian nuclear-power establishment provide dangerous technology to Iran -- something he says he opposes -- he would only be enforcing official Russian policy.
Neither Tehran nor Baghdad will like Russian policies that mean what they say. Saddam Hussein may retaliate by ending the favoritism Russian companies now enjoy. The Iranians may say that if the flow of illicit technology is cut off they'll cut back their legitimate trade with Russia, too.
Standing up to Russian business interests will carry political costs for Mr. Putin. But by doing so, he can enhance American confidence in the new partnership with Russia -- perhaps enough to get Washington to discuss how Russia's economic sacrifices should be recognized. 
Iran and Iraq have taken a toll on Russian-American relations for a long time. Mr. Putin has a chance to break this pattern. Unless he does, we may remember the summit for its promise of an alliance that might have been -- but wasn't.

HEADLINE: SOCCER; 
U.S. Soccer: Sport of 70's, 80's and 90's Still Waits

BYLINE:  By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, June 2 

 BODY:
True, none of the American players are married to a Spice Girl, as is England's top star. President Bush did not invite the national team over for a send-off luncheon, as did Italy's prime minister. The loss of a starting midfielder to injury did not send the country into a panic attack. And the American coach has no personal biographer, as does his counterpart in China.
 This lack of national passion has prompted the same question to be asked repeatedly and skeptically for decades: When is soccer going to make it in the United States? 
 The truth is, in some important ways, it already has. 
The men's national team is in its fourth consecutive World Cup, which continues through June 30 in South Korea and Japan, and will play its opening game on Wednesday against Portugal. The women's national team is the reigning world champion. The American women finished second at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the men fourth. Professional leagues for both men and women were born after the United States played host to a World Cup, a Women's World Cup and a Summer Olympics.
Appealing to both sexes in nearly equal numbers, soccer is the only team sport to experience growth in participation between 1990 and 2000, according to American Sports Data Inc. In college, soccer has overtaken track and field as the No. 1 participatory sport for women. From ages 6 to 17, 7.25 million Americans play soccer frequently, significantly more than the number who play baseball (4.75 million), according to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association.
"That explosion is intimidating the other leagues," said Don Garber, the commissioner of Major League Soccer, the men's professional league, and a former executive of the National Football League. 
Fifteen years ago, the men's national team played before tiny crowds of 2,000 or 3,000. Now, the team regularly draws crowds of 30,000 or more at stadiums around the country. The 1999 Women's World Cup final between the United States and China drew 40 million television viewers, the largest TV audience for a soccer game in this country. In 1990, the sport's national governing body, U.S. Soccer, was a mom-and-pop operation with a budget of less than $10 million. Recently it approved a budget triple that size.
As the world shrinks and economies become more global, corporate sponsors are increasingly enthusiastic about soccer, the most pervasively global sport, said Tony Ponturo, vice president for sports marketing at Anheuser-Busch, a World Cup sponsor since 1986. And soccer is also well positioned to accommodate the changing demographics in the United States. It is particularly appealing to the Hispanic population, whose explosive growth reached 35 million, according to the latest census figures.
"I think soccer is arriving, accelerating into the station, but I wouldn't go so far to say that it has arrived," said Rick Burton, executive director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon's college of business. "I'm not sure the networks or traditional leagues are yet sure how to think about soccer. But I perceive it will continue to grow in the U.S. I think over time soccer will become bigger than a niche sport."

Leagues Are Struggling
Soccer officials are convinced that the sport will become the fifth major league sport in the United States. They also concede that it will take a number of years. Using this World Cup to build interest will be challenging, even if the United States is successful. Its first-round games against Portugal, South Korea and Poland will be played while most Americans are sleeping.
The professional leagues both remain economically fragile. M.L.S., now in its seventh season, has piled up losses of $250 million to $300 million, evidence of a weak television contract with ABC and ESPN. M.L.S. dropped two teams before the current season, reducing the number of franchises from 12 to 10. Philip Anschutz, the billionaire entertainment and telecommunications mogul, has an ownership share in six of the remaining teams, a sign that the league is struggling to attract investors and could fold if one man loses interest.
The Women's United Soccer Association lost $40 million in 2001, its first year of operation, roughly the total it had expected to lose over four seasons before becoming profitable. Television ratings for both leagues remain pallid. The W.U.S.A. switched from TNT to the PAX TV network this year and reached only 81,000 households in its opening week. Attendance is down nearly 14 percent with an average audience of 7,164 through 31 games this season, compared with 8,104 a year ago.
If they are to build soccer into a pillar sport, officials in both leagues said they must convert participants into fans, that is, into regular ticket buyers and television viewers. They must continue to educate the news media and advertisers, develop more star players and unite disparate constituencies that love the game but often clash and impede soccer's development.
"We still have a difficult task ahead to convert masses of people into fans of the professional game here," said Kevin Payne, managing director of soccer for the Anschutz Entertainment Group. "We basically have to create a whole new culture, a habit of supporting those teams."
There are encouraging signs for both the men's and women's leagues. M.L.S. has received commitments from its investors and television partners through 2006. Attendance at M.L.S. games is up this season to 16,228 through 48 games this year, from 14,961 a year ago, a number that approaches the attendance figures for the top arena sports like basketball and hockey. In New York, the MetroStars draw higher television ratings than the Islanders on the Madison Square Garden cable network. In Washington, D.C. United averaged more than 20,000 fans a game last season, which by Payne's calculation would have ranked third in the respected Scottish Premier League and among the top three in England's second-tier league, the First Division.
The W.U.S.A., which fields the best female players in the world from the United States, China, Norway, Brazil and Germany, has a five-year commitment from its investors. It has added Maytag, Coca-Cola and McDonald's as sponsors. And it has the promotional advantage of being the only sports league fully owned by news media outlets, like Comcast, AOL Time Warner and Cox cable systems. Last year, the women's league drew higher cable ratings than M.L.S. when W.U.S.A.'s games were broadcast on TNT. This year the ratings for both leagues have been disappointing.
As soccer officials point out, the N.F.L. was formed in the 1920's, but not until the 1958 championship game between the Giants and Baltimore Colts did professional football gain nationwide legitimacy. And, four decades after the N.B.A. was founded, its championship series was still being broadcast on a tape delay. Yet this is a more impatient era, with many more entertainment options and generally declining attendance and television ratings in professional sports. Leagues do not have as much time to prove themselves with fans and investors as they once did. Soccer finds itself caught between its own expectations and comparisons to other, more established leagues.
"For soccer to occupy a place, not necessarily the No. 1 place, is not a bad thing at all," said David Downs, president of sports at Univision, the Miami-based network that holds Spanish broadcast television rights to the World Cup in the United States. "My fear is that someone will say, 'We're not the equivalent of the N.F.L. or baseball, therefore we don't belong.' "

A Soccer-Specific 'Buzz'
To promote the sport more aggressively, M.L.S. bought the American television rights to the 2002 and 2006 men's World Cups and the 2003 Women's World Cup for a reported $40 million. It is on a campaign to build soccer-specific stadiums, which would allow the league to control revenues, foster an intimate atmosphere for the game and create a demand for tickets. A 70,000-seat football stadium can seem empty for a soccer match, even with 20,000 people in the stands.
A soccer-only stadium seating 22,500 has been built for the Columbus Crew, and the Los Angeles Galaxy is scheduled next year to move into a 27,000-seat stadium that will also serve as a national soccer training center. The league hopes four or five soccer-specific stadiums will be built in the next five years.
"A Lakers game seats 25,000 people," said Clint Mathis, the most reliable scorer on the MetroStars and the national team. "The place is sold out. People want to go because you can't go. It creates a buzz."
New stadiums alone, as baseball has learned, do not attract fans. Not for long, anyway. Better players will attract more fans. While the American women pioneered the rise of female soccer internationally in the mid-1980's, the American men fell decades behind the development of the game, failing to qualify for the World Cup between 1950 and 1990.
"We have to understand we are a developing nation in this sport," said Bruce Arena, coach of the men's national team.
The key to the future of American soccer is player development, he said. In soccer-consumed countries like England and Italy, that task is handled by professional club teams. The best youth players are identified and signed to apprentice contracts when they are 12 or 13 or 14 and given a stipend and professional coaching. By contrast, American youngsters grow up in leagues often run by well-meaning amateurs who have little coaching or playing experience.
M.L.S. has clearly enhanced the caliber of its American players. Eleven of the 23 players on the World Cup team were harvested from M.L.S. rosters. And the league's Project-40, which is designed to place the top high school and college-age players in a professional environment, has produced three players on this World Cup team -- forward Josh Wolff and midfielders Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley. The difference is, while the United States has identified 40 or 50 young players with exquisite talent, other countries may have identified 400 or 500.
"Realistically, our player development isn't very good," Arena said. "Basically, every other country in the world, player development is an important objective of professional clubs. We don't have a player development system yet in M.L.S. Having said that, we're doing all right, given our shortcomings. It's not like years ago on youth teams where the first soccer game a coach saw was the one he coached in."

Trawling for Fans
As M.L.S. seeks to develop a larger number of high-caliber players, it also seeks to develop more ardent fans. In that regard, the league has reversed course, deciding not to cultivate the casual sports fan as much as the established soccer fan. The mantra is: Go fishing where the fish are.
As a group, there is no more of a receptive audience to soccer than the Hispanic population. But U.S. Soccer has historically done a poor job of recruiting Hispanic players into its youth leagues. And many Hispanic fans have yet to be converted into fans of M.L.S. or the American national team, preferring to follow national teams in Mexico, Central America and South America and to watch what is considered to be better competition in the Mexican League or in leagues in Europe or South America.
"We have to build credibility in our jerseys and in our names," Payne said.
In the long term, soccer officials are convinced they can do that with fans and corporate sponsors. They believe that the youth players of today will become spectators of tomorrow and that the grass-roots organization of soccer enables sponsors to reach their target audience more efficiently than with any other sport.
Marketing experts believe the lack of commercial interruption may position soccer appealingly to sponsors, who can place their advertising on the screen as the game plays on and avoid the channel surfing that accompanies timeouts and breaks in football, baseball and basketball.
"I don't necessarily think we will break into the top four, but I think we can find a place in the landscape of greater importance than we already are," said Dan Flynn, the secretary general of U.S. Soccer.

Adversaries' Envoys In a Deepening Standoff
As senior Bush administration officials prepared for a new round of arm-twisting aimed at resolving the dangerous military standoff between India and Pakistan, the two adversaries' ambassadors in Washington each spoke in terms that showed little flexibility or movement toward negotiations. Meanwhile, President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan and Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India both headed for a regional conference in Kazakhstan, where President Vladimir Putin of Russia has offered to serve as a broker in a meeting between them. A1

Israel Backs Military Option
As Israeli forces swept through the West Bank city of Nablus for a third day, the country's leaders said that unilateral military action was the best path to security. George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, is scheduled to visit Israel to promote an overhaul of the Palestinian security forces that would make them more effective at blocking violence against Israel. But with Israeli troops raiding Palestinian areas regularly, the notion of cooperation between the Israeli and Palestinian security forces has been all but abandoned. A4

Arrests in Mexico Killings
Sixteen people were jailed in Mexico on suspicion of killing 26 villagers from rural Oaxaca in a vendetta over land. The suspects were residents of nearby villages that have fought the people of Santiago Xochiltepec for many years. A state prosecutor said he had not ruled out the possibility that the massacre had its roots in a fight between low-level drug traffickers. A3

Swiss Ease Abortion Laws
Swiss voters have agreed to ease the country's strict abortion laws, and to bring them closer to much of the rest of the continent's laws and the actual practice in Switzerland. Abortions will be allowed in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, provided the woman requests the procedure in writing and agrees to counseling and medical advice. A4

Canadian Minister Ousted
Canada's finance minister, Paul Martin, left, has been forced to resign by Prime Minister Jean Chretien in a contest over the leadership of the Liberal Party that has thrown the government into its largest crisis yet. Mr. Chretien had warned that he would fire anyone organizing for the convention to decide who will be the leader, and Mr. Martin has been planning a run at the leadership post for years. He was replaced by Deputy Prime Minister John Manley, a moderate former tax lawyer and loyal ally of Mr. Chretien's. A7

Choosing Afghan Leaders
With a conference to pick a transitional government to run Afghanistan for up to two years a week away, enthusiasm and political pressures have risen in equal measure. A9

C.I.A. on Hijacker's Trail Months Earlier Than It Said
The Central Intelligence Agency has said in a classified chronology submitted to Congress that it had picked up the trail of a Qaeda operative who turned out to be a Sept. 11 hijacker months earlier than it has previously acknowledged, government officials said. A1

Perils of a Prosecution Witness
Essam Al Ridi, a former federal witness, helped convict a Qaeda member early last year in connection with a plot to bomb American embassies. But since then, Mr. Al Ridi said, he has faced reprisals, including a detention during a trip home to Egypt, and the loss of his job with a Middle Eastern airline. He sees his treatment as a sign of potential perils facing Arabs and Muslims who assist the F.B.I. in the war on terror. A1

A Shift on Global Warming
In a stark shift for the Bush administration, the United States has sent a report to the United Nations detailing far-reaching effects that it says global warming will inflict on the American environment. The administration for the first time places most of the blame for recent global warming on human actions. But while the report says the environment will be changed substantially in the next few decades, it does not advocate major changes in administration policy on greenhouse gases. A1

Candidates Clash in Alabama
For the last 10 years, the all-but-invulnerable occupant of Alabama's Seventh Congressional District seat has been Earl F. Hilliard, the state's first black representative since Reconstruction. But Mr. Hilliard suddenly finds himself battling for his political life against a lawyer, Artur Davis, in a Democratic primary contest that is getting dirtier by the day. A10

When Faith and Zoning Collide
A federal law enacted in 2000 prohibits zoning regulations that impose a substantial burden on religious exercise unless the government can show that there is a compelling interest in doing so, and that there is no less restrictive option. The measure has unleashed a torrent of litigation. A10

A Shrinking Shrimp Market
Shrimpers in Louisiana's Cajun country are facing prices at the pier that are lower than they have been in decades. Demand has suffered through an economic hangover and a post-Sept. 11 plunge in travel and entertainment spending. A13

Studying Cloning's Potential
Cows implanted with cells taken from a cloned embryo did not experience immune rejection, showing the potential of therapeutic cloning, researchers said. The technology is opposed by many, but some scientists who oppose the cloning of humans say that therapeutic cloning should be pursued because it could supply healthy tissue to treat a variety of illnesses.

Studies Say Welfare Rules May Discourage Marriage
Just as the White House is seeking welfare legislation with more stringent work requirements and more support for marriage, new research findings in Connecticut and Iowa show that the stricter rules significantly reduce the chances that a single mother will wed. A1

Harbor on a Hard Drive
Over the next decade, millions of tons of silt, sand and muck must be dredged from New York Harbor to keep the port competitive. Knowing what is in that mud, how it moves and where pollutants in it come from could save hundreds of millions of dollars. In pursuit of the answers, experts are using computer models to create what may be the most sophisticated analysis ever of how a harbor system actually works. B1

Parkway Disrupted by Blaze
One home was destroyed and nine others were damaged, hundreds of residents were evacuated, and a 24-mile stretch of the Garden State Parkway was closed yesterday by a windblown forest fire that engulfed more than 1,000 acres of tinder-dry pinelands several miles inland from the Central New Jersey shore. B1

Relocating the Mentally Ill
When state officials moved in March to close Seaport Manor in Brooklyn, long one of New York's most notoriously troubled adult homes for the mentally ill, they pledged to do all they could to protect the safety and well-being of its nearly 300 residents. But the home's discharge records and interviews with officials show that the state, in coordination with Seaport's management, has merely been relocating many of the profoundly ill residents to other adult homes that have their own histories of neglect.

Ground Zero on the Cusp
Many of them said they would be back to leave flowers and written messages for their dead relatives, and to mark a lifetime of anniversaries ahead. Still, a memorial service for the families of more than 2,800 victims of the World Trade Center attack held enough finality for organizers to call it the Ground Zero Closing Ceremony. B3

HEADLINE: Generational Battle Turns Nasty in Alabama Primary 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala., June 1 

 BODY:
Just how much of a re-election fight Representative Earl F. Hilliard has on his hands became clear in a live television interview two days ago, when he asserted that his challenger in Tuesday's primary, a 34-year-old lawyer named Artur Davis, had been forced to resign as a federal prosecutor "because of a date-rape charge."
 Mr. Hilliard later admitted that he had no idea whether the accusation was true. It was not. But the damage was done -- although the question remained: to whom? 
 For Democrats, Alabama's Seventh District seat is as safe as they get -- Al Gore won here by 46 points in 2000 -- and for the last 10 years its all-but-invulnerable occupant has been Mr. Hilliard, 60, the first black representative from Alabama since Reconstruction. But Mr. Hilliard suddenly finds himself battling for his political life against Mr. Davis in a race that is getting dirtier by the day. 
It is a now-familiar generational struggle for black leadership, and its outcome could seal the fate of the Jefferson County Citizens Coalition, the once-dominant political machine that Mr. Hilliard helped found in the 1970's but that has lost control of the mayor's office, the City Council and the school board in successive anti-incumbent landslides.
Strange as it may seem, this contest, in a district spanning six of the nation's poorest counties, has also become a surrogate battle -- waged with contributions from New York lawyers, Detroit doctors and Silicon Valley C.E.O.'s -- between supporters of Israel incensed by Mr. Hilliard's maverick views on the Middle East, and grateful Arab-Americans and Muslims who are eager to flex their political muscles.
Mr. Hilliard, a lifelong Birmingham resident, is a fixture in politics here, serving 18 years in the Alabama House and Senate before moving to Washington. But his opponent, who ran a vigorous but underfinanced campaign two years ago, has gotten all the breaks this time, the biggest coming in January, when the district's lines were redrawn.
Democrats who hoped to pick up the Third District seat, which a Republican had given up to run for governor, shifted heavily black and Democratic areas, including Montgomery, from Mr. Hilliard's district to the Third. To make matters worse for Mr. Hilliard, those areas, where he trounced Mr. Davis in 2000, were replaced by largely white portions of greater Birmingham and Tuscaloosa Counties, where Mr. Davis ran strongest. Mr. Hilliard says he was a victim of white racists in Alabama's Democratic party.
Mr. Davis has never held elective office. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he worked in the United States attorney's office in his native Montgomery, then began handling criminal defense, employment discrimination and civil rights cases in Birmingham. While Mr. Hilliard derides Mr. Davis's credentials -- "The only thing he's done for black people is put them in jail," he scoffs -- the race has centered on Mr. Hilliard's record. 
He boasts of helping to lure Mercedes and Hyundai auto factories to the district, and of aiding isolated communities like Gees Bend, where he revived a ferry across the Alabama River that cut a school bus ride to 20 minutes from 2 hours.
Mr. Davis counters that Mr. Hilliard has failed to improve the economy, health care or education in the dirt-poor Black Belt. "If you had an employee who had not done anything in 10 years, I don't think you'd give him another 15 and see if he gets it," Mr. Davis told a group of black cardiologists here on Thursday.
Mr. Hilliard, a reliable liberal vote, has won far more attention for ethical lapses. He did not pay his taxes. Last summer, he was rebuked by the House Ethics Committee for converting campaign gifts to his own use. Mr. Davis is running television advertisements that warn: "He scammed then. He's scamming now."
Mr. Hilliard's frequent overseas travel also got him branded the top junketer in Congress. One of those trips, in 1997, was a widely criticized fact-finding mission to Libya.
Though his district includes few Jews, Arab-Americans or Muslims, Mr. Hilliard has been voluble on the subject of Israeli-Palestinian tensions. In his view, "they ought to sit down and work out their problems, and if they can't, the U.S. ought to pull out, cut off all its aid, to both sides."
Jews in Birmingham have long seen Mr. Hilliard as hostile to Israel, and when Mr. Davis emerged as a credible alternative, Donald Hess, the retired chief executive of the Parisian department store chain, supported him. In April, he introduced Mr. Davis to the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, the powerful pro-Israel lobby. That led to a fund-raising swing through several New York law firms.
There, Mr. Davis called attention to Mr. Hilliard's May 2 vote against a resolution in support of Israel's fight against terrorism. He also passed out a flier he said had been distributed by Hilliard supporters at a recent political convention in Alabama. "Davis and the Jews," it reads, "No Good for the Black Belt." Mr. Hilliard called the sheet ignorant and said he had nothing to do with it.
But donors reacted, and Mr. Davis has shamed Mr. Hilliard in the fund-raising department since April, raising $364,122 compared with $157,575 for the incumbent.
Arab-Americans and Muslims have rallied to Mr. Hilliard's side, though to a lesser degree. A May 4 fund-raiser in Silicon Valley produced $26,150, and more checks have trickled in from Arabs in Michigan and elsewhere since James Zogby, president of the American-Arab Institute, wrote a syndicated column noting Mr. Davis's pro-Israel backers.
Mr. Davis is bombarding Mr. Hilliard with commercials that depict him as an embarrassment. One contrasts images of ground zero with a bill Mr. Hilliard offered to lift sanctions against countries that sponsor terrorism. Mr. Hilliard is shown smiling and clapping opposite pictures of Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein and Muammar el-Qaddafi.
Mr. Hilliard has not been subjected to this kind of attack before, and it is unclear how effective it will be. He said Mr. Davis's advertisements are too "slick" for the rural counties in the district, where Mr. Hilliard hopes to swamp Mr. Davis. Mr. Hilliard's only television commercial is an unslick direct appeal to viewers. He is also running radio testimonials by his mother, his pastor and Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia.
But Mr. Hilliard acknowledged he was concerned, and a confidant said Mr. Hilliard believes he will have to face Mr. Davis in a runoff, as a third candidate, a political unknown named Samuel Wiggins III, is likely to siphon some votes from people turned off by the campaign's tone. The primary winner will go to Washington; no Republican is running.
Mr. Davis says Mr. Hilliard has become desperate. What else, he said, could explain Mr. Hilliard's false claim that Mr. Davis had once faced a date-rape charge? Mr. Davis's boss at the time, who is now the chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party, quickly pronounced the accusation baseless, and Mr. Hilliard backed away from it, though it did eclipse Mr. Davis's endorsement by the mayor of Birmingham, Bernard Kincaid.
Mr. Davis said he now fears Mr. Hilliard will "play the race card" and try to smear him as an Uncle Tom in the waning days of the race. He may be right. Mr. Hilliard held a notepad in an interview Friday. On it someone had scrawled three talking points about his opponent. The third: "Like Clarence Thomas."

HEADLINE: Strict Limits on Welfare Benefits Discourage Marriage, Studies Say 

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
For years, work and marriage have been seen as twin pillars of welfare reform. But just as President Bush is seeking welfare legislation with more stringent work requirements and more support for marriage, an unexpected contradiction is emerging. New research findings in two states show that the stricter work requirements of contemporary welfare policy significantly reduce the chances that a single mother will wed.
 Though policy makers disagreed in the past about whether old-style welfare was encouraging out-of-wedlock births, neither critics nor champions of the nation's 1996 welfare overhaul contemplated the possibility that replacing welfare with work would discourage marriage. But that is what researchers have found in separate, rigorous studies of welfare programs in Connecticut and Iowa. 
 Researchers suggest two main reasons. Like middle-class married women whose divorce rates spiked when jobs and rising wages made them more self-reliant, some women who moved from welfare to work may have become less willing to settle for the wrong man, they say. At the same time, strict work requirements and low wages may have left some mothers with less time, energy and income to attract a partner or nourish a relationship. 
"Tough love, less romance," summarized Bruce Fuller, a social scientist at the University of California and an author of the Connecticut study. He privately discussed similar findings with Thomas M. Fraker, the author of the unpublished Iowa evaluation, which is awaiting state approval. "If tough-love work policies suppressed marriage at this magnitude nationwide, just under a quarter-million women would not be getting married in any one year," Professor Fuller said.
But Wade F. Horn, the Bush administration official who oversees the welfare program, said on Friday, "We see nothing inconsistent between what we're trying to accomplish and results of the Connecticut study and others."
Referring to the administration's proposal to spend $300 million on demonstration projects like premarital counseling and pro-marriage education campaigns, he added: "What those two studies say to me is, if you up the work requirement and do nothing to support healthy marriages, you get less healthy marriage. Now let's see if you provide supports for healthy marriages, you get more healthy marriage."
The effect of changes in welfare on marriage surfaced first in an evaluation of preschool children whose mothers were randomly assigned to Connecticut's program, known as Jobs First. Researchers at the University of California, Columbia, Yale and Stanford were startled to discover that three years later, only 7 percent of the mothers who had gone through Jobs First were married and living with a spouse, compared with 15 percent of those randomly assigned to receive traditional welfare grants under the old program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Among women in the two groups with stronger employment histories, the gap was even greater: 6 percent versus 18 percent.
Now, researchers say, the same wedding gap has shown up in Iowa, in the results of a much larger welfare evaluation. It was conducted by Mathematica, a research corporation, under a state contract that forbids public release of the findings without approval by state officials. At the close of the study, which followed 4,000 women for as long as six years, 32 percent of the old-style welfare group were married, but only 24 percent of the welfare applicants assigned to Iowa's new program, a mix of work requirements, sanctions and incentives typical of many states' new welfare programs.
Child-bearing was not affected in either study. In both, the majority of women in the control groups -- those in the traditional programs -- also left welfare for jobs during the economic boom of the 1990's, but welfare-to-work programs raised the rate of employment for the others, by margins of 6 to 11 percent. Yet in Iowa, more work and less marriage added up to less money. When contributions from other household members were counted, the welfare-to-work mothers averaged $300 less each month than mothers assigned to traditional welfare.
In interviews, women who were subjects of the Connecticut study echoed theories about new self-reliance and greater stress, even as they described more complicated reasons for broken engagements and failed relationships.
"I enjoyed my independence," said Jennifer Clark, 26, a mother of two in North Haven, Conn., explaining why she would not push to marry the father of her second child, Hannah, 1. Ms. Clark said she had successfully studied and worked, and supported her older daughter, Erica, now 6, partly through a welfare grant she collected under the old rules while earning a bookkeeping degree that tripled her wages, to $15 an hour.
But Ms. Clark soon made it clear that staying single was not really her choice. She and her former boyfriend, a chef, lived together for three years before she became pregnant with Hannah. Serious medical problems forced her to quit her job, she said, and Hannah's father was unwilling or unable to shoulder the added economic burden. As she tells it, he left, refused her suggestions that they get counseling, and became involved with another woman.
"I'm not even interested in dating right now," Ms. Clark added, cheerfully describing a demanding schedule and the 21-month limit on her public assistance under the Jobs First program. She and the children are living with her parents as she tries to find a job, attend mandatory welfare-to-work classes, and continue volunteering with Erica's school and a Girl Scout troop.
The new findings might seem inconsistent with an earlier study that found a small decline in the proportion of low-income children living in one-parent households without other adults, and another that found a two-percentage-point increase in marriage among 2,000 low-income women in Boston, Chicago and San Antonio. But those studies did not focus on welfare applicants, their authors noted. Unlike the Connecticut and Iowa evaluations, they were not set up to separate the impact of welfare policy from the strong economy and other factors. And the results are quite compatible, said Andrew Cherlin, a professor of public policy at Johns Hopkins University and an author of the three-city study.
Women in his sample who had left the welfare rolls divided into two very different groups, he said: "those who are doing better, and those who are now doing much worse -- because they have neither income from welfare or from work." Women in the first group have become more desirable as marriage partners, Professor Cherlin said, but also feel less necessity to be married. Women in the second group may be more eager to share the cost of housing with other adults, but they are less attractive on the marriage market.
"You can't overestimate the importance of economics in why poor people get married," he added. "It's not that romance is unimportant to low-income men and women, it's that it has to be secondary to having a sufficient income."
Women from the Connecticut study spoke of both the potential benefits of marriage and its pitfalls.
"Are they going to give discounts on divorces when they promote marriage?" asked Nicole Carvell, 30, of Coventry, Conn. She said she fled an abusive husband when their daughter was an infant and her son about 5, and was "floored" when the first divorce lawyer she called wanted a $2,500 retainer. Assigned to Jobs First when she applied for aid, she got by on a mix of public assistance and part-time wages of $9.50 an hour in the same bank job she has held since she was 19.
She finally found a lawyer willing to accept installments of $30 a month, she said, but by the time her husband was ordered to pay $94.50 a week in child support, he was in prison. When her aid ended, she increased her hours at the bank and gave up her dream to study social work at college.
Now, she said, she is happily engaged to a man with "a swell job" who is the father of her third child, a 2-year-old boy. But he pays steep child support for a son of his own, she said, adding, "We don't have a set date, only because of money."
Stacey Whitly, 30, of New Haven, another Jobs First subject and a mother of six, said the father of her youngest child is no longer a good marriage prospect since he lost his job digging ditches. But she, too, was engaged at one time, to a carpenter who is the father of her 8-year-old twins. Ms. Whitly said their relationship foundered when she temporarily moved to North Carolina to escape shootings in her neighborhood. The carpenter, who pays no child support, is now married to another woman.
Money in the Bush proposal could be used to offer financial incentives to poor couples who wed, Mr. Horn said, but only as part of a state program to foster healthy marriages. "If what's happening is that women are becoming more economically independent and shedding abusive boyfriends, that's a good thing," he said. "The president's proposal is not about moving marriage rates."
E. Mavis Hetherington, an emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Virginia whose new book "For Better or for Worse: Divorce Reconsidered" (W. W. Norton) draws on her three-decade-long study of couples, said the need was for "hard-nosed research to find a program that works, and is not based on religious beliefs or moral beliefs or political needs."
Very positive results were reported from a pilot welfare project in Minnesota in 2000, she noted, including a 40 percent increase in marriages among parents who had been living together and a 18 percent decline in domestic violence. But by the time the results of that pilot were known, it had been replaced by a far less generous statewide program that lowered income eligibility, decreased training and incentives, stiffened sanctions and set time limits.
Increasing federal work requirements for mothers already short of good child care will be counterproductive, she said. "Welfare reform where people are worse off and they're under more stress -- how's that going to help you be more secure in your relationships?"

HEADLINE: Experts Searching for Ways to Fill the Vaccine Gap 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE BERGER 

 BODY:
Within blocks of Dr. Max Van Gilder's bustling pediatric office near Central Park in Manhattan, patients and their parents can readily find bubble bath from France, chocolates from Belgium and fresh melon from South America. But for months now, Dr. Van Gilder's youngest patients have had to wait for their shots against diseases like measles and diphtheria and to come back to his office once they were available.
 "I never know on a given day which vaccines I'm going to be able to give children and which ones I'll run out of and won't be able to get," Dr. Van Gilder said. "It's very frustrating and very time consuming." 
 At the Southwest Community Health Center in Santa Rosa, Calif., Dr. Panna Lossy has been similarly frustrated by a sporadic supply of vaccines. She also worries about whether her patients' parents, most of them laborers from Mexico, will be able to come back for the delayed inoculations. 
Across the country, whether in private practices treating privileged children or public clinics helping the neediest, a shortage of American-made vaccines has been disrupting the normal schedule of inoculations for 8 of the 11 preventable childhood diseases since last year. No outbreaks have been attributed to the inconsistent supplies, and enough vaccine has been available for the crucial first doses.
But experts say the shortages are sobering, underscoring the shrinking number of companies making vaccines and a tangle of legal and financial issues that may be choking supplies. 
"We've got a complex system of regulations that have served us well but now may be serving as barriers," said Dr. Louis Z. Cooper, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. "The system needs significant upgrading."
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, is studying why the shortages happened and how others might be prevented. A report is expected in July. Experts convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Vaccine Advisory Committee are also preparing recommendations.
Better stockpiles, a national authority to oversee vaccine development and financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies to stay in the market, like tax breaks or higher prices, are among the possible solutions, said Dr. Walter A. Orenstein, director of the C.D.C.'s National Immunization Program.
"This is the worst shortage that I can remember," said Dr. Orenstein, who has been in his field for more than 25 years. In the mid-1980's, he noted, lawsuits alleging neurological damage from the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, or whooping cough, led to a brief shortage.
This time, no single cause is to blame. The problem has involved three companies and five products, including some longtime staples of preventative medicine: the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, now known as DTaP; the Td booster shot for tetanus and diphtheria that is given to teenagers and adults; M.M.R. for measles, mumps and rubella; the varicella, or chickenpox, vaccine; and a relatively new vaccine called Prevnar that protects against seven strains of pneumococcal bacteria.
Dr. Lossy and others said they were bracing for complications in school enrollment but so far the problems have been most apparent in day care centers and preschools, whose infants and toddlers are in the heaviest inoculation period.
At the Church of the Covenant Day Care Center in Cleveland, Carolyn Pfeiffer, the director, said she had given 30-day extensions to many families unable to get vaccines on schedule. The shortages have seemed worse recently, and private physicians are referring parents to county clinics, which seem to get supplies faster.
"These are working parents," Ms. Pfeiffer noted. "To get to the doctor, they have to take off work, and when you can't get the shot, you have to turn around and take another day off."
Parents involved in the early childhood program of the Jewish Community Association of Austin are keenly aware of the shortages and seem to be helping one another avoid long delays. "A lot of our parents are doctors and they treat each other," said Bill Carver, the director.
"It's kind of ironic that just when we're getting stricter on enforcement of vaccines and we know how well they're working that we're having a shortage," he said. For now, the C.D.C. has issued a new schedule for inoculations that defers shots to stretch limited supplies. The agency has also recommended that doctors keep lists of patients needing delayed vaccines and call the patients once supplies are available.
Residual immunity probably accounts for the absence of serious problems in the recent shortages, Dr. Cooper said. But as evidence of the thin line against disease, he cited recent outbreaks of measles in Britain, where fears of a link between the M.M.R. vaccine and autism, largely discredited, have caused a drop in inoculations.
"We've never had higher immunization levels or lower numbers of cases of vaccine-preventable diseases, so we've been able to coast on the high levels," Dr. Cooper said. "But we don't have a lot of margin of safety."
In New York, Ned Levinsohn had to bring his son Adam, 6 1/2 months old, back to Dr. Van Gilder's office one extra time for shots of DTaP and Prevnar that were not available on schedule. Adam's six-month checkup then had to be delayed for spacing between doses.
"I was concerned, and then the doctor assured me that as long as he's on schedule now and stays on schedule that he's fine," said Mr. Levinsohn, a copywriter who works from home.
Problems with the supplies began in January 2001 when Wyeth Pharmaceuticals announced plans to stop production of its tetanus and diphtheria vaccines after 50 years. That left two manufacturers, Aventis Pasteur and Glaxo SmithKline for DTaP. Moreover, Aventis was left as the sole maker of the Td booster.
But those vaccines by Aventis needed to be completely reformulated to meet new standards -- a joint recommendation in 1999 by the Public Health Service and the American Academy of Pediatrics to avoid using a mercury-containing preservative called thimerosal. (Glaxo SmithKline did not use thimerosal in its DTaP vaccine so the new advisory did not affect its production.) 
Yield dropped drastically as Aventis sought clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to switch from the multidose vials containing thimerosal to single-dose vials without it. Production was further delayed because the single-shot vials require more liquid to ensure that a full dose is drawn up into the injection needle.
"The thimerosal notice took effect in the middle of 1999, and we got F.D.A. approval in March 2001, two months after Wyeth discontinued their product," said Len Lavenda, an Aventis spokesman. Aventis is also seeking F.D.A. approval for a DTaP vaccine made by an affiliated Canadian company.
Wyeth's decision to stop making DTaP and the tetanus booster stemmed in part from its development of Prevnar, also known PCV-7, Natalie de Vane, a spokeswoman, said. Introduced in February 2000, Prevnar protects against infections as diverse as earaches and meningitis, and it was immediately popular. But as demand exploded, a disruption in the filling stage slowed production. Wyeth hopes supplies will return to normal by year's end.
Still another pharmaceutical firm, Merck & Company, experienced its own production delays that led to shortages of the M.M.R. and chickenpox vaccines. Merck, the country's sole maker of those vaccines, operates one vaccine-filling plant in West Point, Pa., and twice shut down that site for repairs in August and September.
The first closing lasted about a week and followed a routine F.D.A. inspection. The second closing, for a planned renovation, lasted about a month. Production resumed in late October, a company spokesman said, but supplies are not expected to return to normal until this summer.
Even under ideal circumstances, vaccines are tricky to make and can take almost a year to get from the lab to the doctor's office. Unlike synthetic drugs, they are grown from live organisms -- bacteria and viruses -- an unpredictable process.
The time it takes to make vaccines, the cost of meeting government standards and the limited number of doses given in a lifetime -- compared with the long-term use of many prescription drugs -- all contribute to smaller profits for vaccine makers. Over time, the pool of licensed vaccine makers in the United States has dropped to four major companies from more than two dozen in 1967, according to government reports cited by Mr. Lavenda and others.
"It's no secret that the economics of vaccine manufacturing are not as attractive as the economics of pharmaceuticals manufacturing," Mr. Lavenda said.

HEADLINE: Hartford Budget Gap 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Connecticut's Budget Antics" (editorial, May 28):
 Gov. John G. Rowland vetoed the Democratic budget not just because it had an increase in the income tax but because it was unbalanced, violated the spending cap and had one-time gimmicks (including a temporary income tax surcharge on millionaires) that inflated the outyear gap to more than $600 million. 
 Any cuts in the Democrats' budget were suggested by the governor. Still, the Democrats added tens of millions in new spending. Since then, Governor Rowland has proposed $250 million in reductions, but the Democrats can tolerate less than $30 million in real cuts.
As for the millionaire's surcharge, it would have amounted to a marginal rate increase of 22 percent. Governor Rowland rejected it because the Democrats' class warfare would have changed behavior on the part of high-wealth individuals, eroded our tax base and hurt the economy. That would have meant deeper spending cuts down the road.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW; 
When the Dead Keep Coming Back to Life

BYLINE:  By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
You have to admire a venturesome spirit like Kenny Finkle, the young author of "Transatlantica." The play at the Flea Theater in TriBeCa is a lunatic fable that considers love and death and fate in a series of ever more preposterous iterations. Meant to be Dadaist or surreal, it's the kind of show that consciously walks the line between purposeful wit and meaningless idiocy, that wants to make you laugh at its zany nonsense and reflect upon it philosophically as well.
 No one writes stuff like this much anymore, and that's generally a good thing; the gift for absurdist comedy is parceled out to only a few people. And if Mr. Finkle had turned out to be one of them, perhaps there would be more to admire here than a spirit of literary adventure. But "Transatlantica" is a largely juvenile script, and only two in the cast of six understand how to inhabit an absurd character; the others are merely making absurd gestures. And though the production, directed by Tim Cummings, strains mightily for momentum, it sinks under the weight of dopey jokes and repetition. This is a play in which every time someone says, "Oh, dear!" someone else assumes a deer has arrived. Eventually, of course, one does. 
 Set in a through-the-looking-glass land with elements of Victorian England, contemporary Manhattan and a garden petting zoo, the play is populated by two-legged hyperbolic idiosyncrasies rather than people. To begin with there is a psychiatrist, Reginald Reinhold (Jack O'Neill), with the undemonstrative British cool of Sherlock Holmes, who is constantly asking, "And how does that make you feel?"
Joining him are his wife, Natasha, who is consistently overwrought (Beth Tapper, who consistently overacts) and keeps dying and being reborn. There is Inspector Strang-Jay (Greg Keller), who is investigating the death of Reinhold's servant, ostensibly a suicide, and there is Jacques Jacques (pronounced zha-kwezz zha-kwezz), played stiffly with a painted smile by Dean Strange, who is inexplicably the object of everyone's obsessive affection. He also dies several times.
The other two characters are a woman in a baby-blue nightgown named Ilyria, a patient of Rheinhold's who is evidently doomed and who dies or feigns death half a dozen times (see what I mean by repetition?), and Udi Bohe, an unemployed theater director. Neither of them is written with any particular aplomb, but they are at least played by imaginative actors.
As Ilyria, Jennifer McKenna, who isn't much more than three feet tall and is possessed of a marvelous vocal elasticity (she is capable of a gleefully unselfconscious Munchkin imitation), so exploits her unusual physical qualities that you believe that an alternative universe just might exist. And as Udi, Alfredo Narciso takes elements of an Eastern European accent, elements of effeminate elocution and some pronunciation rule that he seems to have mustered on his own and invents a new way to speak English. (In his lexicon, "you" becomes "kavoo.") The language is matched by his nutty costume (he wears a red, tubelike fez, a dark head cloth and some kind of Persian robe) and a peculiar, exaggerated walk.
The two are as odd a couple as you'll see on the stage, and the funniest moment in the show is when they put on an actual show; acting as actors, they speak without affect, in the mundane idiom of contemporary New Yorkers. Of course, like everything in "Transatlantica," it goes on and on, beating a startling joke into witlessness.

HEADLINE: Choreographer Sees Change of Heart on Frankfurt Ballet 

BYLINE:  By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS, June 3 

 BODY:
The American choreographer William Forsythe said today that Frankfurt city officials have told him they want his acclaimed dance company, the Frankfurt Ballet, to continue working in the city after his current contract ends in 2004. But he added that a deal was not assured, as the city's finances are in dire straits.
 Mr. Forsythe, 52, who has headed the Frankfurt Ballet since 1984, said last week that he had learned from local newspapers and politicians that the city government had decided not to renew his contract and was contemplating replacing his experimental company with a classical dance company. 
 "I personally do not know how all of this started, but apparently there is a desire now to correct what happened," he said in a telephone interview from Frankfurt after meeting with Frankfurt's mayor, Petra Roth. "Neither they nor I will say there is a solution because we will now begin to discuss exactly what is possible in the new contract and what they expect."
Under Mr. Forsythe, the Frankfurt Ballet has become one of Europe's leading dance companies, touring all over the world. His choreography is performed by major companies, including the New York City Ballet, the Paris Opera Ballet and the Royal Ballet. 
Although the city government had made no statement about its plans for the dance company, Mr. Forsythe said he was sure that Ms. Roth's conciliatory position today was the result of widespread publicity about the supposed threat to the Frankfurt Ballet as well as "thousands of letters and e-mails" from the international artistic community expressing support for the company. "The mayor called me on Friday and said, 'We cannot handle the pressure,' " he added.
Mr. Forsythe acknowledged that the city was experiencing a severe financial crisis. At today's meeting, Ms. Roth was accompanied not only by the city's cultural director, Bernhard Nordhoff, but also by its treasurer, Horst Hemzal.
After the meeting a news release from the Frankfurt Ballet today said: "Representatives of the municipal authorities made it clear that further increase of the budget for the city's performing arts groups must be excluded due to the city's extremely difficult financial situation. Strict discipline must be adhered to and the planned budget restrictions need to be respected. It was furthermore stated that the artistic rank of the Frankfurt Ballet and William Forsythe is undisputed."
The Frankfurt Ballet currently receives the equivalent of $5.7 million a year in grants from the city government. This accounts for around 87 percent of its budget. Noting that "I do have sympathy for the financial difficulties," Mr. Forsythe said that he could keep the company alive with the same budget "or a little less."
Asked whether the mayor had mentioned the possibility of installing a classical ballet company in the place of his troupe, Mr. Forsythe said this would be contingent on whether his contract was renewed. "I think that is a decision that will be made after the negotiations have been completed," he added.
He said he hoped that the negotiations could be concluded within the next two weeks. "It would be best for everyone if we come to a quick decision," he noted. "I would be very happy if the city would say yes or no. I have received some extraordinary offers which I cannot discuss. The most important thing for me is that I am able to live and work in a non-hostile environment."
Both sides, he said, had agreed not to disclose the substance of their talks. Spokesmen for Ms. Roth could not be reached because of the late hour, although Mr. Forsythe said that she had agreed that no statement should be issued beyond the Frankfurt Ballet's brief news release.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Accounting Woes and World Strife Take Toll on Shares

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Skepticism about corporate accounting practices and worries about conflicts overseas spurred investors to sell shares yesterday, sending the Nasdaq composite index to its lowest level in eight months and the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 200 points. 
 Investors still nervous about accounting practices after the collapse of Enron were upset by reports that the chief executive of Tyco International had resigned and that Microsoft had agreed to settle charges that it misrepresented its finances. The market disregarded two positive economic reports in the process. 
 "Companies are reporting profits that are not real; they are restating results; people just don't have confidence in companies," said Al Mirman, a strategist at V Finance in Sarasota, Fla. 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 215.46 points, or 2.2 percent, at 9,709.79. The last time the Dow finished lower was on Feb. 7, when it ended at 9,625.44. It has not had a bigger one-day point drop since Feb. 4, when it lost 220.17. 
The broader stock indicators also tumbled. The Nasdaq composite lost 53.17 points, or 3.3 percent, to 1,562.56, its lowest close since Oct. 2, when it was at 1,492.33. The last time it had a bigger one-day point loss was on April 2, when it sank 58.22 points. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 26.46 points, or 2.5 percent, to 1,040.68.
Selling accelerated in the final hour yesterday, a development analysts attributed to program selling set off when the Dow broke below 9,800. Institutional investors often select a certain level at which to sell blocks of stocks. 
"And no one is around to buy. No one is interested," said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst at Prudential Securities. 
The market has not closed higher since May 23, six sessions ago. Since then, the Dow has slid 509.29 points, or 5.0 percent. The Nasdaq has lost 135.07 points, or 8 percent, and the S.& P. 500 has dropped 45.34 points, or 4.2 percent. 
Tyco dropped $5.90, to $16.05, on reports that the chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski, had resigned unexpectedly.
Microsoft fell $1.49, to $49.42, after the company agreed to refrain from accounting violations as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission of accusations that it misstated results. 
These developments overshadowed optimistic economic news.
The Institute for Supply Management, which tracks the manufacturing sector, said its index of business activity rose to 55.7 in May, better than the 55 reading that analysts had forecast. And the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.2 percent in April. 
Prospects of disappointing earnings also weighed on stocks. The home-improvement retailer Lowe's fell $1.91, to $45.25, after reducing its 2002 outlook. 
Ford Motor slipped 34 cents, to $17.31, after the company reported sales decreased about 12 percent in May. --------------------

Treasury Prices Increase
By Bloomberg News
 Treasury prices increased yesterday as a decline in the stock markets bolstered interest in fixed-rate government securities. 
By late in the day, the 10-year note increased 11/32, to a price of 99 2/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, declined to 5 percent from 5.04 percent on Friday.
The 30-year bond also rose, rising 8/32, to 96 27/32. Its yield declined to 5.60 percent from 5.62 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE ROAD; 
Rail Projects Are Sign of a Quiet Revolution in Short-Haul Trips

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; On the Road appears each Tuesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
DELTA AIR LINES, for one, is plenty worried about business travelers who are so fed up with airport problems that they're switching to the train on East Coast routes. In an attempt to portray the train as an inferior option to flying, Delta's ads do everything but imply that train passengers have to watch out for Jesse James and his gang shooting up the lounge car.
 The clear recent success of Amtrak's Northeast corridor rail system, and especially of the high-speed Acela trains that share it, is usually treated as an incidental consequence of the catastrophe of Sept. 11. 
 Hot-air hurricanes rage in Washington and in airline corporate suites about the future of an air transport system based on huge, speculative passenger-growth projections that some critics contend are unrealistic. But a quiet revolution is gathering force, led by business travelers who, in numbers now big enough to truly frighten the airlines, have either found other ways to get there, or alternatives to going in the first place. 
All over the country, ambitious new intercity rail projects are being envisioned, often by states in partnership with private industry. In California, speedy rail service between San Diego and Los Angeles is going to be extended up to San Francisco. In the Midwest, work has already begun on a big high-speed rail project that will link Chicago and other cities in nine states. In Florida, plans are advancing for a high-speed link between Orlando and Miami. In Texas, there's talk of a high-speed link between Houston and Dallas. 
At the heart of this new activity is a growing awareness among transportation planners that business travel demand in the United States is, at least, somewhat similar to Continental Europe, where a vast network of national high-speed train systems has nearly eliminated air trips between cities less than 400 miles apart.
"About 60 percent of airline flights in North America are less than 400 miles in length," Louis A. Turpen, the chief executive of the Greater Toronto Airports Authority, told international airport and transport officials meeting in Boca Raton, Fla., yesterday at the Airport Summit, a gathering sponsored by Marcus Evans, a business information company.
High-speed rail networks "bleed the short-haul capacity out of the system," freeing airports to do what they do best: handle long-distance trips, Mr. Turpen said. Meanwhile, he added, "we must establish airports as intermodal transportation points, and not just places to take off and land airplanes."
That means airports as modern transportation and business hubs, where high-speed and commuter rail links converge to feed into national and international air-transport networks.
That's the kind of airport that Juergen E. Bartels, the chief executive of Meridien Hotels and Resorts was showing off the other day as he thumbed through illustrations showing what the Frankfurt Airport's new AirRail Center will look like once Meridien opens a 680-room luxury high-technology hotel that is under construction there. The soaring edifice is being built on a platform over the high-speed train terminal at the airport.
A passionate advocate of high-speed rail as a vital component of a nation's transportation system, Mr. Bartels noted that planning in European nations for the current systems began decades ago, after Japan led the way in the mid-1960's with its bullet trains. "It's almost as if it is revelation to America that this works," Mr. Bartels said with some astonishment. 
In Europe, where even track gauges didn't match between some countries after World War II, planning has become so coordinated that "they're now integrating all of Europe into one train model, encompassing even the regional and commuter trains from the inner cities," Mr. Bartels said.
His native Germany moved aggressively into high-speed rail planning only in the early 1980's. "Germany had lost what they call the train culture," he said. "The German trains were dirty, they were not on time and the employees were surly." Inspired by energetic high-speed rail initiatives in France, much of the rest of Europe, Germany included, soon developed its own networks. In Germany, "they're spending gazillions on new tracks" for expanded high-speed service, he said.
"They are succeeding at establishing a culture that gets the business traveler out of the plane and into the train" for flights within Germany and to nearby foreign cities, "thus freeing the air space for long-distance flights, which is what it should be used for," he added.
Putting a five-star hotel at the new kind of air-rail transportation hub represented by airports like the one in Frankfurt is a logical, necessary refinement in that plan, he said. Typically, airport hotels are drab and "utilitarian," Mr. Bartels said, adding: "I want to have the best airport hotel in the world. That title is currently vacant, by the way."
Facilities for business conferences and small meetings are a major part of the planning for the new Meridien hotel at the Frankfurt AirRail Center. This reflects the reality of modern business travel in which more business is being conducted right at the airport itself, Mr. Bartels said.
"I would be interested to build this type of hotel at major U.S. airports," he said, pointing out that many airports are deeply into terminal expansion projects costing billions of dollars. At some airports in the United States, airport managers and local and regional government and business planners are already designing accommodations for various kinds of rail links.
Like many outside of governmental transportation planning in the United States, Mr. Bartels is baffled as to why so little has been done to develop rail alternatives to short-distance flying.
Mr. Turpen, the Toronto airport executive who was previously the chief executive of San Francisco International Airport, suggested yesterday at the Airport Summit that the time had come to begin more intense work on building high-speed rail links tied to the air system. "We've got to start to reverse this trend that there is an inalienable right to fly" under all circumstances, he said.
In the United States, where Congress is quibbling about renewing an annual budget for Amtrak that would barely pay for a short stretch of Interstate highway or a single airport runway, serious advocates of intercity rail transport have to share both budget and podium with dewy-eyed romantics who want to funnel rail money into maintaining long-distance trains that some in the industry say merely subsidize "land cruises" for leisure travelers. 
Lose those 20th Century Limited infatuations, Mr. Bartels suggested. "It has nothing to do with romance," he said. "It's about business and the vaunted American productivity. In the United States, you can simply no longer justify the economic costs and lost productivity of traveling short distances by air."

HEADLINE: With Tribal Chic, Chunky Jewelry Is Back 

BYLINE:  By GINIA BELLAFANTE 

 BODY:
Flipping through the June issue of Vogue magazine, one gets the sense that a certain female population has experienced exponential growth. The number of young women -- beautiful, multinamed and transcontinental -- who have taken up jewelry design appears to be expanding at the same pace as Californians becoming nutritionally dependent on wheat grass. 
 In Vogue, readers learn that "the chic London jeweler" Solange Azagury-Partridge likes Stephen Hawking and that the "chic bohemian jewelry designer" Marie-Helene de Taillac now divides her time between Paris and Jaipur. There is news too of Jade Jagger. 
 Despite what global economic realities might suggest, it turns out that this is a good year to be a jeweler. Fashion's current mythologizing of peasant and tribal cultures has sparked an interest in showy displays of turquoise, coral and other chunky stones not seen since the heyday of Joni Mitchell. More telling, at the JCK show, a massive trade exposition of both high-end and low-end jewelry, which ends in Las Vegas today, the number of buyers attending increased by almost 10 percent over last year, Hedda Schupak, a coordinator of the show, said.
Jewelry is outselling handbags and other accessories at Henri Bendel, said Ed Burstell, the store's vice president and general manager. The jewelry he carries -- sculptured pendants, beaded necklaces -- is priced at $100 to $1,000. At Kirna Zabete in SoHo, where chokers, earrings and bracelets are similarly priced, jewelry sales are up 30 percent this spring over last spring, Sarah Easley, the store's co-owner, said. What women seem drawn to are lines like Sweet Pea, made from semiprecious stones. "Nothing is little or wimpy," Ms. Easley said. "The stones may be tiny but they are cascading down your neck."
Uptown, the jewelry business at Bloomingdale's is "on fire," as its fashion director, Kal Ruttenstein, put it. "I think it stems from a desire to go away from minimalism." 
A desire to get away from minimalism is not what trend forecasters were predicting in the somber days of last fall and winter. That women would clamor for earrings resembling chandeliers and neck pieces thick as tires seemed as unlikely as the release of "The Sum of All Fears."
But to Ms. Schupak, the notion that jewelry would find embrace at this particular moment makes sense. "It's very simple," Ms. Schupak, who also edits the trade publication Jewelers' Circular Keystone, said. "After 9/11, people want things that are sentimental and permanent."
She continued: "They want to tell their loved ones, 'You mean a lot to me.' You spend $900 on a suit and you take a bite of a drippy taco and let's face it -- that's the end of the suit. Obviously, with a piece of jewelry, you can have it forever, get it re-styled when you're tired of it and pass it on to your grandchild."
The move away from minimalism began, fashion editors will testify, with the arrival of the Fendi baguette. "Three years ago, there was this embellishment thing with Fendi," Michelle Sanders, the accessories director at Vogue, said. "You couldn't wear jewelry. It was too much; some of those baguettes were encrusted with pearls."
The fashion world's consideration of turquoise arose, Ms. Sanders believes, with the role it played in the spring collections for Chloe and Yves Saint Laurent. "That was very impactful," she noted.
Others speculate that women who once sought personal stylistic expression through vintage clothing have become bored and shifted their attentions to other forms of adornment. "It was good for a while but it's definitely a business that is declining," Mr. Burstell said, referring to the industry that once was known as "old clothes." This fall, he plans to stop selling vintage dresses and focus instead on vintage jewels.
A walk through NoLIta in Lower Manhattan has come to feel like a walk through a jewelry district, with stores selling everything from ear cuffs to cuff links. The latest addition is Dinosaur Designs, which opened on Mott Street two weeks ago. Dinosaur is an Australian company specializing in housewares, bangles and neck chains. "So far, since we've opened, we've only sold jewelry," the store's manager, Matthew Lucas, said. The jewelry is priced from $30 into the hundreds.
"Our company has always expanded during periods of recession," Mr. Lucas explained. "Women can't afford a whole outfit, but for $50 they can really jazz things up."
It would appear that the hunger for pieces costing many thousands of dollars has not necessarily gone dormant either. A few weeks ago, Chanel opened a fine-jewelry shop on Madison Avenue because that segment of the business was doing well, Arie L. Kopelman, the president of Chanel Inc., said. Here one can find white gold bracelets for $1,250 or diamond broaches for $520,000.
Over the Memorial Day weekend in Scottsdale, Ariz., a fine-jewelry fair known as the Couture Show attracted 170 exhibitors, as opposed to 150 last year. One designer, Catherine Carmendy, who has been attending for a number of years, said this time she received the highest number of orders ever, most for pieces $3,500 to $25,000. 
"I came really not knowing what to expect," Ms. Carmendy said. "But people are buying jewelry. Maybe it means we're acclimating."

A Great Gig: $1.50, Standing-Room Only

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Carolina Slim -- born Elijah Staley 75 years ago on a farm near Denmark, S.C. -- remembers the air of disrepute that dogged bluesmen like him around the South.
 "Had a baaaaad name," he says. 
 This memory returns to him with particular clarity whenever he plugs in his old olive-green Fender Mustang, puts pick to strings and starts singing the blues down in the subway, his juke joint of the last decade.
"People think I got to play in the subway," he explained last Friday, between songs at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue. "I don't got to play in the subway. I want to play in the subway." 
He adjusted his porkpie hat the way Rodney Dangerfield adjusts his tie. "Don't get no respect in the subway," he muttered. "I mean what I say, you dig what I mean, O.K.?"
But he, and 14 other musicians who have performed there for years -- who have made the platform their stage and the turnstile their ticket booth, singing and playing everything from the didgeridoo to the paint bucket -- will soon get a measure of that elusive respect.
Several months ago, a concert producer named Peter Gross began working his way slowly through the subway with an interesting idea: to find the best subway performers and hire them to play a benefit concert for New York Cares, the citywide volunteer group.
Mr. Gross had no trouble finding the musicians -- in fact, he heard far too many excellent ones to include. He found a date and time, Thursday, June 20, at 8 p.m. And then he found a venue, one where a subway train will never interrupt a solo and where it always costs more than $1.50 to get in: Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center.
"Y'all come on up to the Fisher Hall!" yelled Mr. Staley on Friday, hiking his pants legs off his ankles to cool down. "You're going to hear something!"
It is a measure of how misunderstood subway performing is that many of the musicians, though they are being paid generously for participating in the high-profile concert, can actually earn more on a slow Monday performing in a noisy corner of Penn Station, passing the hat and selling CD's of their music.
And even if the benefit packs Avery Fisher Hall to its capacity of 2,800, it will be a bit of a deflation in attendance for Mr. Staley and most of his fellow musicians, who perform to devoted subway crowds every week that easily top 10,000.
The subway, they say, is no longer the place where good performers simply start or end their days. It is where many stay gladly, making a nice living, reaching a huge audience and moonlighting elsewhere.
Lorenzo La Roc, an electric violinist who has become a kind of underground institution, calls the subway his stable day job. "And it's a very good one," he said yesterday at Penn Station. "People have no idea."
Mr. La Roc does not like to talk about the exact dimensions of his subway earnings. Like many performers there, he makes so much that he worries about thieves and tax auditors, in equal measure.
But, suffice it to say that in a good year, he makes more than many newspaper reporters and as much as some of the lawyers who walk past him, wondering if they should hire him to play their son's bar mitzvah.
Sean Grissom, an electric cellist who, like Mr. La Roc, was trained at Juilliard, makes a quarter of his income playing only one day a week in the subway and routinely carries so much change to the bank that one gave him an official $50 United States Mint coin bag, to make things easier. "The subway," Mr. Grissom said, "is as valid a gig as playing Carnegie Hall."
As a side benefit, it also helps him and others develop great powers of concentration. "When I'm in performance now, a bomb could go off and I wouldn't miss a bow stroke," Mr. La Roc said.
Mr. Gross, a former entertainment lawyer who has produced other benefit concerts, decided to go into the subway and find music because he has always loved both. But he also went for much more personal reasons.
His son, Matthew, a budding rock musician, was one of the people shot atop the Empire State Building in February 1997, when a Palestinian teacher opened fire on the observation deck. His son, shot in the head, survived but is still facing a long and painful recovery.
That experience, Mr. Gross said, created a deep need in him to help people, and also to find ways to bring more underestimated musicians into the spotlight.
Mr. Staley, playing last Friday in the subway, knows that this spotlight is swinging his way now. But in the meantime, he still has to deal with unforgiving critics.
An undercover police officer walked up, told him to turn down his amplifier, and then threatened to throw him out of the subway altogether. Mr. Staley glared as the officer stalked away. "Talk to me like that!" he said, under his breath. "Does he know who I am?"

HEADLINE: Windows on the World Workers Say Their Boss Didn't Do Enough 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Immediately after Sept. 11, David Emil, whose company ran Windows on the World at the top of the World Trade Center, pledged to do his utmost to help the restaurant's workers and their families. Not only did he promise to help find work for the 350 Windows workers who survived but were left jobless, but he also helped set up a charity that has raised $18 million for the families of more than 100 food workers who died that day at Windows and other trade center restaurant operations.
 But some people who once hailed Mr. Emil as a hero are suddenly calling him a cheat and double-crosser as he prepares to open his next big restaurant, a four-level bright-orange extravaganza with a Latin theme and a dance hall in Times Square, on Broadway at 49th Street. 
 Their passions still raw from Sept. 11, dozens of former Windows workers are furious at Mr. Emil for not giving all 90 jobs at his new restaurant, Noche, to Windows workers. They accuse him of betraying his promise to do his utmost to find jobs for the workers who helped make Windows the nation's highest-grossing restaurant, with $37 million in revenue in its last full year. 
"I'm angry because we believed in him," said Orlando Godoy, a banquet waiter at Windows. "I'm angry because he cheated us. He said we are a big family, that we will be working together. Yes, there's a family, but we get no support from him."
Mr. Emil says he is unnerved by the attacks and insists that the anger stems from misunderstandings and unrealistic expectations. He says he fears that Noche's opening-night gala on Wednesday could be spoiled because a workers' advocacy group is planning a protest outside the restaurant. Two weeks ago, workers demonstrated out front, carrying signs that said, "David Emil, we want our jobs back."
Mr. Emil insists that he has done his best to help the workers. "The truth is, a restaurant of this scale can't possibly have jobs for all of our former employees," he said. "Unfortunately there are a number of former Windows employees who feel that they are entitled to a job at Noche, whether or not they are qualified or even whether a job exists."
Mr. Emil said he knew it would be hard to open a successor to Windows, not only because it might be impossible to ever open another restaurant as beloved, but because he knew feelings over Sept. 11 were still raw.
"We have spent the last eight months and an unbelievable amount of money and emotional energy to build a new restaurant so we could, among other things, employ a lot of people who worked together before," said Mr. Emil, whose restaurant company is managing Noche, which is owned by a financial syndicate. "Short of going out and rebuilding the World Trade Center and a restaurant that employs 450 people, it's a little hard for me to know what more I could personally do."
The Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York, a community group founded after Sept. 11 to help unemployed restaurant workers, asserts that Mr. Emil has not done nearly his utmost to hire former Windows workers. Saru Jayaraman, the center's executive director, said that 96 former union members from Windows applied for jobs at Noche and that only 31 were offered jobs, with 16 of them taking jobs there. 
"If David Emil was going to do everything he said he'd do, he would have made sure that most of Noche's workers came from Windows," said Ms. Jayaraman, whose group gets its funding from several foundations and works closely with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union. "The workers were really looking to Noche as a substantial source of employment. There are thousands of restaurant workers in New York displaced from Sept. 11, and the Windows workers are in hot and heavy competition with those other workers for jobs."
Mr. Emil said that 110 former Windows workers applied for jobs and that he offered jobs to 55 -- 31 of them were union members, and 24 were not. Some of those 31 turned him down because they had higher-paying jobs elsewhere, and he could not hire two of them because they lacked proper immigration papers. 
Several workers said Mr. Emil wanted to hire only a limited number of Windows workers who belonged to the union because he wanted to keep Noche nonunion. But Mr. Emil called that suggestion ridiculous, saying he is happy to work with a union at Noche, which was in the planning stages before Sept. 11. 
In an effort to match jobless Windows workers with openings at Noche, Mr. Emil has met several times with Ms. Jayaraman and representatives of the workers' union. For many of the Windows' workers, there is considerable urgency to their efforts to get hired because their unemployment insurance is scheduled to run out next week. 
Several workers say they expected far more. "We definitely had this sense of family among each other, and he would preach that," said Frank Maelen, a bartender at Windows who applied for a job at Noche, but was not hired. Many former chefs' assistants from Windows said they could not understand why Noche has not hired them. Mr. Emil explained that Noche's chef, Ramiro Jimenez, needed assistants with experience in Latin cooking, but few Windows cooks had that background. 
As for banquet waiters like Mr. Godoy, Mr. Emil rejected them, saying the restaurant needed expert a la carte waiters, not waiters experienced in serving only large functions. 
"There are some people who just didn't have the skills, like it or not," Mr. Emil said. "A lot of the banquet waiters don't have the language skills or the experience to be able to deal with a table of eight guys from Morgan Stanley who want to order seven different dishes."
Such talk angered many Windows workers. "It's ridiculous for him to say that many of them lack the qualifications," said Robert Demand, an organizer with the restaurant employees' union. "This is the best-trained restaurant and kitchen crew in the city. That's what led to Windows' success."
Defending his hiring, Mr. Emil said he filled all eight of Noche's dishwashing positions with former Windows dishwashers. But some former dishwashers say 23 Windows dishwashers sought jobs at Noche.
"Is the answer that we need eight dishwashers, but I should hire 23?" Mr. Emil said. 
If Noche thrives, he said, he plans to hire more former Windows workers. But he said that the protests could backfire if they hurt Noche's business, because that will make it hard to hire more workers.
"I'm very upset by all this," Mr. Emil said. "There are only so many problems that one person can solve."

 CORRECTION:
An article on June 4 about complaints by workers from Windows on the World, the restaurant atop the World Trade Center, referred imprecisely to the employment status of Orlando Godoy, a waiter who criticized David Emil, president of the company, who is opening a new restaurant. Mr. Godoy, who was among former workers seeking jobs, worked part time as a banquet waiter at Windows; he was not a full-time employee.

HEADLINE: Greed Is Bad 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
"The point is, ladies and gentlemen, greed is good. Greed works, greed is right. . . . and greed, mark my words, will save not only Teldar Paper but the other malfunctioning corporation called the U.S.A." 
 Gordon Gekko, the corporate raider who gave that speech in the 1987 movie "Wall Street," got his comeuppance; but in real life his philosophy came to dominate corporate practice. And that is the backstory of the wave of scandal now engulfing American business. 
 Let me be clear: I'm not talking about morality, I'm talking about management theory. As people, corporate leaders are no worse (and no better) than they've always been. What changed were the incentives.
Twenty-five years ago, American corporations bore little resemblance to today's hard-nosed institutions. Indeed, by modern standards they were Socialist republics. C.E.O. salaries were tiny compared with today's lavish packages. Executives didn't focus single-mindedly on maximizing stock prices; they thought of themselves as serving multiple constituencies, including their employees. The quintessential pre-Gekko corporation was known internally as Generous Motors.
These days we are so steeped in greed-is-good ideology that it's hard to imagine that such a system ever worked. In fact, during the generation that followed World War II the nation's standard of living doubled. But then, growth faltered -- and the corporate raiders arrived.
The raiders claimed -- usually correctly -- that they could increase profits, and hence stock prices, by inducing companies to get leaner and meaner. By replacing much of a company's stock with debt, they forced management to shape up or go bankrupt. At the same time, by giving executives a large personal stake in the company's stock price, they induced them to do whatever it took to drive that price higher.
All of this made sense to professors of corporate finance. Gekko's speech was practically a textbook exposition of "principal-agent" theory, which says that managers' pay should depend strongly on stock prices: "Today management has no stake in the company. Together the men sitting here the top executives own less than 3 percent of the company." 
And in the 1990's corporations put that theory into practice. The predators faded from the scene, because they were no longer needed; corporate America embraced its inner Gekko. Or as Steven Kaplan of the University of Chicago's business school put it -- approvingly -- in 1998: "We are all Henry Kravis now." The new tough-mindedness was enforced, above all, with executive pay packages that offered princely rewards if stock prices rose.
And until just a few months ago we thought it was working.
Now, as each day seems to bring a new business scandal, we can see the theory's fatal flaw: a system that lavishly rewards executives for success tempts those executives, who control much of the information available to outsiders, to fabricate the appearance of success. Aggressive accounting, fictitious transactions that inflate sales, whatever it takes. 
It's true that in the long run reality catches up with you. But a few years of illusory achievement can leave an executive immensely wealthy. Ken Lay, Gary Winnick, Chuck Watson, Dennis Kozlowski -- all will be consoled in their early retirement by nine-figure nest eggs. Unless you go to jail -- and does anyone think any of our modern malefactors of great wealth will actually do time? -- dishonesty is, hands down, the best policy.
And no, we're not talking about a few bad apples. Statistics for the last five years show a dramatic divergence between the profits companies reported to investors and other measures of profit growth; this is clear evidence that many, perhaps most, large companies were fudging their numbers. 
Now, distrust of corporations threatens our still-tentative economic recovery; it turns out greed is bad, after all. But what will reform our system? Washington seems determined to validate the judgment of the quite apolitical Web site of Corporate Governance (corpgov.net), which matter-of-factly remarks, "Given the power of corporate lobbyists, government control often equates to de facto corporate control anyway." 
Perhaps corporations will reform themselves, but so far they show no signs of changing their ways. And you have to wonder: Who will save that malfunctioning corporation called the U.S.A.?

HEADLINE: Investors Cast Doubt on Energy-Trading Businesses 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
The stocks of several large energy companies fell sharply yesterday as the industry was buffeted by fresh doubts about the continued viability of electricity trading as a major component of its business.
 Shares of the Williams Companies, the natural gas and electricity concern, fell 23 percent amid investor nervousness about accusations made by a former employee that the company tried to manipulate natural gas prices in California two years ago. The employee, Jones Murphy, and others raised questions about Williams' accounting and risk-management practices in an article in The New York Times on Sunday. 
 Shares of Williams fell $3.25, to $10.95, their lowest level in seven years. 
The market was further roiled by news of the apparent suicide of the treasurer of the El Paso Corporation, Charles Dana Rice, who was found dead on Sunday of a gunshot wound in his home in Houston, where El Paso is based. There was no immediate indication that Mr. Rice's death was related to his work at El Paso, and industry executives said Mr. Rice's health had been failing. But his death was reminiscent of the suicide in January of J. Clifford Baxter, a former vice chairman of Enron who shot himself near his Houston home.
Shares of El Paso fell $3.70, or 14.4 percent, to $21.95. 
"This is a tragic event for our company," William A. Wise, El Paso's chairman and chief executive, told The Associated Press. "However, the market reaction is unwarranted."
The plunge in the Williams share price was touched off in large part by comments by a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis of California, who indicated that the state would request an investigation by federal authorities into the accusations that the company manipulated natural gas prices in California in December 2000. 
Executives at Williams, based in Tulsa, Okla., and some other industry leaders dismissed the notion that such manipulation was possible. "The idea that anyone could corner the natural gas market in California shows a complete lack of understanding of the number of players in and the complexity of that market," said Steve Malcolm, the chief executive of Williams.
The collapse of Enron and the continuous trickle of information about its energy-trading and accounting practices have fostered doubts among investors about the industry as a whole, particularly as revelations have emerged about similar practices among its rivals.
Credit-rating agencies have demanded that companies reduce their debt sharply. Some energy companies have sold assets to satisfy the agencies, while the credit ratings of others have crumbled as they determine what they might sell. Either way, the industry is struggling to shore up some important businesses at the cost of jettisoning others. 
Over the last few weeks, El Paso and Aquila Inc. have announced plans to sharply scale back their trading operations. Over the same period, the chief executives of Dynegy, a major power trader, and CMS Energy as well as top executives at Reliant Resources have resigned after trading and accounting turmoil singed their companies.
Late last week, Moody's Investors Service issued a report that said that energy marketing and trading might not remain an investment-grade business unless it was overhauled. Also, energy industry executives told Dow Jones yesterday that in a recent meeting with officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency's chief accountant, Robert Herdman, told them that they inflated trading revenue and had too much leeway regarding how their contracts were valued.
A spokeswoman for the S.E.C. declined to comment on whether the meeting took place but said officials routinely met with industry executives.
Williams was stung by the accusations about the California market, but in a conference call yesterday, its executives were called on by investors and analysts mainly to defend its trading business. "Unlike many of our peers, we do understand how the market works," said Andrew Sunderman, chief financial officer for Williams's energy marketing and trading unit. "We do take risk adjustments into account."
Investors and analysts asked Williams to explain how its traders were compensated and whether the system included an incentive to over-report profits from power contracts. Williams said strict controls were in place to prevent such opportunities. Investors also pressed Williams to explain how it determined the value of long-term contracts that effectively lacked any markets in which prices could be judged and compared. The company said it had a rigorous internal system to evaluate its economic modeling.
But some investors grumbled that Williams's answers did little to shed light on how the company managed risk and forecast the future price of power, upon which much of its earnings were based.
Fredric E. Russell, who owns a Tulsa investment fund that owns 117,000 Williams shares, said that while he did not think Williams was badly run, "by failing to speak directly in crystal-clear English, Williams is casting more doubt on its business."

HEADLINE: Report Says Police Contract Talks Will Make or Break Nassau Budget 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., June 3 

 BODY:
Whether Nassau County ends this year in the red or the black hinges on the outcome of its contract talks with the police unions, the county comptroller said in a report issued here today.
 The county could eke out a modest $9 million year-end surplus if police pay is frozen, said the comptroller, Howard S. Weitzman. But he cautioned that the county would tip into a deficit of nearly $19 million if the police were to win raises matching those in neighboring Suffolk County. 
 The Nassau police are among the highest paid in the nation, and last year with overtime, patrol officers averaged about $95,000.
The comptroller's projections came in an analysis of the county's $2.2 billion budget for the first four months of the year.
Nassau's finances are under close scrutiny because the county government's repeated fiscal troubles in recent years caused the state to impose an oversight board and to give bail-out aid.
The new county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, has been pushing for a police wage freeze and various givebacks in scheduling and other contract rules. The police unions have retaliated by attacking him and demanding their right to arbitration for a new contract.
Gary Dela Raba, president of the largest police union, the Nassau Police Benevolent Association, took issue with the comptroller, asking: "Is Weitzman scapegoating the police officers?"
Uncertainty over the union contracts and the lure of pension-raising overtime since Sept. 11 could lead more police officers than usual to retire this year, the comptroller said. He estimated that the number could exceed 200, in contrast to the 160 projected by Mr. Suozzi, thus raising the cost of termination benefits by $9 million.
The comptroller underscored two other budgetary concerns. The previous administration overcounted Medicaid revenue by about $12 million, he said, and Nassau's sales tax revenue could suffer if New York City's economic troubles spill over to the rest of the region.
The Suozzi administration recently issued its own report for the first three months and projected a $4.5 million surplus. 
The deputy county executive for finance, Arthur Gianelli, said he welcomed the comptroller's report, which he said "will help ensure that we end with a positive fund balance."
Mr. Suozzi and Mr. Weitzman, both Democrats, campaigned on fiscal issues last fall, and their elections ended decades of Republican rule.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING; 
No Regrets Letting This Winner Get Away

BYLINE:  By JOE DRAPE 

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Russell Reineman is neither broke nor senile. He is a businessman and a horse trader who sold 90 percent of War Emblem, the colt that is a mile and a half away from capturing the Triple Crown. His net income from the deal stands at approximately $1.2 million and growing, or, he insists, enough to make the same deal again. Frank Springer, meanwhile, is somewhat tormented.
 As a trainer, Springer knew as early as last spring that War Emblem might be his runner of a lifetime, but he followed horse racing's textbook and in early April advised Reineman to accept an offer from Prince Ahmed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia to sell because Springer knew that X-rays showed the colt had bone chips in both front ankles, as well as in a knee. 
 Alfredo Juarez Jr. and Larry Sterling Jr., meanwhile, are downright delighted at the possibility of becoming footnotes in racing history. 
Juarez helped introduce the strong-willed War Emblem to the racetrack and won two of three races as his jockey; Sterling guided the colt to a six-and-a-quarter-length victory in the Illinois Derby, which turned out to be the impetus for one of the more fortunate purchases in racing history.
None of them will be in New York on Saturday when War Emblem takes part in the 134th running of the Belmont Stakes in the hope of becoming the sport's 12th Triple Crown winner. There are no what-ifs, either, from the folks who owned, trained and rode the 3-year-old colt for all but the eight weeks of his life that have mattered the most.
They never intended to race War Emblem in the Kentucky Derby, they were weighing a shot at the Preakness and had yet to think of the Belmont.
In thoroughbred racing, horses are sold every day at all levels, and many outrun various chips and nicks, with a few even becoming champions like Skip Away, who won 18 races in 38 starts for more than $9.6 million in purses. In the winter leading to a horse's 3-year-old season, the prices get higher and the various maladies tend to be minimized. But until War Emblem came along, no horse on the verge of a Triple Crown had been sold just three weeks before the Derby.
Reineman is a practical man who is up at 5 a.m. and at his southwest Chicago warehouse by 6:30. He has owned horses for 50 years -- good ones like the 1962 2-year-old filly champion Smart Deb and, as his daughter Lynne McCutcheon says, some that have turned into bums. 
Fifty years of buying, breeding and selling horses has taught Reineman, 84, to keep his eye on the bottom line in a business where the costs are constant.
"Every morning he wakes up and turns his alarm clock off, he's $15,000 in the hole with the ponies," said Charles Nuckols III, whose family owns Nuckols Farm near Midway, Ky., where War Emblem was bred, and who has been keeping and breeding horses for Reineman for the past 40 years.
And when Bob Baffert came calling on behalf of the prince three weeks before the Derby, Reineman looked at the books for his own 100-horse breeding stable, as well as for his family business -- the 35-employee Crown Steel Sales, which is a supermarket for individuals and contractors needing material in small quantities. He is hardly broke, as has been suggested, but in a sluggish economy, cash is always welcome.
A deal to sell a half interest in the horse for $300,000 the previous December had fallen apart when the bone chips were discovered. War Emblem's 2-year-old season had been promising, but early this year, he was beaten decisively twice in stakes in New Orleans. The colt then won an allowance race and looked like a world-beater in the $500,000 Illinois Derby, but his victory at Sportsman's Park was considered suspect because he had an easy lead on an oddly configured track. There also were the bone chips, which could sideline him at any moment.
So Reineman, who has yet to meet or speak to the prince, signed the April deal to sell the horse for $900,000, keeping a 10 percent stake for himself, and wished War Emblem good luck.
"When you sell a horse to someone, you want him to do good, because you might want to sell him another horse down the road," Reineman said.
When War Emblem led every step of the way of the Kentucky Derby as a 20-1 shot, Reineman got his wish. The colt's victory, however, was tougher on Springer, a longtime trainer on the Midwest circuit who has a modest 21-horse barn and has never saddled a horse in a Triple Crown race.
By the end of the horse's 2-year-old season, Springer felt he knew how to get the best out of the ornery colt, but what he did not know was that War Emblem had bone chips -- until the December X-rays killed the original deal.
Springer never really believed another buyer would surface, and he entered him in the Illinois Derby. When the colt won and became eligible for a $1 million bonus offered by Sportsman's Park if War Emblem won any leg of the Triple Crown, Springer set his sights on the Preakness, which is a sixteenth of a mile shorter than the Derby and tends to favor front-runners.
Baffert ended that plan.
Baffert has more than 100 horses and a cadre of deep-pocketed owners, and one was the prince, who wanted another crack at the Derby after heavily favored Point Given finished fifth in the race last year. They knew about the chips, but were willing to make a big bet that War Emblem could run well anyway.
"Folks are always looking for a good 3-year-old," Nuckols said. "Everybody else has done the work and they're looking for the glory. Ninety-nine times out of a 100 it doesn't work out; this apparently was the one time it did."
Baffert has been effusive in his praise for Springer's handling of War Emblem and has said he will split the $100,000 trainer's portion of the bonus with him that was promised by Sportsman's Park if the colt captured a leg of the Triple Crown. That windfall, along with the $90,000 commission Springer received in the sale of the horse, is some comfort.
But seeing War Emblem on the verge of the Triple Crown has not been great for his self-esteem. Last week, Springer was contemplating a last-minute escape to Las Vegas to avoid any more inquiries about his advice to Reineman.
"He probably has accomplished more with him than I would have because I was not going to ask him to run these three races," Springer said of Baffert. "Sure, I think about it late at night, but we did what we did because it was the right thing to do."
For Juarez and Sterling, however, their fling with War Emblem is a warm memory about what was rather than what could have been. Both are accomplished jockeys on a respected circuit, and knew instantly they were atop the most talented horse of their careers. Juarez especially has shown good humor. After being unseated and bitten by War Emblem, but still overwhelmingly impressed by the colt, Juarez, a 27-year-old native of Mexico City, made the worst decision of his young career. 
Despite winning an allowance race aboard War Emblem by 10 lengths in the middle of March, Juarez decided to ride a horse from California instead in the Illinois Derby. That horse, Fonz's, finished third. "Yeah, I'd like to have it back," Juarez said with a toothy grin. "He's a tough, silly horse and I made a silly decision. But I want him to win the Belmont."
So does Sterling, 32, who picked up the mount from Juarez, spent not quite two minutes on War Emblem's back in the Illinois Derby and is grateful.
"Those paydays don't come often," Sterling said of his $50,000 paycheck.
It is McCutcheon who best sums up how War Emblem has touched a diverse collection of horse people: with money.
Last week, Allen and Audrey Murray, the Maryland couple with a modest breeding operation, sold the colt's sire, Our Emblem, for a reported $8 million.
"What kind of horse is it that makes everyone money?" McCutcheon asked.
An extraordinary one, apparently. Estimates of War Emblem's current value as a stallion range from $10 million to $20 million, according to two breeders who spoke on condition of anonymity. The horse business rarely works out to such staggering math.
Reineman knows it, understands it and remains a horseman through every superstitious bone of his being. Asked if he was tempted at all to accept the myriad invitations to go to New York and see if his 10 percent of War Emblem can pay off in some priceless history, the old horse trader gives a knowing wink. 
"He won the first two without me," he said. "I certainly don't want to jinx him now."

HEADLINE: Social Security Issue Is Rattling Races for Congress 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: MISHAWAKA, Ind. 

 BODY:
No other issue is generating more scrambling in this year's Congressional elections than Social Security and what Democrats assert is the looming threat of privatization. Consider the House race in this slice of northern Indiana, where the Republican candidate, Chris Chocola, issued a solemn warning recently to the local Rotarians meeting at Honkers Restaurant.
 The Democrats are plotting to "scare seniors," Mr. Chocola, a 40-year-old businessman, told the hushed breakfast crowd. He read from an intercepted e-mail message -- circulated far and wide by top Republicans in Washington -- that features one Democratic aide chortling to another that "bashing Republicans" on Social Security "is sooo fun." Mr. Chocola concluded, "This is everything bad about politics, part of the reason people are so cynical." 
 Around the country, Republicans are launching similar pre-emptive strikes, with remarkable intensity for this early in the campaign, against the attacks they know are coming. Democrats have reassumed, with gusto and more edge than they have shown in years, their favorite role in a midterm election: The Guardians of Social Security.
They say that Republicans like Mr. Chocola are committed to creating private investment accounts in Social Security that will lead, almost inevitably, to cuts in benefits and an unraveling of the traditional system. Democrats say Republicans just do not want to talk about it in an election year, when the House and Senate are up for grabs and the votes of older Americans loom large.
"The Republican effort to walk away from privatization is something we cannot let them do," said Representative Martin Frost, the Texas Democrat who heads his party's caucus in the House. "They've been pushing it for years now and all of a sudden they want to disavow it."
It is a debate largely touched off by the Bush administration's proposal to allow people to divert part of their Social Security taxes into private investment accounts. When he unveiled his idea in the 2000 campaign, Mr. Bush was considered to have boldly -- or brashly -- grasped the legendary third rail of politics and lived to tell of it. Congressional Republicans are far more wary.
Indeed, Mr. Bush is trying to give his fellow Republicans some air cover, providing a videotape for use in town hall meetings in which he declares: "I'm committed to modernization that will not change Social Security benefits for retirees or near-retirees. No changes, no reductions, no way."
Both parties are keenly aware of one demographic reality: Younger people, pollsters say, tend to like the idea of private accounts. For voters under 40, "having money in their own account, that they get to keep, and pass on to their heirs, sounds a lot less risky than trusting that the government will be able to fund the program in 30 years," said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster.
But older Americans tend to be more cautious, fearing the risks and costs of even a partly privatized system. And it is a law of politics that what older Americans think matters more -- certainly in a midterm election, where they cast a disproportionate share of the vote. Americans 60 and older accounted for 28 percent of the vote nationally in the 1998 midterm election; they accounted for 41 percent in Pennsylvania.
"Younger people may have an opinion on Social Security; older people actually vote on Social Security -- and that's a big difference," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster.
Beyond the question of private accounts, the politics of Social Security is inextricably bound up with the struggle over the budget, with Democrats accusing Republicans of squandering the surplus and raiding the Social Security trust funds.
Even by the standards of past Social Security battles, this year's is expected to be nasty, brutish and long. Republican Congressional strategists, alarmed at the potential political cost of the administration's proposal, have devoted themselves to minimizing its impact and inoculating their candidates from Democratic attacks. They say the long-term health of Social Security and the merits of private accounts needs a sober debate, but not in the heat of an election.
Some Republican consultants are advising candidates to avoid the P-word; once a common shorthand, privatization has become the policy idea that dare not speak its name in some Republican circles. "Democrat attempts to label the G.O.P. position on Social Security as favoring 'privatization' presents a serious threat," declares one recent Republican memorandum circulated on Capitol Hill. "G.O.P. members and candidates must fight back against this label."
Mr. Chocola, who is running for a newly drawn seat left open by the retirement of Representative Tim Roemer, a Democrat, describes his position on private accounts like this: "I support our president in making sure that 20-year-olds find a way to get Social Security -- and one of those ways is personal savings accounts. I support the concept of personal savings accounts."
But two years ago, when he ran against Mr. Roemer, Mr. Chocola was quoted in an editorial board meeting with The Elkhart Truth as declaring that not only did he support the Bush plan, but, "Eventually I'd like to see the entire system privatized." That quotation quickly showed up in one of Mr. Roemer's television commercials, and is likely to be raised again; Mr. Chocola said he was "misrepresented."
Now, like many other Republican candidates this year, he is careful to list three principles for any revamping of Social Security: No benefit cuts, no rise in the retirement age and no increase in the payroll tax.
Democrats are busily trying to force a debate and vote on the various plans advanced by Republicans in recent years for creating private accounts in Social Security, confident that the devil is in the details. For example, Democrats note, the transitional costs of creating private accounts will be immense -- requiring benefit cuts or major new revenue to make up the shortfall.
"Current retirees -- who come to this question strongly inclined to see Social Security as a system that is NOT broken and should NOT be messed with -- are extremely concerned about the possibility that privatization could prematurely deplete the Social Security trust fund," a memorandum produced by Peter D. Hart Research Associates for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. reported. 
Mr. Chocola's Democratic opponent, Jill Long Thompson, who previously served in the House from another Indiana district and was an under secretary of agriculture in the Clinton administration, has already broadcast advertisements in her primary campaign highlighting the risks of private accounts.
"I grew up on our family farm in Northern Indiana," she said in one commercial. "And, despite years of hard work, we almost lost it during the recession of the 1980's. That's why I feel so strongly about protecting Social Security from risky proposals that jeopardize benefits. And, with thousands losing their life savings at Enron, its clear we need reform to protect working people's pensions."
In an interview, she did not engage Mr. Chocola directly on the Social Security issue. But when asked about accusations that Democrats were simply trying to "scare seniors," she replied, "Read his quote."

HEADLINE: A Radical Overhaul for South African Mining 

BYLINE:  By HENRI E. CAUVIN 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, June 3 

 BODY:
After more than a year of painstaking revision and top-level deliberation, the government here is about to alter the balance of power in the country's mining industry.
 Parliament will begin final work this week on a bill that will give the government ultimate ownership of all of the country's prodigious mineral resources, which mining companies would then exploit only under license, giving the state the final say over who digs what and where. 
 With the new law, South Africa hopes to transform an industry that has been an instrument and emblem of white social and economic control since gold and diamonds were first discovered in sizable quantities in South Africa in the 19th century. 
Since the end of apartheid and the establishment of black rule almost a decade ago, the government has made it a central objective to turn the mines into engines of economic betterment for more of the black majority, as they have been for many in the white minority. 
Its principal tool is the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Bill, which Parliament will try to complete beginning Tuesday. Under the law, the state would assume ownership of all the country's mineral resources, a significant share of which have been privately controlled for decades, principally by the major global mining companies. To win mining licenses, the companies would have to promise to "expand opportunities for historically disadvantaged persons to enter the mineral industry," particularly by enlisting black partners and investing in black communities.
Most of the world's major mining nations, including Australia, Chile, Canada and Peru, have similar systems of national control and licensing. The United States, with its mix of private and public ownership of mineral rights, is an exception, in some respects similar to South Africa.
Entrenched though it is, South Africa's mining industry would have been hard pressed to defy prevailing international practices, so it has focused instead on fighting specific elements of the bill, not its underlying principle of state ownership.
The implications will ripple well beyond South Africa. Many of the world's major mining companies operate in the country, and several have roots here, notably Anglo American and its stable of companies. One of them, Anglo Platinum, the world's biggest platinum producer, holds about two-thirds of South Africa's platinum reserves, according to the government. Roughly half the country's gold reserves are controlled either by AngloGold or by Gold Fields Ltd.
Companies now mining in South Africa will have to apply to have their "old order rights" converted into "new order rights." All are expected to win approval, though some are concerned that the process will not run as routinely as promised.
The government's chief of mining regulation, Jacinto Rocha, said the companies had nothing to worry about. "Is there automaticity?" he said. "As far as we are concerned, yes, there is."
The Constitution requires the state to pay compensation for expropriated property, but there are unresolved questions about how this applies to the proposed law, most significantly to what extent mineral rights are "property." The bill's terms impose a long list of conditions for compensation, among them proof "of actual loss and damage," and it calls for the need to redress past racial discrimination to be taken into account. "It is," Mr. Rocha acknowledged, "very complex."
The law calls for licenses of up to 5 years for prospecting rights and up to 30 years for mining rights. Companies would pay royalties to the state, as they do in many cases today, but they would do it under a new framework still being drafted by the ministry of finance.
What is distinct about South Africa's law is its pronounced emphasis on social development in mining communities and on black participation in management and ownership.
No one in the industry openly questions those goals -- indeed, many say they embrace them. But some mining companies and international mining experts say the proposed law remains too vague and too vulnerable to political whims. 
In a critique submitted to Parliament last week, the South African Chamber of Mines praised many improvements in the bill since the first draft of December 2000. But the chamber, which speaks for all the industry's major players including Anglo and Gold Fields, outlined a number of problems and proposed some amendments.
For one thing, the bill is widely taken to mean mining companies will be expected to build schools, clinics and roads in the communities where they mine. But the chamber says it is in the dark about how much of such spending will be enough.
"It's not in the bill," Mzolisi Diliza, the chamber's chief executive, said. "You are expected to comply with something you don't know."
Mr. Rocha said the draft law was not the place for such details. "The bill sets the principle, the meat comes then in the regulations," he said. Along with a forthcoming minerals charter, the regulations that will follow the law will provide sufficient clarity, he said.
Still, many experts say, the most important questions must be addressed up front, whether in the law or in an accompanying document.
"The reality is, we are living in the third world, in a developing country," said Fred Cawood, a senior lecturer in mineral policy at the University of Witwatersrand's School of Mining Engineering in Johannesburg. "Just because the current government has the integrity to deal with this doesn't mean future governments will, and that's why the government has to spell out the rules of the game."
Another concern is that under the law, a court could hear a challenge only to the process of a decision, not its substance. That, Mr. Diliza said, undermines the security that miners are seeking. "You can follow the right procedure and arrive at the wrong decision," he said. 
Rarely has a bill in South Africa faced the scrutiny that the minerals bill has -- and no wonder. While the mining industry's dominance has slipped some in recent years as the economy has opened up and diversified, few industries are more central, symbolically and substantively, to South Africa's identity.
Gold from the mines on its outskirts made Johannesburg the commercial capital of the continent. Diamonds turned a South African company called De Beers into a worldwide synonym for luxury. Platinum is the country's next great hope.
But the boom that blessed South Africa largely passed blacks by, though they were the labor behind it. Even had they the means, they could not own mineral rights under apartheid law, and the industry invested little in mining communities.
So when political power changed hands in 1994, the mining industry was a prime target for black empowerment, the effort to integrate the country's capitalist class and improve the lives of the lower classes.
In her budget speech to Parliament last month, the minister of minerals and energy, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, depicted an industry that, mineral by mineral, remained largely in the hands of whites. "This," she said, "is not sustainable in the democratic South Africa."
By insisting, as the proposed law does, that companies use their rights or lose them, the government hopes to stimulate more turnover. The last few years have produced a few notable new entries, like Tokyo Sexwale, a former antiapartheid guerrilla leader who has become perhaps the most prominent black figure in mining. Earlier this year his Mvelaphanda Holdings was listed on the JSE Securities Exchange, the main financial market here, where it was joined last month by African Rainbow Minerals Gold, led by Patrice Motsepe, a former mining lawyer.
Mr. Motsepe said the government had a difficult line to walk: "The challenge -- and I've got confidence in the way it's being done -- is that while you introduce these changes, these social changes, that you maintain security of tenure, you maintain respect for property rights and you retain the competitiveness of the South African mining industry."

HEADLINE: Moody's, Citing U.S. Concern, Cancels Ratings on Iran Debt 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Iran's plans to borrow in the international bond market for the first time since the 1979 revolution that overthrew the shah were dealt an unexpected blow yesterday when the credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service withdrew its sovereign debt rating for the country.
 Moody's said that it had to withdraw the rating, an unsolicited opinion that was first issued in 1999, after being informed that it was "inconsistent" with United States economic sanctions against Iran. 
 The withdrawal was a first for Moody's. "To date, there has never been the need to withdraw a sovereign rating assigned by Moody's due to government concerns," said David Levey, managing director of sovereign risk at the agency. 
According to a Wall Street executive who is close to the situation, Iran has asked Standard & Poor's, a unit of McGraw-Hill, to rate the planned bond issue, and S.& P. has applied for an export license to do so.
Moody's, this executive said, never checked to see whether a license was required in its case. 
A Moody's spokesman declined to comment.
Moody's, which has occasionally rated other countries without being asked or paid, had rated Iran's foreign-currency debt at B2, well below investment grade. Fitch Ratings, the third prominent rating agency, rates Iran slightly higher, at B+; Fitch is owned by the French company Finalac and has headquarters in London, so American export-license rules do not apply to it.
None of the three agencies rate North Korea or Iraq, the other two nations said by President Bush to form an "axis of evil." 
Analysts said Iran would now have an even tougher time selling its bonds than it would have before and that the $300 million to $500 million bond issue might have to be postponed.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Picked Up Pace In Last Month 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3 

 BODY:
Manufacturing grew in May at the fastest pace in more than two years, an industry group said today.
 The group, the Institute for Supply Management, reported that its factory index rose to 55.7 in May, from 53.9 in April. Measures of new orders and production rose, it said, and factories reported the strongest demand for exports since May 2000. 
 Consumer spending has helped factories rebound from a slump that started in August 2000. For four consecutive months, the national index has been higher than 50, which indicates growth. Midwest manufacturing alone increased in May at the fastest pace in three years, the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago reported on Friday.
One reason for a continued rise in demand is new-home sales, which may have their second-best year in 2002. Spending on residential construction increased to a record in April, the Commerce Department reported today. Overall spending on construction showed an increase of 0.2 percent, led by a rise of 0.7 percent in the building of houses and apartments. 
Still, some areas of the economy may start to cool, causing growth this quarter to slow from the 5.6 percent annual pace of the first three months of the year.
The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company said car and truck sales fell 12 percent in May as they pulled back on low-interest loan offers. 
In today's manufacturing report, the new-orders index, which accounts for about a third of the total, increased to 63.1, from 59. The production index rose to 58.5, from 58, and the export orders index increased to 53.3, from 51.9. 
Exports may be gaining strength partly because of a recent decline in the value of the dollar against both the euro and the yen. The dollar has declined 3 percent since January against the currencies of the largest United States trading partners, and the decrease may eventually bolster exports by making them less expensive.
The Institute for Supply Management, which is based in Tempe, Ariz., surveys more than 400 companies in 20 industries, including clothing, printing, transportation, furniture and plastics. 
Its employment index rose to 47.3, from 46.7, showing that factories are still cutting jobs but at a slower pace. Manufacturing employment has been among the last areas to rebound.

HEADLINE: Ex-Chairman At Sotheby's Is Considering Sale of Stake 

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman of Sotheby's who was sentenced in April to a year and a day in prison for his role in a price-fixing scheme with his counterpart at the archrival Christie's, said yesterday that he was working with Sotheby's officials to explore a possible sale or merger of the auction house or the sale of his stake.
 In a filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Taubman said he would not sell his Sotheby's shares for 90 days without the company's consent. This so-called standstill agreement went into effect yesterday. 
 Mr. Taubman, the 78-year-old real estate developer, bought Sotheby's in 1983 and took the company public in 1988. He owns about 13.2 million Class B shares of Sotheby's Holdings Inc., which represents a 62.9 percent voting stake in the company. 
Goldman, Sachs, which is Mr. Taubman's adviser, together with Morgan Stanley and J. P. Morgan, which represent Sotheby's, will now contact "qualified parties" who may have an interest in Sotheby's, company officials said yesterday. Bill Ruprecht, Sotheby's chief executive, said the process could take at least several months.
Mr. Ruprecht declined to comment about whether the company had any potential suitors. But people close to the situation said prospective buyers could include banks that would be interested in expanding Sotheby's financial services arm as well as major art collectors like Joseph Lewis, who was once a large shareholder in Christie's, or the technology entrepreneur Paul G. Allen. Another possibility could be Anton Rupert, the luxury goods magnate who owns the Richemont Group.
Mr. Ruprecht tried to put a good face on Sotheby's future by underscoring that the auction house expected to return to operating profitability this year. Last year, Sotheby's reported a net loss of $41.7 million, or 69 cents a share, which included hefty legal fees and fines related to the Justice Department's investigation into collusion and price-fixing with Christie's. "The material liabilities in the United States are behind us," Mr. Ruprecht said. "We are currently cooperating with the European Commission." 
Mr. Ruprecht also stressed that Sotheby's spring auctions in New York gave the auction house leadership in many leading areas of the art market and that a relationship with eBay was expected to begin early this summer.
The process of selling Sotheby's has been developing for a while. In December, in a filing with the S.E.C., Sotheby's said its board was directing its executive committee to meet promptly with representatives of the Taubman family to discuss the possible sale of the company. In January 2001, Mr. Taubman filed another declaration with the S.E.C. saying that he had hired Credit Suisse First Boston to evaluate his investment in the auction house. But that process was suspended because of the 16-day-trial that took place in November and December. 
Experts inside Sotheby's say they hope the company will be sold soon. Their eagerness was echoed by Mr. Ruprecht, who said: "We are stronger than we have been in some time. We have the best expertise and experience anywhere, a powerful brand and, in the views of so many of us we remain the most fascinating business in the world.

 BODY:
Car Sales Fell in May Even as Rebates Continued
A 12 percent decline in car sales by Ford and General Motors helped drag May sales to their lowest monthly pace in nearly four years. Auto sales industrywide fell 6 percent in May. The one-month slump came even as automakers continued to offer rebates and to subsidize financing to keep interest rates low.
 Analysts said the drop did not indicate that carmakers were in trouble. Even so, incentives were expected to increase. Page C2.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Fell in May Even as Big Rebates Continued 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 3 

 BODY:
Weak sales in May at General Motors helped drag car sales to their lowest monthly pace in nearly four years.
 Auto sales industrywide fell 6 percent in May from the month a year earlier, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, a data tracking service in Southfield, Mich. 
 The one-month slump came even as Detroit continued to spend money to provide big rebates and to subsidize interest rates, and it suggested that incentive spending, which surged after Sept. 11, could go even higher in the coming months.
"I think the results we have seen suggest that maybe the industry is not quite so robust as was being reported perhaps a week ago," said George Pipas, manager of industry sales analysis for Ford Motor. 
Financial analysts said one bad month did not offset the surprising strength of the first four months. They also said it was not enough to indicate any economic trouble for automakers.
"I don't think this is indicative of a slippery slope," said Darren S. Kimball, an analyst at Lehman Brothers.
"It's a brutal market and month to month you can get payback," Mr. Kimball added, referring to the effect of each company's changing marketing and incentive strategies. 
The pace of the incentives, he said, "is also what's going to keep sales from falling."
Generally, auto sales have held up surprisingly well through the first five months; analysts had expected that the wave of interest-free financing offered after Sept. 11 would do more to undermine sales this year. 
Instead, most analysts and automakers have been raising their estimates for sales this year and stepping up production figures. 
But today, analysts were most surprised that sales at the resurgent G.M. fell 12 percent, a performance as weak as that of the struggling Ford Motor, while sales at the Chrysler Group, part of DaimlerChrysler, rose 4 percent.
"One month doesn't make a trend, but it was pretty interesting that the weakness was concentrated at G.M. and Ford," Ronald Tadross, an analyst at Bank of America, said.
G.M.'s disappointing sales were mitigated by the company's raising its earnings estimates for the quarter, to $2.50 a share from $2, as well as its production estimates. Company executives pointed to several minor issues contributing to what they called a one-month sales blip, including the fact that special offers had expired for its employees and for lease customers.
"May was a bit weaker than we expected," said Paul Ballew, G.M.'s general director for global market and industry analysis. 
G.M. said its overall incentive spending did not decline. Industrywide, the slowest sales pace of the year came despite rebates that remained high and interest rates that remained low last month. 
Mr. Ballew said he expected incentive spending to increase in the second quarter.
Such incentives are good for consumers -- they make cars cheaper -- but erode profit for automakers, particularly the Big Three. In April, the Big Three automakers were offering incentives worth $2,200 a car, according to the Autodata Corporation, an industry research firm. Asian automakers, with better quality rankings and brand loyalty, were offering incentives of $790 a car. Autodata said the early indications were that incentive spending crept up in May for both groups.
The best news from the Big Three came from the Chrysler Group, which continues to show signs of emerging from its troubles. 
Particularly strong were sales of its Dodge Ram pickup, which rose 19 percent in May from April, as well as sales of its Jeep Liberty sport utility vehicle.
"Chrysler was really positive," said Andrew Newton, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. "The Liberty performed well without incentives; the Ram performed well. It was definitely a good month."
Sales at Toyota Motor, ranked fourth in sales in the United States, rose 1.4 percent in May. Sales at Honda Motor, ranked fifth, fell 4.6 percent. Sales at Nissan Motor rose 1.6 percent. Sales at Hyundai Motor rose 9.8 percent, while its Kia Motors division rose 13.7 percent. 
There were also signs that sales to corporations and rental car companies were picking up after falling off following the terrorist attacks. 
At Ford, while retail sales were down 16 percent in May, a performance that continues to trouble Wall Street, fleet sales rose 2 percent. 
"Both of these results were contrary to our experience in the previous four months and our expectations when the month began," Mr. Pipas said, adding that it was "encouraging to see an indication that businesses are back in the market buying cars and trucks."

HEADLINE: MUBARAK TO PRESS BUSH ON A STATE FOR PALESTINIANS 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER and NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: CAIRO, June 3 

 BODY:
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt says he will press President Bush in talks in Washington this week to support the declaration of a Palestinian state early next year.
 In an interview, the 74-year-old leader said he would urge the administration to apply international pressure to the Israelis and Palestinians to return to negotiations. 
 He said he was even prepared to follow in the footsteps of Anwar el-Sadat and travel to Israel, but not while killing continued and only if it would help clinch a deal. Otherwise, he said, "I am going to be insulted from here to here," gesturing from head to toes with his hand. 
"I think to declare a state just theoretically like this and then to sit and negotiate what would be the borders, what about Jerusalem -- I think it may work," Mr. Mubarak said. On the other hand, declaring a state on a fraction of the Palestinian lands seized by Israel in 1967 would only perpetuate tensions and lead to more "terror and violence," he said. 
Speaking in English on Sunday at the presidential palace, which was ringed by tight security in a city flowering under the summer red of acacia trees, Mr. Mubarak said his proposals would be far more detailed than those outlined by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.
That proposal was adopted by nations attending an Arab summit meeting in Beirut in March; it called for Israel to withdraw from all lands seized in the 1967 war in exchange for full normalization of relations with all Arab nations.
Mr. Mubarak, who arrives in Washington on Wednesday and appeared eager to resume a pivotal position in the quest for Middle East peace, did not attend that March meeting. 
He has supported the Saudi initiative in public while disparaging it in private. In the interview, he indicated that he thought it was based on recycled ideas and failed to provide a detailed way forward. He said he planned to address this deficiency with Mr. Bush when they meet in Washington and at Camp David on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
In the 90-minute interview, Mr. Mubarak made plain that he considered the search for Middle East peace far more important than the Bush administration's quest for a change of power in Iraq.
His proposal differs from others in that it would confer statehood on all Palestinian lands recognized by the United Nations before -- not after -- many difficult issues of exact boundaries, refugees, the division of Jerusalem and the dismantling of Israeli settlements are addressed.
The Egyptian president suggested that the proposal would give the Palestinians hope of achieving a state, a hope he indicated had recently been dashed by the actions of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel. 
"This may be one of the proposals which will lead the two parties to sit and negotiate," he said. "Our intention is to lower the tension, and any idea which lessens the tension and violence, I support it, but it should be on a fair basis."
"To leave the problem of the Middle East to Arafat and Sharon alone, you will get nowhere," he said. "It should be a heavyweight country like the United States that should try to interfere, try to listen to this and that and in the end make the two parties make a conclusion."
On the Israeli side, Mr. Sharon has criticized a plan, pushed by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, that calls for immediate Israeli recognition of a Palestinian state in the territory already under Palestinian control, followed by a year of negotiations over the precise boundaries.
But some right-wing members of Mr. Sharon's party fear that he secretly favors the plan as a way of relieving international pressure on Israel while yielding only a tiny Palestinian state, without a capital in Jerusalem.
It is for just those reasons that most Palestinian leaders, including Yasir Arafat, have criticized that approach. They worry that negotiations would become protracted once even a limited state was declared, and that international attention would shift elsewhere.
Mr. Mubarak's plan addresses those Palestinian concerns two ways: by demanding immediate commitment to returning to the 1967 borders and by calling for a specific timeline for arriving at them.
He also expressed the strong view that although Mr. Arafat could not be removed by anyone but the Palestinian people, his failures as a leader of the Palestinian Authority created an opportunity to press him to make compromises he seemed unwilling to make at the Camp David meeting in 2000 and at the very end of the Clinton administration.
At that time, a final settlement was proposed that would have granted Palestinians almost all of the lands taken by Israel in 1967, along with sovereignty over East Jerusalem and compensation for refugees. Under those plans, some of the refugees could have been reunited with Arab relatives in Israel, but most would have become residents of the new Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza.
"I am not saying Arafat is the best man, no," Mr. Mubarak said. "But we have to use Arafat in this present situation. Arafat would be much more flexible than ever before after this period of the past year." 
"I think we have to support him for the time being," he said, adding that "then after that, maybe after one year, he may appoint some other" Palestinian leader "to take over" while assuming a more ceremonial position.
On Iraq, Mr. Mubarak warned that America faced "big losses" if it attacked now. 
"Using force will create a hell of a lot of problems in the public opinion, it will make people very furious," he said. "We will have a heavy burden here to settle down the situation among the people. There will be violence in the whole area against the United States." 
He suggested that the United States needed to address its "bad image" in the Arab world by demonstrating a tangible commitment to a Palestinian state, an idea that Mr. Bush endorsed for the first time last fall, to try to calm the violence that is threatening to destabilize the region.
The government of Egypt is among several in the Arab world under pressure from the young and the unemployed to do more to ease economic hardship, be it through more democracy or greater devotion to Islam. For these malcontents, ties to the United States bring only a repugnant association with American support for Israel.
A Bush administration official said it was not surprising that Mr. Mubarak would float such an idea at a time when Mr. Bush himself has recently referred flatly to "Palestine," as if a state already existed, and when Foreign Minister Peres has discussed similar ideas with Palestinians.
"He knows this discussion is out there, and it makes sense for him to come and make a pitch," the official said. 
In the interview, Mr. Mubarak said he would press Mr. Bush to lay out a framework, using some new ideas for compromise on the crucial issues of dividing Jerusalem, returning Palestinian refugees and delineating final borders.
The framework for the negotiations should be set, he said, only after extensive American consultations with Israeli and Arab leaders by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. This could take months, he added, implying that there was no need to rush into an international conference.
"Before declaring their proposal, there should be an active discussion," he said. "The U.S. should listen to the parties and then find a good formula. You will not satisfy the needs of both sides, 100 percent; it is impossible." 
At that conference, the United States, Arab and Israeli leaders and representatives of the United Nations, Russia and the European Union could set a schedule aimed at a peace treaty sometime after the 2004 presidential elections in the United States, Mr. Mubarak suggested. 
That schedule could help reduce the political risks for Mr. Bush, whose actions in the Middle East are certain to invite intense Congressional scrutiny. But such a delay might be problematic if Mr. Bush did not win re-election in 2004 and his successor had different ideas. 
In the months before any declaration of a Palestinian state, Mr. Mubarak said, Arab leaders and American and Israeli officials could observe how Mr. Arafat carried out the security and political reforms he has promised. The Egyptian president sent his chief of intelligence, Omar Suleiman, to Mr. Arafat last week for a progress report.
Mr. Mubarak seemed doubtful that Mr. Sharon would accept his proposal or engage in serious negotiations to create a Palestinian state. But he said that if a political fight broke out in Israel over whether to enter peace talks, he would be willing even to visit Israel to help break eventual deadlock. 
"Forget about visiting Israel when there is tension and people being killed here and there," Mr. Mubarak said. "I am going to gain nothing. I am going to create problems in this country, and in the whole Arab world." 
But, he added, "if I am sure it would succeed, that is something different, I would consider it."
Though Mr. Mubarak has a dim view of Mr. Sharon as a peacemaker, he said it was necessary to keep in touch, as he said he did last month when warning Mr. Sharon directly against an Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip.
"The message went to him at midnight on the fax straight to his office," Mr. Mubarak said, adding that he had feared a "massacre." "He didn't reply until now, but I think he understood the situation."
The Egyptian leader brushed aside questions about the need for greater openness and democracy in the Arab world, refusing to discuss the trial of a prominent political activist, Saad Eddin Ibrahim, and asserting that, in Egypt, "we have all kinds of democracy."

 Gov. Mike Huckabee said the state would probably incur a $56 million deficit without action by the General Assembly before June 30, the end of the fiscal year. Mr. 
Huckabee set a meeting last night with legislative leaders to discuss options for closing the budget gap. Since last fall, Mr. Huckabee, a Republican, has ordered two rounds of cuts totaling $171 million from the state's $3.5 billion budget, blaming an economic slowdown, which he said had been aggravated by the Sept. 11 attacks.

HEADLINE: Can Pakistan Avoid Sliding Into War? 

BYLINE:  By Michael Krepon; Michael Krepon is founding president of the Henry L. Stimson Center.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Over the weekend, the likelihood of a war between India and Pakistan receded slightly. Secretary of State Colin Powell has confirmed that orders have been relayed to Pakistani forces manning border posts to stop infiltration by militants across the Line of Control dividing Kashmir, as President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan promised on May 27. As a result, Indian leaders are now willing to give American diplomacy more time to turn General Musharraf's pledge into a permanent commitment.
 With Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld traveling to the region in the next few days, the essential elements of a move back from the nuclear precipice are now in plain view. These steps need to be taken quickly, however, because spoilers are now in Kashmir who would like nothing better than to spark a war that destabilizes Pakistan, kills Hindus and disrupts American military operations against the Qaeda network. 
 General Musharraf's announcement that infiltration has ended clearly implies what is well known but cannot be publicly acknowledged by his government -- that the Pakistani Army and intelligence services have long provided logistical and military support for these crossings.
His pledge to end this assistance is an important start, but it is insufficient. Militancy cannot be turned on and off like a spigot to accommodate political pressures. His promise will mean little unless he is willing to close down the training camps and staging areas for militants on the Pakistani side of the Kashmir border. Since operations that originate from these camps could lead to war, nothing short of immediate action by the Pakistani Army to dismantle the camps, with monitoring by the United States and India, will foster stability in the area.
Pakistan's proposal to add international monitors along the Line of Control would not make the 450-mile border harder to infiltrate. Much of this terrain is quite rugged, and most of the crossings by militants happen at night. Before the current deployment of forces to the border, the Indian Army maintained more than six divisions with approximately 70,000 troops along this divide and was still unable to stop infiltration. Nonetheless, even a symbolic increase in international peacekeepers -- there are now a few dozen in place -- could usefully signal the international community's determination that Pakistan put an end to the incursion into Indian territory.
Even now, it is clear to Pakistani military leaders that another loss on the battlefield -- should India retaliate against border crossing with conventional warfare, much less a nuclear strike -- would further damage the army's standing, which has fared poorly in previous wars with India.
It is also clear that the Pakistanis would have to fight another war essentially alone because the United States and China are now more strongly opposed than in the past to Pakistan's links to terrorist organizations. Finally, most Kashmiris, on whose behalf this war would ostensibly be waged, want to see an end to terrorist activities that are destroying their already weakened economy.
The reduction of tension in Kashmir also requires positive steps from India. With the verifiable closure of the Pakistani militant camps, India should begin a phased demobilization of troops from the border areas. The last phase would be a reduction of forces on the Line of Control after the state elections in Indian Kashmir this fall. Equally important are a resumption of substantive dialogue over the Kashmir issue and new efforts at nuclear risk reduction. The framework for a structured dialogue has already been agreed to in previous bilateral discussions dating back to the mid-1990's.
This outcome requires that the United States play a sustained, proactive role in South Asia, a role that it has been very reluctant to take on until now. For a start, Washington needs to help India monitor whether Pakistan is fulfilling its pledges. Nuclear security, the successful prosecution of the war against Al Qaeda and regional stability in South Asia all demand demonstrable changes in Pakistan's failed Kashmir policy.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
ABC Lagging In Shift Toward Strong Demand For Ad Time

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT and BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
An unexpected robustness in demand for broadcast television commercial time before the start of the 2002-2003 prime-time season means the long-awaited recovery in the advertising and media marketplaces may be under way.
 But for one seller, ABC, the trend is heading the other way. ABC, which is under scrutiny as its parent, the Walt Disney Company, seeks to reverse a persistent slump in revenue and profit, will sell less commercial time in what is known as the upfront market than it did last year, an estimated $1.3 billion compared with $1.6 billion. 
 ABC is Disney's most vulnerable division. Disney's declining fortunes are directly tied to the two-year-long collapse of the network's prime-time performance. 
ABC's shortfall would be the only one expected among the six broadcast networks in the upfront market. Over the last two years, ABC has dropped an estimated $1 billion in advance sales. The game show hit "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" fueled huge demand for commercial time in 2000 only to falter to the point where the show has now been removed from the regular schedule.
"Lightning struck with 'Millionaire,' and they weren't able to bottle it," said Tom Wolzien, media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
"This is what happens after the worst ratings drop in television history; it's the chickens coming home to roost," he added. "With ratings down and nothing coming up that knocks people's socks off, you're bound to have problems."
The total upfront market could reach $7.5 billion to $7.6 billion, compared with estimates of $7.2 billion as recently as a month ago.
In another sign of the strength in demand, the selling process is likely to be wrapped up by the end of the week, a quicker pace than had been anticipated. The market is being driven by big-spending advertisers like American Honda Motor, Gap, Home Depot, Procter & Gamble, Target, Toyota Motor Sales USA, Verizon Wireless and Wal-Mart Stores.
Analysts and executives at the networks and agencies gave two primary reasons for the stronger sales at CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN and WB. One was increased demand from advertisers in several important categories like automobiles, movies, health and beauty aids, packaged goods, retail and telecommunications.
The other reason was a growing belief among marketers that waiting to buy commercial time during the season, in what is called the scatter market, would cost more than making deals now.
"Our advice was to get in the marketplace when the getting is good, get the money down and get out," said Andy Donchin, director for national broadcast at Carat USA in New York, part of the Carat division of the Aegis Group that buys media for marketers like Alberto-Culver, New Line, Pfizer and Radio Shack.
The total upfront market would be the second best, ahead of the $7 billion sold for 2001-2002, but still behind the $8 billion sold for 2000-2001. Estimates are that NBC, which finished first in the ratings in the 2001-2002 season, will lead with total ad sales of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion, compared with $1.9 billion in upfront sales last spring.
"This is a signal we are coming out of a recession and people are looking to spend money again on advertising," said Randy Falco, president at the NBC Television Network in New York, part of the NBC division of General Electric.
If NBC books $2.7 billion, it would be a record for any one network in an upfront market, analysts said, and about $900 million to $1.1 billion more than the projected total for the No. 2 seller, CBS.
"NBC obviously had a gangbuster year," said Jon Nesvig, president for sales at the Fox Broadcasting Company in New York, part of the News Corporation. "Two-point-seven would be an enormous number."
Fox is estimated to be selling $1.3 billion worth of commercial time in the upfront market, slightly ahead of the upfront last spring.
Fox had about as mediocre a showing last season as ABC, as both networks had to reimburse advertisers with free spots, known as make-goods, when ratings for many shows fell short of guarantees. But Fox was more effective at reaching the audience most coveted by advertisers, viewers ages 18 to 49, a demographic group in which ABC fell to fourth last season, behind NBC, Fox and CBS.
"That ABC is hurting Disney is not news," said Mr. Wolzien, the analyst. "What we're talking about here is the long-term impact. Obviously it's starting to play out now."
ABC executives have acknowledged the difficulty in reversing the network's fading fortunes. In an interview on Friday, Susan Lyne, president of the ABC Entertainment division, said, "We are clearly a challenged network." One strategy ABC is pursuing is to offer family-oriented programs from 8 to 9 weeknights.
Jack Myers, chief economist at Jack Myers L.L.C. in New York, which publishes media and research newsletters, said that ABC was "expected to aggressively close deals" only by offering advertisers better rates than the others in the cost for each 1,000 viewers, a closely watched figure known as the cpm. The increases in cpm at ABC, at 4 percent to 6 percent, are projected to be the lowest of all six networks -- and less than half those of CBS, NBC and WB.
ABC sales executives put the best face on their results.
"Across the board, we've met or exceeded our expectations in every day part," said Mike Shaw, president for sales and marketing at the ABC Television Network in New York, including early morning and late night as well as prime time.
"Each agency had advertisers in every category that were spending more than we thought they would," he added. "There was strength in every category, very broad based, which is a better sign of recovery" than if the spending increases were concentrated in a handful of categories.
Vying with NBC for bragging rights was CBS, which at $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion will probably generate the largest percentage gain among the networks, an increase of 30 percent from $1.3 billion last year. However, that is partly because CBS will sell more commercial time in the upfront market this spring than it did last spring, when it bet that demand would be more robust in the scatter market and it could command higher prices.
The CBS goal is to sell about 75 percent of all 2002-2003 commercial time in the upfront market, compared with about 60 percent sold in the 2001-2002 upfront market.
CBS, along with its smaller sibling network, UPN, is moving more slowly than the other networks in this upfront market, analysts and agency executives said, characterizing the delay as watchful waiting rather than holding back as CBS did in the upfront last spring.
"We're moving more deliberately," said Joseph Abruzzese, president for network sales at CBS, who is also overseeing the upfront sales effort for UPN. For CBS, Mr. Abruzzese said, "our goal is to get the highest cpm increases than the other networks and the highest 'share shift' in dollars to CBS from the other networks," referring to the movement of ad budgets from ABC and to a lesser degree Fox because of their ratings shortfalls this past season.
Analysts estimate that UPN will sell $250 million worth of commercial time in the upfront market, a robust increase from $200 million last spring. The other smaller broadcast network, WB, is also enjoying a strong upfront market, selling about $550 million worth of commercial time, up from an estimated $500 million, and its cpm increases, at 11 percent to 13 percent, may end up as the largest among all six networks.
"We're making our way back to the levels of two years ago," said Jed Petrick, president and chief operating officer at WB, owned by AOL Time Warner and the Tribune Company.

Building on Success, and Moving to Northern Italian

BYLINE:  By Eric Asimov 

 BODY:
EVEN in these uncertain economic times, the urge to expand, to capitalize on successful restaurants by creating new ones, must seem irresistible. How else to explain Supper, a new osteria that now gives Frank Prisinzano three places in the East Village? The neighborhood has no shortage of little Italian restaurants, but judging by the crowds hovering outside, waiting for tables, Mr. Prisinzano must be doing something right.
 His first restaurant, Frank, a sweet little place on Second Avenue, offers homey Italian-American fare. He expanded his repertory slightly at Lil' Frankie's Pizza on First Avenue, where the pizzas and other specialties are cooked in a wood-burning oven. Now at Supper he has moved onto Northern Italian dishes, done with simplicity and respect for ingredients, buttressed by an unusually extensive wine list. 
 Supper, decorated in standard-issue mismatched tables and chairs with brick walls, tile flooring and antique chandeliers, is divided into three sections: a sidewalk area that would be awfully pleasant on warm evenings if those waiting for seats weren't staring at you like dogs waiting for table scraps; a rear dining room bounded by a mirrored wall and a windowed wine cellar; and a front dining room centered on an open kitchen, where Mr. Prisinzano and a small kitchen crew spin and whirl trying to keep up. 
It's an entertaining view of house-made pastas being cooked to order, but it also displays Supper struggling at busy hours to serve food at a proper pace and sequence. 
At quieter times, though, Supper's simple yet quirky appeal is easy to fathom. A fat lump of perfect, buttery, slightly salty buffalo mozzarella arrives with improbably ripe tomatoes enlivened with olive oil and vinegar ($7.95), while panzanella ($5.95), the Tuscan bread salad, is a tangy delight. Sliced fennel covered with lacy sheets of mild Montasio cheese ($6.95) and roasted beets with Parmesan ($5.95) are both attractive salads, though prosciutto with apple ($8.95) and a simple platter of grilled vegetables ($7.95) are overly bland.
Frankly, I'd consider sharing a pasta as an appetizer, especially if Mr. Prisinzano is offering his tajarin d'ortice ($12), the Piedmontese name for tagliatelle prepared simply with mint and butter, a light, delicate and wonderful warm-weather dish. By contrast, tajarin al sugo d'arrosto ($12), the same pasta served with meat juices cooked down with butter and sage, doesn't succeed; the sauce ends up at the bottom of a deep bowl, never uniting with the pasta. The same sauce works much better with richly flavored veal tortelloni ($12), in which the concentrated flavors can merge on a shallow plate. Tagliatelle with a strikingly herbal Bolognese sauce ($9.95) and "priest stranglers," fluffy pasta twists in a vivid marinara sauce with a dollop of fresh ricotta di pecora ($9.95), are also satisfying choices.
On weekends, Supper serves bollito misto ($13.95), the Northern Italian feast of boiled meats, though Supper's carefully managed portions do not really qualify as feasts, nor do the cramped quarters permit the traditional table-side service. Still, I love the combination of earthy cotechino sausage, juicy veal, pork and beef, and slightly dry capon, served with a selection of sauces. Creamy risotto ($9.95), redolent of chicken stock, is excellent, but crisp veal Milanese ($12.95) and roasted chicken with mashed potatoes ($10.95) are correct, but no more than that. 
For dessert, light and sumptuous hazelnut panna cotta, served with a pitcher of dense chocolate sauce ($6.75), is the clear highlight.
A word about the wine list: it is rare to find an inexpensive restaurant where you can splurge on fine Barolos or Amarones, or (more likely) stick with a decent $25 sangiovese or aglianico, but you can at Supper. Good food, good wine -- if Mr. Prisinzano is challenged by the crowds, it's his own fault.

HEADLINE: WINE TALK; 
In South Africa, He Let the Goats Out

BYLINE:  By Frank J. Prial 

DATELINE: PAARL, South Africa 

 BODY:
THE wine is called Goats do Roam. No, not Cotes-du-Rhone, and before you laugh, be aware that it's one of South Africa's best-known and hottest-selling wines. Particularly overseas.
 Is it a joke? Yes, sort of. Charles Back, who makes Goats do Roam at his Fairview estate here on the southwestern slopes of Paarl Mountain, in the center of the Western Cape wine country, enjoys tweaking French sensibilities. 
 And not just the French. With more and more South African winemakers striving to come up with their own versions of the Rhone Valley's best-known wine, Goats do Roam is, as one critic put it, "a cheeky riposte" to the local vintners as well. 
It is, moreover, no mere irreverent play on words. There really are goats at Fairview, 600 of them, and when Mr. Back isn't making wine, he uses their milk to turn out what many people here believe to be some of South Africa's finest cheeses. 
Goats do Roam is a blend of seven grape varieties, mostly pinotage, "personally selected," according to the back label, "by the rampant Fairview goats as they roam the vineyards for the ripest fruit." Other grapes in the blend include syrah, cinsault, grenache, carignan, gamay and mourvedre. 
There is also a Goats do Roam rose made by the saignee process -- "bleeding" the tanks of the newly crushed red wine grapes -- and beginning with the 2001 vintage, there is a white Goats do Roam, too, made from various varieties, including viognier and grenache blanc.
At 14 percent alcohol, the white version is the most muscular of the three. The red is 13.8 and the rose 13.2; these are California numbers, by any measure. 
The first Goats do Roam vintage was 1999. To call it an instant success could be an understatement; 165,000 cases will be made of the 2002 vintage, the bulk of it red. (The 2001 vintage red Goat, now available, is a rich, fruity wine with considerable concentration and flavors of licorice, sweet spices and ripe plums.)
With its bizarre name, the wine is something of an anomaly in conservative South Africa, but as one winemaker put it, "If anyone was going to do it, it would be Charles Back." 
The Fairview estate was established in 1693, about 40 years after the first Dutch settlers arrived at the Cape. The first wine made there was in 1699. But it was not until 1937 that the first Charles Back, a Lithuanian Jew who had settled in South Africa in 1904, bought the estate. It was another 35 years before winemaking returned to Fairview with a 1974 shiraz, bottled that same year by Cyril Back, son of the first Charles and father of the current owner.
Today, Charles Back is a major player in the South African wine business. Since 1998, he has owned the Spice Route Wine Company, in Malmesbury, north of Cape Town in the Swartland region along the Atlantic Coast. Spice Route syrahs made under his aegis have evoked high praise from, among others, Gerard Chave, the renowned producer of Hermitage in the Rhone Valley.
Mr. Back studied winemaking, but these days, like Mr. Chave, he leaves the cellars to his winemakers, Anthony de Jager at Fairview and Eben Sadie at Spice Route, and spends all his time in the vineyards.
"I must understand the grapes," he told me. "I can't make wine from a vineyard I haven't walked."
Those vineyards, his own and the ones whose fruit he buys, extend all over the Western Cape. From them, he produces a dazzling array of wines, some of them new to this part of the world, like zinfandel. Under the Fairview label he offers malbec; several versions of pinotage; several of shiraz, including the signature Cyril Back, after his father; mourvedre; high-alcohol zinfandels; gamay noir (read Beaujolais); pinot noir; cabernet franc; and carignan among the reds; and chenin blanc, semillon, marsanne, viognier and chardonnays among the whites. 
At Spice Route, Mr. Back makes more syrah, pinotage, chenin blanc and viognier, as well as merlot and a lower-priced line called Andrew's Hope that includes an outstanding sauvignon blanc. Mr. Back exports 90 percent of all his wines, accounting for 25 percent of all South African wine exported by individual wineries (as opposed to the cooperatives).
Winemaking is a serious business in South Africa. After 40 years of economic isolation brought on by apartheid, vintners are working to re-establish themselves in the world wine market.
But they have had more to overcome than just the impact of the sanctions, lifted in the early 1990's. For most of the 20th century, the wine industry here was controlled by a government-backed cooperative organization known as the KWV, which set prices, production quotas, growing areas, even the varieties of grapes to be planted. 
A quarantine system made the importation of good vines virtually impossible. Chardonnay, for example, was banned. Defiant winemakers who produced it had to devise other names under which to bottle it. Chenin blanc, called steen, was South Africa's principal wine grape and much of what was exported was indifferent "port," "sherry" and grape-juice concentrate.
Those days are past. "The sanctions era forced us to plant anything we could find a market for," Mr. Back said. "But it also kept us from developing 'international style' wines, wines just like everyone else's. Now, we can concentrate on our strengths, making wines that are a different interpretation of what others are doing, wines that are uniquely South African."
Among other things, Mr. Back's plans include at least one more Goat wine being released this year, Goat Roti, his homage to the Northern Rhone's famous Cote-Rotie. After that, who knows? A Goats do Bone, perhaps? He might also consider a Goat Door, if not for a Cote d'Or-style wine, then at least for the entrance to the barn where his goats live.
Finally, there is the matter of price. Goats do Roam can be found in most larger markets in the United States for under $10 a bottle, and occasionally for as low as $7.

HEADLINE: Cuban Wizardry Keeps Tail Fins From Drooping 

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO 

 BODY:
There is one thing about present-day Cuba that unfailingly leaves visiting Americans awestruck: the sight of streets filled with 1950's Chevrolets, Buicks, Fords, Chryslers and Cadillacs, some as well-maintained as those in the hands of vintage car collectors in the United States. The fleet, estimated at about 60,000, is believed to be the largest collection of classic American cars outside the United States, and is as much a part of the Cuban landscape as palm trees.
 But behind the shiny chrome and tail fins is a world of need, improvisation and sheer Darwinism. Cuban mechanics cannibalize Russian Ladas and Volgas for parts. They make exact replicas of 1950's hood ornaments and windshields from scratch. 
 For brake fluid, they use a concoction of oil, shampoo and soap. 
"And it works!" says Julio, a taxi driver and one of the subjects in the PBS documentary, "Classic American Cars of Cuba," which is being broadcast in the New York area at 9 p.m. tomorrow on Channel 21 as part of a fund-raising drive for public television. 
"Classic American Cars," to be shown nationwide in August, focuses on the remarkable survival of a byproduct of the revolution that gives Cuba much of its frozen-in-time quality. 
The cars are far from being just a tourist attraction. After Fidel Castro took power in 1959, the United States imposed its economic embargo on the Communist island, halting imports of American consumer goods. People held on to them out of necessity; besides, they were certainly preferable to the boxy Russian and Eastern European models that eventually flooded the market. 
Now, more than 40 years later, while the cars are still used for daily transportation, often as taxis, they have also become cherished heirlooms handed down from generation to generation within families, in some cases going all the way back to the 1930's.
"They started with necessity, but now there's a pride in the cars," said Terrel Cass, general manager of WLIW in New York, the public television station that produced the one-hour program for PBS.
"Everybody in Cuba seems to be a mechanic," he said. "Every two or three blocks you see a car jacked up and someone under it working on it."
The ubiquitous car trouble points to a bigger problem: each day these cars get closer to extinction. Leo Eaton, the program's writer, producer and director, said he was told by Cubans that five years ago about one in every three cars on the street was a pre-1960 American model. Last November, when Mr. Eaton was in Cuba filming, only about one in every five cars was, he said. They are outnumbered by Lada compacts, Volga sedans and more recent European and Japanese imports. 
American car enthusiasts who have organized in recent years to advocate for the Cuban antiques -- some of them served as consultants to the PBS show -- say the biggest threats to the cars are the scarcity of parts and lack of original factory literature to maintain them with uniform standards. A group known as TailLight Diplomacy formed under the aegis of the United States-Cuba Sister Cities Association, which promotes relationships between Americans and Cubans, has approached Cuban government officials to propose cultural exchanges among Cuban and American vintage car lovers. They hope to promote the classic cars as a national cultural asset, like the cable cars of San Francisco or the gondolas of Venice.
To do their part, the Americans want to ship parts, from door handles to carburetors, down to Cuba by the container full, along with repair manuals, paint specifications and other information that would ensure they are restored to internationally accepted standards.
"The performance standards we're advocating would make them last another 48 years," said Rick Shnitzler, the group's lead organizer and an urban planning consultant in Philadelphia.
Mr. Shnitzler said only in Cuba have history and circumstance combined to enable a whole society to preserve the cars and turn them into a national treasure. Of the 60,000 vintage cars, about half are from the 1950's, another 25 percent from the 1940's and a similar number from the 1930's, Mr. Shnitzler said. Chevrolet, Buick, Ford, Dodge, Plymouth and Willys are dominant brands.
Given the island's poverty, Mr. Shnitzler said he found the cars in surprisingly good condition on his last visit to Cuba, two years ago. 
He said that while about 20 percent of the cars were in terrible shape because of collision damage or modifications, most have been kept in good or fair condition through sheer wizardry. 
"Classic American Cars of Cuba" shows some of these magicians at work in unlicensed backyard body shops where 1950's bumpers and tailpipes are recreated and myriad other parts -- some cars are so fully restored only an original panel remains -- are adapted. The engine block may still be Chevrolet, one Cuban mechanic noted in the documentary, but the pistons are surely from a Volga. Mr. Shnitzler said that while such shortcuts would be frowned upon in the United States, he and other antique car lovers admire the Cubans' ingenuity and their ability to keep the cars running.
"How these cars survived is like, How did they build the pyramids?" Mr. Shnitzler said in a telephone interview. "They're just magicians and wizards, pure and simple. They just take stuff from Russian vehicles and adapt parts, but the quality of the work is outstanding." 
Just as in the United States, some Cuban car owners have organized in clubs: the PBS program features a rally in which car club members drive 500 miles round trip from Havana to the old colonial town of Trinidad, to meet and show off. Mr. Shnitzler dreams of face-to-face meetings between Cuban owners of, say, 1955 Mercurys and their American counterparts in the Bronx or Kalamazoo, so they can compare notes, share technical expertise and rhapsodize over their set of wheels.
Ultimately, he said, there should be an exchange of the cars themselves. (Officials at the Cuban Interests Section of the Swiss Embassy in Washington did not return calls asking for comment.)
Mr. Shnitzler said the quality of the Cuban fleet largely reflects the owners' respect for the vehicles.
"The father's '47 Pontiac is the son's '47 Pontiac and the grandson's '47 Pontiac," he said. "Every car is a repository of Cuban history from Batista to the present." 
Still, a further decline in the number of these American cars is seen as inevitable, particularly once the economic embargo is lifted and the door opens for American products like SUV's. Hope for the continued survival of the cars lies with the core group of owners, who have the same love for their antiques as those in the United States, where pre-1960 cars number in the hundreds of thousands and can cost anywhere from under $5,000 to more than $70,000 for a popular 1950's model in mint condition, said Douglas Drake, a national director of the Antique Automobile Club of America.
"We're all in the hobby together," said Mr. Drake, who lives in Rochester. "They were forced into the hobby but it's become a passion for them to keep the cars going. Their interest and our interest is very much the same."
But an American would have to go to Cuba to see a concentration of the cars filling the streets like a snapshot of 1950's U.S.A. come to life. Mr. Eaton said his program was inspired by such memories. "It was a sense of nostalgia for a time that has vanished everywhere else but on one level in Havana still exists," he said.

HEADLINE: French Bank Uses Bugs to Sell Itself 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, June 4 

 BODY:
No longer the heroes of the stock market boom, investment bankers have seen their reputations sullied in recent months by a series of scandals, ranging from the ethical practices of securities analysts to their involvement in the Enron fiasco. Their standing may hit a new low next week, when BNP Paribas, the giant French bank, introduces an advertising campaign that compares bankers to insects.
 "'What do you want, a banker or a locust?" is the tag line from one advertisement in the series that will begin appearing in newspapers and magazines June 11. A field of corn that has been ravaged by locusts is pictured in the background. The head of a giant grinning locust peers from a banker's suit, complete with red-and-white- striped tie. 
 In designing the campaign, which will run in the United States, Europe and Asia through the end of June, BNP Paribas is reviving the concept of relationship banking, while trying to distance itself from rivals that it says are interested only in making a quick buck, said Antoine Sire, who is the director of communications for BNP Paribas.
"We are here today and we will be here tomorrow," Mr. Sire said, in reference to another advertisement that features the mayfly, an insect with a short life.
Eric Tong Cuong, president and co-founder of BETC Euro RSCG, a unit of Havas Advertising that created the campaign, said that the idea had been in the works for several years, but that the timing was wrong during the Internet boom when corporate executives were becoming millionaires overnight.
"Three years ago, we couldn't have done this campaign," Mr. Tong Cuong said. "People were not thinking about these issues, they were thinking about short-term profits." The bursting of the stock market bubble has brought about a change of attitude, hastened by the accounting scandals that have erupted at various large corporations and investigations into the ethics of securities analysts.
Still, BNP Paribas, which spent nearly 5 million euros ($4.7 million) on the campaign, is taking a gamble by positioning itself as the exception in a tarred-and-feathered industry, some advertising experts said. And it remains to be seen whether the idea of building a long-term relationship with an investment bank will resonate with American companies that have grown accustomed to changing bankers on a whim.
By market capitalization, BNP Paribas is one of the largest banks in Europe, surpassing Deutsche Bank and other powerhouses. Michel Pebereau, the chairman, has recently talked about making further acquisitions to expand the bank's presence in Europe and abroad.
Because it wants to be seen as the "Citigroup of the euro zone," according to Mr. Sire, another advertisement trumpets the BNP Paribas range of products by asking, "'What do you need in a banker? A backbone." A caterpillar dressed in a business suit slumps across the desk.
But on a worldwide scale, BNP Paribas trails the so-called bulge bracket banks. From Jan. 1 to June 4, for instance, it ranked 17th in terms of advice on mergers and acquisitions and No. 15 for debt and equity issuance, according to Thomson First Call.
It will take an awful lot of clever advertising to close that gap.

A Fusion Spirit at This Year's Spoleto

BYLINE:  By BRUCE WEBER 

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C., June 3 

 BODY:
The woman on my left took a catnap after intermission. The man on my right actually startled himself awake with a snore. It was a steamy afternoon, and stuffy in the Dock Street Theater, a snug, historic auditorium with the feel of a legislative chamber and one of several idiosyncratic sites used by the annual Spoleto Festival USA here. In addition, the performance was right after lunch, so perhaps there was some excuse for my neighbors' snooziness.
 Then too, maybe they'd been to see some of the festival's other, noisier, more visually vivid theatrical events and so were disappointed by or inured to the quieter potency of the show in front of them. Or maybe they were tourists, exhausted from walking the lovely streets of downtown Charleston, which the festival, in its 26th year as the younger sibling of its venerable Italian namesake, takes over for a couple of weeks each spring. About 50,000 people, about 60 percent from outside the area, attend this festival, contributing roughly $40 million to South Carolina's economy. 
 I wanted to say: Pay attention! Over a long weekend of theatergoing, I found nothing as riveting or as deep as "Two Plays After," a delicious and thoughtful pairing of one-acts in homage to and in reconsideration of Chekhov, written by the Irish playwright Brian Friel and presented by the Gate Theater of Dublin. It is the American premiere of a theatrical evening that is, alas, not yet booked anywhere else in this country. Its final performance is Sunday, the closing day of the festival.
Mr. Friel, the author of "Dancing at Lughnasa," "Philadelphia, Here I Come" and "Translations," which have all appeared on Broadway in the last decade and are all characterized by the kind of comic melancholy that evokes Chekhov, is in admiration mode here, but he is also onto a worthy intellectual idea.
In Chekhov he has identified an artistic progenitor, and it is his notion here to bring his mentor's work and sensibility into his own world. "Two Plays After" gives us Frielized Chekhov, a stage universe that is still philosophically rueful and dramatically oblique but moderately Westernized and modestly updated. The temptation is to call Mr. Friel the Irish Chekhov, though I'm sure he would demur. What he has done here is to imagine what might have resulted if Chekhov had been born into other circumstances.
The first of the two plays, "The Bear," is an overt comedy, an adaptation of an early Chekhov one-act of the same name. It concerns a young widow, Elena Ivanova Popova (Elisabeth Dermot Walsh), who a year after her perfidious husband's death is still in fierce and vindictive mourning.
"I will be faithful to him forever and show him what true love really is," she explains, almost spitefully, to her loyal servant Luka (Eamon Morrissey), who wishes she would get out of the house already. Her absurd self-flagellation (Ms. Walsh has the discipline and comic sense to hold her stern demeanor without a wink) is disturbed when a neighbor, Gregory Stepanovitch Smirnov (Brendan Coyle), comes calling on a desperate errand to collect a debt owed him by her husband. He is a womanizer, a drinker and a bully, and his presumptuousness (which Mr. Coyle portrays with a contemporary swagger) ignites a hilarious enmity in Elena, whose outrage engenders bellows of anger. Of course, a half-hour later they're in each other's arms.
Their battle, amusingly refereed by the hapless old Luka, is rendered by Mr. Friel as though he were a prompter whispering modern idioms in the characters' ears, and as crisply directed by Robin Lefevre, the whole makes you understand what Chekhov might have done for "Frasier." That's not a flippant or dismissive remark; Mr. Friel and this production make you think that Chekhov merely anticipated network television, though Chekhov's sitcom form -- a 22-minute story that is riddled with punch lines and leaves you satisfied until next week -- would have been revered not as an advertising vehicle but as a sonnet.
After intermission, in "Afterplay," two venerable actors, John Hurt and Penelope Wilton, play characters who meet in a downtrodden Moscow cafe, lonely visitors on business from out of town. Their acting is so absorbing -- you really do feel as if you're sitting at the next table, eavesdropping -- that it wouldn't matter who the characters are. But they happen to be Andrey Prozorov, the sad and spineless brother from "The Three Sisters," and Sonya Serebriakova, the heartsick spinster from "Uncle Vanya," and their meeting is occurring some 20 years after their original plays have ended.
Yes, it is a gimmick. And yes, there is a plot device: the two had met the previous night and had a long conversation in which each, it turned out, had lied to the other, or at least kept secrets. And the play, almost humbly, doesn't approach either of its sources in its resonating emotional dramas. In the 20 years since we've encountered them, the characters have passed from the unresolved state of being despairing but hopeful to the considerably less tense one of being resigned and regretful. But Mr. Friel's dialogue is undemonstratively sterling, his imagination of the characters' subsequent lives credible and inventive, touching not only on its own but in its homage, one artist to another. 
Much of the other stage work at the festival is more viscerally commanding; I didn't notice any other sleepers. "Ghost Lovers," directed by Chen Shi-Zheng and starring Qian Yi as a lovely and seductive ghost, provides a sweet introduction to Chinese opera, almost a kind of Cliffs Notes for those who didn't see Mr. Chen and Ms. Qian's previous collaboration, "The Peony Pavilion," at the Lincoln Center Festival in 1999.
In this story, familiar to all Chinese, a woman returns from the dead to persuade her former lover to join her in eternal bliss. The elegance and beauty of Ms. Qian, the burlesque physical comedy of Guo Yi as her lover, the stylized, singsong recitation of their lines (with occasionally helpful forays into English) and the percussive accompaniment of an onstage ensemble make for a gentle, exotic spectacle. At a mere 45 minutes, "Ghost Lovers" is an appetite-whetting taste of a theatrical tradition that might well become ghostly itself; modern tastes in China have brought it dangerously close to extinction.
Ghosts are also thematically central to Ping Chong's "Obon: Tales of Rain and Moonlight," a puppet theater piece that joins fables of deeds on earth that come back to haunt their doers.
Using puppets of various sizes and types, set painting and gorgeous lighting, Mr. Chong and his company create exquisite stage pictures, particularly in the opening half-hour, which presents natural life on a primitive lake whose idyllic state is disturbed by a thoughtless warrior. The story is presented within a tripartite frame, as if on a screen divided into three parts; the colorful scene is painted and lighted behind the puppets of twittering birds, flying fish and regal ducks, and it is as compellingly alive as an aquarium. But the final tale, a contemporary one about a man who leaves his loyal wife to pursue a life of ambition, is slow and rather stale.
I rather like the repetitions and in-and-out-of-phase modulations of Steve Reich's music. But even beyond that I found "Three Tales," his collaboration with the video artist Beryl Korot, an aggressively stirring bit of storytelling, so vivid in its aesthetic presentation that its polemical element (especially in its final segment decrying the technological transformation of the world) did not trouble me. The first two episodes, one about the Hindenburg disaster, and especially the second, about the nuclear bomb test on Bikini Atoll, made these historical events as threateningly immediate as a blasting boombox on a subway car.
The show's urgent rhythms are created not only by the thrumming accents of the score and the rapid staccato images flashed on the video screen above the orchestra, but by the stylized zombie-esque meanderings of the singers and the frenetic but explicit baton-work of the conductor, Bradley Lubman. It is physically eerie and beautiful, contributing to this sensory overload of a show, which you leave rattling, and a little rattled. ("Three Tales" will be at the Brooklyn Academy of Music this fall.)
The one disappointment of the festival was "Yiimimangaliso: The Mysteries," a South African musical adaptation of the biblical mystery plays, which arrived from London heavily credentialed as a crowd-pleaser with a passel of ecstatic reviews. The show (which can be seen at the International Festival of the Arts and Ideas in New Haven on June 14 and 16) might be described as God's greatest hits as updated by the cast of "Fame."
With the fervor, joy and, alas, the theatrical imagination, of gifted high schoolers, it presents the stories of Adam and Eve, Noah and Abraham and Isaac (no Moses, though) and moves on to the New Testament, concluding with the Crucifixion.
Reflecting polyglot South Africa, the show is presented in several languages (English is one), and is largely reliant on visuals and the familiarity of the audience with the stories to communicate its narrative. But for that reason, why there is so much talking is a mystery; you often feel as though you're merely waiting for someone to pipe down so the show can continue. The choreography and the drumming are compelling in a thundery, redundant, "Riverdance" way.
The stagecraft (the show was created by Mark Dornford-May and Charles Hazlewood) relies on anachronistic visuals and is simply not clever enough (angels are denoted by derbies with feathered wings and shirts with "Angel" written in glitter on the back), though having the dwellers of Noah's Ark break out into "You Are My Sunshine" after 40 days and 40 nights of rain is, granted, a good joke.
Still, the pace of the show is hysterical, as is the acting, especially the main characters, Andries Mbali as a relentlessly mugging Lucifer in a red leather suit and Vumile Nomanyama as God and Jesus, played with the severe self-importance of Jerry Falwell. What the cast members do well is sing -- especially Pauline Malefane, who plays the Virgin Mary -- and the African chants in the eclectic score are haunting. But there is not enough of that; if the show weren't so loud, I might have dozed off.

HEADLINE: Rumsfeld Urges Caution On U.S. Role In Philippines 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said today that he would not be willing to expand an American military training mission in the Philippines unless top aides justified a step that would put Army Special Forces at greater risk and would probably commit the Pentagon to a longer-term military role there.
 The immediate issue is whether 160 American military advisers should go out with Philippine forces to provide side-by-side training while the soldiers are on jungle patrols in search of members of a militant Muslim group called Abu Sayyaf who are holding two American hostages. American advisers are now confined to training at battalion level, and do not go out on patrols. 
 But success in combating the rebel group on its southern island base of Basilan raises larger questions of how or whether the United States should help the Philippine forces track down hard-core guerrilla fighters who have fled to other islands. 
"I just haven't had it presented to me in a way that I felt sufficiently comfortable that I understood what was involved, what the cost would be, what the numbers of people would be, what the benefit might be," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "I need a greater comfort level that I understand what I am recommending to the president of this country to get involved -- in terms of people, in terms of dollars, and in terms of potential benefit."
The Joint Chiefs of Staff, the commander of American forces in the Pacific, Adm. Thomas B. Fargo, and American commanders on Basilan have all recommended putting the Green Beret advisers with Philippine soldiers as the next step in a six-month mission that is scheduled to end on July 31. Top civilian and military leaders in the Philippines also support the expanded mission.
But Mr. Rumsfeld said he wanted more time to consider the mission, and to determine how it fit into the Pentagon's longer-term goals in the Philippines, a key ally in Southeast Asia. Moreover, he said he needed to weigh the commitment of troops and resources in the Philippines against other military priorities.
"I have to take into account not just that issue in isolation, but then weigh that issue against other uses for money, other uses for people, talents, men and women in uniform, and compare those benefits against it," Mr. Rumsfeld said.
Mr. Rumsfeld's deputy, Paul D. Wolfowitz, returned today from a five-day trip to Asia that included a visit on Monday to Basilan. There he heard directly from the mission's commander, Brig. Gen. Donald Wurster, as well as Green Beret soldiers and officers, and Philippine generals. All supported an expanded mission.
"When you're down on the ground, in the woods, you can see whether they're doing things right or wrong," said Maj. Jeff Plough, a Special Forces company commander on Basilan.
Mr. Wolfowitz is believed to be leaning in favor of an expanded approach in the Philippines, partly because he has stated forcefully that to fight terrorism successfully around the world, Western nations need to bridge the gap with tolerant Muslim nations and their people. About 10 percent of Filipinos are Muslims, most of whom live in the more economically depressed areas in the south, like Basilan, which are considered ideal to become breeding grounds for terrorists.
Philippine and American officials say the mere presence of the Americans has scared many of the Abu Sayyaf fighters from the rugged hills and dense jungle of the 20-by-30-mile Basilan Island. In addition to the Green Berets, 300 Navy and Marine engineers are also on the island, paving roads, digging wells, providing medical care and clearing a 1940's-era airstrip.
These public works projects, as well as the improving security, have won praise from local community leaders among the 300,000 residents, a majority of whom are Muslims. Earlier concerns from some political critics in Manila that the Americans would soon take over the mission, as well as the hunt for the two American hostages, Martin and Gracia Burnham of Rose Hill, Kan., also appear to have dissipated.
"Thus far, the mission in the Philippines has proceeded in precisely the way it was intended," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "It has gone well. The reception on the part of the Filipino people from everything I can tell has been very positive."
But Mr. Rumsfeld said that while American forces might have brought good will and improved living conditions to Basilan, their presence had not necessarily resulted in more dead or captured terrorists.
"You can improve the situation in one place by your presence, but unless you get the terrorists, you have not improved the situation net in the world," he said. "And there has been very little of getting terrorists in the Philippines thus far."

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Passions About Tiananmen Seem to Be Fading 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, June 4 

 BODY:
Maybe it was the recession, maybe it was the government's toughening stance toward critics or maybe it was just competition from the World Cup, but the annual candlelight vigil here to remember the protesters killed by the Chinese military in Tiananmen Square in Beijing drew a sparser crowd than usual tonight.
 Organizers estimated the crowd at 45,000 people, down slightly from their estimate of 50,000 last year. The police, who have come up with slightly smaller estimates than the organizers for previous vigils, said only 12,000 people showed up tonight. While the police did not release their methods, calculations based on the density of the crowd and the space it filled indicated that the real count was below 20,000. 
 Despite unusually crisp, cool weather with few clouds, organizers had large boxes of leftover candles, and there were few of the usual lines to enter the park. 
The protesters, who held white candles topped with paper cones to protect the flames from being extinguished by a light breeze, loosely covered an area equal to two American football fields. 
Following a tradition that has developed on the anniversaries of the date when the Chinese military killed students who occupied Tiananmen Square in 1989, those protesting tonight sang songs that put mournful lyrics to uplifting contemporary music. The effect is part memorial service and part karaoke.
Szeto Wah, the chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, which organizes the demonstrations, said attendance had been hurt by Hong Kong's weak economy, which has been in recession since last summer, with record unemployment of 7.1 percent.
"Definitely there is a certain effect," he said. "They don't know the poor economy and democracy are two different things."
While Hong Kong's economy has been struggling, China's economy has been booming, and this has improved how Hong Kong residents perceive China's leaders, said Michael DeGolyer, director of the Hong Kong Transition Project, a nonprofit academic research group with a reputation for impartiality.
The project's polls indicate that more than half of Hong Kong's population is satisfied with Beijing's rule of China and, separately, with Beijing's handling of Hong Kong affairs. 
Mr. Szeto's alliance also disclosed financial difficulties in a summary of accounts this evening. The alliance had accumulated a $350,000 reserve in the 1990's as donations exceeded spending. But donations have tumbled in the current recession, and a widening deficit has forced the group to halt advertising and other promotional activities.
The Hong Kong government's hardening stance toward critics may also have discouraged a few people from attending, Mr. Szeto said. The government has arrested three people for unlawful assembly, closed an area near government offices that was a favorite spot for protests by Falun Gong adherents and rounded up Chinese immigrants who have lost court cases to remain in Hong Kong.
Some people may also have stayed home to watch soccer tonight. The World Cup has been a bigger preoccupation here than politics lately. It was not a happy day for local soccer fans, however, as Costa Rica beat China, 2 to 0, in China's first appearance in the World Cup final round of 32 nations.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Sales are up for networks but maybe not for all media.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott and Bill Carter 

 BODY:
IN the wake of the broadcast television networks' surprisingly strong performance selling commercial time for the coming season, the rest of the media are fervently hoping that the rebound will augur improved results for them, too.
 But the advertising bonanza the networks accrued during the closely watched preseason negotiations -- in what is known as the upfront market -- may not translate into robust demand for media like print or even other television outlets, like cable. 
 "I expected things to get better, and the upfront sort of confirms that," said Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director for Universal McCann in New York. "But there are still a lot of media out there having problems, as it looks as if print will lag TV. 
"There are still weak categories, like financial advertising, recruitment advertising and technology advertising, so I would be a little cautious about declaring a boom."
The results in the upfront market are so closely followed because broadcast network television is such an important medium, accounting for more than 6 percent of total ad spending each year, according to Mr. Coen of Universal McCann, a big media-buying agency that is part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Also, the broadcast upfront market starts before those for other television networks and stations, often making it the equivalent of the first robin -- or first vulture -- of spring.
Michael J. Russell Jr., an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York who follows the advertising and broadcasting industries, said, "I've been expecting advertising to be less awful this year than last, and the upfront numbers are eye-poppingly large." Estimates for the amount of advertising inventory that was sold during the upfront range from $7.5 billion to more than $8 billion.
"But I think this is less of a leading indicator for business than an echo," he said, of previous indications of improvements, like data showing consumer spending has remained relatively strong.
Some media, like the Internet and radio, had already been showing signs of improved sales before the upfront market.
"We've been noticing a steady increase, starting in the middle of the first quarter," said Gary Fries, president and chief executive at the Radio Advertising Bureau in New York, "and everything I see now has a positive number next to it.
"The upfront should help because it's traditional that when the upfront is good, strong, everybody below feels a trickle-down. But I'm cautious because business is being placed at a different tempo with 'just in time' media buying."
Mr. Fries used a phrase that has recently gained currency in the media industry to describe how marketers have been backing away from buying large amounts of advertising months in advance. Instead, they are increasingly waiting until the last minute to buy ad space and time, much as manufacturers like automakers strive to have parts delivered to plants as close as possible to assembly. The uncertainty has made it more difficult for media executives to forecast demand or what rates they can charge. And there is a concern that the longer advertisers wait to make their spending decisions, the greater the chance that bad economic news could persuade them ultimately to hold back their dollars.
"One of the great assets newspapers have is short deadlines, which is a big advantage," said Nicholas Cannistraro, president of the Newspaper National Network in New York, a division of the Newspaper Association of America. "But it's also a disadvantage when it comes to predicting advertiser behavior.
"We have yet to see much of an improvement that would translate into spending gains for the third or fourth quarter for the newspaper industry. On the other hand, the strong upfront is a good sign, and may present newspapers with some opportunities among advertisers that feel they are priced out of the market if the double-digit increases hold."
The reference was to large increases in the upfront market in the cost to reach each 1,000 viewers; the increases for some networks were estimated at as much as 10 percent to 15 percent.
Ellen Oppenheim, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at the Magazine Publishers of America in New York, said she was unsure what the robust upfront market portends for her industry. "We're glad about it to the degree it indicates there's a renewed interest in advertising among a broad range of advertisers," Ms. Oppenheim said. "But it's hard to know fully what the upfront signals because of the differences among the media themselves."
For instance, magazines "are a little bit slower on the uptick," Ms. Oppenheim said. Because magazines have production lead times as long as three months, advertising agencies make their commitments to publishers months before readers get their issues. So a recovery in the magazine industry will not become apparent until much later than in other media, like radio.
Though magazine ad pages for the first four months of 2002 fell 13.1 percent compared with a year earlier, Ms. Oppenheimer said "we're starting to see glimmers of recovery in categories like travel, where we'd seen softness, and in categories like packaged goods, where magazines are increasing their share of the media mix."
The rest of the television business is picking up mixed signals from this year's broadcast upfront. "Some fear that the broadcast-network upfront was so robust that it will suck ad dollars out of cable and syndication," said Joe Mandese, the editor of Media Buyer's Daily in New York, a newsletter published by Primedia.
"Or the strong broadcast upfront could be a positive indication for the entire media economy. "We won't know for several weeks."
Complicating the prognostication abilities of media executives is the tendency of upfront numbers to change, because most deals have escape clauses for the advertisers. "Over the last few years, it has become confusing as to what a strong upfront augurs for other media," said Chris Rohrs, president at the Television Bureau of Advertising in New York, which represents local broadcast stations.
"But in this environment, a seller's market in broadcast network television is a pretty encouraging signal generally," he added.
Local broadcast stations showed an increase in revenue in the first quarter of 3.2 percent compared with the same period in 2001, Mr. Rohrs said, fueled by spending by automotive advertisers and for campaigns related to the Winter Olympics. He forecast a strong second half, based on continued demand from automakers, particularly General Motors, and from candidates in the fall elections.

HEADLINE: Gains of 90's Did Not Lift All, Census Shows 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN and LYNETTE CLEMETSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4 

 BODY:
Despite the surging economy of the 1990's that brought affluence to many Americans, the poor remained entrenched, the Census Bureau reported today. The bureau's statistics for the 50 states and the District of Columbia show that 9.2 percent of families were deemed poor in 2000, a slight improvement from 10 percent in 1989. 
 Men's incomes fell in 26 states. Nationally, their median incomes -- meaning half earned less and half more -- fell 2.3 percent. Women's incomes, while 73 percent of men's, rose 7 percent over all and increased in every state except Alaska. More women than ever went to work. 
 "Some people thought you lost if you didn't do as well as the next guy," said Martha Farnsworth Riche, a demographer and former director of the Census Bureau. "There's no doubt that we saw more inequality in the 1990's, but people won across the board in a variety of ways." 
The data released today provide the first national look from the 2000 census at such demographic issues as income, poverty, occupation, housing and the percentage of foreign-born people living in the United States. The data are compiled from the 53-question form that was distributed to about 19 million, or about 1 in 6, of the country's households in the spring of 2000. Thus it picked up none of the impact of the recession that was beginning then.
Expanding upon figures from the initial 2000 census reports last year, the bureau reported that more than half the foreign-born population -- 52 percent -- came from Latin America, an increase from 44 percent in the decade. Of the 281.4 million people the census found in 2000, it said 31.1 million came from abroad, 11.3 million more than in 1990, an increase of 57 percent.
This increase in the immigrant population, which many state officials believe was undercounted, surpassed the century's greatest wave of immigration, from 1900 to 1910, when the number of foreign-born residents grew by 31 percent, according to the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington. 
Demographers noted that for the first time in the 1990's, immigrants moved far beyond the big coastal cities and Chicago and Denver and Houston, into the Great Plains, the South and Appalachia. 
The foreign-born population of Franklin County, Ala., grew from 0.19 percent to 5.55 percent, or from 79 people to 1,734. Dawson County, Neb., had 3,866 foreign residents, or 16 percent of the population, in 2000, up from 138 people in 1990.
"These numbers represent an enormous social experiment with very high stakes," said Steven A. Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates stricter immigration control. "No country has ever attempted to assimilate and incorporate 31 million newcomers, and the experiment is not over." 
Other analysts add, however, that immigrants helped propel the boom in the 90's, taking low-paid service jobs and vital assignments in medicine and in technology companies.
Reynolds Farley, demographer at the University of Michigan, said some of the nation's old, ailing cities also had low growth of both industry and immigration. 
Much of the huge growth in immigration in Sun Belt states, including Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee, was fueled by growth in domestic migration. The flow of wealthy individuals fleeing congested big cities created the need for low-wage workers to build homes, staff restaurants and hotels and do other low-paid service work. The result is a barbell economy of extreme haves and have-nots, said William Frey, a demographer with the Milken Institute, an economic research group in Santa Monica, Calif.
Nevada, for instance, had a 94 percent increase in the number of people with professional and graduate degrees, but also a 76 percent increase of people with less than a ninth-grade education, a number driven by new immigrants. "In the short term these groups complement one another," Mr. Frey said. "But over the long term there will need to be significant investment at the local and state level to bring these immigrants and their children into the middle class."
The census data also indicated that sprawl intruded upon the ways Americans lived and worked. Commuters spent an average of 25.5 minutes getting to work in 2000, about 3 minutes more than in 1990. Fewer walked or took public transportation. More chose to avoid all commuting. In 2000, 3.3 million people worked at home, 23 percent more than at the beginning of the decade. 
The surging economy was a boon to many.
In 10 years, owners saw the value of their homes rise 17 percent, to a median $119,600, after barely budging in the 1980's. But there were signs that new and typically bigger houses were becoming harder to hold. For 15.8 percent of homeowners, mortgage and maintenance costs exceeded 35 percent of household income, an increase from 13.5 percent in 1990. 
"Americans have more wealth, but they're living in it," Ms. Riche said. "With less liquid wealth, there's less flexibility" to save money for retirement or college tuitions.
While not all the same people were poor at the end of the decade as at the start, the proportions of the poor changed little. About 6.6 million families, or 9.2 percent of all families, qualified as poor in 1999, down from 10 percent in 1989. In 1999, a family of four was said to be living in poverty if its income was less than $16,954.
Poverty from state to state and county to county varied widely. The Children's Fund, a liberal advocacy organization, said the census showed that in nine states and the District of Columbia, one in five children was poor. "The goal is to help families escape poverty, not just escape from the welfare rolls," said Marian Wright Edelman, the organization's president. 
Poverty among adults declined little, too, from 11.3 percent to 10.9 percent. But with the overhaul of the welfare system six years ago, many women with children left the welfare rolls for work. 
The poverty rate among female-headed households with children younger than 18 fell from 42.3 percent to 34.3 percent. Poverty among the elderly also declined, to 9.9 percent of people older than 65 from 12.8 percent.
Still, American families realized some solid gains in the decade. After taking inflation into account, the bureau found that the median family income climbed 9.5 percent from 1989 to 1999, to $50,046.

HEADLINE: Edison Schools Gets $40 Million in Loans 

 BODY:
Edison Schools, the nation's largest commercial manager of public schools, announced yesterday that it had arranged to borrow the $40 million that it needs to finance its takeover of 20 public schools in Philadelphia. But the company will pay a high price, with interest rates that will range into the low teens. 
 The deal ends, at least for now, a financial crisis that threatened to derail Edison's expansion into Philadelphia, by far the largest and most ambitious effort in private management of public schools. It also buys time for the company's founder, H. Christopher Whittle, to try to demonstrate that public schools can be operated at a profit. 
 Word of the deal was greeted with relief in Philadelphia, where officials had made Edison's assignment contingent on raising the money. Edison is one of seven outside entities that will manage 42 struggling public schools in Philadelphia this fall.

HEADLINE: The Land of Denial 

BYLINE:  By Thomas L. Friedman 

 BODY:
I read in yesterday's Times that Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, says he warned the U.S. of a plot by Al Qaeda before 9/11 and that he has a new plan for a Palestinian state. I suppose that's all to the good, but frankly, none of it leaves me feeling reassured, for one simple reason: We don't need Egypt to be our policeman, we need it to be our progressive. 
 What I mean is that we need Egypt to play the role that it played in Arab politics in the 19th and early 20th centuries -- the role that history assigned it and for which it has no replacement: to lead the Arab-Muslim world into modernity with an ideological message that is rooted in Arab and Muslim tradition but is progressive, pluralistic and democratic. That is the most important thing Egypt can do for us, and that is precisely what it has not been doing for decades now. 
 Let me be blunt. Egypt is the center of gravity of the Arab world. It has the biggest middle class, the best-educated population and the people with the most potential. Egypt should be the Taiwan of the Mediterranean. But it is a country that has been stagnating, to a degree that smaller Arab countries are now passing it by.
Jordan was the first Arab country to secure a free-trade agreement with America; Bahrain is the Arab country doing the most innovative experiments with democracy; Qatar was the pioneer of free satellite television, with al-Jazeera; and Tunisia, despite its authoritarian regime, has led the way in economic liberalization and in forging closer ties with the E.U. 
All these innovations should have come from Egypt, and had they, they would have had a modernizing effect on the entire Arab world, particularly its other big stagnating countries -- Iraq, Syria and Saudi Arabia. But they are not happening. Egypt, which in the last century produced such towering Arab intellectuals as Naguib Mahfouz, Taha Hussein and Tawfik al-Hakim, has produced no successors to them. The intellectual air has gone stale in Egypt from too many years of controlled press and authoritarian politics.
President Mubarak says, "We have all kinds of democracy." Really? All kinds but genuine democracy, because a genuine democracy wouldn't be putting on trial an Egyptian democracy expert, Saad Eddin Ibrahim, for wanting the right to speak freely, press for social change and question official policy.
In the mid-1990's Mr. Mubarak seemed to realize that Egypt needed to reform and privatize its economy, to keep pace with a population that will double in 20 years. But after a little reform produced a little boomlet, he backed off doing the really hard stuff. Since 2000, Egypt's economic growth has been anemic; it has seemed unable to attract much foreign or domestic investment. Costa Rica, with 4 million people, exports more than Egypt, with 68 million; and Thailand, with the same population as Egypt, exports 10 times as much.
Yes, Egypt has been threatened by Al Qaeda too. But Egypt's way of cracking down has been to either arrest or expel radical Islamic leaders and then leave an ideological vacuum in their wake. The reason a psychopath like Osama bin Laden -- with his Arab, Islamic but backward-looking message -- could gain such currency is because no one in the Arab world, particularly Egypt, has articulated an Arab, Islamic, progressive, democratic alternative to counter him. 
The Bush team wants to spend money on TV or advertisements to broadcast our message in Arabic to the Arab world. Frankly, there is no modern, progressive message we could broadcast in Arabic that would begin to compare in influence to one that would come from Egypt. But it's not coming. 
Look, Hosni Mubarak is not our enemy. He is authentically pro-American and a bulwark against another Arab-Israeli war. But if he really wants to help us, and we really want his help, we don't need to talk to him about Al Qaeda or Israel. We need to talk to him about Egypt.
If we've learned one thing since 9/11, it's that terrorism is not produced by the poverty of money. It's produced by the poverty of dignity. It is about young middle-class Arabs and Muslims feeling trapped in countries with too few good jobs and too few opportunities to realize their potential or shape their own future -- and blaming America for it. We have to break that cycle, and no one could help us do it more effectively than the Egyptians. Does President Bush dare say that, or are we going to keep lying to ourselves and to them?

HEADLINE: At Ground Zero, a New Divide; 
Some of 9/11's Neediest Get the Least Government Aid

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
When the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation convened its first public hearing last month about efforts to rebuild the shattered core of the city, what quickly emerged was a growing schism between two groups that live and work within a mile of each other.
 Many of those who spoke at the session at Pace University on May 23 expressed anger that hundreds of millions of dollars had been set aside for large corporations and the well-off residents of Battery Park City and TriBeCa, at the expense, they said, of small businesses and the more needy residents of Chinatown and the Lower East Side. 
 It was a sentiment that was infrequently discussed during the cleanup and recovery at the World Trade Center site, but as the focus has turned to rebuilding, the protests have gained in volume. 
About $500 million has been designated for cash grants to 145 big corporations in Lower Manhattan, nearly as much as for direct aid to thousands of small businesses in the same area. American Express, for example, recently accepted a grant of $25 million, or $6,250 for each of the 4,000 jobs it agreed to keep in Lower Manhattan. 
Under a similar program, most companies with fewer than 200 employees are eligible for a maximum award of only $3,500 per worker. Similar disparities are evident in a grant program for residents. 
The comments at the hearing, some of them heated, brought to the surface difficult questions about where money goes in the rebuilding process. Is a financial services worker more valuable to the city than the owner of a dumpling shop? Is the owner of a million-dollar loft worthy of more aid than an immigrant who lives and works in a tiny apartment? 
Underlying the words of several residents of Chinatown and the Lower East Side at the hearing was anger over the apparent lack of diversity among officials involved in the rebuilding. Of the 13 directors, government advisers and executive staff members of the development corporation onstage, 11 were white men. Two of the three board members who are members of ethnic minorities did not attend. 
"We're trying to get across that Lower Manhattan is not only the ground zero area," said Vivian Williams, who spoke at the hearing and is a member of Good Old Lower East Side, a community group. "When this horrific act took place, we were also living in a war zone. So there are a whole lot of issues that have to be addressed. We know we want a memorial, and we respect that, but how about the people who are still living and trying to make it?"
A difficult calculus is at the heart of many of the decisions about the $21.5 billion in federal rebuilding aid. Grants to residents, for example, offer the most aid to those who lived closest to the site. Therefore, families living in Battery Park City and parts of TriBeCa, where the median household income is $125,000, are eligible for $14,500 in grants. 
In Chinatown, where streets were also blocked and garment factories shut after Sept. 11, household income is only a third of that in TriBeCa. Yet families there are eligible for grants that reach a maximum of $7,750. The many Chinese families and others in a smaller zone north of Canal Street are eligible for a maximum grant of $1,750.
City and state officials say it is only natural to give more money to the residents closest to the disaster site. Small businesses are important, they say, but big companies that pay large salaries also benefit the city with payroll and income taxes. 
City economic development officials also say that aid programs for small companies are less restrictive than those for large companies and can provide up to three times the benefits per employee when tax breaks and other noncash incentives are counted. 
Community advocates also used the hearing as an opportunity to raise many issues that were problems in those neighborhoods long before Sept. 11, including a lack of adequate medical care and a dearth of low-priced housing. Many of the programs they complained about, though, are administered not by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation but by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the city and state economic development agencies.
Nevertheless, the residents' comments have caused Louis R. Tomson, the president of the development corporation, and others to take a closer look. After the hearing, Mr. Tomson took a walking tour of Chinatown, talking with small-business owners and visiting a garment factory on Mott Street. 
"It was a modest beginning to understanding the issues that were raised at the hearing," Mr. Tomson said. "Our mandate is to focus first on the World Trade Center site and the area immediately around it. But we wouldn't have been given the job of overseeing the revitalization of Lower Manhattan south of Houston Street if we weren't intended to make Chinatown and the other neighborhoods downtown good communities in which to live and work."
The development corporation is planning to hire Asian Americans for Equality, a nonprofit community group, to help administer its residential grant program in Chinatown and provide other services for the corporation, people involved in the process said.
In addition, Peterson Littenberg Architects, the urban-design firm hired to help the development corporation's staff with planning, is focusing on ways to revive the parts of Lower Manhattan not in the immediate vicinity of ground zero, including Chinatown and the Lower East Side, officials said. 
Christopher Kui, the executive director of Asian Americans for Equality, said that roughly 40 garment factories had closed since Sept. 11 and that business at many of the neighborhood's 500 restaurants was still down 20 percent to 30 percent.
"The revival of Chinatown is an integral part of the revitalization of Lower Manhattan," he said. "We did not experience the physical destruction of buildings that the area around the World Trade Center did, but much of the economic activity in Chinatown stopped after Sept. 11."
One roadblock, he said, is that some aid programs use Canal Street as a dividing line for benefits, even though many businesses and residents affected by the disaster are north of Canal. 
Kong Lian, the owner of the Sun Dou Dumpling Shop at 214 Grand Street in Chinatown, is one such small-business owner. In August, Ms. Kong signed a lease for her current location after five years on Mott Street. After the attacks, she said, renovations were delayed because contractors and city building officials were in short supply. 
Once she opened at the Grand Street site in December, restrictions on travel and parking discouraged visitors. Layoffs of garment workers also hurt. As a new business north of Canal Street, the restaurant could benefit little from city and state grant programs. 
After investing close to $300,000 in personal savings and taking a low-interest loan from Asian Americans for Equality, Ms. Kong said the shop was breaking even, but only because she and two family members have drawn no salary for six months.
The frustration of people like Ms. Kong and Ms. Williams, the Good Old Lower East Side member, are likely to be on display at a march and rally today. Organized by a coalition of community groups called the Beyond Ground Zero Network, participants are planning to march from Chinatown to Foley Square for a demonstration at 12:30 p.m.
Melissa Aase, a program director of University Settlement, part of another community coalition called Rebuild With a Spotlight on the Poor, said that even if all the issues being raised by the downtown residents were not clearly within the purview of the development corporation, its guiding principles say that its efforts are intended to help people at a wide variety of income levels.
"We're trying to encourage them to see themselves as a group that can exert policy leadership," she said. "But so far, it's not clear they're thinking about low-income people in this effort."

DEWEY, GORDON CHIPMAN

 BODY:
DEWEY-Gordon Chipman. 79, died peacefully May 30, 2002, at his home in New York City. Mr. Dewey was born in New York on April 9, 1923, to the late Frederick A. and Elisabeth (Braley) Dewey and is the grandson of John Dewey, the American philosopher and educator. Mr. Dewey studied nuclear physics at Harvard during WW II. During the war years, he worked at the Radiation Laboratory at MIT on early radar technology, as well as on The Manhattan Project. He was later recruited to be at the Pentagon for the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the Weapon Systems Evaluation Group, analyzing the nuclear retaliatory mission. In the 1950's he was a consultant to the Department of Defense, the White House (as a presidential appointee to the Air Traffic Control Board) and companies such as the Rand Corporation. In 1955, he founded The Dewey Electronics Corporation, taking it public in 1960. Today the company is active in the snowmaking and defense industries. He was President and CEO until his death. Mr. Dewey's extensive philanthropic efforts centered on education. He was past chairman of the Navy League Scholarship Committee. For 27 years he led The New York Institute for Special Education through a period of major building and transformation as the president of its board. The Institute began for the blind and was then expanded to meet the needs of children with other disabilities. He was an avid sailor and spent his summers in Nantucket. Mr. 
Dewey had the distinction of being one of the longest-running members of the New York Yacht Club. His warm and wise presence will be missed. Mr. Dewey is survived by his wife of 48 years, Frances Dear; his children, Frederick R., Dede W., John H. D. (Sara); and his sister Joanna. A memorial service is scheduled for Wednesday, June 5 at 3 PM at the Heavenly Rest Church, 2 East 90th St. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the New York Institute for Special Education, 999 Pelham Parkway, Bronx, NY, 10469.
 DEWEY-Gordon. The steering committee, staff and friends of Cornerstone, a national literacy initiative of The New York Institute for Special Education, notes with sadness and affection the passing of Gordon Dewey, the Chairman of the Board of The New York Institute for Special Education. Mr. Dewey was committed to raising the standards for children with special challenges, and in so doing, acting on the belief that no one is without gifts. He raised difficult questions and provided unwavering support. Our thoughts are with his wife Fran and other members of the Dewey family.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
At Least in One Respect, Washington Is a Stable Place to Do Business

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Underpinned by a recession-proof federal government, the demand for office space in the District of Columbia has remained strong at a time when many markets around the country have grown distinctly softer. In fact, successful office developments are leading to the revival of once-neglected areas on the eastern end of downtown Washington.
 "The federal government stabilizes the economy here," said Brian T. McVay, a senior managing director at Cushman & Wakefield, the national real estate brokerage and services company. "You do not see 40 to 50 percent rent spikes. You do see a steady rent escalation of 3 to 5 percent a year, which is why Washington is always one of the top two or three markets in the country." 
 Despite a one percentage point increase in the vacancy rate, to 5.7 percent in the first quarter, office rental rates have remained firm, with the average asking rate increasing 7 percent from a year ago, to $39.50 a square foot a year. 
This predictability has attracted the attention of investors, who paid an average of $244.85 a square foot for properties in the first quarter, an increase of 28 percent from the level in 2001, according to Cushman & Wakefield. The city has 107 million square feet of office space that is privately owned, with the federal government leasing 17.8 million. In addition, the government owns 32.8 million square feet.
Although private-sector employment has surpassed the number of government jobs in recent years, the stability of government demand for real estate provides a firm basis of demand. But it is also a quirky market. Because of rules that limit the height of buildings to less than the dome of the Capitol (about 130 feet downtown) architecture here is largely undramatic boxes. 
Because of security concerns, Pennsylvania Avenue, a major east-west artery, remains blocked in front of the White House, snarling already heavy traffic. Because there is parkland to the north and south of the White House, the closing of the avenue put a multiblock plug in the middle of the city.
"People have to decide whether they want to be east or west of the White House," said Audrey Z. Cramer, an executive vice president of Cushman & Wakefield. 
Increasingly they are looking east.
For decades the city's commercial core ran along K Street from 22nd Street in the west to 13th Street in the east. Although the prime retail area of Washington, including the onetime Garfinckel's and Woodward & Lothrop department stores, lay to the east, the area had little allure for office tenants and not much development took place there in the years after the civil unrest of 1968.
It was the lawyers who got things going, real estate executives said. Rapidly growing law firms were outgrowing the relatively confined spaces in the office buildings lining K Street and were looking for a place to put hundreds of partners and associates, even if it meant moving to an unfamiliar part of town.
"The law firms started moving out of K Street in the late 1980's," said Thomas M. Fulcher Jr., a senior vice president in the Washington office of Julien J. Studley, a brokerage firm that has specialized in representing tenants. "These were big deals," he said. "One firm, Wilmer Cutler, took 450,000 square feet of space."
One reason the move was relatively easy was the presence of the Metro, Washington's quiet, clean subway system that can quickly deliver commuters from the suburbs to the heart of downtown.
The area of town known as the East End got a further lift in 1997 when the MCI Center opened on F Street between 6th and 7th Streets. The arena is home to two professional sports teams, the hockey Capitals and the basketball Wizards and is where the Georgetown University Hoyas play. Concerts and other events are held there as well.
The center helped lure people downtown in the evenings and convinced them that the streets were safe. "The arena is driving development because people will hang out in the area now," said Brian C. Sullivan, a retail specialist at Cushman & Wakefield. 
Now a vast $750 million convention center is under construction just to the north and due to open next year. While no final decisions have been made, plans are being drawn up to convert the existing convention center, which is scheduled to be torn down, into a Lincoln Center-like cultural hub.
Real estate executives say the recent changes in political leadership of the city and the rebuilding of municipal finances have gone a long way toward improving the confidence of investors and businessmen.
Increased street traffic is attracting restaurants and retailers to the area and particularly to F Street, the traditional retail focal point. One developer is proceeding with a plan to restore the 100-year-old Woodward & Lothrop store, with its elaborate, landmarked facade, as a mixed retail and office development. The store, at 10th and F Streets, was long the anchor for the F Street corridor and may again fill that function.
Douglas Jemal, the head of Douglas Development, which is doing the conversion of the building universally known as Woodie's, said the city was trying to recapture some of the sales lost to suburban malls. "In 1950, 90 percent of all the retail sales in the metropolitan area were in the District," he said. "In 2002, it is about 2 percent."
Although the existence of the Metro subway means that his location, as he puts it "is 15 minutes away from five million people," he said the construction of the subway downtown in the 1970's and 80's had a lot to do with a retail decline that ended with all the major department stores except Hecht's disappearing.
"They tore up the streets and displaced merchants -- everything was a Metro bomb zone," Mr. Jemal said. "The merchants moved to the suburbs and never came back."
He said he planned to install a mix of nationally branded retailers in the basement and first floor of the 550,000-square-foot building and office tenants in the eight higher floors. The stores, which may include Crate & Barrel, H & M and the Container Store, would replicate the diversity of goods once offered in department stores.
Other, smaller buildings in the area are being redeveloped. To preserve the look and feel of the area, developers are being required to limit the scale of their projects. On some streets in the East End, building facades stand alone supported by steel framework as builders prepare to erect new structures and re-attach the facades.
Retail and restaurant development is changing the look of the East End and making it a more attractive place to live, real estate executives say. Some 10,000 units of housing are under construction or in advanced planning in the downtown area, which could transform it from a 9-to-5 office location to a 24-hour neighborhood.
There has been some slippage of government agencies to the suburbs, where real estate prices are cheaper. Many health-related agencies migrated to the Maryland suburbs where the National Institutes of Health is located, and some related to the military headed to northern Virginia where the Department of Defense has its headquarters in the Pentagon.
But military contractors have begun moving into the southeastern part of the city as a result of a decision to move the Navy's major procurement agency to the old Navy Yard along the Potomac River.
After flirting with a move to Maryland, the Securities and Exchange Commission recently signed a lease for 650,000 square feet of space in Station Place, a planned 1.5 million-square-foot development by the Louis Dreyfus Property Group adjacent to the Union Station railroad terminal.
A presidential executive order bars cabinet-level agencies from leaving the city, said the District's congressional delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton. She said she uses her position on watchdog subcommittees to make sure that lesser-ranking agencies do not stray.
"There is some interest in backup computer space in other locations since 9/11, but it is expensive and comes out of the agency's budget," she said. "Most agencies want to be close to Congress and 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue."

HEADLINE: Canadians Are Focusing on Curbing Inflation 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, June 4 

 BODY:
Pointing to an unexpectedly robust economy, the Bank of Canada raised its crucial overnight interest rate today for the second time in less than two months.
 The central bank's lifting of the rate, from 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, indicates that the bank is more concerned that accelerating growth will unleash new inflationary pressures than about political uncertainties stemming from Sunday's abrupt ouster of Paul Martin, the finance minister. 
 Canadian banks responded to the Bank of Canada's move by raising their prime lending rate from 4 percent to 4.25 percent.
In today's statement, the central bank said that "with the economy showing strong momentum and moving back toward full production capacity more quickly than had been expected," the bank would take whatever action was necessary to hold the inflation rate to its 2 percent target. The core inflation rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, accelerated to 2.2 percent in the year ended in April. 
Statistics Canada reported last week that the economy grew at an annual rate of 6 percent, after adjusting for inflation, in the first quarter of 2002, up from 2.9 percent the previous three months. Just two months ago, the central bank estimated that first-quarter growth would be 4.5 percent.
Although Canada's economy has become increasingly integrated with that of the United States, growth has recently outstripped that in the United States. Real gross domestic product in the United States expanded 5.6 percent in the first quarter.
George Vasic, chief economist at UBS Bunting Warburg in Toronto, said the divergence resulted because there was "less exuberance" in Canada in the late 1990's and Canadian businesses were now cutting back less aggressively than were their American counterparts.
Mr. Vasic said that tax cuts announced by Mr. Martin before the last federal election in fall 2000 and carried out last year had also "kept us on an even keel."
Aron Gampel, deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia, said that with interest rates low, Canadian consumers "have really decided to go on an epic shopping spree." For instance, sales of new motor vehicles jumped 10 percent in May from a year earlier, the fourth monthly double-digit gain so far this year.
Craig Wright, chief economist at the Royal Bank of Canada, described today's statement by the central bank as "a little more hawkish" than in the recent past. Echoing several other analysts, he forecast that the bank would push up interest rates by about another 1.5 percentage points this year, with more increases probable in 2003.
Meanwhile, the government has moved quickly to reassure financial markets that Mr. Martin's departure will not affect its economic policies. Prime Minister Jean Chretien dismissed Mr. Martin because of his efforts to rally support within the Liberal Party for his bid to succeed Mr. Chretien as party leader.
In a speech on Monday night, Mr. Martin's successor as finance minister, John Manley, said: "Although individuals might change within government, our priorities and objectives have not and will not change. That means balanced budgets, reduced debt, low and stable inflation, tax cuts and key investments." Mr. Manley is also deputy prime minister.
Although Mr. Martin has been widely praised as one of the best finance ministers in recent Canadian history, his departure has had little impact on financial markets. "Nothing is going to change with Mr. Martin on the sidelines," Mr. Vasic said.
The Canadian dollar, which has firmed markedly against the United States dollar the last month, was above 65 United States cents today, a bit stronger than the level it settled at on Monday. It touched a low of 62.1 cents in January.

HEADLINE: A New Welfare Policy for New York 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg took a courageous stand when he announced that he was moving away from a welfare policy fixated on reducing the number of people on welfare toward one that would encourage education and training and provide vital support like child care. The new policy will do more to help New York City's welfare recipients find real, lasting jobs. It also reflects a growing awareness that the Giuliani administration's so-called "work-first" policies were less effective than they might have been, and in some instances harmful. 
 Under Mr. Giuliani, the welfare rolls were dramatically reduced. But a shortage of training and education programs for former welfare recipients left many of them with make-work or dead-end jobs that keep them in poverty. It is possible to train workers for jobs that actually exist, though the city will need to confer with the business community more closely than it has. 
 The Giuliani administration's indifference to job training was further reflected in its response to the 1998 Workforce Investment Act, which was aimed primarily at low-income and displaced workers. The city failed to spend as much as $100 million during the initial phase of the program, which was aimed at helping workers acquire marketable skills. Local governments were supposed to set up one-stop centers where the jobless could find a full range of services. Workers could learn English or receive vouchers to underwrite training for specific jobs or instruction leading to a junior college degree in, say, computer technology. Most cities have since set up systems to move displaced workers into real jobs. New York is known in Congress as having one of the worst records in the country. 
The city's disappointing record with former welfare recipients was revealed in a City Council hearing last month when officials were forced to produce statistics showing how many unemployed workers and former welfare recipients had been placed in lasting jobs. Council members listened in disbelief as a deputy commissioner for the Human Resources Administration testified that the city's elaborate and expensive job training and placement services had found jobs lasting more than 90 days for only 10 percent of those people who went through processing. 
The 90-day mark is significant because that is one of the points at which job-search agencies get paid for placing people. Some critics suspect that placement companies manipulate the process so that they get their payment and then dump job candidates back into the market. 
Mr. Bloomberg has wisely moved to cut back placement contracts for agencies that have done a poor job. The main question now is what will happen to the various streams of federal money that are intended to move idle workers and former welfare recipients into the economy. Details of the new policy are not yet clear. But Mr. Bloomberg is clearly on the right track.

HEADLINE: Facing Veto Threat, Senate Debates Counterterror Funds 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4 

 BODY:
The Senate today took up a $31.4 billion emergency counterterrorism measure that Republican critics called too expensive and replete with spending that had little or nothing to do with responding to the Sept. 11 attacks. The White House threatened a veto.
 The administration, lawmakers and outside analysts said the measure, which exceeded President Bush's request by $4 billion and what the House approved last month by $2 billion, included items like relief for New England fishermen, coral-reef mapping in Hawaii and a new home for museum specimens. 
 "Nonemergency pork barrel spending continues unabated," said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and a Senate scold on the subject. "It is unfortunate that in a time of war my colleagues cannot curb their appetite." 
Democrats defended the spending as justified and said critics were nitpicking a measure that would improve national security.
"Why some people would come to the floor and attempt to be critical over monies that are for the defense of our homeland is beyond me," said Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia and chairman of the Appropriations Committee.
As debate began, the Senate moved quickly to respond to a lobbying campaign by US Airways against restrictions on airline loans created after Sept. 11, easily passing an amendment that would remove the limits and help the airline seek federal aid.
Senators were also considering using the bill as a vehicle to resolve other sticky financial matters, including a raise of the federal debt ceiling.
Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., director of the Office of Management and Budget, delivered the administration's view on the bill in a luncheon meeting with Republican senators. "The president requested all that is needed and all that is affordable," Mr. Daniels told reporters later.
In carving out a negotiating position to push the spending level down, the administration used tough language in a statement, saying it "strongly opposes this bill." 
Republican leaders also took aim at the supplemental bill, with Senator Trent Lott, the minority leader, telling a group of visiting builders that some in Congress were treating the terrorism emergency "like a cookie jar."
Representative Dick Armey, the Texas Republican who is House majority leader, also ridiculed aspects of the bill, singling out "spending like $2 million for worm collection, enough said."
In fact, the $2 million will go to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History for planning of a new storage facility for animal specimens in the Maryland suburbs.
Also singled out as extraneous was $11 million in economic assistance to be provided to fishermen in four New England states who suffered losses due to new fishing restrictions.
Tom Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste, pointed to the $2.5 million for coral-reef mapping. "Last I heard, Al Qaeda was not swimming around coral reefs," he said.
Supporters of the measure in the Democratic-controlled Senate said that some provisions being criticized had been originated by Republicans and that the bill was a serious attempt to improve domestic security.
"It is time we understand this bill is important," said Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the assistant majority leader. He said that money in the measure would go toward food safety, border security, cybersecurity, postal protection and guaranteeing the safety of the water supply. --------------------

Air Hijacking Drill
DENVER, June 4 (AP) -- Two jets packed with people took off today from Salt Lake City and Whidbey Island Naval Air Station at Oak Harbor, Wash., in a twin hijacking drill designed to improve coordination among American and Canadian agencies. Fighter jets from the North American Aerospace Defense Command scrambled to respond to the simulated hijackings, and ran through several scenarios, including one that involved shooting down the planes.

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
Edison Schools Gets Reprieve: $40 Million In Financing

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG and DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Edison Schools Inc., the nation's largest commercial manager of public schools, announced yesterday that it had arranged to borrow the $40 million that it needs to finance its takeover of 20 struggling public schools in Philadelphia. But the company will pay a stiff price -- interest rates that are expected to range into the low teens.
 The deal ends, at least for now, a financial crisis that had threatened to derail Edison's expansion into Philadelphia, by far the largest and most ambitious experiment in the short and stormy history of private management of public schools. 
 It also buys time for the company's founder, H. Christopher Whittle, to try to demonstrate that public schools can be operated at a profit, although he has not done so since Edison started managing schools in 1995. While the infusion seems to assure that Edison will be able to open its new and existing schools in the fall, the company's financial condition remains uncertain. 
With high overhead and start-up costs, Edison consumes a large amount of cash each year. Without profits, it will continually need financing to increase its roster of schools and repay its debts. Edison will use some of the new money to expand its presence in about a dozen other school districts in September, including Indianapolis and Kansas City, Mo. But its primary focus in raising the money has been Philadelphia, because of its scale and its significance in the debate over the role of for-profit companies in public education. 
"This fulfills our promise to Philadelphia," Mr. Whittle said yesterday. "But mostly, it removes what was a very significant uncertainty for the company and our customers." 
Edison will receive $30 million in loans from Chelsey Capital, a New York investment fund started by Stuart D. Feldman, a venture capitalist. Chelsey approached Edison through its general counsel, William B. Wachtel, a New York lawyer whose father, Harry, was a legal adviser to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and whose own clients have included the Lefrak Organization and the family that founded Zabar's, the food store.
The younger Mr. Wachtel, who joined with Martin Luther King 3d in 1999 to found the Drum Major Institute for Public Policy, an organization committed to advancing civil rights, said in an interview last night that Chelsey was helping to finance Edison "with the firm belief it will bear two dividends -- one, in terms of an economic return; two, helping to see the public schools in America get some very-much-needed help." 
"We firmly believe," Mr. Wachtel said, "that this is exactly the opportunity Edison presented." He added that he had been friends for 20 years with Benno C. Schmidt Jr., the chairman of Edison. 
The remaining $10 million will come from Merrill Lynch, Edison's longtime investment adviser, which had already extended a $35 million line of credit to the company.
The loans, although expensive, nevertheless seemed to encourage investors. Edison's shares closed yesterday at $1.60, up more than 60 percent since Monday's close of 98 cents but still 90 percent below its January levels of about $20 a share.
Word of the deal was greeted with relief in many circles in Philadelphia, where officials had made Edison's assignment contingent on raising the cash it needs to buy new computers and textbooks, and train teachers -- upfront expenses that Edison must try to recoup from its revenues from the district. Edison and the district are still negotiating how much Edison will be paid. 
"The last thing we would need is significant disruption or significant uncertainty about the plans we're trying to implement," said Michael Masch, a vice president for budget and management at the University of Pennsylvania who is one of five members of the state panel operating the Philadelphia district.
But Mr. Masch and others in Philadelphia expressed caution, noting that the new financing, while critical in the short run, does not answer the question of whether Edison's business plan is viable in the long run.
"It's the same as the average citizen who is able to apply for six credit cards," said Jerry T. Jordan, a vice president of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers, which has opposed Edison's presence in the city. If Edison were to exhaust its credit, Mr. Jordan said, then schoolchildren might face sudden belt-tightening. "Our kids can't afford to have the belt tightened any more than it already is," he added.
Edison, which educates about 75,000 students in 22 states, has relied on the sale of fresh shares to finance its rapid expansion since it began managing schools. But that option evaporated this spring, when a regulatory investigation and widespread investor disappointment -- Edison had indicated that it would get more than twice as many schools in Philadelphia as it did -- drove the company's stock to lunch-money levels.
"We knew this would be costly, and it was," Mr. Whittle said yesterday morning, after negotiating through the night and finally getting to the handshake stage at dawn. 
Edison has traditionally paid top dollar to borrow -- on some loans, as much as 20 percent -- and this occasion is no exception. Although the final terms of the deal have not yet been announced, Edison expects to pay interest rates ranging as high as the low teens, Mr. Whittle said. By contrast, the national average rate for home equity credit lines, which roughly parallels a commercial line of credit, is 5.35 percent.
Like a consumer, Edison has pledged substantial assets as collateral, including the loans it has made to help charter schools finance construction. Although the deal's fine print is not yet available, Edison's creditors could wind up taking over those school mortgages if Edison were unable to repay its debts.
Mr. Whittle said that although the new lines of credit were expensive, the deal was not as damaging to shareholders as would have been the case if Edison tried to raise the $40 million by selling new stock at recent prices. Besides promising to pay high interest rates and pledging substantial collateral, Edison also gave Chelsey Capital and Merrill Lynch a contract, called a warrant, that gives them the right to buy up to 10.7 million Edison shares for $1 apiece.
Edison is one of seven outside entities, including the University of Pennsylvania and Temple University, that have been assigned responsibility for managing 42 struggling public schools in Philadelphia this fall. But with nearly 15,000 students in 20 schools, Edison will be running more than twice the number of schools it manages in any other district, and at least four times any other entity in Philadelphia.
In the next few weeks, Edison and the other vendors are expected to sign contracts with the state panel overseeing the district that will specify how much vendors will be paid per pupil. The organizations will then begin the process of preparing those schools for next fall's openings.

HEADLINE: Speaker Watches Backyard In Battles on Tax Incentives 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
One of the things holding up approval of the city's $400 million tax package in Albany is a $3 million disagreement, according to state and city officials. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, has said that a tax incentive zone for business investment should encompass everything below Houston Street.
 Mr. Silver said the Senate wants the zone to be confined to below Canal Street, a difference of roughly 1.5 square miles and $3 million in tax revenue. Complicating matters is the fact that Mr. Silver represents Lower Manhattan, and his district extends to a few blocks above Houston. 
 "He's looking basically for his own little tax package in his district," said John McArdle, a spokesman for Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, adding that the issue was not holding up the legislation. 
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg supports Mr. Silver's position, a spokesman said.
The quibbling is but one of many reasons that have been offered for the delay in passing the city's package, a delay that has already hurt the city. But it also illustrates the odd position Mr. Silver has found himself in since Sept. 11. 
Mr. Silver is the most powerful politician from the city in Albany, and thus perceived as an important voice for the city's needs. But providing aid to businesses and residents in ravaged Lower Manhattan is in effect the same as providing benefits to Mr. Silver's constituents. 
Mr. Silver has not gone out of his way to dispel that impression. He has made posters, featuring a photo of himself, advertising three periods of sales-tax-free shopping downtown, the first of which begins on Sunday. He persuaded the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation to expand the area eligible for grants to include Chinatown and Little Italy. Then he followed up with letters in three languages telling residents that they could now apply for $1,000 each if they would stay put for two years.
Mr. Silver said his efforts had only one motivation. "We are trying to get it done so that the financial engine of this state is repaired," he said, adding indignantly, "Our ability to provide the Senate with the pork that they exist for is very dependent on the revenue that we generate."
Some have perceived Mr. Silver's interest as limited to what he can do to help his constituents and political allies like Unite, the garment workers' union, whose industry is centered in Chinatown. But others say that with Wall Street interests, the World Financial Center and TriBeCa well represented in planning for downtown, Mr. Silver has been a needed flag carrier for residents with less of a voice.
"I think the press has been unfairly cynical about Silver, who I think is absolutely serious and committed on representing the interests of people that he feels will otherwise be ignored," said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce.
Thanks to the speaker's urging, Madelyn Wils, the chairwoman of Community Board 1, became the only resident of Lower Manhattan to serve on the board of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which controls much of the federal money flowing in. 
But Mr. Silver's power to do anything at all has been closely circumscribed. Gov. George E. Pataki, not the Legislature or the mayor, controlled the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, although Mr. Silver, who has spent 26 years representing the district, has sent a representative to every meeting. 
His staff argues that the speaker has consistently anticipated problems and has worked tirelessly to ensure that agencies mesh and Washington comes through with aid. His aides said that it was his blueprint, they point out, that initially laid out a larger role for the mayor, which Governor Pataki eventually agreed to allow. Mr. Silver had, aides said, the first hearing on air quality, and elected officials from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to the City Council followed suit. 
Yet Mr. Silver has been left to do things like issue news releases that say: "The governor plans later today to announce $20 million in economic development grants for small businesses in Chinatown, Little Italy, the Orchard Street area and all of Lower Manhattan. These grants are part of an economic development package that I insisted upon."

HEADLINE: General Motors Chairman Announces He'llRetire Next Year 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 4 

 BODY:
John F. Smith Jr. said today that he would step down next year as chairman of General Motors when he reaches the company's retirement age of 65.
 During his decade-long tenure at the top of the world's largest automaker, Mr. Smith was credited with greatly improving efficiency and transforming G.M. from a disparate group of competing brands to a unified company. Of late, the company has even halted a long decline in market share. 
 But Mr. Smith was also criticized for having no eye for catchy designs. Analysts praise Rick Wagoner, who took over as chief executive in 2000, for hiring Robert A. Lutz, the former Chrysler president, as vice chairman and resident taste maker. 
"G.M. has come a long way from the dark days of the early '90's, and I take enormous satisfaction that I am leaving the company in good hands," Mr. Smith said at the shareholder meeting in Wilmington, Del.
Though the board recently waived its retirement policy to hire Mr. Lutz, 70, Mr. Smith said he would retire in April and help his son run a small grocery business on Cape Cod. No successor was named, though Mr. Wagoner is a likely candidate.
"I've got 42 years in," Mr. Smith said in an interview. "I'm ready to go."
He started working at a G.M. plant in Framingham, Mass., while working on a masters in business administration at Boston University. He worked for the financial operation and at posts in Europe and Canada, and oversaw international operations. 
If the company can maintain its profit and sales momentum, Wall Street will view Mr. Smith's tenure as a success. Last year, G.M. was the only Big Three automaker to make money. Earlier this week, an initial quality survey by J. D. Power & Associates ranked G.M. third in the industry, the highest for a domestic automaker since the study's methodology changed in 1998. 
"What I'd give him credit for is dismantling General Motors as we knew it," said Gary Lapidus, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. "Jack took on the confederacy of car companies that was General Motors and turned it into one company with six brands."
Mr. Smith said "it wasn't rocket science that told us we had a great opportunity to centralize." 
"We have a manufacturing plan that is consistent across all of our manufacturing operations," he added, while earlier "we probably had eight or nine different plans." 
Mr. Smith also had a less domineering personality than previous executives and played a central role in establishing a joint venture with Toyota in the 1980's. 
"Because Jack had spent so much time outside of Detroit, he was much broader in his thinking and less insular," said Wendy B. Needham, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. "He brought the Toyota principles over and understood the need for lean manufacturing."
Analysts are skeptical of some of his biggest foreign deals, like the purchase of 20 percent of Fiat. Mr. Smith has also not been much liked by environmental groups, who watched G.M. continue to lead battles against higher fuel economy standards. John DeCicco, a senior fellow at Environmental Defense, called Mr. Smith's environmental record "utterly undistinguished."
But most criticism focused on the blandness of G.M. products during most of his tenure.
"It's a mixed bag," said Gerald Meyers, the former chief executive of American Motors, now part of DaimlerChrysler. 
"On the good side, he was at the helm when the company stabilized and, of late, stopped the losses," he said. "On the other side, he was unable to improve its market penetration and showed an extraordinary skill in spitting out lousy products, one right after the other."
The company has shown glimmers of attitude with newer vehicles, and Mr. Lutz has Detroit buzzing about G.M.'s invigorated designs.
"I spent the last half of my career in turnaround operations, first in Europe and then in North America," Mr. Smith said. "Hopefully, the next 10 years will be to the upside."

HEADLINE: ARTS ABROAD; 
Commerce Follows Artists Into the SoHo of Shanghai

BYLINE:  By Anna Esaki-Smith 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, June 5 

 BODY:
An artists' community is growing here along the meandering Suzhou Creek, which empties into the Huangpu River at the northern tip of this city's riverside esplanade. Abandoned waterfront warehouses, hulking memorials to the manufacturing days of Shanghai, provide artists with huge work spaces.
 Last year newspapers heralded the return of fish to the creek, suggesting that an ambitious billion-dollar city cleanup had improved upon a past when raw sewage and chemicals were routinely dumped into its waters. More recently, vast apartment complexes have sprung up in a place where residents used to keep their windows shut year-round because of the stench. 
 This creekside area that has been revitalized is often called Shanghai's SoHo. But as was the case with its namesake in Manhattan, the tug of commercial possibilities may uproot the growing artists' community. The land beneath the warehouses containing studios and galleries has recently been sold to developers, artists say, and the warehouses could be razed for commercial development and a park. 
"We live in a commerce-driven society," said Li Liang, the owner of Eastlink Gallery, which covers 6,500 square feet on the second floor of a former grain warehouse along Suzhou Creek. "You try to do new things, influence society, but in the end you pretty much know what the results will be."
Two years ago the Shanghai Biennial, a government-sponsored art show designed to put the city on the cultural connoisseurs' map, took place at two sites in town, but a band of intrepid artists with no official ties put on a series of their own shows, including one at Eastlink.
Their exhibitions included a video of three artists walking around town as their blood dripped into tubes from catheters in their arms, and a live performance of a diaper-clad artist floating down the Huangpu in a plastic bubble. Some of the shows were shut down by city authorities, which frayed the relationship between the local government and rebel artists.
The art at Eastlink is not the sort favored by the nouveau riche of China. Some of it is installation art, like a pyramid of layered blue-green glass shown at an exhibition earlier this year, paired with a television screen enclosed in a wooden box. Mr. Li said he focused more on exposing people to forms of modern art than on actually selling it. Officials at the Shanghai Cultural Bureau would not comment on development plans for the Suzhou Creek area. 
Teng Kun-yen, 52, a Taiwanese architect, also has a vision about how to marry art with commerce as he works in a former rice warehouse thought to have once belonged to a local gangster. He has given city officials his proposal to transform 30 waterfront warehouses into eight cultural centers focusing on music, fashion, architecture and other arts. Although he doesn't know the status of his proposal, he said he felt that some officials might be leaning in his direction. He said his hopes were buoyed by the suspension of plans to build a garbage-disposal plant next to his studio, where three old buildings were demolished. 
He admitted, however, that conflict seemed to reign. City and district authorities are unclear about how to develop the Suzhou Creek area, Mr. Teng said, and are "entangled in disputes."
The warehouse containing Mr. Teng's studio was built in 1933 and has an Art Deco facade, massive wooden beams and high ceilings. Mr. Teng spent around $100,000 renovating the roughly 25,000-square-foot space, and the yearly rent is just over $40,000. The infrastructure was so solid that little basic reconstruction was needed. 
The appeal of the warehouses is not just their large size and affordability, but their embodiment of Shanghai's history as a bustling international trading port. Mr. Teng said he believed that his building was designed by Americans.
In the early 1990's many old factories along the creek closed or their operations moved to rural areas as the state-run economy of China began to implode and Shanghai started to reinvent itself as a financial center. 
During the subsequent development boom here, blocks of historic buildings were razed to make room for modern offices. Many people fear that the same fate awaits the warehouses.
But Mr. Teng said he saw a promising precedent in the preservation of the hall where the Communist Party was born and of nearby buildings in central Shanghai, which now house upscale restaurants and cafes. If the government wants to go ahead with a preservation project, "the speed of doing things is unimaginable," Mr. Teng said, adding, "Democratic countries can't do that." 
In a last-ditch effort to save the historic warehouse area, preservationists are mounting a letter-writing campaign to this city's mayor. Even if construction of modern buildings gains momentum, there is optimism that some buildings will be preserved. Most artists realize, however, that the lure of commerce over culture may be too mighty for city authorities to resist. 
A woman who works at a gallery in the Suzhou Creek district said, "Only a sliver of hope remains."

HEADLINE: POP REVIEW; 
Funky Mystic Who Longs For Freedom Of All Kinds

BYLINE:  By JON PARELES 

 BODY:
Funk has its share of pragmatists who just want to make people dance. It also has mystics like Meshell Ndegeocello, who hear sex and revolution, culture and nature in the ways instruments mesh to share a groove. Her set on Sunday night at the Bowery Ballroom was a series of unhurried vamps that left room for her to sing, to rap, to talk and to moan. She was introducing songs from her new album, "Cookie: The Anthropological Mixtape" (Maverick), persuading and seducing side by side. 
 Ms. Ndegeocello has a lot on her mind. "God bless America," she mused. "Why just America?" 
 Her new single, "Pocketbook," observes a woman with money in her pocketbook, an eye on the world and the urge to "shake that thing." Other songs ponder bisexual flirtations, success and the cliches of hip-hop video; in "God, Fear, Money," she envisions a returned Jesus thrown in jail while the Devil appears on MTV's "Total Request Live." 
What her songs share is a longing for freedom of all kinds: civil, economic, sexual. She sees obstacles, but she is too hard-headed to gripe. With her deep, husky voice, Ms. Ndegeocello matter-of-factly observes the follies around her, but then she lets herself sing, dropping her defenses to melt into intimacy. In her songs, common sense and sensuality keep close company. "I ain't gonna pay your rent/ 'Cause all I got is love," she sang.
Funk is the songs' universe: their pulse, their colors, their atmosphere. Ms. Ndegeocello, who played bass every so often during her set, knows funk from the rhythm section on up, and she can make even the slowest tempos dance. She and her band look to other funk mystics -- George Clinton, Marvin Gaye, Prince, latter-day Miles Davis -- who used wide-open spaces and jazz harmonies, but she comes up with her own hybrids. 
In the course of her set, she led the band in funk with the snapping beat of Washington's go-go music and funk that oozed like a bubbling tar pit. She led funk that twinkled with jazz chords on electric piano and funk that bristled with fuzz-tone guitar. She led funk that throbbed deep and low, funk that rolled in as smoothly as a fog bank and funk that slithered with rattlesnake cymbal accents. 
Before Ms. Ndegeocello sang "Earth," which is full of vows like "let my sweet, sweet ocean caress your shore," she had her spotlight turned off, as if she wanted to disappear into the groove. Her fans were ready to join her, dancing along.

HEADLINE: SoHo Design Store Closes After 20 Years 

BYLINE:  By MARIANNE ROHRLICH 

 BODY:
AD HOC SOFTWARES, the original resource for industrial-style housewares, is going out of business on June 23. The closing comes two years after its unsuccessful move off West Broadway, SoHo's main shopping drag. 
 Ad Hoc, now on Wooster Street, opened in SoHo in 1982, then virgin territory for retailers, to sell merchandise like Metro Wire shelving, restaurant-grade dinnerware and laboratory glassware. Industrial buildings were being developed for residential use, but the neighborhood was still mainly inhabited by artists and designers living in large manufacturing lofts. "SoHo was going gangbusters then," said Judith Kress Auchincloss, who owns the store with Julia McFarlane. 
 Joan Kron, a co-author with Suzanne Slesin of "High Tech," the bible of industrial style, said: "It was a time when for design purists, finding a plain black shower curtain was nirvana. Ad Hoc was the only place to find these things."
Ms. Kron admired the owners' taste and fast reflexes, but said that inevitably the big stores -- Bloomingdale's, Macy's and even Bed Bath & Beyond -- were jumping on the same trends. "Ad Hoc became like roadkill," she said succinctly. "Even though everyone stole from their style, nobody ever did it as well as they did."
But neighborhoods and styles change. Ad Hoc, along with other early retailers, fell victim to the recent malling of SoHo by high-end merchants like Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Prada that can pay astronomical rents. 
"We had to move off that hot corner of West Broadway and Spring Street in June 2000," Ms. Auchincloss said. "The landlord refused to renegotiate our lease and rented instead to Emporio Armani."
The new SoHo location on Wooster Street, somewhat off the beaten path, combined with the falling economy and the decline in tourism after Sept. 11, led to a significant loss of business. Ms. Auchincloss said the store's revenues dropped 35 percent last year from the previous year, and another 15 percent this year from last.
"It's 2002 and it's time for a change," Ms. Kron said. "I give them high marks, though. They had a great vision and they led the way."
The store's closing sale starts today. Everything is 50 percent off (40 percent off with a credit card), and the store's fixtures, computers and office supplies are also for sale. Area linen-and-cotton-blend king-size duvet covers are now $210; standard-size pillow cases, $45 each. King-size duvet covers in cotton by Yves Delorme are $206, and standard pillowcases are $84 a pair and cotton bath sheets $47. 
Bathroom stainless-steel shelves, 5 inches wide by 30 long, are $54; stainless steel wastebaskets, $21 to $84; vinyl shower curtains, $33. Prices for Colorstone dinnerware designed by Vignelli for Sasaki are: dinner plates, $13.75, platters $45. Throw pillows in suede are $56 to $225. The sale ends when the store closes, or when supplies run out.

HEADLINE: Creating Dots and Connecting Them, Too 

BYLINE:  By MEL GUSSOW 

 BODY:
Andrea Barrett's new collection of stories, "Servants of the Map," sweeps through the 19th and 20th centuries and crosses several continents, moving from the Himalayas to the Dakotas, while conjuring portraits of adventurers and pioneers. In common with her earlier collection, "Ship Fever," and her novel, "The Voyage of the Narwhal," Ms. Barrett's new book mixes real people (like Charles Darwin and the naturalist William Bartram) with fictional figures, as she weaves a rich tapestry of science and history. Oliver Sacks once quoted a 17th-century naturalist referring to "the secret mysteries of nature." That could stand as an apt description of Ms. Barrett's creative territory.
 Now 47, she has been greatly honored. "Ship Fever" won the National Book Award in 1996, and a Guggenheim Fellowship allowed her to travel to the Arctic to finish the research for "The Voyage of the Narwhal," about a 19th-century polar expedition. Last year she was given a MacArthur award of $500,000. Despite such recognition, she retains her modesty and a sense of equilibrium. Six feet tall with long silvery hair, she has a soft-spoken, almost ethereal manner. 
 Although the stories are widely diverse, they overlap as characters or relatives of characters turn up in alternate situations, often over generations. At the center of three of the stories in "Servants of the Map" and "Ship Fever" are two sisters, Rose and Bianca Marbury. Ms. Barrett's next novel will focus on the sisters' grandparents and will be set mostly in a tuberculosis sanitarium in Saranac Lake, N.Y., in 1916. With a nod to Thomas Mann's "Magic Mountain," she said in a recent interview, "I laughingly call the project 'The Magic Molehill.' "
Because of the intricate relationships of her characters, she was asked if she had compiled a genealogical chart. She has, and she said, "It looks like the workings of an insane person, but I understand it." For the purpose of clarity, she plans to insert a version of it as an endpaper in the forthcoming novel. Then she confided: "Here's the big secret. Everybody in those four books is related to everybody else."
Max Vigne, a cartographer in the Himalayas in the 1860's and the protagonist of the story "Servants of the Map," sends letters home to his wife, Clara, who years later is a character in "The Cure," the last story in the collection. Ned Kynd, an emigre to the United States from Ireland, appears in all three books. Other characters are less obviously connected by marriage or descent. When the next novel is completed, the books will form a kind of tetralogy.
"Ship Fever," coming first, was a major breakthrough for the author. Early in her career, she had spent several years rewriting a novel. In 1984, she went to the Breadloaf Writers Conference at Middlebury College in Vermont, where as an unpublished neophyte, she said she felt like "somebody who had fallen off the turnip truck." The novelist Nicholas Delbanco expressed an interest in her writing, but when he read her novel, he told her to throw it away and start something fresh.
Following his advice, she began writing "Lucid Stars," published in 1988. That novel and the three that followed were contemporary family chronicles. In terms of reviews and sales, they were barely noticed. The fourth, "The Forms of Water," sold fewer than 2,000 copies: "It didn't get reviewed anywhere," she said. "Nobody read it and everyone was so discouraged, including me."
Looking for a new direction in her writing life, she decided to concentrate on short stories. "I had always thought of myself as a novelist," she said. "Having failed so firmly at one genre, I had to try and learn to do something else. It was a real sea change, a kind of courage of complete despair."
Searching for a subject, she reminded herself that her background was in science. "That material was always there since I had been a girl growing up on Cape Cod." She had done graduate work in zoology and had thought about becoming a biologist. Her husband, Barry Goldstein, is a biophysicist (and photographer), and many of their friends are scientists. For years, she has been a close reader of the scientific writings of Oliver Sacks, Jonathan Weiner and others.
"I don't know why it took me so long to see that it might be material for fiction," she said. Unifying her primary interests, she wrote "The Behavior of the Hawkweed," in which contemporary characters recount incidents in the life of the botanist Gregor Mendel.
Her models as short story writers were Alice Munro and William Trevor. Ms. Munro's work in particular taught her "how to compress and be economical" and how to "move through time very quickly." The next step was "to let go of the present and the biographical grounding" and invent characters and write "with no safety net." In common with Tom Stoppard in "Arcadia," she became a time traveler -- and discovered her natural metier.
One by one the stories appeared in small literary magazines, The Missouri Review, The New England Review. At the McDowell Colony for artists in Peterborough, N.H., she finished "Ship Fever" with the guidance of the novelist Margot Livesey (author of "Eva Moves the Furniture"), whom she had met at Breadloaf. As close friends they remain each other's reader and editor.
Published in 1996, "Ship Fever" might have disappeared along with her previous books except for a review by Thomas Mallon in The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Mallon said that "her work stands out for its sheer intelligence, its painstaking attempt to discern and describe the world's configuration," and was "quietly dazzling, like looking at handmade paper under a microscope." This was, Ms. Barrett said, her "first grown-up review."
As an artist writing fiction about science, she is well aware of the disparities and the similarities: "Scientific questions are very precise and very directed. A scientist poses problems that can be answered if one works hard enough." In contrast, writers "pose question after question, and none of them get answered," she continued, adding, "A lot of what I write about in science and history serves as a metaphor for the discoveries we make as writers." In both areas, she said, "there is that sense of pushing at boundaries, of trying to discover new ways of looking at things."
In contrast to the astronomers, archaeologists and marine biologists who populate her fiction, she is not venturesome, regarding herself as a timid person, someone who is "hilariously afraid of bugs" and has suffered from altitude sickness. In other words, she lives vicariously through her characters.
Asked where the Marbury sisters come from, she said, "Like everyone else in contemporary America, I have a multiply divorced and remarried family. I have a whole sister, a half sister and stepsister, and the same things with brothers." She added that she herself was both Rose and Bianca: "Rose's fussy, worried nature is mine. I'm obsessive. But something in me is also Bianca, or wants to be, that attachment to nature, that sense of wanting a larger life, of being more open emotionally and spiritually."
Speaking about her breakthrough as a writer, she said, "It was like someone just opened a big double door into this huge palace that I didn't even know was there. Now all these rooms are open and I can just walk around the place and say: 'Oh, there's Max! And there's Clara -- and Ned. Rose is next to Bianca . . . and they're all having a party." 
As she named them, it was evident that they had become an extended family, continuing characters in the world of her imagination.

HEADLINE: Reclaiming Art Caught in the Cuban Revolution; 
In Cases Reminiscent of Looted Nazi Art, Emigres Trace Fate of Their Collections

BYLINE:  By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

 BODY:
As a young bachelor architect in Havana, Manuel De La Torre used to buy paintings from his artist friends, members of a small circle later known as the Cuban avant-garde. "Whenever I had a good commission on a building, I would buy a painting," recalled Mr. De La Torre, now 84. "When I married, I wanted to have a good home with good paintings and sculptures."
 But in 1960, as the Cuban revolution gathered force, Mr. De La Torre, married by then, left Cuba for the United States. All he could take with him was what fitted in a suitcase. His paintings and sculptures were left in the custody of relatives who later left Cuba themselves, further dispersing the remarkable collection, like so many leaves in the wind. 
 Then one day a year ago, Mr. De La Torre, who now lives on Long Island, was reading through The New York Times when he suddenly stopped. There on Page E31 was a photograph of one of his paintings, "La Hamaca" by Mariano Rodriguez, advertising a sale of Latin American art at Sotheby's auction house. The asking price for the painting was $150,000 to $200,000. 
Mr. De La Torre and his family quickly informed Sotheby's of their claim to the painting (his name was in the catalog as the original owner), which, as it turned out, had been sold once before by Sotheby's, in 1997. Startled by the claim, Sotheby's pulled the painting from last spring's auction. A legal correspondence ensued.
A year later, "La Hamaca" is still being held by Sotheby's, awaiting a settlement between the competing claimants -- a familiar standoff for works of art from Cuba that were lost, abandoned or directly confiscated as Fidel Castro's government took control.
Over the last decade, a growing number of these works have surfaced outside Cuba and been put up for sale. Some left the island via diplomatic channels, others were exported privately and illegally, and some, particularly in the early 1990's, were put on the international market by Cuba itself as it sought hard currency.
As these paintings emerge, Cuban families are increasingly active in trying to reclaim what was once theirs, in the way that European Jews and their heirs have sought to recover works seized by the Nazis during the Holocaust.
Provenance issues in the Cuban cases tend to be murkier than those involving art looted by the Nazi, given the various and obscure ways artworks have left the island. And some lawyers say that United States trade embargo laws against Cuba -- especially those enacted in the last 10 years -- could add a new twist in cases where art dealers or auction houses are found to have "trafficked" in works expropriated by the Cuban government.
No one knows how many legal claims have been brought by Cubans seeking to recover lost art or how many have been settled privately. But experts agree that Cuban emigres are now paying more attention.
"There is more information now, with the Internet, where you can find out where the stuff is," said Nicolas Gutierrez, an international business lawyer in Miami. "There is more of it coming out of Cuba than there was before, and then there is the success of the cases where art was confiscated by the Nazis and the Communists in Europe."
The effort to recover lost art may be the first drop in what could become a flood of restitution claims if Cuba sheds its Communist government and moves toward democracy and free markets. "There is definitely a greater interest in people positioning themselves for the day when the end of this regime is less remote," Mr. Gutierrez said.
Manny J. De La Torre, 42, the architect's son, said: "My father had no idea that he could do anything about his paintings. He had no idea that these things were coming out of Cuba."
The art cases are rarely clear-cut. The Fanjul family of Palm Beach, Fla., heirs to one of the great Cuban sugar fortunes, has been trying since the mid-1990's to reclaim a painting by Joaquin Sorolla y Bastida that was confiscated by the Cuban government in 1959 and, in the early 1990's, was quietly brought out of Cuba for a possible sale through Sotheby's.
The painting, "Castle Malaga," valued at $300,000 to $400,000, was one of more than 100 works in the family collection that were turned over to Havana's National Museum of Fine Arts. In 1994, when rumors spread that this painting and perhaps others were being put up for sale, the Fanjul family registered the collection with the Art Loss Register, which lists stolen or missing works and puts the art world on alert.
Matthew Weigman, a spokesman for Sotheby's, said a client brought "Castle Malaga" in for an appraisal in the mid-1990's and it was held for several years. "Sotheby's took the picture to a recognized Sorolla expert, but we could not agree on an estimate for the picture," he said. "So we never offered it for sale, and the picture was returned to the client." He would not pinpoint the date of the painting's return.
He said Sotheby's did get an inquiry from the Art Loss Register. "They simply asked us if we had sold it, which we hadn't," he said, "and we said we hadn't. I don't know where it is now."
The Fanjul family has since learned that "Castle Malaga" is being held by a dealer in Italy, said Shanker Singham, an international trade lawyer in Miami who represents the Fanjul family in the case. Based on correspondence with the Italian dealer's lawyer, Mr. Singham said, he wonders if Sotheby's played a more significant role in the aborted sale. "We still don't know exactly what role Sotheby's played in this, or why they can't be up front about it," he said.
Lawyers in Miami who specialize in cases involving the United States trade embargo against Cuba say that art auction houses and dealers could be running big risks if they handle the sale of art from Cuba.
Laws passed by Congress not only bar United States citizens from dealing in property seized by the Cuban government, but also put foreign citizens at risk of losing their visas to the United States for such activities.
As far as any of the lawyers contacted know, no case has gone to court seeking to reclaim art with the help of the embargo laws. But Mr. Singham said that as more cases of sales by the cash-hungry Cuban government come to light, the option of invoking such laws may become more real.
Typically, as Cubans left Castro's Cuba, government agents would compile an inventory of possessions left behind and consign artworks, books, furniture and other valuables to museums and other public institutions. Several Cuban emigre groups have contended that many of these items were later pilfered and sold illegally. Although some of this has taken place, allegedly with the help of corrupt officials, many experts say that Cuba's museums have in fact been very conservative about selling works from their collections.
Much of the art that has come out of Cuba is thought to have drifted out of the hands of family members, perhaps winding up in commission stores run by the government, then being smuggled out by tourists, diplomats or Cubans themselves. 
"There is a very difficult situation with Cuban art, because many families left their valuables with other family members, thinking the revolution was going to last only a few months," said Ramon Cernuda, a Miami gallery owner who specializes in Cuban art. "Then at some point, some of these people got rid of things. It is a very complicated process -- not as simple as the World War II confiscated material, because it is not as clear-cut."
Mr. Cernuda cited two cases, one at Christie's in 1994 and another at Sotheby's in 1996, when Cuban families who laid claim to paintings put up for auction discovered that the works had in fact been sold by relatives. In both cases, the families agreed to accept compensation rather than pursue claims.
Manuel De La Torre was unusual because he was a passionate collector of contemporary Cuban art, which at the time had little value. In 1956, he showed his collection, which then numbered 48 works, at the Lyceum gallery in Havana. The exhibition, fully documented, anticipated the boom to come some 40 years later in works by artists like Wilfredo Lam and Rene Portocarrero.
Mr. De La Torre lost track of his collection over the years, with the exception of a few portraits that he and his relatives could plausibly claim to be paintings of family members, and thus eligible for export from Cuba. But only recently did he realize just how widely dispersed his collection was: at least two paintings are in Cuban national museums, and another turned up in the private collection of Mr. Cernuda, who in an interview said he bought it through Sotheby's in 1984 for $4,675.
How "La Hamaca" left Cuba is still a mystery. All that is known is that it ended up in Spain -- perhaps by way of a Spanish diplomat, a friend of Mr. De La Torre's sister-in-law, who was the last in the family to leave Cuba, in 1973. A Spanish family consigned it to Sotheby's in 1997, where it was bought by the current owner, who last year consigned it to Sotheby's for resale.
When Sotheby's was first informed of the De La Torre claim, the auction house offered to proceed with the sale, retain its fee and put the proceeds in a special account to be divided later in a settlement between the rival claimants. The family, noting that Mr. De La Torre never divested himself of the painting, rejected the offer out of hand, arguing that Sotheby's had been negligent in accepting anyone else's claim to the painting.
"You would think Sotheby's would have the resources to do the research," Manny De La Torre said. "If they didn't, they are not doing the homework."
Mr. Weigman noted that Sotheby's requires consignors to guarantee that they have clear title. In this case, he said, Sotheby's tried to further investigate how the Spanish family wound up with "La Hamaca." "We even had people sit down with a priest, but we have been unable to cast any light on how the painting came into their collection," he said.
"The truth is, a lot of people don't have bills of sale for everything in their house," he said. "We don't settle these cases; we just hold the paintings."
Glenn Kerner, lawyer for the De La Torre family, said the family was surprised by the auction house's "hands off" approach. "My client is disappointed that Sotheby's appears to be indifferent to this entire situation," he said.
Manny De La Torre added: "We have been trying to deal with this in a friendly manner. We were hoping to have the painting returned in time for my father's birthday on July 4 last year. Then we thought it would be a great Christmas present. Now my goal is for him to have his painting back within his lifetime."

HEADLINE: Australia Raises Rates by a Quarter-Point 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SHAW 

DATELINE: CANBERRA, Australia, June 5 

 BODY:
Like a skilled surfer, the Australian economy is staying on top of the wave.
 To buffer the buoyant economy from the risk of inflation, the Reserve Bank of Australia today lifted its benchmark interest rate a quarter-point, to 4.75 percent, the second such move in a month. The earlier quarter-point increase was the bank's first adjustment since August 2000. 
 The central bank's fine-tuning came as key business indicators, including retail spending, housing starts, auto sales and real estate prices, reached new peaks. And it followed a quarter-point rate increase by Canada's central bank. 
Most analysts say the Reserve Bank of Australia has now tried to slow down the growth generator of historically low borrowing costs and is likely to raise the rate further in the next 12 months.
Official figures released Tuesday show that gross domestic product was 4.2 percent higher in the first quarter than it was a year earlier. (Canada's year-over-year rate was 2 percent; in the United States, the rate was 1.5 percent.)
In his half-yearly report, published last week, the bank governor, Ian Macfarlane, forecast that the economy would grow 3.5 to 4 percent in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2003, and said this would give Australia its twelfth consecutive year of economic expansion. The official bank rate could reach 6 to 6.5 percent in the next 12 months, the report said. This would lift basic mortgage rates from 6.3 percent now to about 8.3 percent, slowing the rapid rise in real estate prices and residential construction.
The report predicted that the jobless rate would fall below 6 percent and inflation would stay around the current rate, 2.9 percent.
Mr. Macfarlane said that growth, jobs and inflation indicators proved that interest rate moves have been effective. "Barring some unforeseen international event it is hard to see serious risks on the downside for the Australian economy," he said. "We can safely claim Australia has weathered a world recession without itself experiencing one."
He warned, however, that the ratio of household debt to income has doubled, from 50 percent to 100 percent, in the last decade, bringing the risk of overcommitment for many borrowers.
Senior government advisers differ marginally on inflation forecasts but otherwise there is consensus that the good times can continue into 2004, perhaps beyond, without any overheating. Some economists sound notes of caution, but few express concern that the economy will overreach itself -- at least anytime soon.
Recent business surveys support the bullish outlook. So do current figures on productivity and trade, and the rising value of the Australian dollar.
"The economy is going gang busters," said Prime Minister John Howard, a conservative who has been in office since 1996. His treasurer, Peter Costello, said, "We have a nice set of numbers." 
Mr. Costello predicted economic growth of 3.75 percent, but most business and banking economists forecast 4 percent growth.
Mr. Costello, 45, is favored to succeed Mr. Howard, 63, who may step aside as prime minster next year after steering the country to balanced budgets and solid growth amid international recessions.
Business confidence is at its highest overall level in almost a decade, according to the National Australia Bank. The bank, which increased its half-year net profit 11 percent, to a record 2.26 billion Australian dollars ($1.29 billion), said its latest research shows particular confidence in the areas of construction, services, plant capacity use, hiring and investment.
Other recent surveys showed business activity up 7 percent, company profits increasing 1.5 percent on average in the last quarter, retail sales expanding at an annual rate of 11 percent, and industrial sales growing by an average of 5 percent.
According to Dun & Bradstreet, sales expectations are the best they have been in two years. A major local employment agency says that 30 percent of companies expect to hire more workers this year. Another report says the number of advertised skilled job vacancies is 6 percent higher than last year, with health, accounting and construction workers in strongest demand.
The average price of houses sold in Sydney in the last year jumped 16 percent. The prices for some harborview residences soared 30 to 40 percent. In other Australian cities housing prices also rose, although not as fast. The national new-home construction rate has jumped 12 percent in the last three months.
Banking profits, university enrollments, domestic tourism and movie attendances are all breaking records. The number of millionaires has doubled, to 3.6 percent of the population, in the last four years, according to research by the University of Canberra.
According to John Edwards, chief economist of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank in Australia, "The economy is certainly doing a lot better than many expected."
Still, Paul Braddick, senior economist of the ANZ Bank, sees some reasons for caution. "While the near-term outlook is good, several risks are emerging" for the next year he said. "Housing growth will wane as higher interest rates increase the cost of mortgages." Mr. Braddick predicted that growth in net trade levels -- steady exports minus growing imports -- would slow next year, and he said an increase "in business investment is critical to the economic outlook."
Then there is the drought. Many farm regions have had no useful rain since February, and scientists are reporting the apparent approach of a new El Nino cycle of mid-Pacific warming -- an event that can bring exceptionally hot, dry periods, which could reduce farm production and exports, including grain and meat.

PERSON: Fernando Belaunde Terry 

HEADLINE: Fernando Belaunde Terry, 89, Who Was Twice Peru's Chief 

BYLINE:  By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Fernando Belaunde Terry, the soft-spoken idealist who was ousted from the Peruvian presidency by the military in 1968 but won it back in 1980, died on Tuesday in Lima. He was 89.
 Elected in 1963 with only 39 percent of the vote, Mr. Belaunde, an American-educated architect who became a symbol of democracy, cut an attractive and charismatic figure as he called on citizens to "reconquer Peru" by fully exploiting its economic potential, promising them "a revolution without bullets." 
 But his Accion Popular party was outnumbered in Parliament by opposition groups that succeeded in blocking much of his plan for agrarian reform, which would have entailed opening up the country's interior for settlement and farming by building an extensive road network.
This deepening political impasse left the military increasingly frustrated with politicians in general and Mr. Belaunde in particular. But what immediately precipitated his downfall was his attempt to settle a long-running dispute with the International Petroleum Company, an Exxon subsidiary -- an attempt denounced by the head of the Peruvian national oil company as a surrender of national wealth to foreigners.
On Oct. 3, 1968, a column of army tanks commanded by Gen. Juan Velasco Alvarado entered Lima's historic Plaza de Armas, arrested Mr. Belaunde and sent him into exile in Argentina, from where he moved to the United States.
Mr. Belaunde spent the next 10 years lecturing on architecture at American universities including Harvard, Columbia, Johns Hopkins and George Washington. Meanwhile, economic conditions deteriorated in Peru under the radical and repressive rule of the Velasco junta.
In 1975 a new junta headed by Gen. Francisco Morales Bermudez seized power, promising a return to democracy and more moderate policies.
The next year, Mr. Belaunde moved back to Peru and in May 1980 he presided over the country's return to democracy; this time his Accion Popular led a majority coalition in Parliament.
Mr. Belaunde campaigned carrying a shovel to symbolize his pledge to create a million new jobs through agricultural projects.
But while he embraced more liberal policies, he made little impression on the country's deep economic problems, which included an annual inflation rate surpassing 100 percent, a growing burden of foreign debt payment and high unemployment.
These difficulties were worsened by the terrorist activities of the Shining Path, a band of Maoist revolutionaries who greeted the return to civilian rule by starting a campaign of violence in the impoverished Ayacucho region.
Within four years more than 4,000 guerrillas, soldiers and civilians were dead and 1,000 people were reported missing after detention by the security forces.
In the April 1985 elections, Mr. Belaunde and Accion Popular were swept from power by their traditional opponents, the Apristas, or supporters of the Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana, who gained control of both houses of the legislature.
Their presidential candidate, Alan Garcia Perez, replaced Mr. Belaunde on July 28 -- the first time in the 20th century that power had been transferred from one elected Peruvian leader to another.
That same day Mr. Garcia announced that Peru would henceforth restrict foreign debt repayments to 10 percent of export earnings.
Fernando Belaunde Terry was born in Lima on Oct. 7, 1912. He came from a distinguished family of lawyers and diplomats. When Fernando was 12, his father was exiled from Peru. The youth pursued his education first in Europe, then in Florida at the University of Miami, and finally at the University of Texas, where he studied architecture.
Returning to Peru in 1943, Mr. Belaunde was elected to Parliament in 1945 and became a successful architect. He kept himself firmly in the public eye, fighting a duel with sabers against one political opponent and attempting an escape by swimming from an island prison where he had been sent for holding an illegal rally.
He is survived by a daughter and two sons, Maria Carolina, Fernando and Rafael, from his first marriage, which ended in divorce. His second wife, the former Violeta Correa, died last year.

HEADLINE: McCall Urges Upstate Voice in 9/11 Recovery Agency 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
H. Carl McCall said yesterday that upstate and suburban New Yorkers should have a direct say in planning the reconstruction of Lower Manhattan, and that the state agency overseeing the rebuilding effort should be enlarged to include members from outside New York City.
 Mr. McCall, a Democratic candidate for governor, said he would revamp the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the 16-member agency created by Gov. George E. Pataki to help New York recover from the Sept. 11 attack. He also said Mr. Pataki had excluded "too many important groups" from the agency, which will shape the future of downtown New York. 
 In particular, Mr. McCall said, new members should represent hotel and retail workers, religious and civic groups, and "upstate and suburban interests."
Mr. McCall's remarks were part of a speech at Pace University in Lower Manhattan intended, he said, to lay out his views on how to rebuild downtown New York and the state economy. 
Mr. McCall also echoed an attack that his Democratic rival, Andrew M. Cuomo, made in a similar speech three weeks ago by criticizing Mr. Pataki's role in overseeing the redevelopment effort.
"We need a long-term vision for the future of New York," Mr. McCall said. "And the governor, I believe, has failed to provide that vision and that leadership."
In his speech, Mr. McCall, the state comptroller, sketched out a vague vision of what a rebuilt Lower Manhattan should look like. It reflected what has already emerged as a rough consensus among New York officials and planners: a mixture of residential and business development, along with a memorial.
Mr. Cuomo had proposed anchoring downtown New York with some sort of major project -- he suggested moving the New York City Opera or the World Bank there -- as a way of guiding development there. Mr. McCall declined to offer any details of what shape that development might take, saying he would prefer to leave that to advisers.
"I'm not trying to say, 'This is the plan,' " he said. "I want to bring together the best talent to develop that plan. I want to bring diversity out there."
Mr. McCall said he thought that the downtown area should have a transportation hub linking various subway, commuter and ferry lines, an idea that has already found wide agreement among city planners. Mr. McCall declined to say whether he would endorse another central part of that plan -- extending commuter train lines from Westchester and Long Island into that downtown transportation center -- over long-standing attempts to build a Second Avenue subway.
"I think we will have to look at all these issues and decide what our priorities are," Mr. McCall said. "Downtown Manhattan is important, but it's not the only thing."
Mr. McCall said the redevelopment effort should try to bury part of West Street so Battery Park City is linked to the trade center site. Both Mr. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg endorsed that idea two months ago.
Mr. Pataki's spokesman, Michael McKeon, disputed Mr. McCall's assertions, saying that the development corporation board, which includes members appointed both by Mr. Pataki and by Mr. Bloomberg, was representative. "We will leave the partisan attacks to the Democrats and stay focused on ensuring that Lower Manhattan is stronger and more vibrant than it was on Sept. 10," Mr. McKeon said.
Mr. McCall is the first to call for representatives from the suburbs and upstate on the board. In explaining his reasoning, he said, "I don't want people there to be left out, to feel that this is all we are doing, that this is only what we are paying attention to."
He added: "And people from outside New york, if they come and see what we're doing here, they might get some ideas that they can apply where they are as well. I just want, I think we need to be as inclusive as possible in this process."

HEADLINE: Several U.S. Allies Criticized in Powell Report on Slave Trading 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5 

 BODY:
South Korea, Romania and Israel all stepped up efforts to stop slave trafficking within their borders last year, but some of the United States' closest allies, including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and several Persian Gulf states, did not, according to a State Department report issued today.
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said that the United States was resolved "to stop this appalling assault on the dignity of men, women and children," that victimizes an estimated 700,000 to 4 million people a year worldwide through coercion and outright kidnapping -- most of them women and children -- including some 50,000 in the United States. 
 But the law that mandated creation of the report two years ago does not provide for imposition of penalties until next year, when countries judged not in compliance with certain minimum standards will face penalties in the form of withheld aid, and votes by the United States against loans from international organizations like the World Bank. 
In the current report, the 19 countries in that category, called Tier 3, include Afghanistan, Bahrain, Myanmar, Greece, Iran, Lebanon, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. They were judged to have made no real effort to stop a commerce in human beings who are forced to work in brothels, sweatshops and other involuntary servitude.
"There were absolutely no political considerations entering into this," said Nancy Ely-Raphel, who presented the report and is a senior adviser to Secretary Powell on the issue. "Some of our closest allies are on Tier 3, and they were on Tier 3 last year. This is a straight-out, objective report determining whether a country meets the minimum standards and whether it's making serious and sustained efforts to meet those minimum standards."
Countries that make such efforts can move up to Tier 2, which this year includes such American allies as India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, the Philippines and Pakistan, which rose from the lowest category last year, angering some human rights groups. South Korea, a key ally, leapfrogged from Tier 3 to the top level.
Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey, who sponsored the law requiring the report, expressed disappointment that "both last year and this year, the report omits from Tier 3 countries including India, Thailand and Vietnam -- all of which have serious trafficking problems in which government officials appear to be actively involved."
He noted that "several of the nations omitted from Tier 3 have governments with which the United States is trying to improve relations." But, he added, "For governments whose own high-ranking officials are deeply involved in trafficking, holding an occasional training session with an international organization, or even a few ineffectual prosecutions, do not amount to 'significant efforts.' "
Ms. Ely-Raphel noted that the number of Tier 3 countries decreased to 19 from 23 last year, and praised Romania, South Korea and Israel for taking significant steps to crack down on the practice. 
Theresa Loar, president of Vital Voices, a nonprofit organization that promotes human rights and democracy for women, said the government needed to do more to work with nations and nongovernmental organizations to provide training and tools to fight trafficking.

HEADLINE: Here, Gatsby Would Be Just Ordinary 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: NORTH HILLS, N.Y., June 5 

 BODY:
Driving by, it is easy to miss this small, secluded community on the North Shore of Long Island. There is no real center or downtown. Most of its residents are hidden in costly enclaves of town houses -- one is actually called The Enclave -- and million-dollar homes on private cul-de-sacs. Gates, guardhouses and private-road signs discourage the uninvited. 
 But now the village is getting nationwide attention for its new ranking as the richest community in the Northeast, with an average per capita income of $100,093 a year, according to figures reported Tuesday by the Census Bureau. North Hills was the only spot in the Northeast to earn a place on the list of the nation's 10 wealthiest communities, ranking No. 8, alongside some better known places like Palm Beach, Fla. 
 No one here seems surprised. "There's a lot of wealth in this community," said Mayor John M. Lentini. "It's such a blue chip area. I don't know of any area of Long Island that has this kind of concentration of wealth. There's no place like this." Actually, the village's current very-rich status is a bit of a comedown from its origins -- it was incorporated in 1929 -- as the domain of a few super-wealthy families. For decades, much of North Hills was occupied by the estates and horse farms of the likes of the Whitneys, the Paleys and the Graces. "They were the very wealthy icons of the Gold Coast," the mayor said.
Modern North Hills began taking shape in the 1970's, when the old estates began to break up and be redeveloped. Despite zoning restrictions that allow only two houses per acre, the population has flourished -- from 200 or 300 in the 70's to about 4,500 today. 
"We've had a phenomenal growth pattern that to my way of thinking is unrivaled," Mayor Lentini said. 
Why did the well-to-do flock to North Hills? Mayor Lentini, a real estate manager, has a one-word answer: "Location." 
The western end of the village is only a mile from the Queens border, yet its terrain is a bucolic respite of gently rolling hills with plenty of trees. The transportation is hard to beat: The village straddles the Long Island Expressway and the Northern State Parkway, and the Long Island Rail Road provides an under-30-minute commute to Manhattan.
Some older residents are drawn to the condominium life, and some are snowbirds who spend winters in the Sun Belt. Other residents work in the financial industry or as doctors, lawyers or executives. "There are even sports professionals here," said Tara Acciardi, who has lived in the community two months. "They practice at Hofstra, and Darryl Strawberry used to live here." 
There is no reason why North Hills cannot rise to first place nationally, Mayor Lentini said, especially if he succeeds in his plan to buy the Deepdale Golf Course and open it to residents only.
"That would make North Hills that much more desirable, which would make the properties that much more valuable, which will bring in that many more affluent people," he said. "It can only get better."

HEADLINE: Perot Systems Shares Drop Over Accusations on California Energy Role 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5 

 BODY:
Shares of Perot Systems plunged 19.1 percent today after a California lawmaker accused the firm of using knowledge gleaned from its work in setting up the deregulated California power markets to instruct energy-trading companies on how to exploit vulnerabilities in those markets.
 In another energy-trading development, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has been investigating the collapse of Enron, has widened its inquiry to review allegations that Enron and others manipulated California energy prices. Investigators are preparing to interview people about the allegations, a spokesman for the panel said. 
 The California lawmaker, State Senator Joseph Dunn, a Democrat who is heading a legislative committee's investigation into market manipulation, cited a 44-page presentation that he said Perot Systems made to energy traders who did business in California. Mr. Dunn said the presentation appeared to be at the core "of what ultimately became the economic rape of California consumers." 
The presentation discussed how Perot Systems had "discovered a 'hole' " in the state grid operator's system that "allowed strategies that would destabilize the market." The presentation also discussed how market players could have "caused wild swings" in certain electricity prices. Another page of the presentation, titled "Strategic Decisions in California," stated that one decision was to "bid capacity in one market and withhold in others."
Perot Systems, a computer services company founded by the Texas billionaire and former independent presidential candidate H. Ross Perot, said in a statement this afternoon that it "did not reveal or sell any confidential information of any kind."
The company, whose chief executive is Mr. Perot's son, Ross Perot Jr., also said it had worked with the California Power Exchange to "correct the defects" in the market. "The defects that were identified by Perot Systems in the document were corrected before the California Power exchange became operational, as the document itself indicates," the statement said. It added that it had provided "no energy trading services to any California market participant."
A company spokesman, Eddie Reeves, said he could not answer many questions because the business unit that was involved had been shut and its employees had left the company. He said he could not say when the presentation was made or to whom it was made. And he said he could not say whether any sales pitches made by Perot Systems included a discussion of how to exploit flaws in the California markets.
Mr. Reeves also said he could not say why the presentation was made . "It's not clear whether this is an analysis of what happened in the market, or whether it was an analysis of what could happen in the market," he said.
Shares of Perot Systems, which halted trading for about an hour in the afternoon, closed at $14.55, down $3.43.
Mr. Dunn obtained the document from Reliant Energy, a trader active in California. Today, a Reliant spokesman said: "We believe this document was provided to Reliant as part of a Perot Systems sales presentation. We don't yet have definitive information, and further comment would be premature."
A spokesman for the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's electricity grid, said today that the presentation appeared to highlight a previously identified flaw related to the ability of companies to use their bidding strategies to affect the market-clearing price for electricity. The spokesman, Gregg Fishman, said Perot Systems had signed a contract with the grid operator that included a confidentiality clause. But he said an initial reading of the document by I.S.O. officials suggested that the documents contained "what had all been available market data.
"There's nothing in there that appears to be proprietary information," Mr. Fishman continued.
Meanwhile, in Washington, the chairman of the House panel, Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, sent a letter on May 24 to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, asking the agency to respond to questions about the status, findings and methodology of its investigation into market manipulation.
"We're trying to determine if these practices were isolated incidents involving Enron and several other companies or whether this was an industrywide norm," Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Mr. Tauzin, said.
"We are in the process of setting up interviews with people who may have intimate knowledge of some of these shady practices," he added. "We're trying to gather as much information to determine how to proceed."
House Democrats have for weeks been seeking a House investigation into the matter, and today the Democratic leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, called on House Republican leaders to "end the Enron cover-up and hold hearings now into the mountain of evidence indicating Enron might have conspired to create last summer's energy crisis."
Mr. Johnson replied, "We have not ignored anything, except for the Democratic leadership's hyperbole."

HEADLINE: Service Economy Grows, Survey Says 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
A survey of activity in service industries released yesterday showed that the sector grew last month at its fastest pace since August 2000.
 The survey by a trade group, the Institute for Supply Management, yields a nonmanufacturing index of activity in a wide range of services, like entertainment and financial services. 
The index rose in May to 60.1 from 55.3 in April. 
 It was the highest level since the economic downturn began in late 2000. Nonmanufacturing businesses account for a majority of the economy.
But economists cautioned that the results overstated strength in some of the survey's other components and that the data reflected only moderate growth in the second quarter.
"It's consistent with a decent growth rate in the economy," said Stephen Stanley of Greenwich Capital Markets in Greenwich, Conn. 
Earlier this week, the trade group's manufacturing index showed that that sector grew in May at its fastest pace since February 2000. 
Another gauge reported yesterday, the institute's index of new orders, rose to 56.8 in May from 56.4 in April, while the order backlog index posted its first growth in 17 months -- signaling rising demand for future services. 
The employment index rose in May to 49.5 from 48.9 in April, still the 15th consecutive month of job losses, but moving closer to the 50 threshold that would signal job growth. 
The prices-paid index fell in May to 55.5 from 59.5, indicating that prices were rising at a slower pace and soothing some worries about a possible buildup of inflation. 
The trade group compiles its nonmanufacturing index, which is seasonally adjusted, by surveying some 370 purchasing executives in more than 62 service industries once a month.

HEADLINE: BLOCKS; 
Streets Vanish From Master Plans

BYLINE:  By David W. Dunlap 

 BODY:
MORE streets, smaller blocks.
 That city planning mantra, reflecting the conventional wisdom of recent years, has dominated thinking about the World Trade Center site. 
 But even as strategists figure out how to divide the 16-acre trade center superblock with a small-scale street pattern, planners elsewhere have been assembling large-scale parcels by eliminating proposed new streets and replacing them with parkland. 
They are not so much repudiating a precept laid out in 1961 by the activist and critic Jane Jacobs -- "Most blocks must be short" -- as they are recognizing that not every new street enlivens a neighborhood or expands public space. And that even conventional wisdom cannot offer a "one size fits all" planning solution. 
At Battery Park City, which purposefully revised its master plan in 1979 to create a westward extension of the Lower Manhattan street grid, two blocks will be united by the omission of a planned street called Park Place West. In its place, a park will be built at the center of the superblock.
And at the north end of the 74-acre Queens West project on the East River, the Rockrose Development Corporation has won approval to consolidate what were to have been four discrete new city blocks into a single waterfront park with apartment towers and stub-end streets along one edge.
"We saw a lot of unnecessary streets that weren't going anywhere, and we saw the opportunity to eliminate them and increase the open space," said Jon McMillan, director of planning for Rockrose, the developer of the new north residential neighborhood at Queens West, where Pepsi-Cola once had a bottling plant.
Rockrose could not quite reconcile its design, by the Miami architectural firm Arquitectonica and the Manhattan landscape architectural firm Abel Bainnson Butz, with a master plan drawn up in 1990 by John H. Beyer of Beyer Blinder Belle and Jordan L. Gruzen of Gruzen Samton Steinglass.
(Beyer Blinder Belle was chosen last month to conduct an urban planning and transportation study of Lower Manhattan and the trade center site. Mr. Gruzen is a member of New York New Visions, a design and planning coalition that has involved itself in downtown rebuilding. And Arquitectonica has just been designated by city officials, with Cooper, Robertson and Partners, to prepare a planning study of the far West Side of Manhattan.)
The original Queens West plan called for seven blocks in the north neighborhood, oriented along Center Boulevard, a new north-south thoroughfare. A street called East River Road was to divide the blocks from the waterfront.
This approach seemed to embody a central principle of "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," the influential critique by Ms. Jacobs that was published when planners were enamored of superblocks.
"Most blocks must be short; that is, streets and opportunities to turn corners must be frequent," she wrote. "Frequent streets and short blocks are valuable because of the fabric of intricate cross-use that they permit among the users of a city neighborhood."
But Rockrose looked at all the streets planned for Queens West and saw a lot of infrastructure that would have to be built to serve a circulation system that might not be needed.
Rockrose proposed at first to eliminate every building on the west side of Center Boulevard and concentrate all of its 2.8 million square-foot project on the east side, creating something like Riverside Drive. But the Queens West Development Corporation, a unit of the Empire State Development Corporation that is overseeing the project, insisted that buildings line both sides of the boulevard.
In the end, East River Road was eliminated and three through-streets were turned into cul-de-sacs, while sight lines and pedestrian access were preserved.
"It's not so much that it is a superblock as that the city context ends and the waterfront context begins," Mr. McMillan said.
ASKED about the revisions, Mr. Gruzen said they showed that although some assumptions of the master plan -- the skeleton, he called it -- were not to the developers' liking, it was resilient enough to allow change. "It didn't corrupt the idea," he said. "The idea was strong enough to sustain these modifications."
The Battery Park City master plan was modified by the architect Ralph Lerner to eliminate a one-block stretch of Park Place West in the north residential neighborhood, thereby creating a two-block development parcel on which four towers are to rise. For the cruciform space among the towers, Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates has designed the 1.8-acre Teardrop Park.
The idea behind Park Place West was "a sentimental belief in the virtue of the old grid," Mr. Lerner said. "I don't think one should automatically presume its virtues," he said. "You shouldn't mistake the claim for the result."

HEADLINE: Reporters at Washington Post Withhold Bylines 

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
Virtually all the reporters who wrote articles appearing in The Washington Post yesterday refused to allow their names to appear over their work, in protest of the newspaper's position in contract talks.
 The "byline strike" is the first at The Post since 1988. 
 The three-year contract at issue would cover 1,400 Post employees -- most of them journalists and advertising sales personnel -- who are represented by the Newspaper Guild, an affiliate of the Communications Workers of America. 
Rick Weiss, a science reporter who is co-chairman of the Guild unit at The Post, said the two sides were at loggerheads over raises, employees' right to save unused vacation time and whether employees represented by the Guild can quit it at any time.
"The company's efforts to undermine the strength and the very existence of the union here are obviously very important to us," he said.The byline strike continued with Thursday's editions.
Asked management's stance on the negotiations, Patricia Dunn, vice president for labor relations, said: "Our focus is on resolving contract issues at the bargaining table. That's where we'll reach an agreement."
The previous three-year contract, which gave reporters the right to withhold their bylines, expired on May 18. Negotiations on a new contract began about three months ago.
Mr. Weiss cast the union's demand for average pay increases of 3 percent a year in the context of the $230 million in net income reported by the newspaper's owner, the Washington Post Company, in its most recent annual report. Post management sources, on the other hand, pointed out that unlike some other newspapers, The Post had not laid off workers in response to the advertising recession that has hit the industry.
The guaranteed pay increases offered by The Post, the Guild says, would average 1.3 percent a year; the first year's payment would be given as a lump sum, which would not be counted in base pay, the figure on which future percentage increases would be calculated.
A Post source briefed on the talks, however, indicated that the offer amounted to 2 percent a year.

HEADLINE: India Success In Software Is Set Back By War Talk 

BYLINE:  By SARITHA RAI 

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, June 5 

 BODY:
The tensions and war fears mounting in South Asia are taking a toll on one of India's major economic success stories, its software industry.
 New business is drying up because foreign clients -- mainly Americans -- are avoiding travel to the region. And though India's main technology center here is more than 1,000 miles from the frontier with Pakistan, leading companies are nonetheless bracing for the impact of war and are rushing to make sure disaster recovery plans are in place. 
 "The last time India went to war was with Pakistan in 1971, when India was a closed economy," said N. R. Narayana Murthy, chairman of Infosys Technologies, India's largest publicly traded software exporter. "Today we are a globalized economy, and prolonged talk of war is not going to help business at all." 
Neither side in the current crisis seems to want war, especially a war that might involve use of nuclear weapons, and there has been some retreat by each side from its most aggressive postures. But until a diplomatic formula can be found for substantially relaxing the tensions with Pakistan, India is likely to be seen by the world as a high-risk place to do business, a perception many here hope will prove only temporary.
In the meantime, software service companies are doing their best to reassure clients. "We are showing our customers our disaster recovery plans, complete with hot-site backup centers and higher levels of security, to contend with threats of terrorist attacks," said Phaneesh Murthy, Infosys's global chief of sales and marketing, who is based at the company's American offices in Santa Clara Calif. Phaneesh Murthy and N. R. Murthy are not related.
Visits from foreign clients are vital to the Indian software industry, which must sell itself against the more familiar names of rivals in the developed world. Customers travel here in teams to tour the gleaming suburban office campuses, meet with executives and engineers, sit in on presentations and see for themselves what the industry can do, compiling short lists and learning what differentiates one Indian software company from another.
In normal times, a dozen or more customer teams might be visiting Infosys's sprawling 50-acre headquarters in the Bangalore suburbs. But in recent weeks, they have all but disappeared.
Phaneesh Murthy said he did not think the deferred client visits would permanently harm Infosys's business. "We are convinced that the strategic reason why companies outsource work to India will remain and that will continue to bring in business," he said.
But the picture may change. "If the standoff does continue for long, it could begin to affect business," said Kiran Karnik, president of the industry's main trade group, the National Association of Software and Service Companies, known as Nasscom, in a statement on Tuesday.
More than 200 major American corporations now buy software services from Indian companies, a number that has risen steadily in the last few years, according to Nasscom. India's annual software exports, $150 million a decade ago, grew to $7.6 billion in the 12 months from April 2001 to March 2002, accounting for one-sixth of India's total exports; about two-thirds of the software exports go to the United States.
For the moment, Indian companies like Ishoni Networks are trying not to let disruptions in travel between India and the United States hold back business. The company is still actively hiring, and has just finished recruiting two new employees from the United States. "But a nuclear war could change all this and render us dysfunctional," said Vivek Mansingh, the company's chief executive.
Sanjay Kalra, chief executive of DSL Software, a joint venture between Deutsche Bank and India's top software exporter, HCL Technologies, said he thought American companies that already used Indian software suppliers would not break off business. "But decision-making concerning growth will not happen immediately," he said. "The business cycle will slow down." 
Like many companies here, DSL Software said it was doing what it could to prepare for trouble, including backing up its systems and archives here and in the United States and working from two locations within India. Others have backup sites in Singapore or other places outside the country. Cognizant Technologies, with four programming centers in India, said it had special teams ready to travel to the company's New Jersey offices or to Europe on short notice if necessary. 
CCC Information Services, one of Cognizant's United States clients, says it has its own contingency plan. "We are extraordinarily concerned about the situation and have looked into Cognizant's contingency plans," said Jim Beattie, executive vice president. "We have a very high-value relationship with the company, and we are not considering forsaking them at the moment. But if the situation becomes grave, we will have to look at options elsewhere."
Several Indian companies said that they were putting to use lessons they learned last September from the terror attacks. The events of "9/11 taught most large companies not to rely on any one location fully, and that is helping companies in times like this," said Phaneesh Murthy of Infosys.
Executives here expect few problems with international communications if war breaks out, citing the wealth of available satellite links and undersea fiber optic cable capacity. "Every company has redundancy built into its communication infrastructure," said a network specialist at a leading exporter. "We have factored in the possibility of multiple hits in different cities during a war." 
Cool-headed calculation like that is what the industry is counting on from clients. Gerhard Watzinger, chief executive of Mascot Systems, an important Indian software exporter, said sheer value for money would keep the American orders coming in. Mascot has 35 project proposals pending in the United States, he said.
Other industries in India are also feeling the effects of war fears. Among garment makers, another important export sector, the mood is sober. "We are not panicking, even though a lot of buyers have canceled visits in the last few days," said Ashwin Hinduja, director of Gokaldas Exports, a leading garment exporter based here.
June is the month when buyers come to India to see goods and place orders for the next spring season, and Manu Chablani of Krishna Krishna Knitworld said that a number of American buyers had canceled sampling visits. "The situation bodes ill," he said.
The evacuation of staff from the embassies of the United States and several European countries was compounding the problem, he said. "If buyers don't come, we will have to travel with samples. But if missions are understaffed, will visas be available?
"This whole India-Pakistan thing is a nightmare for us."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Breaking Pace, Major Gauges Rise on News From Oracle

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street had its first winning session in more than a week yesterday after encouraging news from Oracle started a last-minute rally in technology shares. The Dow Jones industrial average surged more than 100 points.
 The increases came late in the day, with technology stocks having strong gains only after reports that Oracle did not plan to issue an earnings warning for its fourth quarter. Analysts said the response reflected Wall Street's hunger for something to rally on and did not signal an improvement in market conditions. 
 "People had been betting Oracle would warn," Stephen Massocca, president of Pacific Growth Equities, said. "When it didn't, it became an excuse for people to buy." 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 108.96 points, or 1.1 percent, at 9,796.80, after losing 237 points over Monday and Tuesday.
Broader stock measures also rose, particularly the Nasdaq index, which increased 17.14 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,595.26. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 9.21 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,049.90. 
It was the first session since May 23 in which all three indicators closed higher.
The day started quietly. Wal-Mart Stores reported stronger-than-expected sales in May, and Avon Products, the direct seller of makeup, reaffirmed its earnings forecast. But that news failed to ignite a broad rally. Although blue chips were higher for much of the session, technology did not catch up until the Oracle announcement. 
Shares in Wal-Mart rose 96 cents, to $54.96, as shares in Avon gained $2.69, or 5.2 percent, to $54.64.
Although many analysts expect that May retail sales will be disappointing over all, the buying spread to other retailers. The Gap rose 63 cents, to $15.18, after Prudential Securities upgraded the stock. 
Technology stocks received a lift from Oracle, which gained 84 cents, to $8.66. Microsoft rose $1.68, to $51.66, and Intel jumped 68 cents, to $28.18. Intel is scheduled to release a midquarter update today. The stock is considered an indicator of where the broader technology sector is headed, and Oracle's announcement might have allayed investors' fears that Intel's news would be terrible. 
Shares in Philip Morris dropped 36 cents, to $57.36, after the Oregon Court of Appeals reinstated a $79.5 million punitive damage award against the tobacco maker in a lawsuit that accused the company of knowing that smoking was harmful and concealing the facts. 
The market responded to Oracle's announcement, analysts said, because few companies have felt confident enough to forecast solid business ahead. Earnings reports that will be released next month could alleviate or intensify Wall Street's concerns about the pace of a recovery. 
Investors are also uneasy because of the number of companies, including Microsoft and the oil services company Halliburton, that have faced questions about or made changes to their accounting practices because of government scrutiny. --------------------

Treasury Prices Decline
(By Bloomberg News)
Treasuries fell yesterday as an industry report showed that services, the biggest part of the economy, grew more than expected in May.
Some investors sold government debt and bought stocks, as a bet that the economy's recovery from recession would bolster corporate profits.
By late in the day, the 10-year note had declined 4/32, to a price of 98 21/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, increased to 5.05 percent from 5.03 percent on Tuesday.
The 30-year bond also dropped, falling 11/32, to 96 2/32. Its yield increased to 5.65 percent from 5.63 percent.

HEADLINE: New York's Arts Budget 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council face a challenge in adopting a new budget (news articles, May 30 and 31). Although every constituency must sacrifice, it would be wise to minimize the cut to the cultural budget. 
 Nonprofit cultural organizations employ 20,000 people throughout New York City. In fact, the city gets back in tax revenue as much as it contributes to these groups, according to a new report commissioned by the Alliance for the Arts. Further, they raise $6 for every dollar the city provides. In return for $100 million in city support, nonprofit arts groups generate $5 billion in economic activity. 
If we keep our museums and theaters and zoos open, we proclaim the values that symbolize New York to the world and remind everyone that we are undefeated. Culture is New York's calling card and our main attraction to tourists. These messages need to be heard now, more than ever.

HEADLINE: 'Freedom to Farm' Law Becomes Freedom to Add Subsidies 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5 

 BODY:
Farmers who raise lentils, a crop so ancient it is mentioned in the Book of Genesis, have survived for years without government assistance. But Congress has decided they need a little help.
 In the farm bill that President Bush signed last month, it created subsidies for lentil growers, guaranteeing them prices substantially above current levels, which are the lowest in 15 years. It provided similar guarantees for growers of small chickpeas. 
 So how is it possible that six years after Congress tried to wean farmers from subsidies and let the market dictate prices, a new subsidy was born? 
The noble experiment in market-driven policy, the 1996 Freedom to Farm law, fell victim to powerful economic forces and election-year jockeying that catered to every region of the country. 
Subsidies beget subsidies, and that is where lentils came in.
Supporters argued that lentils and chickpeas needed help to compete with other crops subsidized by the federal government, or with crops subsidized by foreign governments.
They found a champion in Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, where farmers grow lentils and chickpeas in rotation with crops like wheat and barley, already subsidized by the government. Growers of lentils and chickpeas said it was difficult to compete with Canadian farmers because Canada had lower freight rates and better crop insurance as well as a weak currency, which makes its exports more affordable. 
The farmers found allies in a half-dozen nearby states that grow lentils and chickpeas. Conservative Idaho Republicans fought for the new program, alongside liberal Minnesota Democrats.
"Every country that produces agricultural products subsidizes them in some way," said Senator Conrad, whose family has been in North Dakota for five generations. "This is a little like the cold war. You have to build up to build down. If you don't fight back, you consign American farmers to failure."
The U.S.A. Dry Pea and Lentil Council, based in Moscow, Idaho, hired a Washington lobbyist who specializes in farm issues.
The lobbyist, John D. Gordley, said: "It's always difficult to establish a new farm program. A lot of people think we ought to get rid of these programs instead of setting up new ones."
The lentil program is one of many subsidies and benefits sprinkled through the farm bill. Growers of ginseng, onions, apples and catfish all receive benefits. Even in a time of shrinking budget surpluses, such measures passed with little trouble.
Under the program for lentils and chickpeas, if market prices fall below levels specified in the new law, ($11.94 for 100 pounds of lentils and $7.56 for 100 pounds of chickpeas), the government will make up the difference. With these "deficiency payments," farmers are assured of a certain income and can obtain the loans they need to stay in business. In the past, many lenders discouraged farmers from growing lentils and chickpeas because the government provided no price supports for them.
Representative Dan Miller, Republican of Florida, who opposed the new subsidy, said: "Lentils make good soup. But why is the federal government getting into the subsidy business? It makes no sense to keep expanding the size and scope of the federal government."
That sentiment, however, was relatively rare in the farm bill debate. It was more common for lawmakers to argue that the money could be better used to subsidize other crops.
In addition, Californians feared that the new subsidies, by stimulating production in the Midwest, could take business from their state. "The new payments will result in subsidized competition against California garbanzo farmers," said Representative Cal Dooley, Democrat of California. (Chickpeas are often called garbanzos, especially when referring to larger ones used in salads and soups.)
As chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Mr. Conrad has been a zealous advocate of fiscal discipline. But he had no apologies for the farm bill, which he expects to increase farm payments to North Dakota by 68 percent, to $676 million this year.
The Congressional Budget Office puts the cost of assistance for lentils and chickpeas at nearly $12 million a year, or $116 million over 10 years -- a pittance in a bill expected to increase farm spending by $79 billion over 10 years, to $242 billion. 
Now, farmers and ranchers are coming back to Congress, seeking at least $2.3 billion in disaster assistance, mainly to cover losses caused by severe drought in the last year. 
Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the senior Republican on the Agriculture Committee, questioned the need for such aid so soon after passage of the farm bill.
But Larry Barbie, president of the Montana Grain Growers Association, said, "Without disaster assistance, many of Montana's producers won't be around to participate in the benefits of the farm bill." 
Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, said that ranchers in his state were in dire need of disaster assistance. "What's the use of the farm bill if my farmers have been sucked dry and my farms are out of business?" Mr. Enzi asked.
The Midwest and Great Plains states were not the only ones to benefit from the farm bill. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, secured assistance as well.
Section 10106 of the new law says, in its entirety: "The secretary of agriculture shall use $10 million of the funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation to make a grant to the State of New York to be used to support onion producers in Orange County, N.Y., that have suffered losses to onion crops during one or more of the 1996 through 2000 crop years."
Mr. Schumer said the overall law would also provide a "a giant stimulus package" for New York agriculture, with federal payments averaging $15,200 a year for each dairy farmer and $12,925 this year for each apple grower.
Other provisions of the new law benefit ginseng growers in Wisconsin; catfish growers in Arkansas and Louisiana; and the John Hancock Life Insurance Company, the biggest owner of peanut-growing licenses. 
Ginseng, used for centuries as a folk medicine in China, has gained new popularity in the United States. Wisconsin produces 97 percent of the ginseng grown in this country, and its high-quality product commands a premium in world markets.
Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said plant products imported from Asia had been mislabeled as ginseng root when, in fact, they came from a bush of a different species.
The farm bill stipulates that products may not be labeled or advertised as ginseng unless they are derived from a particular type of plant. It prohibits use of the term "Siberian ginseng," which refers to a bush of a different species.
"Ginseng is a root, not a bush," Mr. Feingold said. "Consumers have a right to know that when they reach for a high-quality ginseng product, they are buying just that -- ginseng, not some ground-up bush."
Another provision of the farm bill, which generated intense debate, says that food labels must show the country of origin for most meat, fish, fruit and vegetables.
Senator Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota, and Representative Mary Bono, Republican of California, insisted on this requirement, saying that if American consumers had a choice, they would buy meat and produce from the United States.
The Grocery Manufacturers of America and the National Food Processors Association opposed the requirement as a form of protectionism, saying it would raise costs without providing consumers any useful information about food safety.
When it became clear that Congress would adopt some requirement, food companies lobbied successfully for an exemption to make clear that they did not have to identify the source of every ingredient in a can of soup or a frozen pizza.
"The tomatoes, meat, spinach and cheese in frozen lasagna could come from 16 different countries," said Michael D. Gill, vice president of the American Frozen Food Institute.

HEADLINE: Accord Nears To Give Mayor School Control 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
With possibly just one last sticking point delaying an agreement to give Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg control of New York City's vast school system, Mr. Bloomberg and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver are to meet this morning in hopes of reaching a quick compromise on the historic deal.
 Officials on both sides said the two political leaders were still divided over whether people who lack education credentials could be named chancellor without getting a waiver from the state. Current state law requires such a waiver, but Mr. Bloomberg, who has hinted that he will seek a new chancellor from the business world, wants that provision abolished because it dilutes his power to choose whomever he wants. 
 Although Assembly Democrats said their opposition to removing the waiver requirement was philosophical -- they said it would be unfair to allow people with no education background to run the nation's largest, most complex school system -- it is also politically motivated. The state education commissioner, who decides whether to grant waivers to chancellor candidates, is appointed by the State Board of Regents -- whose members are chosen mostly by Mr. Silver and the Assembly.
According to both sides, all the other disagreements that had muddled negotiations and even threatened to blow up a deal in recent weeks had been effectively resolved by late yesterday. (The meeting was to have been held last night, but Mr. Silver's flight from Albany was delayed.)
Mr. Silver, they said, had relented to Mr. Bloomberg's demand that the chancellor alone hire district superintendents, and that local school boards be stripped of all or most of their role in the process.
In return, Mr. Bloomberg has agreed to let the reconfigured Board of Education, which he will control and which will lose almost all its powers, approve the school system's expense and capital budgets. That power means little, however, because the board's disapproval cannot block those budgets, which are controlled by the mayor.
Mr. Bloomberg has also assented to Mr. Silver's demand that the board, which will expand to 13 members from 7, vote on certain policy changes, according to people on both sides of the negotiations. But the chancellor, who will be appointed by and presumably loyal to the mayor, will decide which policies merit a board vote, these people said. (Since 8 of the 13 members on a new board would be appointed by the mayor, and could be removed by him at any time, they would almost certainly follow his wishes, anyway.) Aides to Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Silver were still negotiating the language of these provisions yesterday.
Finally, Mr. Bloomberg has agreed to guarantee that New York City will not cut its share of school spending from year to year except in times of major financial crisis, according to both sides. But here, too, the language was still being worked out yesterday.
Steven Sanders, chairman of the Assembly Education Committee, said in an interview that the Assembly felt strongly about not removing the waiver requirement for chancellors.
"That is a slippery slope that could go downhill very quickly," said Mr. Sanders, who has been negotiating the details of an agreement with Deputy Mayor Dennis M. Walcott. "Maybe some day we won't have a mayor who's as scrupulous as this one, who will want to appoint his biggest fund-raiser or favorite adviser as chancellor."
Asked about the waiver question, Deputy Mayor Marc V. Shaw, who has also been immersed in the negotiations, said, "It is an outstanding issue."
Both sides have agreed to abolish the 32 community school boards by next June, and to solicit ideas from the public on what to replace them with. The Justice Department must approve any changes to the boards -- including their reduced role in hiring superintendents -- to ensure that they do not dilute the voting power of minorities in the Bronx, Manhattan and Brooklyn. Officials said that Mr. Silver and Mr. Bloomberg might appoint a task force to solicit public opinion and plan the boards' replacement starting this fall.
Any agreement would have to be approved not only by the Assembly but by the Republican-controlled State Senate and Gov. George E. Pataki, who is also a Republican. Officials in Albany warned yesterday that passage of a law could be delayed if Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, was not satisfied with Mr. Bloomberg's and Mr. Silver's agreement.
In another sign that a deal was imminent, the Bloomberg administration yesterday scheduled collective bargaining sessions with the city teachers' union for today and Friday. The city's 80,000 teachers have worked without a new contract for 19 months and have threatened to strike, but Mr. Bloomberg has been reluctant to approve a contract deal until he knows whether he will control the schools. The issues still in dispute are how the teachers will spend the extra 100 minutes they have agreed to work each week -- either in instruction or in training or some combination -- and whether to add 20 minutes to each day or bundle the extra time into two 50-minute sessions.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Software: Manugistics Shares Fall After Loss Is Posted 

BYLINE:  NYT (Compiled by Gary Bradford) 

 BODY:
 Shares of the Manugistics Group, a software company in Rockville, Md., dropped almost 26 percent yesterday after it said it recorded a first-quarter loss because of weakened sales. The company had predicted a profit. Shares fell $2.04, to $5.90. Sales declined in April and May, company officials said on Tuesday, compared with March when demand appeared to be recovering. Gregory J. Owens, the company's chief executive, said "financial performance this quarter was adversely impacted by the continuing global economic downturn." The company said it lost $16 million to $18 million in the period that ended Friday. While sales were $71 million to $73 million for the quarter, the company had predicted a range of $84 million to $85 million. Mr. Owens said he would consider some job cuts.

 BODY:
THE RUSSIAN DEBUTANTE'S HANDBOOK
By Gary Shteyngart
452 pages. Riverhead Books. $24.95.
 The "Russian debutante" in Gary Shteyngart's very funny, very deft first novel is one Vladimir Girshkin, a feckless 25-year-old Russian-American who works as a junior clerk at an immigrant assistance agency in Manhattan. He's what Kingsley Amis's Lucky Jim would be, if he were a Russian emigre trying to cope with the confusions of life in America of the 1990's and the incessant demands of an ambitious and endlessly aggrieved mother. 
 Vladimir is an engaging enough fellow, but he's also a shameless opportunist and self-loathing nerd: envious of those more attractive and successful than he is, self-conscious about his imperfect command of Western manners and mores, and eager to buy himself a portion of the American Dream at any cost.
In "The Russian Debutante's Handbook," Mr. Shteyngart tells the uproarious and highly entertaining story of how Vladimir journeys from St. Petersburg to Scarsdale and back to Eastern Europe, and how he becomes in the interim a kingpin in the Russian mafia. But at the same time the author -- who, like his hero, was born in Leningrad and moved to the United States as a boy -- also uses Vladimir's picaresque adventures to satirize Americans' and Russians' preconceptions about their former cold war enemies and to send up their illusions about themselves.
Like Salman Rushdie and Bharati Mukherjee, Mr. Shteyngart uses his appraising outsider's eye to examine the bizarre, weightless state of exile (its conferring of freedom, but also rootlessness and dislocation); and like Victor Pelevin, he proves himself a nimble cultural magpie, borrowing street argot from both the East and West to create a wonderfully idiomatic, jet-fueled prose. His voice, however, is thoroughly his own, by turns ironic and earnest, farcical and melancholy, as attuned to the exhilarating possibilities of the English language as Martin Amis, as deadpan funny as the young Evelyn Waugh.
Vladimir, Mr. Shteyngart writes, was the "enduring victim of every practical joke the late 20th century had to offer." This "coddled single child" of parents who had left Russia for the wilds of Westchester and who had "paid $25,000 a year to send him to a progressive Midwestern college" will journey through the hip provinces of downtown Manhattan and, on the run from money problems and an amorous member of the Catalan cartel, will wind up in a small Eastern European country, in the employ of a gangster known as the Groundhog.
Raised in Russia, schooled in America, Vladimir is a knowledgeable but itchy outsider wherever he goes. "Vladimir was 50 percent functional American, and 50 percent cultured Eastern European in need of a haircut and a bath," Mr. Shteyngart writes. "He was the best of both worlds. Historically, a little dangerous, but, for the most part, nicely tamed by Coca-Cola" and "blue-light specials."
In New York, college Marxists and politically correct liberals adopt Vladimir as their pet, and he soon becomes an avatar of "Immigrant Chic," embraced by his girlfriend Francesca's parents and courted by her Slavophile friend Frank, who says things like, "Don't forget that Vladimir has an expansive Russian soul," and "Camaraderie and salvation, that's his game." In Eastern Europe, where he is regarded as an expert on America, Vladimir sets about giving the Groundhog's troops "American Lessons," goading his students to rid themselves of their kitschiest possessions: "the nylon track suits, the Rod Stewart compilations, the worn Romanian sneakers, everything that had qualified the Groundhog's vast crew as Easterners, Soviets, cold war losers."
To Vladimir, "Americans were too keen to invent their own troubles," Mr. Shteyngart writes. "To paraphrase an old Russian expression, they were wild with their own fat." As for Russians like the Groundhog, Vladimir sees them as history's casualties: "Everything they grew up with is gone. So what are their options now? They can either shoot their way through the gray economy or make $25 a month driving a bus in Dnepropetrovsk."
Mr. Shteyngart's depiction of Vladimir's adventures is so manic that his poor hero sometimes seems like a billiard ball careering from one head-on collision to another. His billowing money woes in New York; his encounter with the Groundhog's madman of a father, who has conversations with electric fans; his flight from America, pursued by a convoy of thugs driving peach-colored Cadillacs; his Ponzi scheme for making the Groundhog's organization even richer by selling horse tranquilizers and literary dreams to young, well-heeled Americans: all are delineated with the antic glee of a natural farceur. 
And the people Vladimir meets along the way are sketched with an equally wicked and comic hand: his two impossible New York girlfriends, the pudgy, grudging Challah, and the snooty, doctrinaire Francesca; the jovial but deadly Groundhog, and his nutty, irascible father; and Morgan, the beautiful, plain-spoken terrorist with whom Vladimir falls in love.
Together these people populate the black comedy world in which Vladimir pursues his dreams, and they help the very talented Mr. Shteyngart expose the absurdities that exist on either side of the former iron curtain.

HEADLINE: Greve Journal; 
Sometimes Slowing Down Can Really Get Hectic

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: GREVE, Italy 

 BODY:
Since Paolo Saturnini declared this old market town, in the heart of Chianti country, a slow city, life has never been so hectic.
 Mr. Saturnini, 52, has been mayor of Greve for 13 years, and his inspiration came from the Slow Food movement that arose in the 1980's to oppose fast food and its values of homogeneity, impersonality and haste. 
 When McDonald's began to open in Italian cities, Slow Food proponents set up tables in the street in front and served traditional dishes like pasta in meals lasting hours. Next came long lunches, a movement in Tuscany that fosters old-style lunches, stretched out over hours, with traditional dishes that often take as long to prepare as unhurried diners take to consume them. 
If Slow Food and long lunches, Mr. Saturnini reasoned, why not slow cities?
"Cities are becoming all uniform; they are losing their identity, their souls," Mr. Saturnini lamented in a recent conversation. In commerce, he added, chain stores triumph, creating sameness in food and customs. "It's a negative uniformity," he said.
A slow city, by contrast, would preserve its architectural heritage, typical dishes and inherited customs. So two years ago, Mr. Saturnini founded the International Network of Slow Cities. Today, five Italian cities belong, and 40 more want to join.
But Greve -- once known for little more than being the birthplace of the explorer Giovanni da Verrazano -- now finds itself with little time to slow down. 
"Everyone's running," complained Alessandra Molletti, Mr. Saturnini's assistant, taking time to show a visitor around, since the mayor's calendar was full. Being a slow city, she said, "is a two-edged benefit -- it helps us live better, but it's also commercially useful."
Mr. Saturnini says he wants to leave his son something of his grandparents, Ms. Molletti explained, and in a world full of uniformity, Greve finds that individuality sells well. So like much of Tuscany, Greve is thriving selling its uniqueness. Unemployment has been replaced by a labor shortage, and while the young once emigrated for jobs, they are returning. Ms. Molletti is an example: a native of the region, she spent eight years working in the theater in New York, before settling in Greve.
Stefano Falorni never left. For eight generations, his forebears ran the pork store on the main piazza. But Italy's opening to the rest of Europe, which led other local butchers to import pork from the Netherlands and beef from Denmark, nearly drove the Falornis out of business.
So five years ago, Mr. Falorni, now 55, revived a near-extinct race of local free-ranging hogs to produce salami and ham. Now, Mr. Falorni employs 40 people raising the distinctive black and white hogs and producing meat products. Local restaurants feature pasta with meat sauce from the hogs, and tourists fill his store. The meat is shipped throughout Europe, and orders come from as far as Hong Kong.
"We put our soul in this salami," Mr. Falorni says, tugging at a bushy moustache. "Not just pork." Asked whether he found time for long lunches, he confessed he usually sneaks off for a sandwich.
Greve's backwardness, he said, became an asset. His competitors, he went on, "are outside biting their nails, while we're making money."
For decades after World War II, Ms. Molletti said, the people of Greve, like so many Italians, sought modernity in neon signs to replace old hand-painted ones, and aluminum front doors, rather than wood. Now Mr. Saturnini campaigns against neon and aluminum. He urges store owners to put out flower boxes of geraniums, and rewards with diplomas those who paint their facades. He has banned big hotel chains, like Sheraton, and sought to instill a taste for tradition in the young by asking school cafeterias to serve the kind of bread soup their grandmothers used to cook, and teachers to take their pupils on field trips to the grape harvest to learn about wine.
Of course, no one here mistakes this return to past ways with the real thing, whose main features were poverty and unemployment.
Sandro Checcucci, 35, ran a quiet wine bar until two years ago. Then, local investors, including Mr. Falorni, restored a block of quaint wine cellars that had stood unused for 30 years. They installed one of Tuscany's biggest wine shops and hired Mr. Checcucci to run it. Now, streams of visitors taste the 1,100 Tuscan wines that Mr. Checcucci offers. In place of unemployment, he said, "we now lack workers, especially in the tourist season." The 15- to 20-year olds often leave, tired of the quaintness, he said, though many return in search of work. What's missing now, he added, is "social life -- not jobs."
Still, Rossella Rossi, who runs the 10-room hotel on the piazza, said there was no mistaking the new Greve with the town of her youth. Around Greve, fields once terraced with grape and olives that were tended by hand are now sloped to allow for tractors and other mechanized equipment, Ms. Rossi, a woman in her 30's, said. "Where the bookstore is, there was a greengrocer," she said, "and a poultry shop where they now sell souvenirs."
"It's developed," she added. "But it has lost that aspect of genuineness."

That produced a commercial boom, helped by tourists who now crowd cafes to sample the 1,100 Tuscan wines on offer.

HEADLINE: Group Says Course Training Still Breaks Along Sex Lines 

BYLINE:  By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6 

 BODY:
Three decades after Congress passed Title IX, the law meant to end sex discrimination in publicly financed education, vocational and technical courses remain as heavily segregated by sex as ever, according to a report released here today.
 The report, by the National Women's Law Center, a nonprofit group representing women on economic, education and workplace issues, analyzed enrollment figures in high school vocational and technical courses nationwide. It found that 96 percent of the students training for jobs in cosmetology, for example, were female. Young women account for more than 85 percent of the students taking child care and health aide courses. 
 Training for traditionally male fields, too, showed little change, with young men accounting for 94 percent of students in plumbing and electrical work, 93 percent of the students in welding and carpentry, and 92 percent in auto mechanics courses. The patterns were the same in every state and region.
The group also filed a dozen complaints, one for every regional office of the federal Education Department's Office of Civil Rights. The complaints detailed segregation in vocational and technical courses by sex and demanded investigations into whether public schools were violating Title IX. 
"The evidence is clear; far too many schools are providing inferior opportunities for their female students," Marcia D. Greenberger, co-president of the National Women's Law Center, said at a press conference today. "What we found was unconscionable."
In a statement, C. Todd Jones, deputy assistant secretary for enforcement in the Office for Civil Rights, said the office was "committed to ensuring that girls and boys have equal access to the vocational programs that interest them" and would "vigorously investigate each of the complaints filed by the National Women's Law Center and determine whether the schools are in compliance with Title IX."
Along with the enrollment data, the group released federal wage figures showing that workers in the heavily female service fields earned a fraction of what workers earned in the building trades and computer support, both fields dominated by men. The median income for health aides, for example, is $11.06 an hour, and for beauticians, it is $8.49 an hour. In contrast, the median wage for electricians is $19.29 an hour, while computer support specialists earn $17.53 an hour.
More conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation did not instantly support the law center's conclusions. Krista Kafer, senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, said that while discrimination might crop up, "I don't think that it's a conspiracy or a pattern of discrimination, of people not enforcing Title IX, or teachers and guidance counselors dropping the ball."
"In the end," Ms. Kafer said, "it does come down to personal preference."
The complaints, however, say that more than personal taste creates the disparities. 
They said that counselors often steer young women away from vocational and highly technical courses. 
The group also cited recruitment drives that send messages both subtle and overt that girls are not welcome. At one vocational school recruitment fair, Ms. Greenberger said, the display for Samuel L. Gompers Vocational School in New York featured a banner that read, "Gompers Builds Mechanical Men."
Geri Harston, a Chicago electrician, said she had been turned down when she wanted to learn electrical work in high school and was steered toward nursing courses instead. Ms. Harston said she was discouraged from a construction-related job on the grounds that as a woman, she could not lift heavy objects. But as a nurse, she handled patients that weighed up to 600 pounds.
"Just the act of turning them from side to side to prevent bed sores was as physical as anything I've experienced as an electrician," she said.
It was not until seven years after graduating from high school, Ms. Harston said, that she found the course that trained her for the job she really wanted.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Negativity Reigns Again, Wiping Out Wednesday Gains

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street's fortunes turned negative again yesterday as a downgrade of chip makers by Merrill Lynch and disappointing sales by retailers gave investors more reasons to doubt the strength of an economic recovery. Shares fell sharply, with the technology sector suffering the heaviest losses.
 After a respite on Wednesday, the market resumed a decline that has lasted more than a week, giving back gains from the previous session. Investors are selling on worries about earnings, mistrust of corporate accounting and the conflicts in the Middle East and between India and Pakistan. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 172.16 points, or 1.8 percent, at 9,624.64. The loss easily wiped out the Dow's gain of 108.96 points on Wednesday, when all of the major indicators finished higher for the first time in nearly two weeks. 
The broader market also fell sharply yesterday. The Nasdaq index dropped 40.38 points, or 2.5 percent, to 1,554.88, losing all of its 17.14 advance from Wednesday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 20.75, or 2.0 percent, to 1,029.15, more than erasing Wednesday's gain of 9.21. 
Analysts said the market's persistent selling was no surprise because earnings remained depressed, jeopardizing the recovery investors had hoped would happen in the second half of 2002. 
Fears of improper bookkeeping, involving Tyco International and several other companies in the wake of the Enron debacle, and worries about tensions overseas have also given investors little reason to buy, analysts said. 
The chip maker Intel fell $1.18, to $27, after Merrill Lynch lowered its near-term rating on the stock. Shares in two other chip makers that were downgraded by by Merrill also declined; Texas Instruments fell 75 cents, to $27.69, and Triquint Semiconductor fell 91 cents, to $7.47. 
Weak retail sales for May also drove the market lower. Shares in AnnTaylor, a retailer of women's career clothing, fell $1.28, to $26.80 after the company reported a 5.2 percent decline in sales from stores open at least a year. Shares in Sears, Roebuck stumbled $1.76, to $56.26, after the company reported a 4.4 percent drop in sales at its department stores. 
Tyco International plunged nearly 16 percent, down $2.70 at $14.60, on concerns about its former chief executive L. Dennis Kozlowski, who has been indicted on charges of evading New York sales taxes. New York prosecutors are investigating whether Mr. Kozlowski tapped company accounts to buy his $18 million Manhattan apartment or whether he received interest-free loans from Tyco to buy artwork. 
Oracle fell 51 cents, to $8.15, yesterday, losing some of its 84-cent gain from Wednesday when the chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, said the company would meet fourth-quarter expectations for earnings of 12 cents a share. 
Many analysts see no signs of a reprieve for Wall Street. 
Earnings are the biggest factor weighing on stocks, said Gary Kaltbaum, market technician for Investors' Edge Partners in Orlando, Fla. "To get things going, you have to beat earnings and beat them good." 
Meeting already lowered expectations, he said, is not enough to inspire investors to buy and hold onto shares. --------------------

Treasury Prices Increase
 By Bloomberg News
Treasuries gained yesterday as investors fled a declining stock market for government-guaranteed debt even as signs point to stronger economic growth. 
By late in the day, the 10-year note had increased 18/32 , to a price of 99 /32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, declined to 4.98 percent from 5.05 percent on Wednesday.
The 30-year bond also increased, rising 21/32 , to 96 3/32 . Its yield decreased to 5.61 percent from 5.65 percent.

HEADLINE: Half the Afghans, the Women, Fight to Establish Their Rights 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
When Afghanistan's grand council convenes next week to begin creating a new political order, one task will be to select the writers of a new Constitution. There has never been a moment with more promise -- or long-term danger -- for Afghan women.
 Three of them -- a lawyer, a law professor and a judge -- brought that message to New York this week, along with an urgent plea for help, meeting with American foundations, law firms and the Bar Association of the City of New York. 
 Soraya Paikan, a lawyer and member of the grand council, or loya jirga, said in an interview on Monday that there are signs that newly won women's freedoms are already under threat, and that women must take part in writing the Constitution if they are to achieve protection. 
The task of drawing women into the process can seem overwhelming. "Afghan women don't know their rights," said Ms. Paikan, 42, a founder of the Afghan Women Lawyers and Professionals Association, which emerged in January from four years underground. 
She is in New York with two colleagues from the association's board -- Hangama Anwari, a law scholar, and Nafisa Kabuli, a judge in the struggling juvenile justice system. The association has trained 40 women in basic human rights. It wants to send dozens more across Afghanistan to explain to women in towns and rural villages about the evolution of political life and how they can work to ensure that developments work to their advantage. 
The women brought a meticulous list of what their association needs, from chairs and kitchen items to a car and eight computers, to open a center in Kabul. All told, they need $237,600. It seems a lot to them.
Visibility is equally important. Ms. Anwari, 26, said, "One of the purposes of our visit here -- beside getting some financial and material support from outsiders -- is to introduce the aims and the goals and the dreams of Afghan women lawyers to the international community." 
The women spoke at the offices of Equality Now, an organization that works on women's rights in more than 100 countries. 
Afghanistan once had hundreds of women trained in law. For 57 years, before women were banned by the Taliban, Kabul University graduated coeducational law classes that included 20 to 40 women a year. But they were not active in political life and women's rights. Many also left the country during the last 23 years of war. 
Ms. Kabuli, 41, was among those who stayed and worked underground, and she is now a judge dealing with youthful offenders; girls as well as boys are often charged with robbery in these difficult economic times, she said. During Taliban rule, from 1996 until last fall, she ran one of hundreds of clandestine home schools for girls.
"One of the first violations of the Taliban against women was that they instantly got rid of the female judges," Ms. Kabuli said. "As a consequence of that, and because the schools were closed, I had a home school and taught up to 300 students. The girls had to come one by one to school because if they came a group, they might have been arrested." 
Ms. Kabuli said the problem with the Taliban was not that they were Muslims. "Islam brought a certain equality to men and women," she said. "The laws that the Taliban brought were from pre-Islamic times, based on traditional law."
Those traditions die hard, Ms. Paikan said.

HEADLINE: Zimbabwean Court Grants Bail To Lawyers Held for Subversion 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe, June 6 

 BODY:
Facing growing international censure, a Zimbabwean court granted bail today to two top lawyers who had been arrested on subversion charges.
 Sternford Moyo, president of the nation's Law Society, and Wilbert Mapombere, a former magistrate who is the society's secretary, have denied accusations that they urged the opposition to topple President Robert Mugabe. 
 The United States government, the United Nations and the International Bar Association have all strongly condemned the arrests. 
Magistrate Dominic Musavazi dismissed police requests to hold the two in custody pending their next court appearance in August, said Joseph Mafusire, acting for the lawyers' group.
He freed Mr. Moyo and Mr. Mapombere on $95 bail each and ordered them to surrender their passports.
Under strict new security laws, subversion carries a penalty of up to 20 years in jail.
The lawyers' arrests Monday and their detention in police cells for two nights followed a government crackdown on those viewed as critics. The government has used new security and media laws to arrest journalists, opposition leaders and prominent members of civil society.
The International Bar Association, a global body of jurists and lawyers, expressed its "shock and deep concern" over the arrests, saying they were directly related to Mr. Moyo's strong stance on the rule of law and judicial independence.
The Law Society recently published a report condemning "sustained abuse, defamatory remarks and threats of violence" by the state and ruling party militants against independent judges.
The State Department protested the arrests, denouncing Zimbabwe's "continuing harassment of the free press and now lawyers through repressive legislation."
The United States and the European Union have imposed travel restrictions against Mr. Mugabe and high-level Zimbabwean government officials.
"The U.S. is reviewing additional measures aimed at bringing pressure to bear on Zimbabwe's leadership," the United States government said in a statement. "We are consulting with others in the international community who are similarly concerned about the situation in Zimbabwe."
The United Nations special investigator on the independence of judges and lawyers, Param Cumaraswamy, said today that the arrests breached international legal standards.
He said he had "grave concerns over the deterioration of the rule of law and acceleration of governmental lawlessness" in Zimbabwe.
Zimbabwe has been suffering its worst political and economic crisis since the country gained independence from Britain in 1980. Local and international human rights organizations have criticized government efforts to suppress dissent.

HEADLINE: Torricelli and Forrester Senate Campaigns Point Fingers Over Prescription Costs 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 6 

 BODY:
Striving to make the high cost of prescription drugs a prominent issue in New Jersey's United States Senate race, Senator Robert G. Torricelli's campaign charged today that the Republican nominee, Douglas R. Forrester, made his fortune in business by unfairly inflating the price of medications.
 But Mr. Forrester denied the allegations and said the giant pharmaceutical companies, which have contributed heavily to Mr. Torricelli's campaign, were the ones driving up drug prices. 
 Mr. Forrester, who financed his own primary campaign and is expected to spend millions more before the general election, is president of BeneCard Services Inc., which manages pharmacy benefit plans for employers. He has declared his stake in the company at more than $50 million. The entire pharmacy benefit management industry has come under fire in recent years amid complaints that the companies steer patients toward certain higher-priced medications in return for rebates from drug manufacturers.
In a news briefing at the State House today, Mr. Torricelli's campaign staff, several Democratic colleagues and an assortment of doctors and critics of the health care system asserted that companies like BeneCard have become a predatory part of the drug delivery system and had failed to deliver the savings they promised consumers. Mr. Torricelli's supporters said they could not cite specific examples of BeneCard's advising clients to use expensive drugs because the company's records are private, but insisted that it was common practice throughout the industry. Walter Worgacki, the mayor of Wallington, N.J., said that the school board in his community pays BeneCard to administer its prescription plan and that the price per employee has jumped to $90.74 this year, from $26.82 in 1995.
"BeneCard isn't putting people first, it's putting profits first," Mr. Worgacki said.
But Mr. Forrester's advisers vehemently disputed the notion that companies like BeneCard are to blame for prescription costs. Bill Pascoe, Mr. Forrester's campaign manager, said that much of the increase has been driven by the pharmaceutical manufacturers, and that Mr. Torricelli accepts more campaign money from drug companies than any other member of Congress. 
"Bob Torricelli appears to be a vacuum cleaner when it comes to accepting PAC money from pharmaceutical companies," Mr. Pascoe said. "For him to be criticizing Doug Forrester, who finds ways to make prescriptions more affordable for his clients, is outrageous. "
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent watchdog group, Mr. Torricelli has received more than $85,000 from pharmaceutical companies and their political action committees this year, the second-highest of any federal legislator.
The clash over prescription costs, which came just two days after Mr. Forrester won the Republican nomination, is likely to be repeated frequently between now and Election Day. By focusing on Mr. Forrester's business activities early in the campaign, Mr. Torricelli can deflect attention from questions about his own ethics: whether he took improper gifts from a contributor in exchange for political favors. Talking about prescription drugs will also allow him to indicate that he is attuned to the economic pressures facing the elderly and middle-class families, political analysts say. 
But it is unclear whether the issue will resonate with voters in New Jersey, a major center of the pharmaceutical industry, especially because the Torricelli campaign's criticisms are about the industry in general rather than specific actions involving Mr. Forrester. In the Democratic Senate primary two years ago, Jim Florio, the former governor, made little headway by assailing the business ethics of Jon S. Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, accusing him of underwriting gun manufacturers and profiting from slavery in Sudan.
Prescription drug benefits were a major issue in the 2000 presidential race, when both Al Gore and George W. Bush promised voters to push for a national plan. Because no plan has been enacted, many Democratic candidates for Congress are making prescription costs a major theme this year. In his kickoff speech Tuesday, Mr. Torricelli described it as one of the defining issues of the campaign.
After today's briefing, Mr. Torricelli's campaign manager, Ken Snyder, said there was an enormous difference between drug manufacturers and companies like BeneCard. "Pharmaceutical companies in New Jersey have great labs that produce life-saving drugs and they provide jobs for tens of thousands of New Jersey residents," Mr. Snyder said. "But Doug Forrester's company only employs 18 people and he makes enormous profits for processing claims and making average people pay exorbitant prices for medicine." 
Mr. Forrester's campaign countered that companies like BeneCard helped to slow the rise of prescription costs by cutting administrative costs. 
"Either Bob Torricelli is hopelessly ignorant about the prescription business and should be removed for office for incompetence," Mr. Pascoe said, "or he understands, is misleading the public and should be removed from office for throwing around such scurrilous lies."

HEADLINE: Initial Claims for Jobless Benefits Decline Sharply 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6 

 BODY:
In a sign that the job market in the United States might be picking up, the number of workers filing first-time claims for state unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level in more than a year, the Labor Department reported today.
 Initial jobless claims, which offer an early glimpse into the health of the labor market, dropped 32,000 last week, to 383,000, from a revised 415,000 the previous week, the report said. 
 The size of the decline surprised some Wall Street analysts, who had forecast a slight decline, to 407,000. 
"The economy was showing some signs of improvement from the start of the year," said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, "but now we're beginning to see a little more of that work its way into the labor market."
But Carey Leahey, a senior economist at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, said the report offered little insight into the report on May unemployment, due on Friday, which some saw as a factor in interest-rate decisions by the Federal Reserve at its next meeting June 25-26.
The Fed's policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee, is expected to leave rates unchanged. 
Unemployment claims filed last week were at the lowest level since falling by 27,000, also to 383,000, in May 2001, the Labor Department said.
The number of people applying for benefits also broke a 10-week run above 400,000, which began on March 23. Economists regard the 400,000 mark as a sign of a lackluster labor market. 
The four-week average of claims, which is considered a more accurate gauge of longer-term labor conditions because it smooths out week-to-week gyrations, fell for the sixth consecutive week, to 411,250, down from 419,750 the previous week and the lowest since 398,750 in the week ended March 23. 
But in a sign that unemployed workers were struggling to find jobs, the number of continued claims -- those collecting benefits for more than a week -- rose to 3.82 million in the week ended May 25, the latest week for which those figures were available.

HEADLINE: Japan Reports 1.4% Growth, Signaling End To Recession 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, June 7 

 BODY:
Japan's economy expanded by 1.4 percent during the first quarter of this year, the government said today, ending a recession that had dragged on for a year.
 A 6.4 percent rise in exports and a 1.6 percent increase in consumer spending -- which together account for more than half the economy -- helped to revive Japan's economy, the second largest in the world after the United States. The return to economic growth was slightly less robust than analysts had forecast because corporate capital spending dropped 3.2 percent compared with the last quarter of 2001. But it was the strongest growth in two years. 
 If it continues to grow at the rate it did in the first quarter, Japan's economy would expand at an annual rate of 5.7 percent, slightly better than the 5.6 percent annual rate in America in the first quarter. In the fiscal year that ended in March, Japan's economy contracted by 1.3 percent.
The numbers confirm the widely held view that Japan is emerging, if only perhaps temporarily, from an 18-month recession, its worst in a series of slumps since 1990. The report gives a minor lift to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, whose disapproval rating in public opinion polls is now higher than his approval rating. With approval ratings around 43 percent, Mr. Koizumi has only two weeks left in the current parliamentary session to pass bills privatizing the highways and the postal system.
But today's growth numbers do little to ease doubts about the sustainability of Japan's recovery, which is still largely driven by exports rather than domestic spending. Production has picked up -- particularly of cars, electronics and semiconductors -- but most of these products are being shipped overseas rather than used in Japan. Exports account for only about 10 percent of Japan's total economic output. Should economic growth slow in the United States, traditionally Japan's biggest export market, Japan would probably fall back into recession.
Last year, publicly traded companies in Japan lost about $100 billion, according to calculations by the Nihon Keizai newspaper. During the first quarter of this year, corporate profits generally were down 14.6 percent over the quarter a year ago.
In addition to providing a monthlong distraction from the economy, the World Cup soccer championship is also attracting about 400,000 foreign visitors to watch the games. But skeptics doubt that the tournament, which is being shared with South Korea, will give more than a temporary boost to Japan's economy.
Economists at the Dai-Ichi Life Insurance Economic Research Institute forecast that soccer fans will spend about $1.8 billion on hotels, restaurants and related purchases, providing an additional three-tenths of a percentage point of growth in the April-June period. Dentsu, Japan's largest advertising agency, is more upbeat, saying the economy will receive three times the benefit if Japan makes it into the quarterfinals of the monthlong tournament. Last winter, Dentsu estimated that soccer fans would spend $26.6 billion, a figure now seen as wildly exaggerated.
Over the last five years, Japan spent $4.6 billion to build or refurbish 10 stadiums, a government-led spending spree that may have eased past recessions. Three weeks from now, the soccer championship will be over and Japanese taxpayers will be looking at the bills.
"A lot of money has been invested in the games, but it was spent years ago on stadiums and fewer fans are coming to Japan" compared with other World Cup championships, said John Lilley, director of analytical operations at Standard & Poor's MMS International in Tokyo. "Even if the economy gets a push in June, there's no evidence it will be sustainable."
Although Japan's government officially declared last week that the economy had "bottomed out," it is unclear if the economy will be able to reorient itself in time to cope with a rapidly aging population. In 20 years, about a third of Japan's population will have reached retirement age.
To generate the self-sustaining recovery that has eluded Japan since 1990, consumers and companies must spend more and save less, Mr. Lilley said. That is unlikely to happen soon since companies are retrenching and moving operations offshore, where costs are much cheaper.
Despite a 1.6 percent rise in consumer spending in the quarter, consumers are still hunkering down. Unemployment remains relatively high, at 5.2 percent; wages are eroding; and 173,000 people filed for personal bankruptcy last year, four times the number in 1995. Graduates face the worst job market in half a century as manufacturers shift operations to China, where young engineers can be paid a fraction of what Japanese earn.

HEADLINE: Where Have All the Artists Gone? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 We may have thought New York City was the cultural capital of the world, but according to Prof. Richard Florida, we slipped up somewhere along the line ("The Cities and Their New Elite," Arts & Ideas pages, June 1). 
 This is not a surprise, since the arts were withdrawn from the school curriculum starting in the 1970's. Creative development must start in the primary grades with sequential training that values the arts equally with academic subjects. Otherwise, we deny children access to higher education and to the creative labor force that drives the communications economy. 
The good news is that since 1997 we have seen an infusion of private and public money to bring the arts back to the schools. That momentum must be maintained.

HEADLINE: U.S. Decides to Recognize Russia as MarketEconomy 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 6 

 BODY:
President Bush told President Vladimir V. Putin by telephone today that the United States would begin regarding Russia as a market economy, a change in semantics that has significant practical consequences for Russian-American trade.
 The move, after a similar step last week by the European Union, addresses one of Moscow's main complaints about the West, that Russia's Communist past is used as an excuse to treat it unfairly in trade disputes. 
 American antidumping laws, meant to protect American industries from unfair import competition, turn on whether goods are sold in the United States for less than they cost to make at home. For nonmarket economies, the law assumes that domestic prices are meaningless, and American trade officials use figures for a surrogate market economy country instead -- generally to the great disadvantage of the country accused of dumping. 
That provision has been especially costly for Russia in commodity goods like steel and fertilizer. In 1998, Russian steel producers agreed to deep cuts in their shipments to the United States to avoid punitive duties.
With the market economy designation, Russian companies will get to use their own cost figures in arguing dumping cases, and not be saddled with figures from third countries that may bear little relation to Russian reality. 
Russian steel makers applauded. "This is a very important and long-awaited decision," said Aleksei Mordashov, general director of Severstal, a major producer, through his spokesman. "It is a real example of the easing of tensions in Russian-American trade relations." 
The change in status is one of the economic rewards Russia has been expecting for backing the United States in its response to the Sept. 11 attacks. People here were disappointed that it was not granted when Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin met in Moscow last month.
Tonight, a statement by Mr. Putin's press office said he "hailed this step, noting that it would give a powerful impulse to the development of bilateral economic ties."
German Gref, the minister for economic development and trade, told an interviewer on Russian television that the nonmarket status had denied the country $1.5 billion a year in sales of goods to the United States.
"For Russian companies, this means more possibilities to enter the American market, and for the Russian people it means the creation of new jobs, and for the Russian economy it means new opportunities and new production of domestic goods," Mr. Gref said.
There are drawbacks, too, experts said. As a market economy, Russian state subsidies will come under greater foreign scrutiny than before. 
For example, gas and electricity, provided free in Soviet times, are still partly subsidized, and that subsidy may count against Russian producers in future dumping-related cost calculations.
"We've always told them that this is a double-edged sword," said one Western specialist in Moscow working on the issue.
Russia is also waiting for the United States Congress to scrap the Jackson-Vanik amendment, a 1974 economic sanction intended to press Communist-bloc nations to allow free emigration.
The Bush administration has asked Congress to exempt Russia from the sanctions, saying Moscow dropped discriminatory emigration practices long ago.
The amendment is one obstacle to Russia's joining the World Trade Organization, which it hopes to do as soon as next year. It is by far the largest country still outside the organization, which sets global trade rules.
A Commerce Department official told reporters on a conference call today that legal, regulatory and tax changes in Russia since 1991 had laid the groundwork for membership in the organization, Bloomberg News reported.
But there is some resistance on Capitol Hill to upgrading Russia's status, partly because Russia banned imports of American chicken for more than a month earlier this year and has been slow to grant new import licenses since the ban was lifted in mid-April. A number of lawmakers have told the administration they believe that Russia is not ready to abide by international trade rules.

HEADLINE: Bush Is Said to Be Set to Back Patients' Bill 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6 

 BODY:
Representative Charlie Norwood, a leader of the six-year campaign for legislation defining patients' rights, said today that the White House had expressed a new willingness to support a compromise letting patients sue health insurers for medical injuries caused by substandard care.
 Mr. Norwood said he and the White House favored the proposal, which would allow patients to recover up to $4 million for pain and suffering and other noneconomic damages resulting from serious injuries. 
 "This is the best deal Congress will get," Mr. Norwood said, expressing hope that the idea would open the way to final approval of the legislation. 
The Senate, defying a veto threat from President Bush, passed a patients' bill of rights 59 to 36 last June. The House passed a different version, with a much more limited right to sue, last August by a vote of 226 to 203. Mr. Bush supported the House bill.
Under the Senate bill most cases would go to state courts, subject to any limits of state law, while the House bill would limit pain and suffering to $1.5 million.
The White House and several senators have engaged in quiet negotiations for months, especially over the legal liability of health maintenance organizations and other insurers.
Mr. Norwood, Republican of Georgia, said the negotiators had made significant progress on all other issues, and the White House confirmed that.
"Both sides have come a million miles," Mr. Norwood said. "They are down to the last inch."
In an interview, Mr. Norwood said White House officials had assured him they would accept a $4 million cap on damages for serious injuries. 
"Most everybody is willing to go along with this deal except a few people in Congress," he said. 
A White House spokesman confirmed the discussions but declined to be more specific. 
Mr. Norwood said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and the chief sponsor of the Senate bill, which would give patients broad new rights to sue, has seen the proposal. The two Democratic sponsors of the Senate measure, Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina, have not accepted the idea of a $4 million cap, and many plaintiffs' lawyers oppose any limit on damages as unfair to patients.
Frustrated with the pace of negotiations, Mr. Norwood asked, "What is this fight about? Many states already have caps lower than $4 million. The average jury verdict and the average out-of-court settlement in medical injury cases are much less than $4 million."
Senator Kennedy has been tight-lipped about the negotiations, indicating that he was more interested in enacting legislation than in scoring political points.
"While I remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement that fully protects all patients from H.M.O. abuse," Mr. Kennedy said tonight, "we are well into the ninth inning, and time is running out on our discussions."
Scott McClellan, a White House spokesman; Nancy E. Ives, a spokeswoman for Mr. McCain; and James P. Manley, a spokesman for Mr. Kennedy, would not discuss details of any proposal.
Mr. McClellan said the White House has been working to reach a bipartisan consensus.
"We believe it was within reach, and could still be," he said. "The real question now is whether the interests of powerful personal injury trial lawyers will prevail over the health care needs of the American people."
The White House and Senate negotiators said they had discussed proposals that would set different limits on lawsuits for serious injuries and other, less severe injuries. Under the proposal described by Mr. Norwood, the limit would be $1.5 million for less serious injuries.
For serious and less serious injuries, Mr. Norwood said, there would be a $1.5 million cap on punitive damages but no limit on economic damages, which reimburse patients for medical expenses and lost wages.
Lawmakers said they had not reached agreement with the White House on how to define the difference between more serious and less serious injuries.
If negotiations with the White House fail, Congress could appoint a conference committee, the usual mechanism for resolving major differences between the House and the Senate.
Supporters of the legislation have been trying to avoid a conference committee. An earlier version of the patients' rights bill died in such a committee in 2000, after countless hours of negotiations that frustrated members of both parties.
Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, the Senate majority leader, said on Wednesday that he was close to seeking a conference committee because of "the intransigence that we have had from the Republicans and the White House."
"We're getting very mixed signals," Mr. Daschle said, "and I don't know that the White House wants to press ahead. They don't appear to want an agreement, and we're left with really no choice, it seems, but to appoint conferees."

HEADLINE: Blunt Talk by an Investment Banker 

 BODY:
For much of corporate America, Goldman Sachs has long epitomized the discretion and solicitude of a Wall Street investment bank. That is what made Wednesday's call for corporate governance reforms by Henry M. Paulson Jr., the firm's chief executive, so compelling and unusual. Amid the gathering storm of corporate scandals that threatens to thwart the stock market's comeback, Mr. Paulson delivered a stern warning to his clients and to other major companies in a speech at the National Press Club: Either clean up your act or we are all in serious trouble. He ought to be heeded. 
 "In my lifetime," Mr. Paulson said, "American business has never been under such scrutiny. To be blunt, much of it is deserved." This scrutiny and a sense of alarm triggered by such spectacular corporate scandals as Enron and Tyco have rattled investors, and help explain the markets' puzzling decline at a time of apparent economic recovery. 
 Mr. Paulson, who rarely makes public appearances, called for reforms to bolster the integrity of financial markets and public confidence in them. His recommendations reflect what is by now a growing consensus of what is needed. He was especially adamant about the need to overhaul accounting rules -- such as those relating to off-the-books entities made infamous by Enron -- and the way the accounting profession is regulated. On this issue, he rightly said: "If the outcome of all that we have been through in the past six months, all the soul-searching and debate, is business at usual . . . then we will have missed an enormous opportunity."
Mr. Paulson acknowledged that Wall Street needed to address the conflicts of interest affecting the research of firms like his own. He said boards of directors needed to become more independent of management. News of the extravagant payoffs owed to C.E.O.'s ousted in recent scandals is evidence that some boards have been negligent about protecting shareholder interests. Mr. Paulson acknowledged that some C.E.O.'s were overpaid. He believes that companies will have to report executive stock options as an expense affecting the bottom line, and that chief executives should have to hold on to their company stock for a long time, and should be forced to give back any gains realized by selling company stock on the eve of a bankruptcy filing. Plenty of Mr. Paulson's clients will be none too pleased with his speech. 
Throughout the 90's, American consultants parachuted into a liberated Eastern Europe and elsewhere to preach the virtues of American-style accounting and corporate governance rules that champion transparency. The integrity of its financial markets was one of this country's economic strengths. A Wall Street insider like Mr. Paulson understands the economic significance of losing this advantage, and of the serious effort that is required to maintain it. 
So do others on Wall Street. Yesterday the New York Stock Exchange announced new rules to strengthen directors' independence that listed companies will have to follow. Not wanting to wait for the accounting profession to act, Standard & Poor's has said it will report "core earnings" for major companies in the future, a figure that will treat stock options as an expense. The Nasdaq market is barring Wall Street analysts from participating in their firms' marketing of initial public offerings. 
Self-interest is forcing meaningful, if piecemeal, reforms. This crisis of investor confidence is a serious economic threat. In order to advance the national interest, Congress ought to join the reform effort.

HEADLINE: The Global Warming Dropout 

BYLINE:  By Eileen Claussen; Eileen Claussen is president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change.

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va. 

 BODY:
In its business-as-usual approach to climate change, the Bush administration is increasingly out of step not only with other industrialized powers, but also with the growing support in this country for action to prevent global warming. The administration's oddly two-sided report last week to the United Nations brings the White House into the scientific mainstream on the subject -- acknowledging that human activity is probably the cause of global warming and that America itself faces serious consequences -- but at the same time lays out a strategy ensuring that American emissions of greenhouse gases will continue rising sharply for at least a decade.
 Last week the European Union and its 15 member states completed en masse their ratification of the emissions-limiting treaty that President Bush has rejected, the Kyoto Protocol. This week Japan followed suit. Russia expects to ratify by the end of the year, meaning only one or two smaller countries would be needed to put the treaty into effect. (Ratifying countries must account for at least 55 percent of developed country emissions in 1990.) 
 The administration is also ignoring a growing domestic recognition of the need to act. Persuaded that the risks of climate change are real and that restraints on emissions are inevitable, many American companies are working on carbon reduction. To be sure, many others, especially in the energy and oil businesses, are strongly resistant. But dozens of major corporations like Alcoa, DuPont and Intel are among those setting their own targets for lower emissions. For many, there are financial payoffs, too -- improved efficiencies, lower costs and increased sales of energy-saving products.
State governments are also moving ahead. New Hampshire recently became the third state to adopt mandatory controls on carbon emissions from power plants. New Jersey is aiming to reduce statewide emissions by 3.5 percent from 1990 levels in the years before 2005. All six New England states, in a compact with five Eastern Canadian provinces, have pledged to reduce their emissions to 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.
Even in Congress, the tide is beginning to turn. Twice as many climate change measures were introduced in the past year as in the previous four years combined, many with strong support from both Democrats and Republicans.
Scientists project that a century's worth of greenhouse gas releases, mostly from burning fossil fuels, have already bought us a few degrees of warming in the decades ahead. The challenge is heading off further warming by gradually weaning ourselves from fossil fuels. This transition to a low-carbon economy will require a new industrial revolution.
We must look to the marketplace to carry it out. Only the market can mobilize the ingenuity, investment and productive capacity needed to develop and disperse new technologies on such a large scale. But the marketplace will deliver only if it perceives a demand, and providing that demand is a role for government.
A modest but logical first step in the U.S. is a measure passed unanimously by the Senate in April encouraging companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions voluntarily. If after five years less than 60 percent of emissions are being reported to the public, the measure would change this voluntary reporting system to a mandatory one. A similar approach helped dramatically reduce toxic air and water pollution nationwide. This legislation should be accepted by the House and signed by the president. 
Ultimately, though, the market must be driven by policies that set realistic, binding targets for reducing emissions and give companies the flexibility to achieve them as affordably as possible. The Bush administration's own report shows the danger in its remaining stubbornly out of step. The longer the United States waits, the graver the risks -- and the cost of averting them.

Arafat Weathers Assault But Compound Is Battered
Yasir Arafat's Ramallah complex was wrecked in a six-hour Israeli assault that sent a tank shell through his bathroom, killed two people, left half a dozen buildings in ruins and weakened his status as Palestinian leader. The attack was a reprisal for a suicide car bombing of a bus that killed 17 Israelis, mostly soldiers. A1

The latest suicide bombing and Israeli reprisal elicited strong and familiar condemnations from senior Bush administration officials. But they were just as quick to assert that the events would not deter them from discussing proposals for peace with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt this weekend and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel on Monday. A10

Bush Envoy Presses Pakistan
Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage was in Islamabad to begin an effort at American shuttle diplomacy intended to ease tensions between Pakistan and India, where he is to go to today. Pakistani officials described the talks as blunt and the demands detailed. A8

Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld urged NATO to take the campaign against terrorism to the terrorists with pre-emptive attacks on shadowy networks or hostile states that have biological, chemical or nuclear weapons. During a meeting of NATO defense ministers, the question of possible military action against Iraq hung in the air. A8

U.S. Admitting Fewer Refugees
Security concerns in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks have slowed refugee admissions to the United States to a trickle, even as the number of civilians fleeing war worldwide has inched up over the last year, according to refugee resettlement groups. As a result, refugees are languishing in crowded, foul and sometimes unsafe camps. A9

Bush Seeks to Create Antiterror Cabinet Post
President Bush called for creation of a cabinet department for domestic defense that would combine 22 federal agencies -- but not the C.I.A. and F.B.I. -- in an effort to prevent attacks on the United States. A1

President Bush's proposal for a new cabinet-level agency to oversee domestic security drew wide bipartisan support in Congress. A21

Agent Coleen Rowley, whose complaints about handling of Sept. 11 investigations caused a furor, told a Senate panel that the F.B.I.'s bureaucracy discouraged innovation, drowned investigators in paperwork and punished agents who sought to get by headquarters gatekeepers. A1

House Backs Estate Tax Repeal
The House voted 256 to 171 to make permanent a repeal of the estate tax. Opponents said eliminating the tax would cost the Treasury billions and mainly benefit the wealthy. A1

HEADLINE: The Many Faces Of Amr I. Elgindy 

BYLINE:  ByDAVID BARBOZA and ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
The faces that Amr Ibrahim Elgindy offered the world were as different as the names he used.
 To the investors who paid him hundreds of dollars a month for stock tips that were often uncannily accurate, Mr. Elgindy was Anthony Pacific. 
 To the Muslim refugees he brought from Kosovo to the United States, he was Tony Elgindy, a benefactor who provided cars, apartments and even cash -- and asked for little in return.
But to the regulators and prosecutors who chased him throughout the 1990's, he was Amr I. Elgindy, a man they considered a liar and thief who avoided prison mainly because of his willingness to turn in co-conspirators in stock frauds. 
Now Mr. Elgindy is moving from a San Diego jail to one in Brooklyn, charged with running a stock manipulation ring that is said to have included two F.B.I. agents who tipped Mr. Elgindy to current criminal investigations. Meanwhile, the investigation is widening, as the authorities publicly question whether Mr. Elgindy, who is Muslim and was born in Egypt, had advance knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks.
So far, evidence backing that suspicion is scant. Jeanne G. Knight, Mr. Elgindy's lawyer, said that he had done nothing wrong and that he had no prior knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks. In an interview, Ms. Knight accused the government of a form of racial profiling for denying Mr. Elgindy bail in part because of Sept. 11.
Still, the arrest and the charges against Mr. Elgindy, 34, have put him in the public eye and on the edge of ruin. He has been both places before.
Over the last decade, Mr. Elgindy chiseled a small fortune out of the often sleazy world of penny stocks, the shares of tiny companies that can double in a day and fall just as fast on waves of rumor and speculation. Along the way, he played off the fringe brokerage firms that pump penny stocks up against the short sellers who try to take them down, and he became a source of tips for both regulators and journalists.
"He always had an in with somebody," said Stuart R. Allen, a former investigator with the Securities and Exchange Commission. "If it wasn't the authorities, it was the press."
In the backwaters of the securities industry, where brokers can look more like bouncers and criminal records are common, the battles between long sellers and short sellers can be vicious and personal.
Mr. Elgindy seemed to thrive on the tension. On ABC's "20/20" five years ago, he said with relish that he carried a handgun and had "received a bullet in the mail, a bullet with my name on it."
"Three-hundred-pound guys walking into an office beating you up, making you do this, do this," he said. "It's happening. It's happening on Wall Street. That's not going to happen to me."
As his fortune grew, Mr. Elgindy acquired the trappings of wealth, including a Ferrari, a Bentley and a Hummer. Last year, he moved with his wife and three young sons into a $3 million house in the wealthy northern suburbs of San Diego.
But the money apparently did not change Mr. Elgindy's behavior. His own lawyers have called him "edgy" and "intimidating." Several neighbors recalled being irritated by his speeding along the narrow, hilly streets near his new home.
"It was obvious he had achieved a certain level of success," said one neighbor, Rick Engebretsen. "You'd think a certain amount of maturity would come along with that. But it didn't as far as I could tell."
Mr. Engebretsen watched one day last month as F.B.I. agents stormed Mr. Elgindy's mansion.
"He seemed squirrelly, wiry. On the surface level he was O.K., but my wife and I had a terrible feeling about him," Mr. Engebretsen said. "Was I surprised that I saw his house raided? No, I wasn't. I'd thought he was going to come out of there in a body bag or a raid."
Before the million-dollar homes and flashy cars, Mr. Elgindy was struggling to make his mark in a new world after his family moved from Egypt to the suburbs of Chicago when he was 2 or 3.
From an early age, he had trouble living up to the high expectations his family set, he told friends. His father was a professor, his mother was a pediatrician; his two brothers went on to earn advanced degrees, and a sister became a teacher. His own path, he conceded, was more tortured.
He dropped out of high school and got an equivalency degree in 1985. He enrolled at the University of Southern California to study biomedical engineering and later studied biology at San Diego State, but he completed less than two years of course work, university records show.
Trouble found him early. In 1986, at 18, he was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon in Los Angeles; the charges were later dropped. He worked as an auto salesman at three different Chevrolet dealerships within a year before entering the murky world of buying and selling penny stocks.
His resume includes some of the most notorious brokerage firms in the industry, the "pump and dump" shops that had long histories of manipulating stock prices and leaving investors out in the cold. Among these firms he joined, now defunct, was Blinder Robinson, nicknamed "Blind 'em and Rob 'em."
Mr. Elgindy later confessed to the authorities that he and brokers at another firm had accepted bribes from stock promoters seeking to manipulate shares. According to court records, in 1995 he was granted immunity in exchange for information about the scheme.
With his cooperation, federal prosecutors won convictions against four people on tax evasion charges. That was the beginning of Mr. Elgindy's life as a government informant, documents show. At a time when Wall Street was overrun by penny stock fraud and even the influence of organized crime, he helped government agents navigate the terrain. In court, the government has acknowledged that his tips were valuable.
Mr. Elgindy, who moved to Texas in 1994 to run his own brokerage firm, liked to boast about how he began wearing a wire. He also started carrying a gun, a small .380 Colt, because he had been repeatedly threatened, he said. When reporters visited his home, he would play tapes of secretly recorded conversations and show off his gun collection.
By the late 1990's, Mr. Elgindy had repackaged himself as a short seller who blew the whistle on crooked companies and wise guys. He was mentioned in a 1997 Business Week article about corrupt brokers. He was also written up in Wired magazine and featured on the Discovery Channel program "Justice Files."
Though many journalists were suspicious of Mr. Elgindy's motives, his information was often useful and provocative to them.
Bill Alpert, a longtime reporter at Barron's, the financial weekly in New York, remembers visiting Mr. Elgindy in 1996 at his home in Fort Worth and seeing stacks of cassette recordings he had made with people from the underbelly of Wall Street.
By then, Mr. Elgindy was driving a Ferrari and living comfortably in a home decorated with statues on columns, draped in velvet.
"Everyone in his family was accomplished, an achiever, and he'd gone astray," Mr. Alpert said. "But by helping the government and helping get swindlers, this would help redeem him."
When stock trading moved to the Internet and day trading became a fad, he moved his soapbox to the Web. On popular sites like Silicon Investor, an online stock forum, he plied his trade with great bravado.
He later set up a Web site and sold tips for a $600-a-month subscription fee. Few complained about the price.
"Most of the people on that site were doing 20 to 30k a week -- what's 600 bucks/mo.," one fan, who called himself Tool Dude, wrote in a recent post on the Silicon Investor site.
As early as 1997, though, Mr. Elgindy began to run into legal troubles. He had worked briefly for Bear Stearns in 1994 and later lost a civil suit over his firing by that firm. He was also sued by the insurance company MassMutual, which accused him of fraud for accepting disability checks worth $7,500 a month in 1994 for unemployment attributed to "emotional stress" even though he was employed at Bear, Stearns and another brokerage firm at that time.
That case was referred to the Justice Department and in 1999, while living in San Diego, he was indicted by a federal grand jury in Texas. He pleaded guilty to insurance fraud and was sentenced to four months in a California prison. 
When he was released in October 2000, Mr. Elgindy resumed his position as a prominent short seller on the Internet. He also began assisting the government in investigating cyberspace scams, he said.
At a probation hearing last January, his lawyer told the judge that Mr. Elgindy was a good citizen who had traveled to Kosovo and helped resettle refugees in the United States.
His case was supported by a letter from Jeffrey A. Royer, an F.B.I. agent in Gallup, N.M., who said that Mr. Elgindy had "gone above and beyond to assist law enforcement and civil regulatory agencies in combating fraudulent activities."
The F.B.I. now says the letter, which was undated and not on official letterhead, is suspect. "It is highly unlikely that as an agent Royer worked on any significant white-collar cases in Gallup," said H. Douglas Beldon, an F.B.I. spokesman.
Indeed, by the time of that letter, the Justice Department had opened an investigation into Mr. Elgindy's activities. After Sept. 11, the government said, a Wall Street broker told federal officials that Mr. Elgindy had tried to sell $300,000 in stock in anticipation of a market plunge. He placed his order on Sept. 10.
As part of that inquiry, the government said it uncovered a broader plot that involved Mr. Royer, who had left the F.B.I. in December to work for Mr. Elgindy.
In a 33-page indictment handed up over two weeks ago, the government portrayed Mr. Elgindy as a con man's con man. For the last two years, the government contends, Mr. Elgindy led a double life: He told people he was helping the government uncover stock market manipulation, but instead, the indictment charges, he was bribing F.B.I. agents to supply him with information to commit his own frauds.
Mr. Elgindy and four others, including Mr. Royer and another F.B.I. agent, were charged with obstruction of justice and securities fraud. They have all pleaded not guilty. Mr. Elgindy's lawyer, Ms. Knight, declined to comment except to accuse the government of using a "race based" notion to deny Mr. Elgindy bail.
Mr. Elgindy's Web sites have gone dark; his tip sheets are blank. But questions remain: Was he really tipped off to Sept. 11? Or is the government trying to get back at a longtime informant who proved untrustworthy?
Some people who know Mr. Elgindy best say that if he was tipped off, he would not have simply pulled his money out of the market, he would have taken out a big bet that the Dow Jones industrial average would fall.
"Tony was too damn selfish to be involved in anything that wouldn't turn into a buck in his pocket," said Richard Edward Hill, a lawyer in Texas who once represented Mr. Elgindy. "Tony is a smart guy, very intelligent, very gifted. But he didn't seem to have a lot of guidance."

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Fell 0.2 Point Last Month 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Offering a glint of hope to out-of-work Americans and further evidence of an improving economy, the unemployment rate fell to 5.8 percent in May, from 6 percent in April.
 But an unimpressive gain of just 41,000 in the number of people on business payrolls -- often considered a more reliable measure of current conditions than the unemployment rate -- led experts to caution that the nascent economic recovery is unlikely to produce many new jobs until businesses start investing again. 
 "The corporate sector will still take several more months before they build up confidence on the sustainability of the recovery and make permanent hirings," Elaine L. Chao, the secretary of labor, said in an interview.
In the meantime, the burden on the unemployed grows heavier. The number of long-term unemployed -- those looking for jobs for more than six months -- rose to 1.64 million last month, an increase of 45 percent from the beginning of the year and the highest figure since 1994. (All figures are adjusted to take account of normal season variations.) 
Yesterday's report followed a series of encouraging indicators about the economy this week. On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell 32,000, to 383,000, the lowest level since May last year. Consumer borrowing also increased solidly in April, the Fed reported yesterday, indicating that Americans remain in a buying mood. And measures of manufacturing and service sector activity from the Institute for Supply Management, which closely follows purchasing patterns, gained ground in May.
Services -- particularly the health care industry -- was the source of most of last month's improvements. Manufacturing continued to lose jobs, though the 19,000 positions shed in May were the fewest losses in a month since November 2000.
Despite the mildly positive report from the Labor Department, the stock market fell yet again on Friday, still smarting from disappointing news from Intel and Biogen and the widening investigation of Tyco International and its former chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski. The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 35 points yesterday to close at 9,589.67, down 3 percent for the week.
Although forecasters had earlier predicted that the Federal Reserve might begin increasing interest rates once unemployment started declining, the mixed signals in yesterday's report helped to assuage fears of tighter credit. While some others still predict that the Fed might start raising rates as early as August, Goldman, Sachs issued an advisory yesterday suggesting that the Fed would not adjust rates until next year.
Economists said yesterday's report offered possible evidence of a turn in the economy's fortunes, though they agreed that widespread hiring was at least several months away. 
"In the first year of an expansion, productivity gains tend to dominate, not job gains," said Daniel E. Laufenberg, chief United States economist at American Express Financial Advisors. Eventually, he said, companies will need to hire more workers to keep growing.
A combination of rising productivity and stable wages has allowed companies to increase profits without expanding their work forces.
But a variety of risks are hampering business confidence, according to Ian Morris, an economist at HSBC Securities, the Wall Street arm of the global bank. "What seems to be happening now," he said, "is that all these terrorism threats, and uncertainty about the genuine level of earnings, are driving the stock market down." 
The disjoint between consumers, who have been buoyant of late, and business executives, who remain cautious, may continue for some time. Until companies can catch up to consumers, they may rely on temporary workers, whose number rose 0.9 percent, in May. "Businesses are looking to hire people, except they're not ready to hire permanent people," Mr. Laufenberg said. "They're using temporary workers until they're convinced that things are really better."
For now, the number of long-term unemployed is mounting, having risen by 142,000 in May. "As the unemployment rate increases, it takes longer for people to find a job," said Robert Shimer, a professor of labor economics at Princeton University. But that is not entirely unexpected. After a recession, the number of long-term unemployed typically continues rising even after the total unemployment rate begins to recede, Mr. Shimer said. 
Extensions in unemployment benefits could explain part of the trend in the current cycle. People who collect unemployment benefits, Mr. Shimer said, may look harder for work or settle for lower-paying jobs just before their benefits expire. "When benefits last for six months, a lot of people tend to find jobs in the sixth month," he said. "Now benefits are up to nine months for a lot of people, so I would expect to see that a little farther down the road." Nine-month unemployment benefits for people who lost their jobs after Sept. 11 will begin to expire next week.
Financing those benefits has not been easy for New York State, which has already taken out (and repaid) $215 million in loans from the federal government to pay claims. If the relatively high unemployment continues, New York and other states, including Alabama, Texas and Illinois, might exhaust their reserves and resort to more borrowing.
"States are fairly flush with funds at the beginning of each year," said Richard A. Hobbie, unemployment insurance director of the National Association of State Workforce Agencies. "It isn't until later on that they might run into trouble."
Ms. Chao said she expected the unemployment rate to stay near 6 percent until companies have built up enough productivity-based profits to start hiring in earnest.
But Mr. Morris said that the unemployment rate has historically switched between high and low levels extremely quickly. "When it goes up, as it has done over the past 18 months, it tends to shoot up fairly quickly," he said. "Once it peaks, it actually comes, initially, straight back down again."
Yesterday's report also ushered in new measures of employment in several service industries. The new statistics incorporate probability-based estimates as well as hard data.

HEADLINE: Sweet on Times Square, Hershey Is to Open Store 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The maker of Hershey's Kisses, Reese's peanut butter cups and Milk Duds plans to open an interactive candy store festooned with an elaborate electronic billboard at the northern end of Times Square. 
 Hershey Foods Corporation officials say they hope that the store will become an international tourist attraction. The company's decision to locate its first major store outside its home in Hershey, Pa., is an ambitious and expensive undertaking and a tribute to the allure of Times Square as an intersection of marketing and retailing. 
 But Hershey is one of few glamorous exceptions to the retail tenants making their way to what promoters call the crossroads of the world. The second wave of retailers since the resurgence of Times Square in 1997 is more likely to include retail banks, sneaker stores and fast food. A 7-Eleven outlet will be serving Slurpees and the Big Gulp in the best-known Times Square tower of all, 1 Times Square, site of the New Year's Eve ball drop. 
Despite the revival, there are risks. The Museum Store on 42nd Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, is the latest retailer to succumb to high rents and slow sales. The Disney and Warner Brothers stores are long gone, as are Cosmetics Plus and the All Star Cafe, the sports-themed restaurant.
But the tens of millions of tourists and the tens of thousands of office workers who course through Times Square are too good an audience to pass up, said Wynn Willard, chief marketing officer of Hershey Foods. 
The Hershey store and its 15-story billboard -- one of the largest signs in Times Square -- will be at the northwest corner of Broadway and 48th Street, in the Crowne Plaza Hotel.
"Times Square is a showcase that is all of America," Mr. Willard said. "We want to create the image and delight of a Hershey chocolate factory in Times Square. We want to add to the rich layers of icons that have existed in Times Square over the decades."
The store, which will open in November, will mimic the company's chocolate factories in Hershey, Mr. Willard said, while the billboard will incorporate the company's smokestacks, a giant chocolate bar, a Jolly Rancher wind vane and a pile of Hershey Kisses. The company is hoping to duplicate the success of the giant Toys "R" Us store and its operating Ferris wheel at Broadway and 45th Street.
But why would Hershey do better than Disney and Warner Brothers, which both closed their large Times Square stores? "You can only have so many T-shirts and plush toys," Mr. Willard said. "When it comes to the range of Hershey products, we think we'll have an enduring appeal."
Tourists and New Yorkers have made their way back to Times Square since last year, when the sluggish economy and the attack on the World Trade Center cut sales by as much as 40 percent. Brokers disagree on whether rents are rising or leveling off, but they all say that retailers are hunting again for space and billboards.
"Times Square is hot again," said Robert K. Futterman, a broker. "There's a lot of demand for space."
C. Bradley Mendelson, a broker at Insignia ESG, said that retailers make expensive deals in Times Square that are as much about marketing and brand identity as retail sales.
But Mr. Mendelson, Mr. Futterman and most other brokers, landlords and store owners say that retailing is much tougher on 42nd Street, west of Times Square, where a number of stores have had disappointing sales or gone out of business. Madame Tussaud's museum on 42nd Street does attract large numbers of tourists and New Yorkers and, across 42nd Street, the PastaBreak restaurant has signed a lease.
"The street is still a challenge," said John L. Livingston, president of Tishman Urban Development Corporation. "Retailers view it as an entertainment area, but there aren't that many entertainment tenants."
Ripley's Believe It or Not has been scouting locations in Times Square. For the most part, however, the current crop of retailers is less exotic.
According to real estate brokers and landlords, Footlocker is signing a deal to open a showcase sneaker store on Broadway, next door to Toys "R" Us, and Champs, the sports chain, is headed for the Ernst & Young Building at 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue. J.P. Morgan Chase is opening a retail bank in the Reuters Building, and Skechers, the shoe store chain, is negotiating for space in that building to return to Times Square. Adidas is still looking for a spot.
The executives said that 7-Eleven, Two Boots Pizza and the Times Square Brewery are signing deals to move into 1 Times Square, the space once occupied by Warner Brothers. Given the 24-hour nature of Times Square, the 7-Eleven chain expects that the new store will be as popular as their highway and suburban outlets. But not everyone agrees.
"I think 7-Eleven will be disappointed," said Mr. Mendelson. "It's the most visible signpost because it's an island in the center of Times Square and it's the worst retail site because it's an island. Visible yet invisible."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 13, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A map on Saturday about plans for stores around Times Square, including a Hershey candy outlet in the Crowne Plaza Hotel, gave an erroneous location for the site that will include a 7-Eleven store. It is 1 Times Square, north of 42nd Street at the junction of Broadway and Seventh Avenue. The map also misstated the name of a store that recently closed. It was the Museum Company, not the Museum Store. The name of an avenue was also misstated. It is Eighth Avenue, not Eighth Street.

HEADLINE: Argentine Ex-Minister Freed After Jailing on Arms Sale Charges 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 7 

 BODY:
A federal appeals court in Argentina today ordered the release of Domingo Cavallo, a former economy minister who was jailed more than two months ago on charges that he approved more than $100 million in illegal arms sales while in office during the early 1990's.
 Mr. Cavallo was the most powerful of several cabinet ministers under Carlos Menem, the president at the time, who were required to sign decrees authorizing the sale of 6,500 tons of munitions to Panama and Venezuela. The armaments ended up going to Croatia and Ecuador at a time when both countries were under an international arms embargo, leading to a government investigation into what was termed "aggravated contraband." 
 One of Mr. Cavallo's lawyers, Eduardo Oderigo, cautioned that despite today's ruling, the case against his client had not been totally closed. The investigating judge who ordered the arrest of Mr. Cavallo was told by the court that he had acted improperly on the basis of the evidence. But he could still file new charges. 
Mr. Cavallo has been held for 65 days at a military base outside Buenos Aires. Mr. Oderigo described the charges against him as "without merit." He said his client "is relieved and satisfied and sees no reason why he should be called on again" to testify in the case.
Mr. Cavallo, a Harvard-educated economist, was economy minister from 1991 to 1996 and again for nine difficult months last year. During his first period in office, he was widely praised on Wall Street and in Washington for carrying out free-market reforms that led to a burst of rapid economic growth, which made Argentina a model emerging market.
But after the collapse of the Argentine economy in early December, he resigned and was quickly blamed for the crisis. He was especially unpopular for issuing an order, still in effect, that virtually froze bank deposits, which now have lost more than 70 percent of their value because of the devaluation of the Argentine peso.
A new government led by a rival of Mr. Menem has fanned sentiment against Mr. Cavallo even as the economy continued to disintegrate. Mr. Cavallo's release from jail, however, was announced on a day when most of Argentina's 37 million people had their attention focused on a crucial World Cup soccer match against England and were paying little attention to politics. (Argentina lost.) 
Mr. Menem was also arrested in connection with the smuggled arms and held under house arrest for five months last year. But charges against him and a former army commander, Gen. Martin Balza, were dropped because of insufficient evidence, leaving Mr. Cavallo as the only prominent former government figure still under scrutiny in the case.
Mr. Cavallo and his lawyers have argued since the beginning that the charges against him were politically inspired. In an advertisement published last month in The New York Times, more than 70 international economists and scholars called on the government to treat Mr. Cavallo fairly. His lawyers have also filed a complaint with the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, seeking a ruling that would end official "harassment" of him. 
Mr. Oderigo said that complaint would go forward. Mr. Cavallo "has been the object of persecution not only in this case, but in various others," he said.

Snobs: They're Made, Not Born

BYLINE:  By EMILY EAKIN 

 BODY:
Joseph Epstein drives a Jaguar S-Type. His son went to Stanford. He has hobnobbed with Saul Bellow and shared meals with five other Nobel laureates (three in economics, two in physics). He's been to a Chicago Bulls game with Gene Siskel ($350 front-row seats), exchanged greetings with Oprah Winfrey and had Lynne Cheney to his apartment for supper. He's on friendly terms with one of Monica Lewinsky's lawyers and receives the occasional note from former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
 Oh, and he wants you to know that on a recent visit to New York City, he was put up at the Plaza. 
 Impressed? Mr. Epstein certainly hopes so. An essayist, author and former editor of The American Scholar, he is also, by his own bashful admission, a snob. Those celebrity names and status brands glinting from the pages of his new book like Swarovski crystals on an Armani gown are just his way of letting you know that he is a person of superior taste and social standing. And since the book is "Snobbery: the American Version" (Houghton Mifflin), they're also intended to encourage reader confidence that Mr. Epstein is just the man to tackle an affliction apparently as slippery as it is ubiquitous.
Everyone knows a snob when he sees one, he notes. But there is considerably less agreement about exactly what makes one a snob. Virginia Woolf, who confessed to uppity impulses -- like keeping letters from her titled friends in conspicuous view -- in her 1936 essay "Am I a Snob?," claimed that "the essence of snobbery is that you wish to impress other people."
Marcel Proust, a famous snob from a country generally thought to be teeming with them, defined snobbery as "admiration of something in other people unconnected with their personality." He also called it "the greatest sterilizer of inspiration, the greatest deadener of originality, the greatest destroyer of talent." Perhaps, Mr. Epstein suggests, the philosopher George Santayana put it best when he said that to call someone a snob "is a very vague description but a very clear insult." 
Lexicographers can provide no further help. The origins of the word snob are a total mystery, though Mr. Epstein comes up with four intriguing theories: 1) it is derived from a Scandinavian term for dolt or charlatan 2) it comes from an abbreviation of the Latin sine nobilitate, supposedly used to distinguish commoners from bona fide nobles on official lists 3) it is an antonym for the word nob, British slang for a person of genuine wealth and stature or 4) it is derived from French peasants' elision of the phrase "c'est noble," meaning "it's noble." 
But whatever its roots, scholars generally agree that before the 19th century, the word snob simply did not exist. And in Mr. Epstein's view, this makes sense. Snobbery, he contends, is a peculiarly modern disease: a byproduct of democracy. "The social fluidity that democracy makes possible, allowing people to climb from the bottom to the top of the ladder of social class in a generation or two," he writes, "provides a fine breeding ground for snobbery and gives much room to exercise condescension, haughtiness, affectation, false deference and other egregious behavior so congenial to the snob." 
In the past, he argues, such behavior was pointless -- and little indulged in. Who was going to mistake a scullery maid's daughter for a lady, no matter how skillful her piano playing or fluent her Latin? Your place in the rigid social order was fixed at birth. And this, Mr. Epstein says, explains why Shakespeare, Dante, Aristophanes and the Bible are basically snob-free: "Snobbery as we know it today, snobbery meant to shore up one's own sense of importance and to make others sorely feel their insignificance, was not yet up and running in a serious way."
By 1848, however, when the English novelist William Makepeace Thackeray wrote his "Book of Snobs" -- the first major literary use of the term -- they were apparently everywhere. Thackeray's comprehensive treatment includes chapters on every possible strain: royal snobs, city snobs, country snobs, military snobs, literary snobs, club snobs and "dining-out" snobs. "It is impossible for any Briton, perhaps, not to be a Snob in some degree," he remarks at one point. 
According to Mr. Epstein's theory, such an explosion of snobbery was only to be expected. By 1848, a large and prosperous commercial class was wreaking havoc on England's old caste system. 
But no place, he insists, proved a more ideal incubator of snobbery than the United States. Living in a country with few built-in class distinctions, Americans turned to snobbery as compensation, a means of clarifying what the Constitution failed to: just who was better than whom. (Alexis de Toqueville, who saw this phenomenon up close, wrote that "democratic institutions most successfully develop sentiments of envy in the human heart.")
Nor did it hurt that America was predominantly middle class. "Vague and wide-ranging though the term middle class may be," Mr. Epstein writes, "it does render anyone who is part of this class capable of, if not intrinsically susceptible to, snobbery in both directions. To be middle class positions one nicely to be both an upward- and a downward-looking snob, full, simultaneously, of aspiration to rise to the position of those above and of disdain for those below." 
Mr. Epstein traces snobbery's fickle path through American history, noting the changing status of brand names, people and objects -- from neighborhoods and cities to music, beverages, colleges and dogs. (King Charles spaniels and golden retrievers are out; half-Labs are the new status symbol.)
Along the way, he finds a dizzying array of new snobbisms, including "reverse snobbery," which amounts to asserting your superiority over other snobs by embracing what they disdain and disdaining what they embrace. Calling "The Simpsons" high art and The New Yorker a middle-brow rag is the sort of thing Mr. Epstein has in mind. (His own reverse snobbism is mostly limited to expressing a strong aversion to the work of Susan Sontag, a writer generally held in high esteem by the literary establishment.) 
If Mr. Epstein is right, as social barriers fall away and more Americans of diverse backgrounds join the middle class, the nation's snobbery quotient is likely only to grow. But perhaps that's not such a bad thing. If snobbery flourishes where freedom and social mobility are great, maybe it's less a symptom of disease than a sign of health.

HEADLINE: Insuring Against Terrorism 

 BODY:
Last fall, Congress responded energetically to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But the response was incomplete. When the fog of normalcy, with its paralyzing partisanship, again descended on Capitol Hill late last year, Congress had not yet enacted urgently needed legislation to provide federal help in insuring against similarly catastrophic terrorist attacks in the future. It must do so now, particularly in light of the constant stream of Bush administration warnings about new potential terrorist threats. 
 Before Sept. 11, insurance companies routinely provided businesses with coverage for terrorism-related losses as part of their general property and casualty policies. Not anymore; not after the attacks resulted in some $50 billion in insured losses. Unable to assess the risk of future attacks and their potential cost, some insurance companies and reinsurers have stopped providing terrorism coverage altogether; many others are charging astronomical premiums for very limited coverage. 
 In New York City and elsewhere, high-profile sites are finding it especially hard to insure against terrorism. Legal disputes between lenders and property developers about the adequacy of their insurance coverage, such as one involving the new Conde Nast office tower on Times Square, could become more common as more and more policies expire and companies are forced to proceed without terrorism insurance, or with an insufficient amount. Meanwhile, in the absence of a federal backstop, the prospect of potentially devastating workers' compensation liability in the event of future attacks may force many businesses to reconsider concentrating so many employees in Manhattan.
There is broad support across the political spectrum for the notion that the federal government must cover the bulk of any private losses that exceed $10 billion from a terrorist attack. Even if Congress fails to formalize the commitment, it will undoubtedly act after the fact. By passing a law now requiring the insurance industry to provide terrorism coverage in exchange for capping its potential losses, Congress can create a market for affordable coverage and protect potential terrorism targets, from New York City to San Francisco, from an exodus of business. 
None of this is seriously in dispute in Washington. What has produced a partisan stalemate on the issue was the House Republicans' decision late last year to transform the issue into a Trojan horse for their cherished tort reform agenda. Their bill, passed last November, was stuffed with items on a longstanding wish list of desired curbs on litigation, such as a cap on lawyers' fees and exclusions for non-economic damages. The restrictions would apply only to lawsuits that stemmed from a terrorist incident, but the Republicans wanted to make a political point.
This is an ideological showdown the American economy cannot afford. Senate Democratic leaders, eager to pass their own bill, must compromise, even if it means offending trial lawyer groups. Senate Republicans appear willing to accept far more modest curbs on terrorism-related litigation than their House brethren. Their proposals provide the basis for an eventual reconciliation of House and Senate efforts. 
It would be a reckless blow to America's economy for Congress to continue neglecting this wartime imperative.

Efforts to Ensure a Catholic Burial

BYLINE:  By JULIE FLAHERTY 

DATELINE: BOSTON, June 7 

 BODY:
It is not a sale, per se. And price slashing would be the wrong term. But there is no denying that the Archdiocese of Boston hopes to attract customers with the low-cost burial packages it introduced this year.
 The discount burial plots, which Roman Catholic cemeteries around Boston first began offering in January, start at $1,500, and while no signs in church windows scream "40 percent off," that is about what the average patron can expect to save. 
 The bargain price is part of the archdiocese's effort to fend off competition from crematories and private cemeteries. It has advertised on the radio and in parish bulletins, made presentations at churches and started filming a video on Christian funerals in conjunction with the local Catholic cable channel. The message is this: Because the body is considered sacred, burial in a Catholic cemetery is the church's preferred way of disposing of the faithful.
Five years ago, the cremation rate among Catholics in the Boston area began rising. With about a quarter of all deaths in Massachusetts now resulting in a trip to the crematory, the increase was enough to make Cardinal Bernard F. Law take notice.
"What he was concerned about was that people were being forced into cremation for economic reasons," said Anthony Rizzuto, a deacon who heads the archdiocese's cemeteries and burial services.
So last year, the archdiocese began converting parts of four of its cemeteries into more affordable burial plots. The reduced price comes from the design. For example, the grave markers are flat, so a lawn mower can run over them easily, reducing maintenance costs. 
Although Catholics are not refused a burial if they cannot afford to pay, offering lower cost plots is a way of recognizing that it can be expensive to follow church doctrine.
"That's an excellent way to approach this," said the Rev. Patrick J. Pollard, director of Catholic cemeteries for the Diocese of Chicago. "We're not only saying we believe in this as the proper way for burial, but we're going to support you in this."
In the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, above-ground interment is getting similar promotion.
"Because land is becoming more scarce, we are looking at pricing our crypts to make those more affordable," said James M. Tixier, director of Catholic cemeteries in Los Angeles. "At some point, cemeteries will eventually fill up." 
The Chicago diocese has not resorted to discounting, but Father Pollard has been educating Catholics about proper burial for years, helping to keep business stable. 
Father Pollard said many Catholics knew a good deal about Catholic burial. "Any time we attempt to teach," he said, "we're often times simply reminding people."
But what if Catholics still opt for cremation? Mr. Rizzuto is dealing with that as well. In addition to the new burial plots, Catholic cemeteries in Haverhill and Salem, Mass., are displaying new columbaria, stone edifices that hold 80 to 90 urns each. 
Cremation has always been a tricky subject for the Catholic Church. Before Bruno Brunetti, an Italian professor, introduced his cremation chamber at the Vienna Exposition in 1873, burial had been the only accepted method of disposition for some 1,500 years. But cremation quickly caught on, promoted by Protestant clergymen who wanted to reform burial practices and doctors concerned about the health risks associated with cemeteries. 
Once banned for Catholics, cremation is now allowed if it is done in keeping with the church's respect for the body. Remains must be buried in a grave or placed in a columbarium. 
While bishops in the United States have worked to make the rules on Christian burial clearer, explaining them to the bereaved can be a challenge. In Boston, Mr. Rizzuto has also been trying to reintroduce some of the funeral vigils and rituals that are sometimes passed over as old-fashioned or unnecessary by the bereaved. Once he finishes the instructional video, Mr. Rizzuto is considering filming a multipart documentary on the history of burial for Boston Catholic Television. 
"You can trace the roots all the way back to the first century and beyond," he said.
One important moment in burial history, Mr. Rizzuto pointed out, was Vatican II, which determined that Catholics could be buried in non-Catholic cemeteries as long as the graves were blessed. 
"The intent was to be more accommodating to people," Mr. Rizzuto said. "An unintended effect was to open up the Catholic cemeteries to competition."
Indeed, for several years the archdiocese's cemeteries -- with a budget of about $8 million a year -- have been losing money. When Mr. Rizzuto was hired three years ago, he began to standardize record-keeping and procedures among the local Catholic cemeteries, which he said had been "all over the map." 
"We had to take a look at our pricing structures, our maintenance and upkeep and what our cemeteries look like competitively," he said.
As he slipped into the occupational parlance, he admitted, "we are constantly walking the tightrope between business and ministry."
But the goal, Mr. Rizzuto said, is more about bringing a community of faith together than improving the bottom line, and so far the response has been good.
"People are coming and telling us they heard about the programs, or they were driving by and saw the billboard on the side of the cemetery," he said, adding that one family had just signed up for nine plots. "I think people are starting to notice."

The woman has accused her brother-in-law of raping her. He has not been charged. A4

Killings in Israeli Settlement
Two gunmen slipped into a heavily guarded Jewish settlement south of Jerusalem and shot six people, killing two. One attacker was slain and the other escaped, an Israeli military spokeswoman said. Earlier, Israeli forces swept into Palestinian-controlled towns in the West Bank, firing machine guns and making arrests in what the army said were raids for wanted militants. The sweeps came on the eve of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. A8

HEADLINE: A California Downtown Is Poised for a Comeback 

BYLINE:  By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: FRESNO, Calif., June 1 

 BODY:
At high noon on a shirt-sleeve Saturday, one of the oldest downtown pedestrian malls in the country is as quiet as Christmas morning.
 The shops at the 38-year-old Fulton Street Mall -- a bridal salon here, a jewelry store there -- are open, but the pedestrians are not here, or anywhere else downtown. In what was once a jam-packed Chinatown, buildings are boarded up, streets are nearly empty, and a lone cyclist on a beat-up Schwinn is king of the road. 
 But looks are deceiving.
Fresno's Triple A baseball team, the Grizzlies, are not playing, and the new 12,500-seat stadium that draws crowds for every home game, snarling the streets with traffic, is momentarily idled. 
The crews building a $120 million federal courthouse and a $200 million medical center smack in the middle of downtown are off for the weekend. Work on a $50 million office tower that will bring at least 1,100 new jobs has yet to start.
For too long, the streets of downtown Fresno have had that sad, toothless look of so many downtowns in midsize cities across the country. Like so many of those cities, Fresno has tried to lure business and commerce back, only to find that an aging downtown could not compete with the corporate parks and hermetically sealed shopping centers on the edge of town. But these days, this city of about 430,000 has the buzz of an underdog political campaign on a roll. Banners proclaim, "Welcome Back! Downtown Fresno," reflecting an optimism evident among the people who live and work here.
"Fresno is truly the new frontier of California," said Mayor Alan Autry. "Downtown is the heart and soul of that new frontier."
The city plans to spend $30 million over the next eight years to entice businesses and create thousands of jobs. Mayor Autry has such confidence in the strategy that he spent more energy in his State of the City speech on Friday discussing anti-terrorism efforts and his reasons for wanting to overhaul the 80,000-student school system.
The Grizzlies stadium is not the only reason people here believe that a downtown rebirth might actually take place this time. Other cities have bet on downtown stadiums, only to have their hopes dashed by fans who get right back on the highways when the game is over.
The Grizzlies stadium, home to the Pacific League farm club of the San Francisco Giants, has indeed prompted interest among developers. But what helps is that rents in downtown Fresno -- 187 miles southeast of San Francisco -- are generally half of those for offices in north Fresno, where much of the development here has taken place over the last decade. The Downtown Task Force, a group of elected officials and community leaders, has made sure that government agencies follow federal and state mandates that they seek space in a city's downtown before looking elsewhere. Those mandates paved the way for the new tower that will house offices for the state transportation agency and the Internal Revenue Service.
"This is the first midrise building to go up in downtown Fresno in 25 years," said Tom Richards, a long-time Fresno resident whose company, the Penstar Group, is the developer for the new tower. 
By all rights, the city should be better off than it is. Fresno is the heart of the fast-growing San Joaquin Valley, home of some of the richest farmland in the world.
But rich soil does not translate into a healthy economy. Seasonal farm work means Fresno County has one of the nation's highest unemployment rates -- about 15 percent in a good month. The low-paying, back-breaking farm jobs also mean high poverty rates and health care costs. Air pollution, in part from agribusiness, is so bad that the San Joaquin Valley ranks as among the worst in the country. 
Even though it is not quantifiable, Fresno suffers from a low opinion of itself. Residents seem to reflexively apologize, or crack a self-deprecating joke, when they say -- if they say -- they come from here.
But that is changing too.
"I've always liked Fresno," said Tiffany Gomez, a 25-year-old native raising two daughters within walking distance of the Fulton Mall. 
Martin J. Hansen, president of Aegis Bancorp, a Bakersfield-based company that assists businesses with mergers and acquisitions, said that when he was looking to expand his business, he chose Fresno. "It's the largest untapped market in California," he said.
One of the most ambitious plans for downtown is to resurrect the 15 blocks of Chinatown.
The neighborhood is spotted with bars and prostitute hangouts. But it has its bright spots, like Central Fish, a market and restaurant that serves as many as 500 lunches on a busy day, and the Chinatown Jazz Festival, which takes place every September.
Kathy Omachi, the vice president of Chinatown Revitalization Inc., said the hopes were that Chinatown would become a tourist destination, like the old town section of Sacramento, but also a real community.
On this afternoon, not far from the empty downtown, a fair featuring food, a band and pony rides was under way on the grounds of Fresno's visitor center, and the talk was all about the Grizzlies and the team's new ballpark.
"The park-- great. The team -- well, they need some work," Jason Orlando, a 20-year-old student at Fresno State, said of the 21-34 Grizzlies.
Another student, Alexa Hidalgo, 19, said: "Now we've got a beautiful stadium downtown. But there's a long way to go." 
She was talking about the Grizzlies, but her words could be applied to downtown as well.

HEADLINE: Pope Selects Cardinal Egan To Serve on Top Vatican Court 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. WAKIN 

 BODY:
Pope John Paul II has named Cardinal Edward M. Egan to the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, the Roman Catholic Church's highest court, a sign of the Vatican's confidence in him even as his diocese is embroiled in the priest sex-abuse scandal.
 The appointment is also a recognition of the cardinal's expertise in church law. Cardinal Egan, a canon lawyer who will remain the archbishop of New York, was one of five new cardinals placed on what functions as the church's supreme court. Among its duties, the court hears appeals on procedural grounds of decisions by the lower court, the Roman Rota, including the removal of priests from the priesthood. 
 Such removals, called laicizations, could become more common after next week. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops will meet to consider new guidelines on dealing with priests who sexually abuse minors. The proposed guidelines call for the laicization of any priest who has committed more than one act of abuse of a minor in the past.
The Archdiocese of New York has suspended at least nine priests who have been accused of abuse, though their final status is still undetermined. Cardinal Egan has come under criticism for how he handled abuse allegations before coming to New York while he was bishop of Bridgeport, but church experts said the appointment showed he still had the confidence and support of the pope.
"It's an honor, very definitely, to be named," said the Rev. Arthur Espelage, executive coordinator of the Canon Law Society of America. "He has been under the gun, I read in the papers. But yes, I think Cardinal Egan has the credentials and the experience in the canonical world to take a place at the table and do credible work."
Cardinal Egan learned of the appointment, which was announced by the Vatican on Thursday, a month ago. But it was likely that Vatican officials had been thinking of him in the position last year, after he and the latest group of cardinals were named and before the scandal emerged, said Msgr. David M. O'Connell, the president of the Catholic University of America.
"It's conceivable that if some pressing matter would argue against his appointment, that would have been brought to the attention of the Roman authorities," Monsignor O'Connell said. The appointment is also important because it puts an American voice on the court, he said.
Cardinal Egan has a doctorate in canon law and served as a judge on the Rota for 12 years. He helped prepare a revision of the church's law code, and briefed the pope on it. 
Joseph Zwilling, the spokesman for the archdiocese, said that the added duty would not mean more trips to Rome for the cardinal. "Much of the work can be done via the work being sent to him, and he can review it and render an opinion," Mr. Zwilling said.
Along with hearing appeals on procedural grounds in lower court cases, the Signatura also makes judgments on administrative matters, like whether a bishop acted properly in removing a pastor from a parish or in closing parishes, Father Espelage said. It does not have authority over doctrine, liturgy or canonizations.
The other cardinals whom John Paul named to the high court are prominent, including Jozef Glemp, the primate of Warsaw; Agostino Cacciavillan, a former Vatican representative to the United States and now president of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See, which manages Vatican finances and investments; Sergio Sebastiani, a former Rota judge and now president of economic affairs for the Vatican; and Walter Kasper, an influential theologian.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Index Goes From an Aha to a Hmm 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence has been a mainstay of economic forecasting for more than 25 years. Alan Greenspan invokes it as a source of strength for the struggling economy. Wall Street traders buy or sell on each squiggle in the consumer confidence indexes. Politicians, economists, corporate executives, journalists all count on it to make the recovery work.
 But now a growing number of researchers and economists say that consumer confidence may be a phantom concept, an attempt to quantify a state of mind that does not exist. The much-watched indexes may not capture mood swings that lead to more or less spending, they argue, but only such down-to-earth concerns as how much the next pay check will be and whether it will still be arriving six months from now. 
 "The fact is there is just sheer randomness in consumer spending," said Sydney Ludvigson, a New York University economist and the co-author of one of the critical studies. "No index or statistic is the silver bullet that anticipates consumption." 
For those hoping for a quick economic recovery, that is disconcerting. The nation's two main consumer confidence indexes have been rising lately, encouraging many on Wall Street and in Washington to believe that optimistic consumers will revive the economy, even though actual consumer spending has been wavering. The surveys on which these indexes are based ask questions that are supposed to capture willingness to spend. In a nation that runs on consumer spending, that is a claim that has elevated the indexes to the reputation of major tools in forecasting the rise and fall of the economy.
Richard T. Curtin, the director of the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumer Sentiment, the granddaddy of the nation's two established monthly consumer confidence indexes, maintains that his index "foretells swings in the economy." Still, even he conceded that "if you want to really predict consumption, you would be better off using the details in the survey rather than the overall measure."
There is more information, Mr. Curtin said, in the answers from a cross section of the population to individual survey questions about income, unemployment, interest rates, inflation and plans to buy cars, homes, appliances and the like.
Complicating matters, American spending patterns are much more varied now than they were in the early years after World War II, when the first consumer confidence index was born at Michigan. That early index assumed the existence of a typical, average consumer, one whose mood and propensity to spend could be fathomed in a survey. That typical consumer was more likely to have existed in the 40's than today, Mr. Curtin said. "People were more focused on their jobs and wages."
Today all sorts of other factors figure into spending and interfere with consumer confidence as a national concept. Some people base their spending decisions on their wages, while others are governed by job security or the value of their stock portfolios and homes, or interest rate fluctuations, or their willingness to accumulate debt, particularly through credit cards, which did not exist in the 1940's.
And there is income inequality, which has increased since the 1970's and has affected the consumer confidence surveys, says Nicholas S. Souleles, an economist at the Wharton School of Business. Analyzing the Michigan survey data over 20 years, he found that low-income households constantly and optimistically overestimated their future incomes, while upper-income people swung from optimism in expansions to pessimism in downturns.
"You really have to look at individual households," Mr. Souleles said, "and not at some representative, average consumer. That no longer works."
Rather than concern themselves with the composite index, companies that use the surveys in their marketing efforts do focus mainly on the answers to individual questions. The overall index was an afterthought, a single number first published in 1952, six years after the surveys began. (The other major index is compiled by the Conference Board, a research group supported by companies.) The surveys were the brainchild of George Katonah, a Hungarian-born economist and psychologist who conceived of consumer confidence and organized the surveys at Michigan in the late 1940's, the goal being to capture the shifting optimism and uncertainty that in his view governed consumer spending.
Mr. Katonah, who died in 1980, also thought up the first overall index, by averaging the answers to several questions. Embracing the Katonah model, the Conference Board started its index in 1967, and the two index numbers gradually became the public face of consumer confidence, a headline number that draws quick reactions from politicians, journalists and Wall Street. As a measure of their importance, the Federal Reserve gets the monthly numbers before their public release.
All this attention to the composite index makes Mr. Curtin uneasy, he says. As Mr. Katonah's student, disciple and successor, Mr. Curtin would prefer more public interest in the individual survey questions, which do help to foreshadow future home buying and auto sales, for example, and do shed light on public expectations about inflation.
"I must admit that I view the consumer confidence index as a mixed blessing," Mr. Curtin said last month during a Princeton University symposium that explored the strengths and shortcomings of the two major indexes, drawing on the research of a handful of scholars who have been delving into their accuracy and meaning in recent years. What the new research has concluded is that the consumer confidence indexes turn out to be much better at predicting ups and downs in the employment numbers than what they are supposed to predict: swings in spending.
Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board economist, still stands by the measures. People go home and watch a little television news, he said, and they also talk to neighbors and friends and they know their own situations, particularly their job situations.
"These streams of information merge, and people pick up that something is going on, that things are getting better or worse," Mr. Goldstein explained. "When we ask our survey questions, we get the direction. We are getting a kind of pure pulse beat."
Both Mr. Goldstein and Mr. Curtin say that their indexes accurately predict swings in the gross domestic product, a government measure that tracks expansions and contractions in the economy.
But Dean Croushore, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, who is preparing yet another study of the indexes, says they often gyrate after an expansion or a recession has begun, not before. "Look at the charts," he said. "The biggest drops in the indexes are after recessions have begun."
Yet ascertaining which comes first, the economic swing or the index swing, is not as straightforward as it might seem. Researchers have been comparing the confidence indexes to data that has been updated and revised over a five-year period. Sometimes an initial report that the economy expanded in a quarter is later revised to a contraction. Consumer spending data has gone through similar revisions. Would the indexes look more omniscient if they were superimposed on initial data; that is, the information people had available to them when they were surveyed? Mr. Croushore is trying to answer this question.
Whatever the shortcomings of the consumer confidence indexes, nearly all the researchers agree that when combined with other data, they provide some additional information in forecasting consumption. "Let's suppose that we are going to forecast consumption growth without using the confidence indexes," Mr. Croushore said. "Forecasters have used past consumption, past income, past changes in interest rates and past returns to the stock market, up to the day of the forecast. Suppose we forecast with that, and then we add consumer confidence to the model. If you use both confidence indexes, then you can improve your forecast by about 13 percent for consumer spending."
That may satisfy the purists but not all those counting on consumer confidence for a recovery.

HEADLINE: Washington Approves Grants to Entice People to Lower Manhattan 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has given final approval to a $306 million program that will provide grants to residents of Lower Manhattan and pay for job training programs at small and medium-sized companies downtown, Mel Martinez, the secretary of housing and urban development, said yesterday.
 The residential assistance program is intended to encourage residents who live below Canal Street to remain there and to attract new residents to the area. The grants will vary in size, depending on a household's proximity to ground zero, with a maximum of $14,500 over two years. 
 Applications for the program will be accepted beginning late in the summer, and the grants are likely to be paid in September, state and federal officials said. 
In approving the $280.5 million housing program, however, federal officials failed to approve a $10 million portion intended to further compensate residents of Battery Park City for the loss of services and access to their homes after the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center and for the loss in value of their properties.
Matthew Higgins, a spokesman for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which submitted the grant program to the housing department for approval, said the corporation was still working out details for that part of the request.
"We anticipate approval by the time the program is implemented in late summer," he said.
Mr. Martinez said that in the future the department would probably approve more assistance, perhaps including some low-cost housing, for downtown residents. But the initial program was necessary to keep people from leaving the area, he said.
"All of the plans are not in place down here," Mr. Martinez said in an interview after the announcement. "I think that construction of affordable housing should be part of the equation."
Mr. Martinez made the announcement at a news conference on Liberty Street, at the edge of ground zero, with a half-dozen city and state officials.
The $306 million package also includes $10 million for the job training program, available to companies south of 14th Street with fewer than 500 employees. That program, which pays for 50 percent of training costs, is expected to provide assistance for 5,000 people. 
An additional $350,000 was approved to pay for the installation of an interim memorial at Battery Park; that memorial includes the damaged sculpture that was in the trade center's plaza. An additional $15 million was approved for administration of the residential program and others.
The program offers grants of 30 percent of the monthly rent or mortgage payment, maintenance and tax payments, up to $12,000 over two years, to residents nearest the trade center, south of Chambers Street and west of Nassau and Broad Streets; and up to $6,000 over two years to other residents south of Canal Street or Rutgers Street. Those residents must make a commitment to remain downtown for two years.
In addition, all residents of an area north of Canal Street, south of Delancey and Kenmare Streets and east of Lafayette Street who lived there on Sept. 11 and continue to do so will receive a $1,000 grant.
Families in all three zones with one or more children under the age of 18 are eligible for a family grant if they commit to remain for at least one year; those in the zone closest to ground zero are eligible for $1,500 and all others for $750.
The program has drawn criticism because, unlike many housing grant programs, it offers the highest grants to families that are very well off. In most of the zone closest to the disaster site, the median household income is above $100,000.
Last week, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation approved the hiring of four companies to administer the program and set up outreach programs to assist residents in applying for the grants.
The companies are Concera Corporation, a unit of FleetBoston Financial, which will provide general administration and grant distribution; I.B.M., which will provide mapping services to help certify buildings for inclusion in the program; and Asian Americans for Equality and the New York Association for New Americans, community groups that will provide community outreach and translation services.

HEADLINE: New Questions On Handling Of Power Prices In California 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Xcel Energy, a power company based in Minneapolis, has sent documents to federal regulators suggesting that three big competitors -- Mirant, Duke Energy and the Williams Companies -- may have schemed to drive up the price of power in California.
 The documents are part of Xcel's response to a demand by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that 150 energy companies disclose whether their traders used any of the market manipulation techniques outlined by Enron lawyers in memos that were released last month. 
 Xcel sent transcripts of several phone conversations that took place in 2000 between one of its traders and a counterpart at Southern Company Energy Marketing, now Mirant, where tactics to overschedule power were discussed. Overscheduling the amount of power that is needed in a market helps drive up prices. In one conversation, the two unidentified traders said Williams and Duke were among companies that routinely manipulated the weaknesses of the California market to increase prices. 
Paul J. Bonavia, president of Xcel's trading business, said that Xcel had no way of determining whether Mirant, Williams and Duke actually used such practices and that the trader who talked about them left the company a year ago. Xcel released the transcript, Mr. Bonavia said, because the company understood FERC's request for information to be broad, covering anything pertinent to possible price manipulation. 
"We're not pointing the finger at other companies," he said, "but we feel we're under a duty from FERC to respond fully and we responded fully."
The companies vigorously denied any improper behavior in California.
Williams said in a written statement: "Williams did not engage in any Enron-style trading. We have meticulously reviewed thousands and thousands of documents, reams of data and conducted dozens of personal interviews and Williams is certain that what we have told FERC is the truth. The Xcel document that you refer to sounds like employees' talk around a water cooler."
A Duke spokesman, Bryant Kinney, said: "We told FERC we had not participated in any of the activities described in the Enron memo. All we can do is stand on what we said."
James Peters, a spokesman for Mirant, said: "There is nothing new here. We have said we acted appropriately."
Bad news continued to batter the energy sector yesterday, further eroding confidence in the business of buying and selling electricity. Moody's Investors Service lowered its ratings on $13 billion of Williams's secured debt. The rating is now one notch above junk levels.
Also yesterday, the El Paso Corporation, Williams and Duke confirmed that they had received informal requests for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission about trades that may have inflated revenue without any other economic benefit, so-called round-trip or wash trades. The companies have said that they did not engage in such trades or any that may have manipulated power prices in California.
Duke, based in Charlotte, N.C., has conceded that its financial statements over the last three years included $1 billion in revenue from trades that had no economic benefit. But the company said the trades accounted for less than 1 percent of its revenue over that period and were done to "validate real-time prices," not inflate revenue.
Shares of Williams fell 23 cents, to $8.70. Duke fell 68 cents, or 2.2. percent, to $30 on concerns about the S.E.C. inquiry. Shares of El Paso fell 94 cents, or 4 percent, to $22.30.
On Tuesday, FERC threatened to strip Williams, El Paso and two other energy traders of their ability to charge unregulated rates for electricity because it found their responses to inquiries about their strategies in California inadequate.
An Xcel unit, the Public Service Company of Colorado, did participate in wash trades with Reliant Resources. Xcel itself denied using any of the schemes described in the Enron memos about price manipulation, although it indicated that it might have unwittingly participated in one. One of its traders at Public Service of Colorado discussed various arrangements with a counterpart at Southern Company Energy Marketing, but Xcel said it had found no evidence that the company actually did trades based on their ideas.
The company said it routinely recorded traders' phone calls in case questions emerged about deals. In several transcripts of conversations that took place in 2000 between the Xcel trader and a Mirant trader, they discussed overscheduling power into the California market: "11 through 20 we're going to overschedule the load," the Xcel trader says to his Mirant counterpart in one conversation on Oct. 4, 2000, using trader shorthand to talk about the power demand they wanted to schedule. It is unclear whether the plans the traders discussed were carried out.
Mirant has said that it overscheduled the need for power in California with the full knowledge of state regulators to obtain a fair price for electricity. The company maintained that the California utilities understated their need for power in the market to keep prices low. 
In the last transcript of the filing, an Xcel trader and one from another company discuss penalties California regulators had just issued over manipulation of power prices. The arrangement traders may have used is described in garbled language, but Mr. Bonavia said it appeared that they were describing the creation of artificial congestion on transmission lines. In its memos, Enron described arrangements for scheduling demand for power on tight transmission paths on the California grid, thus creating congestion. Then the companies would be paid for generating power or sending it another direction to relieve the congestion.
One trader says: "Williams and Duke do that all the time. They overschedule a load at SP. So they create tons of congestion because they have all that generation in CP 26." The abbreviations are for zones where power becomes badly bottlenecked on the California grid.
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis of California, said the transcripts indicated that price manipulation and those who might have practiced it were widely known in the energy trading industry but that FERC was indifferent. 
"This isn't the second shoe to drop; it's the 15th shoe to drop," he said. "FERC needs to step up to the plate and do its job. They're supposed to be a cop on the beat here and they were off getting doughnuts."

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about documents on energy trading in California, sent to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Xcel Energy, a power company based in Minneapolis, misstated the name of one company whose ability to charge unregulated rates for electricity has been threatened by the commission. It is El Paso Electric. (The El Paso Corporation is unrelated.)

HEADLINE: Crime 

BYLINE:  By Marilyn Stasio 

 BODY:
Time is cruel to the characters in a James Lee Burke novel. The more they struggle to leave the past behind and move on, the more they become mired in family history, compelled to relive their childhood traumas and pay for their fathers' crimes. Burke treats his favorite theme with unusual depth and considerable sorrow in JOLIE BLON'S BOUNCE (Simon & Schuster, $25) by linking two savage rape-murders in a Louisiana bayou town with the casual sexual sadism once practiced on the plantation of the town's most prominent family. Deputy Dave Robicheaux of the Iberia Parish Sheriff's Department works hard on his reputation as "a violent, unstable and dangerous man" by focusing his enraged reaction to the crimes on the plantation's former overseer. "I think he's evil," Robicheaux says of this man with the biblical name of Legion. "I don't mean bad. I mean evil, in the strictest theological sense."
 No question about it, Legion is one of Burke's finest villains -- a creature of immense force, fueled by pure malignancy, but not without the shred of humanity that makes a monster memorable. If Robicheaux is confounded by Legion, it's because he reminds him of another tormented soul he knows well, "a violent creature who rose with me in the morning and lived quietly inside my skin." The man he calls "the real enemy." 
 "So what's up with Florida?" Tim Dorsey has been kicking that question around in four insanely funny novels without coming up with a definitive answer. But if he has yet to determine what makes schoolteachers, bank tellers, rocket scientists and other good citizens go bad when they relocate to the citrus state, he has grown more manic in his zeal to satirize their outlandish behavior. In TRIGGERFISH TWIST (Morrow, $24.95), he herds a representative group of cutups into one ill-fated street in suburban Tampa ("You're going to love Tampa," one transplanted Midwesterner misinforms his wife) and sets in ecstatic motion the cataclysmic events that will end on the Fourth of July with the entire neighborhood in chaos.
So what is up with Florida, anyway? As the catalyst for the "wild parties, kidnappings, drunkenness, fast cars, deviant parlor games" and bizarre killings that make Triggerfish Lane such a pleasant place to live, Dorsey's master trickster-criminal and Florida history savant, Serge A. Storms, has the answer. Pointing gloomily to the state's "special confluence of economic and social factors that are killing the roots of the communities," Serge predicts total moral meltdown -- even as he gleefully lights the match that sends Triggerfish Lane up in flames.
If WITHOUT FAIL (Putnam, $24.95) doesn't hook you on Lee Child, I give up. In what may be the best of Child's austere thrillers, Jack Reacher, a rootless ex-military cop who emerges from the shadows of his carefully guarded anonymity to play the series fix-it man, is given the assignment of his career: to assassinate the newly elected vice president. Well, not exactly. More accurately, a nervous official high up in the Secret Service wants him to figure out (just as "a security audit," you understand) how the V.P. might be killed. When Reacher and a female confederate obligingly illustrate, the Secret Service contact reveals what Reacher has already surmised -- that a serious assassination plot is under way and must be foiled, even if it means going all the way out of town to Wyoming.
Because Reacher is a hero-for-hire with little back-story baggage to haul around, every book offers virgin territory for Child to explore. Here it's the covert operations of the federal government's offices of internal security, whose arcane procedures and eerily detached personnel are every bit as baffling as the assassination conspiracy. (To one special agent, the crux of the matter reduces to an infernal "math puzzle.") As the ultimate outsider, Reacher brings a fresh, if cynical, perspective to a world that he never made -- and can't wait to escape.
Lyn Hamilton's archaeological mysteries follow a formula sure to have armchair travelers on the edge of their settees. At once erudite and entertaining, these jaunty whodunits tag along after Lara McClintoch, a Toronto antiques dealer whose quest for ancient artifacts takes her everywhere from Africa to Ireland. In her sixth series adventure, THE ETRUSCAN CHIMERA (Berkley Prime Crime, $22.95), a commission from a reclusive collector sends Lara to Tuscany in search of a 2,500-year-old hydria, a painted water vessel depicting a mythological beast with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of a snake -- an apt description of some of the ruthless dealers competing with Lara for this prize. Although these shady characters tend to come and go through sheer serendipity in the unlikely murder plot, Lara's persistent pursuit of the hydria -- through the very heart of Tuscany, into Etruscan hill towns like Volterra, Arezzo and Cortona -- provides the itinerary for a journey that is every bit as magical as the elusive chimera.
The metaphorical fires in Earl Emerson's VERTICAL BURN (Ballantine, $24.95) are the ones that flare up in Lt. John Finney's belly when he is ostracized by fellow firefighters in the Seattle Fire Department for leaving a crew member to die in a burning warehouse. After being branded as the arsonist in a second suspicious fire, Finney realizes he is being set up to take the fall for the main event, a devastating blaze in Seattle's tallest skyscraper, the 76-story Columbia tower, that singes the pages with its descriptive narrative heat. Emerson convinces us that fighting fires builds character; but drama beats out theory when he sends his hero into an inferno with 50 pounds of protective gear, 30 pounds of firefighting equipment and a single bottle of compressed air emitting worrisome warning sounds. Emerson, himself a veteran firefighter, deserves a medal both for walking us so coolly through the technical drill of the job and for taking us inside the hermetic subculture of the men and women who do this dangerous work for a living.

HEADLINE: You Know That Space-Time Thing? Never Mind 

BYLINE:  By George Johnson; George Johnson contributes science articles to The Times. His new book, "A Shortcut Through Time," will be published next year.

 BODY:
 A NEW KIND OF SCIENCE
By Stephen Wolfram.
Illustrated. 1,263 pp. Champaign, Ill.:
Wolfram Media. $44.95.
 AMONG a small group of very smart people, the publication of "A New Kind of Science," by Stephen Wolfram, has been anticipated with the anxiety aroused in literary circles by, say, Jonathan Franzen's recent novel, "The Corrections." For more than a decade, Wolfram, a theoretical physicist turned millionaire software entrepreneur, has been laboring in solitude on a work that, he has promised, will change the way we see the world. Adding to the suspense, the book has been announced and withdrawn as the artist returned to his garret to tinker, ignoring the bad vibes and hexes cast by jealous colleagues hoping to see him fall flat on his face. 
Now, weighing in at 1,263 pages (counting a long, unpaginated index) and 583,313 words, the book could hardly be more intimidating. But that is the price one pays for a first-class intellectual thrill. While experimenting with a simple computer program 20 years ago, Wolfram stumbled on something rather eerie: "the beginning of a crack in the very foundations of existing science." Ever since, he has been following it deeper as it widens into a crevasse.
The normal thing would have been to dispatch regular reports from the field -- unreadable papers published in fashionable zines like Physical Review Letters or Physica D. Instead, Wolfram decided to do what Darwin did (and he would not shun the comparison). He is springing loose his vision all at once, in a book intended for nonscientists and scientists alike. 
From the very beginning of this meticulously constructed manifesto, the reader is presented with a stunning proposal: all the science we know will be demolished and reassembled. An ancient error will be corrected, one so profoundly misguided that it has led science down the wrong avenue, until it is approaching a cul-de-sac. The mistake (as everyone who hated calculus will be happy to hear) is trying to capture the richness of the universe with mathematical equations -- Newton's, Maxwell's, Einstein's. All are based on an abstract, perhaps dubious idea -- that time and space form a seamless continuum. Whether dealing with an inch or a second, you can chop it in half and the half in half, ad infinitum. Thus things can be described with unlimited, infinitesimal precision. 
This conceit works fine for simple phenomena like a planet's trajectory around the sun or a weight falling from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. But as scientists try to explain systems of greater complexity -- a hurricane, the economy of Portugal, a human or even a reptilian brain -- the calculations become ever more elaborate until one is left with an unwieldy array of symbols that do not explain much at all. 
Wolfram believes that even his own field, theoretical physics (he got a Ph.D. from Caltech when he was 20), suffers from the problem. Equations can capture characteristics of individual particles with breathtaking precision. But put three or four particles together and the complications begin to overwhelm. The problem, he proposes, is that equations are the wrong tool for the job. They should be replaced with computer programs -- more specifically, the little snippets of software called algorithms. 
That sounds absolutely ridiculous. Programs are just human inventions, marching orders for a machine. They serve well as a quick and dirty means of tricking a computer into approximating the smoothness of nature, roughing out reasonably good facsimiles of a scientist's perfect equations. But computers understand nothing but 1 or 0, with no gradations in between. Algorithms can mimic reality's grain as finely as the engineers can manage, but the simulation can never be as sharp as the real thing. 
Wolfram contends that this, the common wisdom, gets things upside down: the algorithm is the pure, elemental expression of nature; the equation is an artifice. That is because the continuum is a fiction. Time doesn't flow, it ticks. Space is not a surface but a grid. A world like this is best described not by equations but by simple step-by-step procedures. By computer programs.
The universal operating system Wolfram imagines is not something horribly complicated like Windows. The key idea in the book is that simple, byte-size programs have the surprising ability to produce endlessly intricate behavior. His most basic example is a group of elegant little algorithms with a clunky name: cellular automata. 
These have been kicking around in the popular science press for years. Start with a row of squares (the cells), some white and some black. Then transform the pattern according to a mindlessly simple rule. Here is an example: if either of a cell's neighbors is black, then make the cell itself black in the next round; otherwise, make it white. That is the whole program. Print each new generation below its progenitor and a pattern unfolds like a piano roll. Automate the procedure with a computer and watch what scrolls down the screen. 
Most of these experiments -- Wolfram has tried them all -- settle into numbing repetition, churning out the same configuration again and again. But every now and then a rule takes flight and soars. What Wolfram calls Rule 30 sounds about as dull as can be: if a cell and its right-hand neighbor are white, the next time around make the cell the same color as its left-hand neighbor is now; otherwise, make it the opposite. Apply the rule to a single black square and the pattern that emerges looks every bit as random as the snow on a television tuned to an empty channel. You have to see it to believe it, and Wolfram obliges with stunning illustrations (including the book's goldenrod endpapers, spattered with output from Rule 30). The implication is that some computation like this may be the engine of entropy in the universe.
Other rules have the opposite effect: seed them with a random jumble of cells and, after a few iterations, they begin generating complex order. Some of the output resembles intricately varied stalactites; some looks like tracks of colliding particles in a high-energy accelerator lab. Think of stars and galaxies emerging from the confusion of the Big Bang, or life from the primordial sea. 
Most pleasing to the eye are rules generating nested patterns like those of a crystal or a snowflake, or the markings on a seashell, the branching of a leaf, the spiral of a pine cone. Other patterns swirl like clouds, smoke or turbulent streams of water. 
Wolfram believes he has clinched the deal with what, for many scientists, will be the meat of the book: a proof that a simple cellular automaton can be programmed to perform any conceivable computation (making it equivalent to what the British mathematician Alan Turing called a universal computer). If you buy all this, then a simple algorithm like those described in the book could constitute the machine code of the universe, the platform on which all the other programs run. 
One idea after another comes spewing from the automata in Wolfram's brain. Maybe it is not evolution but algorithms that generate biological complexity. Maybe, if everything arises from computations, it makes perfect sense to think of the weather and the stock market as having minds of their own. Maybe free will is the result of something called "computational irreducibility" -- the fact that the only way to know what many systems will do is to just turn them on and let them run. 
All this is laid out clearly and precisely. Any motivated reader should be able to plow through at least a few hundred pages before the details become too burdensome. Then one can just marvel at the pictures. (It's evident why Wolfram, who adds depth to the term "control freak," published this work himself. Some illustrations contain hundreds of checkered cells per inch, requiring "careful sheet-fed printing on paper smooth enough to avoid significant spreading of ink.") 
Probably only scientists will read the 348 pages of notes (though these can be very amusing, providing us with Wolfram's thoughts on subjects like "clarity and modesty," "whimsy" and "writing style"). Many may already be thumbing through the index, whetting their knives. At least in the main text, Wolfram often gives the impression that he has the field -- sometimes called physics of computation -- all to himself. Some of his colleagues will find their work acknowledged in the notes; others may not. 
Yet Wolfram has earned some bragging rights. No one has contributed more seminally to this new way of thinking about the world. Certainly no one has worked so hard to produce such a beautiful book. It's too bad that more science isn't delivered this way.

 CONFESSIONS OF
A STREET ADDICT
By James J. Cramer.
339 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $26.
 IF you pay attention to the stock market, it's hard not to know something about James J. Cramer. His engaging face, flower-fresh and smiling when the great bull market began in 1982, is worn a bit by gravity, as attested by the close-cropped photograph on the cover of his book. The "confessions" of the title appears in print across his furrowed brow, as once he required subordinates to wear Post-its on their foreheads with reminders of their trading losses as badges of humiliation. But for all the strung-out, street-addict look that Cramer affects, there is still something in his baleful glare that pleads "Trust me!" We all know what that means on Wall Street. 
Cramer gained fame in the late 1980's as an enthusiast of stocks. The manager of a hedge fund, he appeared on Charlie Rose's show in 1989 to urge investors to sell the Nikkei at 38,000 and buy the Dow at 3,000 -- a brilliant call. He became a market guru, a fixture on programs like "Squawk Box" and "Good Morning America," famous for his keyboard-smashing rages. But Cramer doubled as a financial journalist, first for The New Republic, then for SmartMoney and New York magazine, finally as a founder of the Web site TheStreet.com. When TheStreet.com was riding high, he compared himself to the founder of Time magazine, Henry Luce. 
It was a pipe dream. Trading was Cramer's day job, not publishing. The techniques his hedge fund relied on to make money cut against his journalism at every turn. He wanted to be a great financier and a great journalist. By the time he quit his shrunken fund in late 2000, he was neither. He had become a strange hybrid, a kind of money-management performance artist.
The nature of the problem is laid out in the first chapter of "Confessions of a Street Addict." "When other 9-year-old kids bothered to look at a newspaper back in 1964," he begins, "they turned to the comic strips, or maybe the ball scores. But when my dad brought home that three-star Philadelphia Evening Bulletin, I . . . went right for the only section that has ever mattered to me: the business section, or more accurately, the stock tables." That's a born trader talking. His fifth-grade imaginary portfolio ran up a paper profit of $2 million, he says -- at a time when his father was pouring the family's savings into a famous black hole of the 60's called National Video.
Yet when Cramer goes to college, it is to the newspaper that he heads. He joins The Harvard Crimson and rises to the top. He even takes a couple of newspaper jobs after graduation, before moving on to law school. Then he becomes a stockbroker at Goldman Sachs. And because he is very good at picking stocks, he quits in early 1987 to start a hedge fund -- a pooled investment vehicle for the very wealthy, largely unregulated, whose operator is permitted to charge a management fee and take a hefty percentage of any gains. 
Soon Cramer is running more than $200 million, mostly for friends he made at Harvard. His formula for making money? Relatively simple: he works the phones, schmoozing analysts for the major investment banks and brokerage houses, trying to figure out what they will be recommending, in order to buy (or sell) ahead of the rush. He feeds them positive bits of news about companies whose stock he favors, talks down other shares. "We became merchants of the buzz," he writes. "We knew, cynically, that Wall Street was simply a promotion machine." In this account, that was the extent of the manipulation; when Nicholas W. Maier, an ex-employee, alleged insider trading in his recent memoir, "Trading With the Enemy," Cramer forced him to withdraw the charge. 
On the surface of it, exchanging information sounds like what a news reporter does. The reporter, too, trades tips with sources, keeps people talking by seeing to it that their names appear in print. But to the trader, movement in the market is all that matters, not direction -- or truth. As Cramer remarks, "Justice is an irrelevance in the stock market." 
Cramer got in trouble in 1995 for boosting small-cap stocks he owned in his SmartMoney column without disclosing his big ownership position. (An investigation concluded that he pumped but didn't dump -- not then anyway.) His reputation as a journalist damaged, he decided to start a new venture -- an online newspaper" that would track stocks in real time. After all, hadn't the Web changed everything? Why not beat news services like Dow Jones and Bloomberg at their own game? And so TheStreet.com was born. 
THE diminution of Cramer's hedge fund begins when his old law school chum Eliot Spitzer wants to get out -- the same Eliot Spitzer who today as attorney general of New York is reaming Wall Street for the misconduct of its analysts. Many other investors follow in the next five days. It is September 1998, the height of the Long-Term Capital Management crisis, and the nightmare run costs Cramer almost half the fund's assets. The rest of the story is one crisis after another. At the bottom of the market, Cramer writes a famous piece for TheStreet.com called "Get Out Now"; meanwhile, his wife (and partner) buys throughout the panic it helps create, and Cramer himself changes his mind the next day. Readers of TheStreet.com never forgive him. And when TheStreet.com's initial public offering finally comes, Cramer is outraged when underwriters permit speculators to take a play from his own book and "play the flip game."+The stock opens at an improbable $63 a share, goes to $70 and never reaches that height again. Cramer urges his father to dump all the stock he has been given. Ever the cluck, his father sells only half. 
The book ends with an "Anna Karenina"-like celebration of family life, coaching soccer, hanging out, everything but the dirty diaper. Cramer quits the hedge fund that he founded and announces that he's given up trading for journalism. He still makes frequent television appearances, and to reassure the viewing audience, his CNBC contract explicitly forbids his selling stocks that he discusses for at least one month -- whereupon his friend Mark Haines introduces him on the air as the Rev. JimBob of the Church of What's Happening in One Month. 
Throughout the book, Cramer complains that nobody believes him. He's right about that. I've never met him, but I've read his book. I don't believe him either. But I enjoy his act.

 BODY:
 TO THE HERMITAGE, by Malcolm Bradbury. (Overlook, $16.95.) This posthumous novel by Bradbury (1932-2000) employs two voyages -- that of an unnamed English novelist (the author's stand-in) on an academic junket to St. Petersburg, and that of the Enlightenment writer Denis Diderot to Russia in the 18th century -- to advance a wacky theory called postmortemism: that great writers are never really dead and buried, in either the physical or literary sense. "It's a wonderful conceit," James Shapiro said in the Book Review in 2001. "Bradbury breaks new ground" in the tale, including "a surprising final turn toward the elegiac."

THE LAST EMPIRE: Essays 1992-2000, by Gore Vidal. (Vintage International, $16.) In 48 wide-ranging essays on literary, cultural and political topics, from the Bill of Rights to Frank Sinatra to the novelists Dawn Powell and Sinclair Lewis, Vidal displays "a carefree touch and a humorous air," according to our reviewer, Paul Berman, who last year found the collection uneven but at its best "lively, instructive, lucid and amusing."

CARRY ME ACROSS THE WATER, by Ethan Canin. (Random House, $12.95.) This novel's 78-year-old protagonist, a former Pittsburgh brewery owner, has led a vital, eventful life, and as death approaches he finds himself vulnerable to sudden eruptions of memory, which arrive unbidden but not always unwelcome. Last year in these pages, Gary Krist admired the "complex, almost musical interplay of reminiscence and current experience."

FRANTZ FANON: A Biography, by David Macey. (Picador USA, $20.) The Martinique-born Fanon, a psychiatrist before becoming a spokesman for the Algerian uprising against French colonial rule, is portrayed as a fiery, reckless figure whose belief in the therapeutic value of violence -- given full throat in "The Wretched of the Earth" -- hasn't aged well, though much of what he wrote seems prescient today. "Macey has written a prodigiously researched, absorbing book about the mind and passion of a 20th-century revolutionary," Adam Shatz said here last year.

CHANCE IN THE HOUSE OF FATE: A Natural History of Heredity, by Jennifer Ackerman. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14.) Blending science writing with personal experience, a journalist explores the genetic links between humans and the rest of the world, and examines the history of research into heredity. "Tying together the famous and the forgotten, the microscopic and the vast," the result is "a sprawling but fascinating book," Christine Kenneally wrote here in 2001. Invisible Frontiers: The Race to Synthesize a Human Gene, by Stephen S. Hall (Oxford University, $15.95), is a 1987 account of the scramble by three teams of molecular biologists in the 1970's not only to clone the human insulin gene but to manufacture genetically engineered insulin for the marketplace. Our reviewer, Daniel J. Kevles, called this "an important and pioneering book, dealing with events of high scientific and economic consequence."

THE BOOK OF HAPPINESS, by Nina Berberova. (New Directions, $12.95.) Set in the years before and after the Russian Revolution, this passionately candid yet unsentimental novel about a woman's three defining love affairs is notable for its striking absence of irony as it allows people to speak ingenuously about the things that matter to them, including happiness. "Like Turgenev and Chekhov . . . Berberova (who died in 1993) is uncannily shrewd about romance, about its bright promise, without making her characters' real satisfactions seem trite," Adam Phillips wrote here in 1999.

A FORTUNE-TELLER TOLD ME: Earthbound Travels in the Far East, by Tiziano Terzani. (Three Rivers, $14.) An Italian journalist recounts his ground-level trek through Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar and other nations, where he was determined to consult every fortuneteller who crossed his path. "He's a first-rate raconteur, and once he gets moving -- by train, car or on foot -- he proves excellent company," Michael Upchurch wrote here in 2001.

THE HOLE, by Guy Burt. (Ballantine, $12.) What happens when five British teenagers allow themselves to be locked in a school cellar for three days as a prank, or, as the plan's mastermind puts it, "an experiment in real life"? Think "Lord of the Flies" meets "The Blair Witch Project." Last year our reviewer, King Kaufman, called this a "chilling" little novel "about that most elemental of human fears, being buried alive."

HEADLINE: Why the U.S. Will Always Be Rich 

BYLINE:  By David Brooks; David Brooks, a senior editor at The Weekly Standard, is the author of "Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There."

 BODY:
No nation on earth has ever tried as hard, and failed as utterly, in its efforts not to become rich as America has. From the start our great leaders have tried to steer us away from the pitfalls of great wealth. Thomas Jefferson campaigned against manufacturing and commerce, fearing we would become a nation of "gamblers" and "jugglers" who spent their lives performing "tricks with paper." John Adams was convinced that big money would lead to our downfall: "Human nature, in no form of it, could ever bear Prosperity."
 Almost all of our great thinkers and writers have joined the cause. The Transcendentalists railed against materialism. "Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity" was Henry David Thoreau's advice. Mark Twain lambasted the values of the Gilded Age. Thorstein Veblen ridiculed self-indulgent consumerism. Left-wing beatniks like Allen Ginsberg condemned the money-mad "Moloch whose mind is pure machinery," while conservative stuffed shirts like Henry Cabot Lodge warned that "the adoration of money is an ever-present peril." 
 "Keep out of mansions," our national poet Walt Whitman cautioned. "A mansion may be heaven on earth, but you might as well be dead." 
Everybody this side of Ayn Rand sympathizes. Great wealth leads to decadence and complacency, and hence to corruption and decay. And yet when it comes to leading the simple life, we are utter failures. We keep sprouting money -- old money, new money, accidental money, incidental money and self-hating money -- despite all the novels, folk songs, sermons and Bill Moyers specials that remind us that this is not what life is really all about.
The average household in America now pulls in about $42,000 a year. The average household headed by someone with a college degree makes $71,400 a year. A professional degree pushes average household income to more than $100,000. If you are, say, a member of one of those college-grad households with a family income of around $75,000, you probably make more than 95 percent of the people on this planet. You are richer than 99.9 percent of the human beings who have ever lived. You are stinking rich.
You may start the day with good intentions in your heart and one of those simplicity magazines by your side. You may tell yourself that today you are going to renounce material things. You're going to slow down and savor the moment. So you break out the seaside-scent candles, fill up the claw-foot tub with fluoridated water and tub tea, and just soak with a volume of Robert Frost in your hand and some brown-sugar-based body wash on the shelf. But then the bathroom renovation fantasies start crowding into your brain and along come the second-home longings. To really clear your mind, you realize, you need a country place in the Berkshires where you can get away from it all, and just a couple more big financial scores so you can carry that soul-saving second mortgage. And before long you are back in the land of desire. You've been sucked in by the alluring availability of increased earnings and the narcotic of potential capital gains. You have returned to the realm of buying and selling and earning and investing. And the sheer wealthiness of American life has swallowed you back up. 
There are now around seven million households in the U.S. with a net worth of more than a million dollars. But the affluence of the upper class isn't even the amazing thing. It's the affluence of middle-class life. The average new American home has grown from 1,500 square feet to about 2,200 square feet in a single generation. The average American family spends more than $2,000 a year on food from restaurants. According to Cotton Incorporated's magazine, Lifestyle Monitor, American women between the ages of 16 and 70 have, on average, seven pairs of jeans in their wardrobes. Nearly three-quarters of the new cars bought by Americans have cruise control and power door locks, and there will soon be more cars in this country than people. Americans altogether spend $40 billion a year on our lawns, an amount roughly equal to the entire federal tax revenue of India. 
This is a country where nobody bats an eye at teenagers with credit cards, administrative assistants going off to Lasik eye surgery or middle-class dog lovers taking their pooches to one of the nation's 600 certified pet chiropractors. With 6 percent of the world's population, the U.S. accounts for more than 30 percent of its total economic production. We're big earners. We're big spenders. We're huge borrowers. Risking sin and perdition, we're rich.
We all know what should happen next. The Roman Empire illustrated the life cycle of great nations. As the historian John Anthony Froude put it, "Virtue and truth produced strength, strength dominion, dominion riches, riches luxury, and luxury weakness and collapse." It's as inevitable as death. Nations grow to adulthood by virtue of their simplicity and fall to decay because they grow spoiled by comfort and ease.
It's what America's founders worried about 200 years ago. "Will you tell me how to prevent riches from becoming the effects of temperance and industry?" Adams asked Jefferson. "Will you tell me how to prevent luxury from producing effeminacy, intoxication, extravagance and folly?" It's what social critics worry about today, with books like "Luxury Fever," "The Overspent American" and so on and so on.
And yet, somehow, America has this amazing ability to not decline. America's history doesn't follow the normal life cycle of nations. American standards of living actually surpassed European standards of living around 1740. For about 260 years, in other words, America has been rich. And yet decline hasn't come; Gibbon would have nothing to write about here. American workers are still the most productive on earth, two-thirds more productive than our counterparts in Great Britain, for example. American technology is still the envy of the world, and her universities are the queens of learning. Three-quarters of the Nobel laureates in economics and the sciences over the past few decades live and work in the United States. Spending more on defense than the next 15 nations combined (while still devoting only around 3 percent of the G.D.P. to the military), America is now the undisputed great power of the globe. And as the Yale historian Paul Kennedy wrote recently in The Financial Times, never before in human history has the disparity between the world's greatest power and the next greatest power been so wide.
Moreover, despite all the social-critic jeremiads, Americans have shown this remarkable tendency to remain undecadent. Look, for example, at how we spend our money. Michael J. Weiss summarized the latest Consumer Expenditure Survey in the April issue of American Demographics. He reports that during the 1990's, which was the great fizzy decade of splendiferous stock-market returns and walloping prosperity, Americans spent less on just about every item on the Hugh Hefner/Larry Flynt/Maxim magazine/Robb Report repertory. Americans in 2000 spent less than they did 10 years earlier on steaks, martinis, cigars, jewelry, watches, furniture, toys and sound equipment. They spent less on entertainment and more on education, housing, transportation and computers. Americans spent 10 percent less on food in general (though baby boomers spent 15 percent more on fresh vegetables). Americans spent 14 percent less on clothing, the largest decline in any category, though they did spend 12 percent more on shoes. 
Overall, this is not a picture of a nation of orgiastic self-indulgence. Furthermore, despite all of our earnest resolutions, Americans are still terrible at languorous ease. We can't take a vacation for a week without bringing our laptops along, let alone laze away at health spas for weeks on end slicing sausages, the way the Germans do. American beaches still aren't Rio-style thong expos, nor are they southern European nudist zones, where 70-year-old women who grew up with corsets and propriety suddenly get the urge in advanced retirement to throw off the vestments of civilization and let the vein patterns protrude in the breeze. Despite leadership from the top, we haven't really learned to relax about adultery, and serious sex surveys do not depict a nation of serious kinkiness and sensuality. Picture a typical American man going on the Internet looking for some pornography. In a few minutes he can't help himself: he's clicked over to LendingTree.com and he's checking out the latest mortgage rates. His sexually bored wife bursts in on him with disgust etched in her voice: "What is it men have about refinancing? Can't you at least look at a few leather or barnyard sites and at least pretend to enjoy yourself?" 
The reason America hasn't been corrupted by all its wealth is that in this country we have transformed the nature of money. If you have enough of it, and you are sloppy enough with it, and if you have a system that promiscuously sloshes it around from the deserving to the undeserving and back again so that there are great flows of wealth oozing all over the place and great tales of opportunity in every ear, then pretty soon money is no longer just a thing you hoard in the bank. Money has become the environment, and that changes the way it affects people.
Money in America has been transformed into abundance. In the realm of money, money is scarce. But in the realm of abundance, money is promiscuous. And this environment of abundance comes with its own psychology, morality, sins and virtues. It does not create the old corrupting patterns described by the philosophers.
The abundance mentality starts with the unconscious premise that there exists, at all times, close by, a happy hunting ground, a valley where acres of diamonds are there for the picking. In the land of abundance, work is worth it, because it is often rewarded. In the land of abundance, a person's lower-class status is always temporary. If the complete idiot next door has managed to pull himself up to the realm of Lexus drivers, why shouldn't the same thing happen to you? 
The psychology of abundance explains why Americans are notoriously bad class warriors. They overestimate where their income puts them in the economic pecking order. (Most people think they are above average.) They exaggerate their future income prospects. And they perpetually, and not always unrealistically, sense the imminence of great wealth. In the land of abundance, there are all these wonderful spots just over the next hill, or with the next spouse, or with the next job opportunity, after the next deck renovation or lottery ticket, where all the dreams come true.
People who have money in the realm of abundance tend not to be miserly about it. Miserliness, much talked about in the ancient literature, is not a big American problem. Our national economic flaw, on the contrary, is personal debt. When money is a goo that flows and oozes, comes and goes, people are careless with it. "The American talks about money," George Santayana wrote, "because that is the symbol and measure he has at hand for success, intelligence and power; but as to money itself he makes, loses, spends and gives it away with a very light heart." 
The environment of abundance is found not just on Madison Avenue or on Rodeo Drive. It is also evident at Wal-Mart and Target and Kmart. Walk into one of those places and you're in middle-American nirvana. You can get absolutely everything you need for a wholesome, happy life.
You stand at one end of an aisle and look down the length of a Wal-Mart Super Center and you've got affordable plenty as far as the eye can see. There are glitter lava lamps, "The Prayer of Jabez" inspirational books, Inca-design polyester place mats, Secret Treasures see-through panties, schools of blue gourami in the fish department and DripMoist Vegetable Garden Soaker Systems in the garden department. You get a sense of the excitement the 18th-century French philosophes must have felt when they dreamed of putting all human knowledge into one encyclopedia. Here at Wal-Mart all human desires are organized, categorized and shelved -- available in one vast and friendly place, with ample parking.
Then you go over to one of those price club stores and you enter abundance on steroids. Here you can get laundry detergent in 40-pound tubs, 30-pound bags of frozen Tater Tots, frozen waffles in 60 serving boxes and packages with 1,500 Q-Tips -- which is 3,000 actual swabs since there's cotton on both ends. These stores have been constructed according to the modern American principle that there is no flaw in design and quality so grave that it can't be compensated for by mind-boggling quantity. The aisles here are wider than most country lanes. The shelves are packed from the linoleum floor clear up to the 30-foot fluorescently lighted ceiling with economy-size consumer goods. Sometimes you look up and consider what would happen if there was an earthquake right now. "Great," you think, "I'm going to be crushed to death under a landslide of falling juice boxes." 
The first time I went into one of these places and got a load of the size of the household-goods containers, I naturally wanted to see what kind of person would come here shopping for condoms. But what's really amazing is that wherever you go in a price club, everybody in every aisle is having the same conversation, which is about how much they are saving by buying in bulk. You overhear "If you use a lot, it really does pay . . . " or " . . . they never go bad, so you can keep them forever . . . " or " . . . it's nice to have this many popsicles, and someday we plan on having more kids anyway." All the people in all the aisles feel this profound satisfaction over what good deals they are getting as they pile the stuff into their shopping carts, which are practically the size of 18-wheelers with safety air bags for the driver. By the time they head toward the checkout registers, they look like the supply lines for Operation Overlord. 
Abundance really does seep into your soul. Even the people who are not blessed with big incomes are affected by it. One-sixth of the American population is part of the working poor, earning between $17,000 and $34,000 a year. Many of these people are just scraping by, shopping at Dollar General, very often without access to banks and health insurance, fearing the next layoff or illness. But still they breathe the air of plenitude. Some get seduced into consumption patterns they cannot afford and fall deeper and deeper into debt. But abundance also means that tomorrow could always be a brighter day. Minority groups, whose incomes remain below the national average, are far more confident than whites that their incomes will be higher in 10 years. 
And because there is so much income churning in the land of abundance, few families stay at the bottom or the top for very long. That means there is no sense of inherited hierarchy. There is no deference to one's supposed betters, and almost no sense that one should stay in "one's place." Every person, regardless of income, naturally considers himself superior to the rich jackasses with their McMansions. 
But the most obvious feature of the land of abundance is that people work feverishly hard and cram their lives insanely full. That's because the candies are all around, looking up and pleading to you, "Taste me, taste me, taste me." People in this realm live in a perpetual aspirational trance. They are bombarded from first waking to nighttime's last thought by images, messages, novelties, improvements and tales of wonder. The Range Rover ads with the mountain views, the perfect Maybelline models, the beautiful people on "Friends" and the cool gizmos on the latest DVD players all present themselves as brightly packaged visions of paradise.
In this way abundance electrifies and motivates. Life becomes a vectorial thrust toward perpetual gain and aspiration fulfillment. An indefinite diversity of activities awaits. In fact, it takes a force of willpower beyond the call of most ordinary people to renounce all this glorious possibility. Among abundance, it's harder to do without than to do with. So it's actually easier and more natural to work phenomenally long hours. People at the top of the income scale now work longer hours than people on the bottom. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the proportion of professional and managerial workers who work more than 50 hours a week has risen by more than a third since 1985. And it's not just workaholism that marks contemporary life, it's hobby-aholism, activity-aholism and fun-aholism and friend-aholism, and pretty soon you've got 18 places to be on Saturday and color-coded schedules on the family refrigerator. 
The electrified life of perpetual possibility has its downsides. Divorce rates have always been high in America, as people go off in search of the newer opportunity. People with dreams of abundance dancing in their heads but without the means to achieve them pick the high-risk and immoral roads of drug dealing and crime to get there. People live with time clocks thumping so loudly in their heads that they pull into the gas station strategizing about what they're going to do while the tank is filling up so as not to waste that precious 90 seconds.
But -- don't tell the professors -- it's not all dross, either. Many of the satisfactions, the little pieces of prosperity, the magical wonderlands are real. The great power of abundance is that it takes dreams that are aristocratic in nature and it makes them democratic in possibility. There's so much bounty that the life of ease and refinement is not just confined to the well born and well to do. There are plenty of heavens to go around, for Reader's Digest readers as well as Vanity Fair readers. 
The environment of abundance accounts for the energy, creativity and dynamism that marks national life. The lure of plenty, pervading the landscape, encourages risk and adventure. The more opportunity there is lying around, the more you'll risk to go for it and the less cost there is in going for it and failing. You just declare bankruptcy and move to the next valley. 
A phenomenal 8 percent of Americans have started their own businesses at one time or another. Even today, during the dot-com hangover, American venture-capital funds still dwarf the funds in other countries. There was an interesting study published in 2000 by Anisya S. Thomas and Stephen L. Mueller in the Journal of International Business Studies. Comparing entrepreneurialism across cultures, they found that innovative people are spread pretty evenly throughout the globe. But they also found that people in the United States are more likely to feel that they are in control of their own destinies, and more comfortable with the idea of taking a risk, than people in any of the nine other nations studied. 
In the land of abundance, as the current phrase goes, it's all good. God's blessings have been slathered on with such liberality, the beneficence of the universe seems like an obvious fact. There's no racking sense of evil in the land of abundance, no staring into the abyss. (Actually, we could use a little more of that.) All God's children -- as long as they are good-hearted, tolerant and hard-working -- go to heaven, and the heaven of the next world seems like an extension of the heavenly possibilities of this one.
This whole worldview encourages an open, trusting, genial approach to life -- happy smiles to strangers, indulgences for the kids, a naive embrace of the untried. Americans go in for online shopping and stock market investing at rates much higher than people in other lands -- sending their money off into some unidentifiable ether and somehow trusting the forces of that invisible place to treat them square.
As people get more affluent, they are more likely to join community associations. They are more likely to care about quality-of-life issues. They are more likely to call themselves environmentalists, and they have the means to go off and explore our increasingly overcrowded national parks. Americans spend their abundance on products that bring them closer to their families: on educational toys and family getaways and massive turbo grills for neighborhood barbecues. Americans are far more religiously active than, say, Europeans, maybe because God has been so good to us it makes sense to go off and thank him at least once a week. 
Americans are also far more charitable than people in other lands, and we structure our tax laws to nurture the philanthropic sector. American adults give on average $1,097 a year to charity, and evangelical Christians, who are the most charitable among us, give on average $3,601 a year. When money comes and goes with such alacrity, it doesn't hurt to give it away: join an Elks Lodge, have a bake sale, march in one of those walks for medical research. Someday soon we'll all be bidding to have lunch with one another at charity auctions.
And so we are the beneficiaries of a magical alchemy. Americans live with the sort of wealth that turned Caligula into a monster, Marie Antoinette into a symbol of self-absorption and the British upper classes into anticommercial snobs. And yet because wealth here is a loose floozy, available for nearly all the good-time Charlies, it does not enervate. It does not insulate its possessors into a permanent charmed circle of inherited affluence.
That could change, of course. Efforts to reduce the inheritance tax could help produce a huge class of trust-fund millionaires. But so far, Jefferson and Adams were wrong. The gurus of the simple life are wrong. The noblest, most creative and fullest life is not to be found by the backwaters of Walden Pond but in the rushing mainstream of life, in the office parks and the malls and the Times Squares twinkling with lights, screens and money. 
Enjoy the ads in this magazine, and yes, you now have permission to turn to the incredible real estate classifieds in the back.

HEADLINE: Houston Does Not Believe In Tears 

BYLINE:  By Randall Patterson; Randall Patterson, a former writer for The Houston Press, now lives in Asheville, N.C.

 BODY:
After the disaster, I got back to Houston as quickly as possible and at first could hardly tell anything had happened. It was not as if a bomb had exploded or a building had collapsed. There had been a disappearance, that is all, and the effect was not apparent until I got out of the car. It was the fear I noticed, and I saw it first when I sat down with Elyse Lanier.
 Lanier is the wife of the former mayor and the closest thing the fourth-largest city in the country has to a mother. In her enormous diamonds and green leather pants, she ate a hamburger and fries and spoke of "the setbacks we've had" -- Tropical Storm Allison and the floods it caused, the Andrea Yates murders and trial. What made it worse was that all these outsiders had come in to gawk and had not helped at all. And it was then, while the reporters were standing around, that the most embarrassing thing happened. 
 One morning, the pride of the town, the greatest example of what a business could do in Houston, woke up dead. 
The corpse was right out there in the front yard, Enron's hollow new skyscraper, sprouting out of the Y.M.C.A. parking lot. "It was really shocking," Lanier said. She and her husband, Bob, quickly composed themselves and hurried to tell reporters that this was nothing to be overly concerned about. Enron did not "economically affect the city at all," and this sort of thing happened all the time in Texas.
But the reporters kept standing around, poking the corpse, sniffing. It was as if they had never seen a bankruptcy before, as if they thought it was wrong to go bankrupt. "All the anger and emotion, it's ridiculous!" Elyse said. She just wished they would go back to where they came from, because they were not good for business. They were making Houston look like some unstable frontier boomtown again, like "a bunch of hicks," Lanier said. "It's not true. Houston is a diverse, cosmopolitan, international city."
She reached across the table for a thick folder, and though I told Lanier I had lived in Houston for eight years, she began reading the proof that it really is a city. "Please don't think I'm cracked," she said. "These are just things I happen to believe in."
The Port of Houston ranks No. 1 in the country for foreign tonnage. . . . The Texas Medical Center is the largest medical center in the world. . . . The new Reliant Stadium has twice the square footage of the Astrodome. . . . 
The longer Lanier went on with her evidence of life after Enron, the less convincing she became. It was a sales job; she was frank about that. Houston would never be recognized as a great metropolis, she said, until it had a great marketing campaign. This was the city's ruling credo: Nothing happens until you sell something. Enron was built on that principle, and certainly it was the guide to the New York flimflammers who founded Houston.
The city began as one of the country's great real-estate scams. In 1836, immediately after the battle that won Texas independence from Mexico, Augustus and John Allen began advertising a new port town, "located at a point on the river which must ever command the trade of the largest and richest portion of Texas."
The brothers crooned: "There is no place more healthy," and " none possesses so many advantages for building. . . . It is handsome and beautifully elevated, salubrious and well watered."
The single truth in that ad was that Houston was well watered, as swamps tend to be. A desperate sort replied to this ad, packing up their belongings and traveling hundreds of miles to arrive at absolutely nothing: a flat, hot, wet plain of no beauty whatsoever, cut through only by a sluggish creek, colonized already by flocks of mosquitoes and herds of snakes.
The moment presented choices. One hundred and fifty years earlier, in the 1680's, the followers of Cavelier de La Salle, on finding themselves lost in what is now Texas, chose to shoot their leader and stagger home. The settlers attracted by the Allen brothers were a different breed, and when they opted to pay the brothers and stick it out, the great city of Houston was born.
It has never been like other cities -- not like San Francisco or Denver or Palm Beach. People have never gone to Houston for its beauty or climate, or because it is in any natural way a good place to live. Houston from the start has been a place to make money -- the great interior commercial emporium of Texas," as the Allen brothers promised. And if money was Houston's singular attraction, then certainly the city would impose no heavy restrictions on the making of it.
"Does the Houston region have a business-friendly environment?" asks a recent brochure. "Oh, yes." No zoning. Pollution-control abatements. Tax exemptions. Laissez-faire as loose as you like it. When the F.B.I. arrested several city councilmen a few years ago for either accepting or giving bribes, no one was really surprised. As Mayor Lee P. Brown told me, government works very closely here with the private sector to create the "premier world-class city" that Houston is.
By the time I got there in 1992, the swamp had been fully air-conditioned, and people moved from bubble to bubble -- there were tunnels for this -- from one artificial environment to the next. Houston was a sprawling, twisting knot of strip malls and highways, and no one had the big picture here; no one was watching the store. The city that began as a scheme seemed to proceed as an uncontrolled chain reaction of schemes, the descendants of the Allen brothers preying on the descendants of the settlers, again and again.
They passed before me, and I wrote about them -- the director of beauty pageants who always kept the prizes, the delightfully conniving snail salesman, the gentle inventor of the perpetual-motion machine who thought the oil industry was keeping him down. I used to imagine them all working the same room together, and now I see Ken Lay there too.
Lanier reeled off her evidence and then at last sent me to visit "a jewel in the rejuvenation of the town" -- the place formerly known as Enron Field.
"I want you to look around," she said, "and feel the spirit of the city you're in." The diverse, cosmopolitan city. Lanier said the stadium was a "microcosm" of it, "a great visual." So I took her tickets and made my way there on a Saturday night and quickly saw what she meant: a coliseum with a 15-million-pound retractable roof is clearly something no cosmopolitan city should be without. As for the diversity, everyone was certainly here and in his place, arranged by income. The diverse rabble was up there in the nosebleeds, and here I was, directly behind home plate, surrounded by white guys who could afford $18,000 season tickets.
The area was known as the Diamond Box, and in ordinary times Ken Lay was said to be a Diamond Box man. He must have been watching the game on television that night, so I wandered over to the owner of the Astros, Drayton McLane Jr. Though Lay helped lead the fund-raising effort for the stadium and helped break the ground, McLane didn't seem to miss him at all. Unfurling from his seat, McLane said he was reared to believe that "you conduct yourself in a very dignified and respectable way in business." At the time he granted Enron a 30-year deal for naming rights to the stadium, he said, the company appeared to be one of the most dignified and respectable businesses in the world. When that appearance dissolved, McLane paid $2.1 million to detach the Astros from a loser. "Nobody's been wounded more than we have," he said, "but we're on our feet, and we'll go on."
I settled in to watch the game. When the waiter politely offered me a beer, I might have declined if I'd known the man beside me was a Baptist preacher. Duane Brooks looked fresh from the barber and the bath and began speaking of the "symbiotic" relationship in Houston between church and business. As I understood it, businessmen give money to the church, and the church in turn encourages businessmen to make more money. Jesus suffered and died so they might live well and prosper; Jesus wants everyone to maximize his potential.
I asked Brooks about what Jesus had said in the temple with the money-changers. "Is it not written," Brooks paraphrased, "My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations? But you have made it a den of robbers."
Brooks acknowledged that "one of the dangers of being a Christian businessman is to worship God as the God of my success," but he seemed to think there was nothing he could do about that. Instead of sermons on greed, he had preached lately on the need to keep worshiping, even when "the Nasdaq falls through the basement." The current uncertainty was bringing people to church in droves. "These are really good times," he said. "Yeah, these are great days." And with excitement in his voice, Brooks told me of plans to move Tallowood Baptist Church into a shopping mall. 
Over the left-field wall the name Gallery Furniture was emblazoned. The owner has expressed interest in a "Gallery Furniture Field," but McLane said that "his involvement was never a serious consideration," presumably because the owner is a jumping, shouting businessman known as Mattress Mac (real name, James Franklin McIngvale).
Mac is Houston's most prominent citizen, and one of the few of any prominence publicly critical of Enron. After the game (the Astros lost, alas), when I went to Gallery Furniture to see him, it was like walking into the big top -- an imperial red-white-and-blue warehouse, shrouded in flags and Elvis signs, a giant bin by the door containing the free red-white-and-blue basketballs that came with every purchase. Mac, the elfish man on a leather sofa, explained that to work in retail, you have to live in your customers' world, "understand their needs and concerns and fears." The store, then, was like the church; the flags made people feel safe, Mac said, and he put up more of them after Sept. 11. "The amazing thing, after 9/11 and the planes hit the tower, I thought we were going to blink" -- one prepares for a remark on the resolve of a great country -- I thought sales would go down, but we did $250,000 that day."
Mac judged Enron's collapse as he seems to judge all things -- by its effect on sales. "Like dipping your hand in a swimming pool and pulling it out -- the hole fills in." But he seemed to have a personal reaction too, almost as if he himself had been cheated. Both he and Ken Lay started out with a desire, as Lay has said, to "make some money," but they went about it in different ways and as a result held different places in the town. Lay wore suits and worked big deals quietly; Mac was the flag-draped clown, appealing to the hordes, endlessly yanking a wad of cash from his pocket, screaming, "Gallery Furniture will save you money!" Since "money is a scorecard," Mac is pleased to divulge now that Gallery Furniture grossed $150 million last year alone. Lay, who is reported to have sold $180 million in stock from 1998 through 2001, may be the less wealthy man, but he was always considered the respectable one, the great city father whose charity work received the most attention, who got invited to all the rich parties.
Mac insisted that none of this ever bothered him, but when he heard that Enron reported hundreds of millions in phony profits and concealed billions in debt, Mac spoke of how the company had "hoodwinked" the city -- the incredible fraud of it!" And the failure of a cheat had vindicated his business instincts: to make money, you must sell "real things to real people," he said. 
"They had no idea who their customers were," Mac went on. "If you can't serve customers, you can't stay in business -- I don't care who you are."
My friend from the old Houston Post, the gossip columnist with the dark sunglasses and the rich laugh, knew what happened at all the parties to which Mac was not invited, and as far as she was concerned, Enron was "a dull business story." Betsy Parish said her eyes glaze over whenever people talk accounting to her, but she could not see that anyone had done anything terribly "bad or evil." No one comes to Houston to be poor, she said, and to get rich, you have to drill a well, take a chance. Enron's leaders had certainly taken a chance.
"People in Houston admire spunk," Parish said. "It's an action town."
I wanted to know what the future held for Enron's leaders. Parish was certain that whatever shame had attached to them was nothing money could not remove. "Everything is based on money," she said.
Its effect on court proceedings was clear already. Attorney General John Ashcroft, at least three federal judges and the entire United States attorney's office in Houston have recused themselves. If criminal charges do eventually come to trial in Houston, the case may well be presented to a jury of spunk admirers. As for civil cases, they will confront Texas laws that shield houses, cars, future earnings -- virtually everything -- from seizure. Which leaves the men of Enron time to contemplate their social lives.
In addition to exorbitantly priced defense lawyers (perhaps the greatest threat to their fortunes), Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling and Andrew Fastow have all worked with publicists. Parish explained that Skilling and Fastow were never more than businessmen. "They simply did not exist in the framework of those I know," Parish said.
But Lay was a different matter. He was the boldest of "bold-faced types." Businessmen typically enter the social set through their charitable good deeds, and Lay presided over Enron's $10 million-a-year "community relations" budget, buying relationships and prestige. Then in a plunge, it was gone. No one could remember a fall from grace like this. The city simply didn't know what to do with him. Steadfast friends could only insist he was incompetent, not criminal. ("He may not have been watching those balance sheets as he should," Elyse Lanier explained.) 
Lay groped about for his dignity. Instead of shutting his family away from the angry world, they came out, one by one, to defend him. His sister testified to Lay's "tremendous integrity." One son swore that he was "the most generous, ethical, giving man that I've ever met." But it was Lay's wife, Linda, who afforded the best theater, trotting out to avow not simply that her husband was "a moral human being who would do absolutely nothing wrong" but that he was a victim, too: "We've lost everything," she said, speaking from their $7 million condo. 
Lay was blessed by a visit from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who flew in and compared him to Job. But elsewhere, the greetings were cooler. There was a report of an "E.F. Hutton moment," when Lay walked into the ballroom of the River Oaks Country Club. Spotting Lay at a party there, a waiter could not help but gasp, "Oh, my God!" And a doctor who saw Lay at the hospital boasted of staring the great man down. 
But Lay kept himself out there. He soldiered on and was rewarded when the pastor of the Oasis of Love reached out, squeezed his arm and said he was praying for him. The city wanted to forgive him, and as he returned to his old charity circuit, the absolution began. He arrived timid, not his old genial self, but usually met a warm reception. And finally the triumphal moment came at, of all things, the Holocaust Museum Houston benefit.
The evening's theme was "Our Nation's Courage," with Bob Dole to receive the Lyndon Baines Johnson Moral Courage Award. Lay seemed to have summoned everything he had for the event. He and his wife arrived dead last, and as an honorary chairman, he made his way to the front table, where he sat with the former senator from Kansas. How gratifying it must have been as a stream of well-wishers came forth to shake his hand. According to one account, the announcement of Ken Lay's continued support, that his family foundation had somewhere scrounged up a contribution of $100,000, brought "some of the most enthusiastic applause of the night."
"He'll be forgiven," Parish said, "not in the Christian sense, not by those he hurt, but by Houston. If they give, they'll be embraced by those they give to. They'll have the same friends they had before." 
Houston's old scandal was being played out again. Promotional literature referred to the city as "an expansive urban forest" with a "mild" climate, painted in "the blues of many lakes and the nearby Gulf of Mexico."
I was never aware of the lakes; the gulf is an hour away and brown; and the city's prevailing color is brown. For all its virtues, Houston is not a town of natural beauty, and when I said so to Elyse Lanier, she replied, "Oh, you must see my backyard!" That is how I came on a Sunday afternoon to the Laniers' new pink villa.
Until last summer, they had lived in a penthouse, one floor above Ken and Linda Lay. Now the former mayor sat beside the pool, in his bathrobe. Bob Lanier found it hard to explain what happened at Enron, but he could not simply blame greed. Houston has always been an entrepreneurial town, he said. It began as a real-estate speculator's dream, "and then people came here and made it nice." And for most of his life, Lanier himself had been an "acquisitor." The city was filled with acquisitors. And "what you do in a democracy," he said, "is you try to have regulations and restrictions that channel that greed toward constructive ends."
When he heard of Lay's "great personal tragedy," Lanier said, he faxed "words of encouragement and hope that he would straighten out his life and make a contribution again." Houston will go on regardless, Lanier said, because the need to make money will go on. 
"I want to show him our hill," Elyse said to her husband.
Bob Lanier rose to give a tour of the grounds. He took his time, proudly pointing to the rosebushes, the ferns, the carefully planted impatiens. "This used to be all wild," he said. At last we came to the hill, the work of a bulldozer. Elyse gazed over the black iron fence and across the rolling golf course to the trees. "Don't you feel like you're in the East here?" she asked. "Reminds me so much of the Berkshires."
I agreed that Houston is certainly very beautiful in her backyard. Elyse Lanier said it was pretty from the penthouse too.

HEADLINE: The Hangover Years 

 BODY:
That was some party we had. But the boom years are long over now, a rapidly receding memory, and we're still reeling a bit from our drunken excess. Unfortunately, this is one hangover that won't be cured with a couple of aspirins and a nap. In fact, this thing could last awhile. 
 There was some optimistic buzz about a recovery this winter, but that has died down. This isn't the typical recession in which a few interest-rate cuts perk things right up. In fact, there is no recent precedent for our current economic condition of anemic growth amid quiescent inflation and low interest rates. It happened last in 1957-58, when a slump was followed by a slow recovery and another drop. In the 1960 presidential campaign, John F. Kennedy promised to "get the country moving again," which he did, sort of. But it wasn't until 1965 that unemployment rates retreated to boom-era levels. 
 This is not to say that everyone is suffering. For a while after 9/11, economists worried that frightened consumers would stop spending. Not to worry. Three-bedroom fixer-uppers are going for $1 million in Silicon Valley, and sales of jewelry and high-end yachts are doing quite well, thank you. What's missing, though, is the capital investment that powered the expansion of the 90's. Businesses are saddled with too many routers and servers, too much useless software. The Internet now looks more like a Florida land deal than a New Economy gold mine.
Still, this is America, and we'll shake off the cobwebs and boom again. But before that happens, we need to attend a few recovery meetings to figure out what went wrong. There's plenty to discuss. In this issue, for instance, Harris Collingwood explains how many of the worst excesses of the 90's can be traced to an obsession with corporate earnings growth. And Roger Lowenstein shows how executives have niftily decoupled pay from performance. 
But some things also went right. Most Americans got to keep the bulk of their boom-time wealth, an abundance that David Brooks argues has made us more virtuous, encouraging us to work harder to get more. And much of America is impervious to cycles, anyway. Randall Patterson reports from Houston that a little thing like the Enron scandal isn't about to distract people from their God-given right to chase the almighty dollar. In "The Middle of the Middle Class" you'll find smack-center median-income families who are perfectly happy with their lot.
Occasionally, in the foggy years ahead, the deal will fall through, the job may disappear or, as in Melanie Thernstrom's case, the inheritance may end up in the Cleveland Museum of Art. But these relapses are to be expected, momentary setbacks as we exorcise the excesses of the 90's and prepare for the next great binge.

 BODY:
Jayson Jackson is breaking it down. "Cars and jewelry come first," he says. "Maybe jewelry has become a bit passe, because with jewelry you can't outdo anyone -- no one takes the microscope and measures the clarity of the diamond. So the first thing is probably go out and buy a car. Or two. It's like sneakers, man -- you gotta have a pair of high-tops, and you gotta have a pair of low-tops. So they'll go get the convertible, and they'll go get the Range Rover." 
 As the senior vice president and general manager for urban music at Virgin Records and a veteran of several other labels, Jackson has seen one newly signed recording artist after another head down that path. "Then you graduate to watches," he continues. "You can buy a watch that costs 50 grand and doesn't have any diamonds in it, and that's an interesting thing for people to realize once they start coming into a lot of cash. After you've done that, smarter guys usually get a home. That's a matter of: 'Do I buy Park Avenue, or do I buy Saddle River? Or do I just go Connecticut?' Not too many people go Connecticut. Once you've got that, you get a home in the Hamptons and maybe one in Miami. And it's Miami that really gets you thinking about a boat. Folks are definitely moving into boats. I know a couple of people who've ventured into that, and it's not for the light in pocket." 
 The particular status details may vary from one genre to the next, but the thrill of blowing piles of newfound money has always been an essential part of the music industry's mythos. These extravagances are so widely publicized that they've even started to recalibrate the way mere civilians think about luxury. "At one point, if a guy had a $30,000 car, he was thought of as doing pretty well," says Al Gary, owner of Virtual Auto in Fort Lee, N.J., a dealership that caters to celebrity musicians. "But because of videos and movies and music, now if a guy's not driving something $75,000 or better, basically he can't get a date. He's not even getting a wink."
These days, however, the business that reset the standards for conspicuous consumption is in the midst of a wrenching downturn. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, record companies shipped 10.3 percent fewer units in 2001 than in the previous year -- a drop of more than half a billion dollars. The industry's mergers and takeovers, which left hundreds of employees without jobs, also left many artists without labels. Others saw their royalties shrink as the retail price of CD's went lower and lower in search of buyers. As a result, some of the business's most visible players are now finding themselves stretched between their own high profiles and their industry's lowering tides. And many of the professionals who used to help keep musicians' pockets full of spending money now feel obligated to help them conserve their funds, invest prudently and think about the long term.
"I try to advise artists before I sign them, because a lot of them come in with dreams," says Brian K. Jackson, a senior vice president at E.M.I. for creative/A&R. "They believe their life is going to be so incredible once they find a deal. But advances disappear quickly. I know a songwriter, practically the day after he signed for $350,000, he had a Bentley. And this newfound love for diamonds: I've seen people get a $200,000 advance and buy a $75,000 diamond watch. I know one big producer who stated that by having the jewels on, if he sat across the table from someone else who had jewels on that he would gain respect. It's a lot of values that are messed up."
The midtown offices of the Madison Smallwood Financial Group are modest, as if to signal the partners' determination to practice the fiscal restraint they preach. Like their most obedient clients, Horace Madison and Solomon Smallwood are probably doing much better than they let on: they have another office in Atlanta and a third opening soon in Los Angeles. Their clients, 50 or so, are mostly artists, producers, songwriters and executives in the music business (OutKast, Usher, Swizz Beatz, Pastor Mason Betha -- formerly Mase -- and the late Lisa Lopes, to name a few). The firm has been in business for all of two years.
Madison, an affable 37-year-old dressed in understated gray slacks and white sweater, sits at a marble conference table amid photographs of grateful stars he has guided toward financial responsibility. "I'm not completely altruistic," he admits. "I definitely do this for profit, but I really do enjoy teaching people and helping people." Oblivious to the sound of roiling Third Avenue traffic below, he is confident and easygoing. But on the subject of his professional mission, he is unmistakably serious.
"Most of our clients, excluding the executives, come from nothing and have relatively a lot," he continues, gesturing to an assistant to bring him a folder. "We have to remind them that if you just made a million dollars, but you spend $900,000, you're in the same place you were when you got it. The other thing is making them realize that the big-ticket items are a problem, because most of the ones our younger clients tend to purchase are a depreciating asset." He leans forward into the conversation. "You have to become an actor in the theater of the absurd: 'Can you live in that watch? If something happens to you -- your mother, your children, your wife, what are they going to be able to do with that $200,000 car?"' 
The purest example of Madison's methodology is "the stupid letter," a reproach he faxes to clients who are about to make an irresponsible purchase. Their signed response amounts to an acknowledgment -- and a legal record -- of Madison's profound disapproval. At the mention of his secret weapon, he laughs. "Customized every time," he says. "I'll say, you know, 'Is this more important than Cindy and Bobby's education?' Or, 'How can you justify buying this when you have yet to fund your trust accounts?' Or, 'You haven't even thought about your retirement."'
The letter engenders a variety of responses. "A few ignore it," Madison says. "A very few have taken offense. But far more often the clients appreciate what we're trying to accomplish. If, reluctantly, they decide not to complete the transaction, that's a coup. More times than not, they will at least tone it down." And in the current climate, toning it down seems smarter than ever. "A few years ago, any clown could make money," Madison says, holding a call. "As the market share gets smaller, people are going to have to be more careful with their finances."
Jimmy Maynes, Vice President for A&R/Music Publishing at Jive Records, has had his own share of experiences trying to save newly flush artists from themselves. It hasn't always worked. Maynes recalls one artist who called him right after landing a big deal and said, "Meet me at the Benz dealer."
Knowing that the artist was still deep in debt, Maynes replied: "Listen, how about I meet you at the BMW dealer? How about I meet you at the Lexus dealer?"
But the artist wasn't interested. "I've worked too hard and too long," he said. "So you may as well just come help me pick out the color." 
Maynes laughs. "So naturally -- 'cause I like a nice ride -- I go with him," he says. "I'm thinking, I can guide him to the affordable Benz. He didn't like that. He guides himself over to the biggest Benz there is. This car is $125,000." The artist paid in cash. "Long story short: now he only has the car," Maynes says. 
"You spend so much time trying to get a deal, you spend so much money on your demos, and your clothes, and your travel," he says, that when the first big check arrives, "you forget that your Con Ed bill was eight months behind. You forget that your cellphone bill was 15 months behind. You forget that you never paid the I.R.S. -- at all, ever, in life. And you know what? You can't really enjoy that car knowing that you have all those other bills. It's nice to be flamboyant and ride around and have everybody stare and look, but at the end of the day you have to go to bed knowing that in the morning the lights are going to go on."
That sort of logic had more traction with another of Maynes's artists, a woman who, having spent time sleeping in a car and living on shoplifted food, suddenly had several hundred thousand newly wired dollars sitting in her bank account. Maynes sat down and explained what lay ahead: months -- at least -- of hard work and tireless promotion before any more money could possibly come in. And even then there were no guarantees. "I was able to show this artist the long haul," Maynes says. "The label was looking at this money to last a couple of years. I said, 'I don't care if 17,000 people are looking at you every day, I'm going to give you $35 per diem."'
So she put half of the advance into a high-interest I.R.A. and spent another $50,000 or so building a recording studio, which in short order paid for itself and promises to yield much more. Eventually, Maynes says, "the artist did go to the Benz dealer -- for some reason or other, you just can't keep these people out of the Benz dealer -- but she got a used Benz, and she leased. So she gets the same 'oohs' and 'aahs' from the fame-watchers when she pulls up to the club or when she pulls up to the mall, but at a fraction of the cost." 
Maynes was confident that she'd stick with the program. He regards it as a matter of character. "I watched her spending habits," he says. "I'm not going to go out and get a bunch of clothes, because I'm going to get free clothes from photo shoots.' 'I'm not going to go to the hottest hairstylist -- I'm just going to go to somebody I know.' The thought of going broke again was a real fear factor. Look at the personality trait: even when she was shoplifting, she was shoplifting food. Not jewelry, not clothes."
In the rarest of instances, musicians learn to practice restraint not from a professional counselor but from fellow artists. "Stevie, my bass player, he was an accountant before we started this, so he's really good with numbers," says Dave Williams, the 28-year-old lead singer of Drowning Pool, a heavy metal band that has sold more than a million copies of its 2001 debut, "Sinner" (Wind-up Records). "Mike, my drummer, is really into a lot of investments. They look out for me."
Speaking from Germany, where the band is on tour with Ozzfest, he recalls: "The first thing off the bat was, 'I want to get a car, and I want to get a house.' And they're like, 'Just . . . wait a . . . minute. How much time do you think you're going to spend in that car and in that house over the next two or three years?' And I looked -- 'cause our career is pretty much mapped out for a while -- and I went, 'Wow, maybe you're right."'
He also credits Sevendust and Pantera, successful Southern metal bands, with inspiring Drowning Pool to stay on its casually shod feet. "Pantera is a constant moneymaking thing, as far as the trademarks and the merchandise," he says. "There's a constant flow of income, and I think that's awesome. They live comfortably. That didn't just come overnight, as I'm sure it won't for us.
"I don't know how to react to a lot of money 'cause I've never had it," he admits. Back in the old days, when the band all slept on the floor in the same one-bedroom apartment, "we had fun," he says. "As long as the money we made covered the gas to get home, we were cool with that. Enough to buy some beer and lunch meat. The thing that's different now is, now we're homeless. When we come off the road, we stay with friends, or Mom and Dad, or get a hotel room. I think everybody expected us to change with everything that's happened, but we weren't raised that way.
"We all bought some toys," Williams concedes. "I went out and got some tattoos and stuff, and I took some friends out to dinner and to some strip bars. A couple of the other guys want to get dirt bikes." But so far it hasn't gone any further. "Maybe when I sit down and watch a football game with all my friends in my house, for the first time, then maybe -- maybe -- it'll set in." 

Hollywood's Portfolio
Despite the temptations of luxury spending, many celebrities are focused on investment, a field in which they tend to have opportunities not open to mere civilians. Herewith, a selection of options favored by the very famous.

1. Production companies. The father of them all was Merv Griffin Productions, which was sold in 1986 for a reported $250 million. Oprah's 90 percent stake in Harpo Inc. is worth about $518 million. David Letterman owns Worldwide Pants; George Lucas owns Industrial Light and Magic.

2. Personal marketing. In 1999, George Foreman sold the rights to his name to the makers of the wildly successful George Foreman Grills for $137.5 million and stock. Many celebrities promote their own product lines on television; Joan Rivers, for one, has sold more than 15 million pieces of jewelry. Elle Macpherson owns a top-selling lingerie line.

3. Restaurants. Some of the very many high-profile investors: Jennifer Lopez (Madre's in Pasadena), Sean Combs (Justin's in New York and Atlanta), Michael Jordan (Michael Jordan's: The Steak House in New York) and Britney Spears (Nyla, opening soon in New York).

4. Fine art. Madonna's art collection includes more than 47 works by Frida Kahlo. Steve Martin's includes works by Hockney, Fischl, Hopper, Lichtenstein, Picasso and Seurat; Andrew Lloyd Weber collects Pre-Raphaelite paintings.

5. Stocks and bonds. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia's I.P.O. raised $129.6 million. David Bowie raised $55 million
by issuing bonds backed by his song catalog's future earnings; Ashford and Simpson, James Brown, Dusty Springfield, the Isley Brothers and the estate of Marvin Gaye followed suit.

6. Cars and planes. Among the many who collect them, some make money: Frankie Muniz sends his customized 2000 Volkswagen Jetta to car shows; Latrell Sprewell opened a racing shop; John Travolta's movie contracts require the production company to pay for fuel and maintenance on his jets -- as well as two standby pilots, at $1,250 a day.

7. Racehorses. Toby Keith, the country-music star, owns more than 40 horses, several of which cost $150,000 each; they've already paid for themselves through winnings and sales. Alex Trebek, Burt Bacharach, Rick Pitino and William Shatner have major equine holdings.

8. Theme parks and resorts. Dollywood, the Pigeon Forge, Tenn., amusement park in which Dolly Parton has invested tens of millions of dollars, now generates estimated annual revenues of $84 million. Clint Eastwood bought a historic resort in Carmel, Calif.; Kevin Costner bought a South Dakota casino and plans to build a golf resort nearby.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN; 
Istanbul

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ; DOUGLAS FRANTZ is chief of the Istanbul bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
There are two Istanbuls. One is historic, an ancient city where Byzantine churches, Roman walls and Ottoman monuments constantly remind visitors that this was the capital of three great empires.
 Then there is modern Istanbul, a vibrant metropolis of 15 million where traffic is controlled chaos, five-star hotels offer sumptuous accommodations and ambitious restaurants compare with the best of New York or London. 
 Istanbul today is the ultimate hybrid city, a beguiling conjunction of old and new, Asian and European, a place with options to fit the interests and budget of any traveler.
This summer, crowds should be sparser than usual and most prices are down. Turkey has been hit hard by the post-Sept. 11 travel decline and Mideast violence. Further, 18 months of recession have stripped the Turkish lira of 50 percent of its value against the dollar -- it is now nearly 1.5 million lire to the dollar. 
Prices are lower, though not half what they were a couple of years ago. And bigger bargains are available, especially for those willing to negotiate. Except in restaurants, bargaining is part of Turkey's entrepreneurial culture, and polite negotiation should not offend any shopkeeper or hotel owner. Even folks too shy to haggle should ask if they are getting the best price.

Events
 The high point on Istanbul's cultural calendar comes each June when the International Music Festival brings in musicians from around the world for three weeks. Most performances take place in Haghia Eirene, an atmosphere-laden jewel of a Byzantine chapel on the grounds of Topkapi Palace.
The festival, which opened Saturday, concludes July 1, when William Christie conducts Les Arts Florissants, the early-music vocal and instrumental group, in Haydn's "Seasons." Early music and period instruments are the emphasis this year, and the program includes I Solisti Veneti on June 19 and 20, and the Academy of Ancient Music from England on June 22.
Festival tickets, $10 to $100, can be ordered by phone, (90-212) 334-0700, extension 34 or 36, or by fax, (90-212) 334-0705. E-mail reservations: meric .soylu@istfest-tr.org. The schedule is at www.istfest.org.
On the heels of the music fest is the International Istanbul Jazz Festival, which opens July 5. There will be 35 to 40 acts over two weeks, ranging from favorites like Herbie Hancock to Antibalas, a New York group that is making a name with its blend of jazz and funk known as Afrobeat.
Performance sites are as varied as the music. Headliners perform in a 4,000-seat open-air theater and others play in more intimate settings like Babylon, a club at 3 Sehbender Street, just off Istanbul's busiest pedestrian boulevard, Istiklal Street. 
At least one concert will be at Kiz Kulesi, or Maiden's Tower. Legend has it that a sultan's daughter was locked in this 12th-century island tower in the Bosporus near the Asian side to protect her from a prediction that she would die of a snake bite. More recently, Pierce Brosnan was held hostage there in the 1999 James Bond movie "The World Is Not Enough." Refurbished and now a restaurant, the tower provides stunning views.
Festival tickets are $10 to $50. Information: (90-212) 334-0739, fax (90-212) 334-0705, and www.istfest.org. 
A stroll along Istiklal to the Tunel district on a Sunday afternoon can lead to some unusual sounds. Disciples of Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi, a Sufi mystic, perform a concert, complete with whirling dervishes, each summer Sunday at 5 p.m. Tickets are $6.80 and sell fast, so stop by the box office at Galata Mevlevihanesi, a museum at Galip Dede Caddesi, during the week because reservations are not accepted. Seating is also first come, first served. Information: (90-212) 245-4141, fax (90-212) 213-1059, www.emav.org.

Sightseeing
Few cities offer as much history as Istanbul, and no place in Istanbul offers more than the Sultanahmet district, where three major monuments and numerous others are within walking distance. 
Topkapi Palace, home to the Ottoman sultans for nearly four centuries, is worth a day itself for touring the grounds and exhibits like the harem and the treasury. At Babihumayun Caddesi, it is open daily except Tuesday. Admission is $10.20; (90-212) 512-0480. 
Nearby is the magnificent Haghia Sophia, built as a Byzantine church in the sixth century and now a museum at Ayasofya Meydani, (90-212) 522-1750. Restoration work has recently been completed on the stunning upper gallery. Closed Monday; general admission is $10.20 and another $10.20 for the upper galleries. 
Across a park from Haghia Sophia at Sultanahmet Meydani is the Blue Mosque, an active place of worship that is always open free. The mosque takes its name from the mainly blue Iznik tilework and is particularly magical at night. Proper attire is required: women should avoid shorts or short skirts and wear a scarf; donations are customary.
A Bosporus tour is delightful, especially in summer. The best -- and cheapest -- way to see the straits is by municipal ferries, which leave Bogaz Iskelesi dock in Eminonu at 10:35 a.m. or 1:35 p.m. daily for a 90-minute tour. You can get off for two hours in Kavaklar, a village on the Asian side famous for its fish restaurants. Tickets are $2. 
Shopping in Istanbul is entertaining enough to qualify as sightseeing, particularly at the Grand Bazaar (or Covered Market) on Carsikapi Caddesi in the Beyazit district. The 450-year-old collection of about 4,000 shops winds through a vast network of covered streets and buildings. Open 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily except Sunday, the bazaar is a cornucopia of wares, from mass-produced carpets and fake designer shirts to fine jewelry and antiques. By bargaining, expect to pay about two-thirds the asking price for most goods.
The best shops don't hawk their wares. At Eski Arts and Antiques, at Cevahir Bedestan, 7 Serifaga Street, Irfan Karatas sells antique jewelry and religious icons without moving from his cozy store. Stunningly detailed antique Russian icons can cost as little as $500 or as much as $5,000. 
Nearby, at 93-95 Takkeciler Street, Dogan Bilgili sits patiently in his shop, where a lightweight, butter-soft leather coat for a man or woman is about $225.
Carpets are popular purchases, but buy with care. For people with expertise and money, or just money, a handful of shops sell antique rugs starting at $1,000 and ranging to the stratosphere. One is Naturel, on Evkaf Street at Ekmel Han No. 1, near the Grand Bazaar, (90-212) 516-7601, fax (90-212) 516-7603. It specializes in old carpets from Turkey and the Caucasus, some of museum-quality and priced accordingly.

Where to Stay
 The downturn in tourism is keeping most hotel rates reasonable, and a number of high-end places have weekend and other specials.
The Conrad Istanbul, Barbaros Boulevard, Yildiz Caddesi, Besiktas, (800) 774-1500, (90-212) 227-3000, fax (90-212) 259-6667, www.conrad.com, was the first of the city's modern luxury hotels and many of its 592 rooms have wonderful Bosporus views. After June 15, a standard double will begin at $130, including tax.
In the heart of Sultanahmet is the 14-room Seven Hills Hotel, 8/A Tevkifhane Street, (90-212) 516-9497, fax (90-212) 517-1085, and at www .hotelsevenhills.com. Rooms have hardwood floors and lovely rugs from a shop below, owned by the same family. The rooftop restaurant has great views. A standard double is $140, with tax and breakfast.
Budget: The Side Hotel and Pension, 20 Utangac Street, (90-212) 517-2282, fax (90-212) 517-6590, Web site www.sidehotel.com, is across from the Seven Hills, with 43 tidy rooms and a friendly atmosphere. A double is $50, in the pension $35, both with breakfast and tax. Pension rooms are smaller and don't have phones; some share a bath. 
An interesting alternative for groups of three or four is Galata Residence, Felek Street, (90-212) 252-6062, fax (90-212) 244-2323, www .galataresidence.com. The hotel is in the city's oldest apartment building -- dating from the late 19th century -- and has 15 sparkling two-bedroom apartments, with a living room and full kitchen, for $100 a day.
Luxury: The Four Seasons Hotel, 1 Tevkihane Street, Sultanahmet, (90-212) 638-8200, fax (90-212) 638-8210, www.fourseasons.com, has 65 elegantly understated rooms in a renovated, century-old prison. A short walk from Sultanahmet's monuments, the hotel is an oasis of personal service, including spa treatments; the staff prides itself on knowing each guest by name. Summer rates are well below last year's: a standard double is $250 and a deluxe double, with balcony and view of the sea or Haghia Sophia, is $360.
Across town, directly on the Bosporus, is the opulent Ciragan Palace Kempinski, 32 Ciragan Caddesi, Besikstas, (800) 426-3135, (90-212) 258-3377, fax (90-212) 259-6687, Web site www.ciragan-palace.com. The Ciragan (pronounced chir-HAN) is actually two connected hotels -- a restored 19th-century palace that was one of the last homes of the sultans and a newer hotel built and decorated in similar style. The hotel takes full advantage of its location, with two pools, gardens and terraces on the Bosporus. Prices for the 315 rooms have not dropped; a standard double is $320, a superior with sea view is $430.

Where to Eat
When the hustle of Istanbul gets to you, Korfez Restaurant, 78 Korfez Caddesi, (90-216) 413-4314, fax (90-216) 413-4306, offers a respite. Tucked into an inlet on the Asian side of the Bosporus, it is best reached by a free shuttle boat from the dock near Rumeli Hisari fortress. The salt-encrusted sea bass may be the best fish dish in town, and the Turkish appetizers -- mezes -- are unusual and refined. Reservations are required; ask for a waterside table. Dinner for two with wine, $65 to $80. Open for lunch and dinner daily, except dinner only on Monday. 
Chefs is a more inventive, hipper place, especially in its new summer location in Park Orman, Buyukdere Caddesi, Maslak, (90-212) 328-2000, fax (90-212) 328-2038. The two chefs who run it, Mike Norman, a South African, and Marco Anzani, an Italian, transform traditional Turkish ingredients into dishes like sea bass wrapped in potato and risotto with seasonal vegetables. Mezes come in tiny bowls so diners can sample many. Dinner for two with wine is $50 to $65. Lunch and dinner daily, except dinner only Sunday.
Despite its tourist attractions, Sultanahmet has few good restaurants. One is Balikci Sabahattin, Armada Hotel, 1 Seyit Hasan Kuyu Street, (90-212) 458-1824, fax (90-212) 458-1802, where traditional fish dishes, like jumbo shrimp baked in clay pots, are specialties. A meal for two with wine: $45. Lunch and dinner daily. 
Sazeli Durum Evi, 76 Mualim Naci Caddesi, in Ortakoy, (90-212) 260-6969, serves outstanding grilled meat in a homey setting for great prices. The best dish is the Sazeli special kebap, a sizzling plate of minced smoked eggplant, grilled meat and cheese. A meal for two is about $8; no alcohol served, and no reservations. Lunch and dinner daily.
The Tarihi Nevizade Meyhaneleri is a collection of traditional restaurants serving mezes, fish, meat and raki, the national drink. They are off Istiklal, behind the Cicek Pasaji, or Flower Passage; finding them is half the fun, as you pass stands of fresh fish, vegetables and spices. Prices and quality are pretty uniform, though Demgah, 18 Nevizade Street, (90-212) 245-0964, is a cut above. A meal for two with wine or raki, $25; lunch and dinner daily.

Start Me Up

BYLINE:  By Ivar Ekman 

 BODY:
 In 2000, near the height of the economic boom, 8.6 percent of American adults -- about 15.7 million people -- were in the process of starting businesses. In 2001, that number fell to 7 percent, or 12.7 million. Here, in ascending order of capital invested, are some who braved the tougher climate and got businesses rolling in the past 18 months. The costs reflect only what the owners spent before opening their doors. The break-even dates represent their own (optimistic) predictions.

Syreeta McDaniel
Business Consultant, Dallas

McDaniel, 29, started McDaniel Consulting, writing business plans for small companies, in June 2001. She kept her costs very low by finding cheap office space, recruiting unpaid interns and bartering with a Web designer, who created a site for her in exchange for her help in securing him a business loan.

Investment
Office furniture $1,000
Office supplies and stationery, 550
Marketing, 450
Membership and registration fees, 360
Insurance, first two months, 240
Rent deposit, first month, 140
Total $2,740

Source of Financing
Personal savings $2,740

McDaniel says that she made back her start-up costs within three months and had revenues of around $50,000 the first year. This translates into writing roughly three new business plans per week.

Dana Wright
Dentist, Anderson, Ind.

Instead of going to work for another established dentist, as most new graduates do, Wright, 26, went straight from Indiana University's School of Dentistry to establishing her own practice in August 2001. Wright also got a couple of unusually big breaks from the dentist with whom she shares a space -- first, he let her use some of his equipment; second, he gave her the first six months rent free.

Investment
Four years of dental school $139,000
Dental supplies and equipment 19,100
Office supplies and stationery 3,000
Legal and accounting fees 2,500
Setup computer services 1,500
Casualty and malpractice insurance, first year 1,100
State board exam 1,000
Advertising and marketing, 800
Credit-card services, 600
Uniforms, 500
Telephone installation, 400
Association dues and journal subscriptions, 200
Drug Enforcement Agency number
and state licenses, 200
Total $169,900
Sources of Financing
Subsidized and unsubsidized government
student loans $139,000
Bank loan 30,900

Wright started making a profit after three months, on expected revenues of $180,000 in the first year. This translates to about 40 patients per week. (An established dentist with two assistants, three hygienists and two office workers handles about the same number of patients per day.)

Peter Sclafani and Kristen Hallett
Restaurateurs, Brooklyn

Sclafani, 36, and Hallett, 38, opened the restaurant Luce in Park Slope in October 2001. Hallett is a photographer and a photo producer. Sclafani has owned and run restaurants in New York before. The couple designed the restaurant themselves and did a lot of the interior work, which cut down on their expenses considerably.

Investment
Construction $42,000
Decor and interior fixtures 29,000
Utilities and rent deposits 25,000
Kitchen equipment 24,500
Exhaust and duct work 20,000
Electrical and plumbing work 16,500
Extensive interior and exterior metal-design work 15,000
Initial alcohol inventory 10,000
Insurance, year of construction
and first year of business 10,000
Dishes and small wares 8,000
Antique bar 6,500
Exterior fixtures 6,000
Permits 5,000
Miscellaneous 5,000
Office supplies 3,500
Initial food inventory 3,000
Legal and accounting fees 3,000
Total $232,000

Sources of Financing
Loans from friends and family $132,000
Personal savings 50,000
Loan from Regional Economic
Development Assistance Corporation 50,000

Hallett and Sclafani say they will break even in two years, on revenues of $800,000 per year. To do this they need to serve about 420 dinner customers and 132 brunch customers each week.

Edward Kim and John Suh
Dry Cleaners, New Rochelle, N.Y.

Kim, 67, and Suh, 45, opened their Hangers Cleaners franchise in May 2002. Between them, they have previously owned dry cleaners, fruit-and-vegetable stores, grocery stores, wig stores and a paper company.

Investment
MICO2 dry-cleaning machines with Koolant Koolers, two sets each $360,000
Renovation 200,000
Electrical system 200,000
Other heavy equipment (washing machines, pressing machine, compressor, boiler, etc.) 200,000
Shipping and installation 95,000
Plumbing system 65,000
Computer system 28,000
Conveyor system 26,000
Franchise fee 25,000
HVAC (air-conditioning and heating) 21,000
Architect and permit 15,000
Rent deposit, two months (on a 15-year lease, with an option to extend for five years) 14,400
Sales counter 13,500

Total $1,273,100

Sources of Financing
Bank loans $700,000
Personal savings 253,000
Credit on payit-card loans 150,000

Kim and Suh say they will break even within six months on yearly revenues of about $1.5 million. To do so, they will need to dry clean about 5,000 pieces of clothing per week and launder 5,500 and make an additional $300,000 from their wash-and-fold and tailoring services.

Pat Kuleto
Vintner, St. Helena, Calif.

Pat Kuleto, 56, owns Kuleto Estate Family Vineyards, which he says will be fully operational in July. He is a restaurant designer and the majority owner in five popular restaurants in the Bay Area, including the Martini House in Napa Valley, which opened in November.

Investment
Cost of building wine inventory (including development
of vines and aging of wine) $5,500,000
Winery building (including production facilities, tasting room
and special-event areas) 5,350,000
Developing 100 acres of vineyard at $40,000 per acre 4,000,000
Acquisition of 100 acres at $15,000 per acre (1992 rate for undeveloped
hillside land in Napa Valley; today, that land is worth $75,000 to $125,000 per acre) 1,500,000
Wine-production equipment 570,000
Furniture and fixtures 200,000
Marketing 62,000

Sources of Financing
Personal savings and investments $8,207,600
Bank loans 7,000,000
Farm loans 2,000,000

Kuleto says that he will break even by the end of 2005, with revenues of $2.5 million that year. That means selling 5,500 cases of prime Napa Valley cabernet, pinot noir, chardonnay, sangiovese and shiraz, and holding about $200,000 worth of special events on the property.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 6-09-02: SALIENT FACTS; 
Down From the Peaks

BYLINE:  By J. R. Romanko 

 BODY:
The last economic golden age probably peaked not much more than two years ago. That's when the Dow Jones industrial average reached its all-time high of 11,723, on Jan. 14, 2000, just after a fourth quarter in 1999 in which gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 8.3 percent, the largest quarterly increase in just over 15 years. 
 But if that was the glorious then, we aren't necessarily in a leaden time now. The Dow is still bouncing around 10,000, and G.D.P. in this year's first quarter was 5.6 percent. Business bankruptcies have actually declined and productivity (output per worker per hour of work) rose an annualized 8.4 percent in the most recent quarter, the best performance in 19 years. So why does it feel as if we've experienced such a comedown? Here are some of the numbers that suggest it isn't all in our heads. 

Unemployment rate in April 2000: 3.9 percent (30-year low)
Unemployment rate in April 2002: 6 percent (8-year high)

Estimated decrease in the hiring of college grads from the class of 2002 compared with the class of 2000: 37 percent

Percentage of those surveyed in January 2000 who said that business conditions were good: 47.3
Percentage of those surveyed in April 2002 who said that business conditions were good: 19.7

Money invested by 916 venture-capital firms in 1,009 Internet companies in the first quarter of 2000: $15.7 billion (each figure a peak)
Money invested by 292 venture-capital firms in 202 Internet companies in the first quarter of 2002: $1.3 billion

Number of I.P.O.'s completed in the fourth quarter of 1999: 159
Number of I.P.O.'s completed in the first quarter of 2002: 16

Loss in market cap of the N.Y.S.E., Amex and Nasdaq combined from August 2000 to April 2002: $4.876 trillion Decline in assets of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation from 1999 to 2001: $6.9 billion (53 percent of its value)

Annual increase in giving by grant-making foundations in 2000: 18.2 percent
Annual increase in giving by grant-making foundations in 2001: 5 percent (smallest gain since 1994)

Annual increase in giving by corporate foundations in 1999: 15 percent
Annual increase in giving by corporate foundations in 2001: 2.6 percent (less than inflation)

Amount spent on additions to homes in 2000: $18.1 billion (peak)
Amount spent on additions to homes in 2001: $14.1 billion

Number of billionaires in the U.S. (Forbes 400 estimate) in 1999: 307
Number of billionaires in the U.S. (Forbes 400 estimate) in 2001: 266 J. R. Romanko

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 6-09-02: QUESTIONS FOR JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ; 
Think Global

BYLINE:  By Abby Ellin 

 BODY:
Q: Your new book, "Globalization and Its Discontents," which is being published this month, is already out in Germany and France. Why there first? To make a point about globalization?
 These issues are becoming more alive in Europe. So the German and French publishers really pushed to have it come out quickly. 
 What's the No. 1 "discontent"?
One charge, which has some validity, is that the International Monetary Fund undermines the democratic process, because it dictates policies. When Korea needed money, it was told, "Only if you open up your markets faster than had been agreed and only if you have a central bank independent and focused exclusively on inflation." 
In the United States, the Federal Reserve Board focuses on inflation, employment and growth. And yet the I.M.F. gave Korea no choice. 
It's not only that I think it's bad economic policy, but I think those are the kinds of things that countries should decide for themselves. The undermining of democracy, the lack of transparency, which results in particular interests being advanced often over broader interests -- that's one set of objections. And there is discontent as a result of the inequities in the global trading regime. For instance, many of the poorer countries produce agricultural goods, and advanced industrial countries have protected agriculture to the extent that the subsidies exceed the entire incomes in sub-Saharan Africa.
So you're probably no fan of the recent farm bill.
It is the worst form of political hypocrisy. The farm program had been originally prescribed to help poor farmers. Well, most of the poor farmers have left farming, and now the vast majority of the money goes to rich farmers and big corporations. That's the first moment of hypocrisy. At the global level, we have been going around the world telling countries that subsidies distort and lead to unfair competition. We have lost all credibility all over the world.
But what's wrong with taking care of your own before worrying about the rest of the world?
One of the aspects of globalization is the recognition that at one time we only had a responsibility to our own family, but as communities developed, your sense of moral responsibility went to your community, to your whole country. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't also feel a moral responsibility that goes beyond that. My sense is that most Americans do. It is part of the ethic of Americans, of every religion, to help people worse off than themselves.
Doesn't that make globalization as much of a moral argument as an economic one?
I also think that it's in our economic self-interest, because as the incomes of these countries increase, they will buy more of our goods. One of the major sources of our economic growth in the mid 90's was the growth of emerging markets. I also think it is a moral imperative -- both together. I sometimes worry that the economic argument takes attention from the moral argument.
Do you think it would be a good idea for the United States to write off debts of poor countries?
In many cases the debts are so large the prospect for reducing poverty is going to be very bleak unless we write off their debts. And some of the debts are cold-war debts. When we lent money to Mobutu, we knew the money wasn't going to the people in Zaire; it was going into Swiss bank accounts. And yet the people have to pay back the money. Another way of putting it is that every loan has a borrower and a lender. When the loan goes bad it's the lender's as much as the borrower's mistake. In the 19th century, when Mexico couldn't pay its debts, the French and British armies marched in. That's not the way we want to run things today. The result around the world has been bankruptcy laws, which are a form of debt forgiveness. That's the way we handle those questions of excess indebtedness within our country. Internationally, we have to do the same thing.
Last fall you won the Nobel Prize for work you started more than 30 years ago. While doing it, did you ever think it would get you a Nobel?
It sounds immodest, but the fact is when I was doing it, I knew that it would have profound implications for capital markets, labor markets, product markets. You know you make a step forward, but you don't know if it is just a half-step of what will be 20 steps or if this will be the big step. You never know the answer -- that's the nature of research. But 30 years later, you realize you were lucky.
Has winning the prize changed your life?
Yes and no. I had gotten a lot of honorary degrees already.
You hear about Academy Award winners who keep Oscars in their bathrooms. Where do you keep the medal?
The actual medal is gold -- I keep it in a safety deposit box. We have a replica. I don't know where it is right now, but I'll find it. Abby Ellin

HEADLINE: DANCE; 
No Longer Defenseless, Dance Finds an Advocate

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER DUNNING 

 BODY:
YOU could almost hear the collective thud of sinking hearts when the first announcements of the new Jazz at Lincoln Center complex were made two years ago. What about modern dance, that other indigenous American art form? It badly needs a theater of its own, with a seating capacity large enough for performances by major dance troupes. And why was dance hardly mentioned as a possible use for the jazz theater on dark nights?
 Some things have changed since then. The Joyce Theater in Chelsea has been prominently mentioned as a possible participant in the planning of an arts complex at the World Trade Center site. The Joyce has for several years been searching for a site or an existing building for a 900-seat theater for dance. Such a theater could be part of the downtown project. 
 Last week, a promising lobbying effort began when a national dance service organization called Dance USA announced the opening of Dance/NYC in Manhattan. Robert Yesselman, the director of Dance/NYC, maintains that dance, which played important role in the city's culture in the 20th century, must make itself heard more clearly. Some 400 dance companies, of every aesthetic stripe, are at work in the five boroughs. Dance/NYC aims to give them a unified voice. 
"New York is the dance capital of the world," Mr. Yesselman said. "The whole world knows of the centrality of New York to dance." With one exception, he added: New York City itself has little inkling of its importance to the history and production of dance throughout the world.
It all started with "the George and Martha story," Mr. Yesselman said: after George Balanchine and Martha Graham, "no one danced the same." First came Graham. In the late 1920's, working out of a studio on Ninth Street just east of Fifth Avenue, she developed and codified what we know today as modern dance. Nearly a decade later, Balanchine arrived and settled into a studio in an old building at Madison Avenue and 59th Street, where Isadora Duncan had once worked. His patron, Lincoln Kirstein, had intended to open a school in Hartford. It had to be in New York, Balanchine told Kirstein. And it was here that he began to create a new-looking, American kind of classical ballet.
From the start, there have been problems that kept dance from fulfilling that potential. Balanchine, for the most part, kept a distance from his dancers emotionally and disdained excess. "Just do it," he told them, well before Nike thought up the slogan. But Graham's companies often resembled dysfunctional families. Without emotional pain, there could be little or no artistic gain.
That attitude set the pattern for modern-dance companies. It also made it easier for dancers and their profession to be overlooked by a culture that believes work is validated only by pay. Who could take seriously workers who subsidized their art by performing for pittances or for nothing? Early reviewers recognized that it would be a struggle for modern dance to survive and flourish in competition with the more glamorous, safely European art form of classical ballet. And so they tried to help, becoming advocates for a sometimes tiresomely fragile-seeming art. The smell of need settled into the flesh and bones of modern dance.
And there was a larger, inherent cultural problem for all dance forms in America. From Isadora Duncan's first near-naked gambols, the exposure of the body in dance has offended or worried a Puritanical nation. Immodesty had the delicious taint of sin on the burlesque stage but not in the concert halls. Then there was the problem of the insubstantiality of dance. In drama there are words. In music there is a score you can hold in your hands. Sculpture is three-dimensional. Paintings feature figures, recognizable or not, that do not flee from the field of vision.
Dance frightens some new dancegoers, who tend to worry about "understanding" the leg stretched out into an arabesque or the torso wrenching inward in a Graham contraction. Sadly, marketing sometimes plays right into those fears. What could the New York City Ballet have been thinking, for instance, when it described certain weekend matinees as "family friendly"? (On a happier note, once reluctant men in City Ballet audiences now volubly explain to the women accompanying them the intricacies of the performance they're watching, having awakened, it appears, from their fabled torpor at the ballet.)
BUT now, Mr. Yesselman contends, dance may be more ready to fight for its place at the table, in part because an increasingly bad economy has driven dance to catch up with the other arts. Dance/NYC is responding with a Web site aimed at audiences and dance professionals.
The Web site -- dancenyc.org -- includes up-to-date information on dance and dance-related events in the five boroughs, with links to sites for individual companies. Dance/NYC has created temporary sites for troupes that do not have their own. There are also mini-interviews and lively chunks of dance history tied to the places in New York City where they occurred.
Another site lists available rehearsal and performance spaces in the city. Members will receive regular e-mail messages about new grants and corporate projects. Dance/NYC has also commissioned a survey on the economic impact of the dance industry on the city. It intends to show how much money is spent by dance organizations and audiences and how that money is spent by the people who receive it.
The Joyce began to work with arts lobbyists three years ago. Linda Shelton, the executive director of the Joyce and a member of the Dance/NYC advisory committee, found that some of the mystery was taken out of the process of working with city and state governments. Dealing with politicians and finding new donor sources began to get a little easier. "They get our name out to people in the political world that we might not know even exist," Ms. Shelton said. "And they don't necessarily know that we exist." That may be changing.

HEADLINE: MUSIC; 
Adventurous Punk Of a Troubled Past

BYLINE:  By BARRY SINGER; Barry Singer writes frequently about music and theater for Arts & Leisure.

 BODY:
FROM Poison to Beck and Moby, today's pop artists are recycling the musical schlock of the 1970's and 80's. Their fascination with kitsch, however, can make us all myopic. Unambiguously good music from those years is being overlooked.
 Take the British band XTC. The release of "Coat of Many Cupboards," a four-CD boxed set from Caroline Records covering XTC's prolific early years, 1978 to 1989, is currently generating hosannas from the English music press. Here in the United States, though, it has barely been noticed, which is a shame. 
 XTC first appeared on the London punk scene in 1976, just as punk music was about to evolve into new wave. A quartet initially, the group had two primary songwriters, the guitarist Andy Partridge and the bassist Colin Moulding. Though each wrote his own songs, they shared a gift for catchy, three-minute pop tunes in the Lennon-McCartney tradition. It was Mr. Moulding's "Making Plans for Nigel" from XTC's third album, "Drums and Wires," that finally landed the band on the British charts in 1979. The song reached only No. 17 in England, but that was enough; XTC began touring internationally, performing in New York at CBGB alongside Talking Heads, to whom it was then compared.
Meanwhile, the band members were seeing no money from their increasing record sales and finding themselves deep in debt to their label, Virgin Records. The situation gave rise to a lawsuit, in which the band members accused XTC's manager of borrowing heavily from Virgin against the band's royalties. The suit was settled out of court, with both parties barred from discussing the terms.
It is this period of creative ferment, commercial breakthrough and economic catastrophe that the first two CD's on "Coat of Many Cupboards" document. The final discs offer up music from the years following what Mr. Partridge calls his "nervous collapse," in 1982, after which the band quit touring for good. This collapse, triggered by Mr. Partidge's paralyzing stage fright and compounded by his having just kicked a Valium addiction, became a creative turning point for both Mr. Partridge and XTC.
Over the next 10 years the band recorded six increasingly accomplished, adventurous and idiosyncratic albums. From the stiff-jointed, ska-influenced new wave of their early years, Mr. Partridge and Mr. Moulding blossomed. Mr. Partridge, in particular, produced richly textured, elegantly structured tunes that, on occasion, even became mainstream radio hits.
Challenging yet accessible, these perfectly simple pop songs, like "The Ballad of Peter Pumpkin Head" and "Dear God," wove together ingenious sonic experimentation, wordplay and chiming vocal harmonies redolent of the later Beatles and Brian Wilson's "Pet Sounds."
Listening to this music today, one wonders whether there would even be a Moby or a Beck without XTC. Absent Mr. Partridge and his band's pioneering intelligence and craftsmanship, these studio-obsessed latecomers would not sound nearly as interesting. And none of them is remotely in Mr. Partridge's class as a writer.
True to their iconoclastic form, Mr. Partridge and Mr. Moulding have deviated from the familiar greatest-hits package on "Coat of Many Cupboards." Many songs are represented not by their original album versions but by early demos, outtakes, rehearsal dubs or live recordings. The compilation is, as Mr. Partridge described it recently, "something of a Savile Row suit, but with lots of food stains."
At 48, Mr. Partridge has not stepped onstage before a concert audience in almost 20 years. This is perhaps the main reason XTC never caught on in America. Unlike Sting and the Police (who, in 1981, toured here with XTC), Mr. Partridge and his band never provided America with much of a flesh and blood presence.
Still, XTC did enjoy a small but devoted following here and in England. In 1993, though, at Mr. Partridge's instigation, the band went on strike against Virgin. "We had the world's worst record deal," Mr. Partridge recalled, seated serenely now in the garden of the tidy house in Swindon that he bought with Virgin's initial advance. "We were never going to make any money. I asked Virgin if we could go and Virgin said no."
THE strike lasted until 1997, when Virgin released XTC from its contract. "The most difficult years of my life," Mr. Partridge said. "And I wrote a ton. It's either extreme joy or extreme pain that gets you going."
The fruits of this productivity were finally released in 1999 and 2000 -- two XTC albums on the independent label TVT: "Apple Venus," which featured a 40-piece orchestra, and "Wasp Star," subtitled "Apple Venus Volume 2," a return, in Mr. Partridge's words, to "sonorous guitar bashing." Both discs were critically acclaimed, but neither sold well.
"I realize, of course, that audiences have changed dramatically," Mr. Partridge said. " Still, it really was a kick in the groin for me."
XTC is, today, a two-man enterprise; the lead guitarist Dave Gregory, the band's last original member, fled in frustration not long ago. Caroline Records is nontheless planning to follow up "Coat of Many Cupboards" by reissuing XTC's first 10 albums. Could this mean that the band is being rediscovered?
"Nah," said Mr. Partridge. "I think we're just going to discover as this century grinds on that the three-minute pop song was, in fact, a 20th-century art form. Why is it fading away? Computers. People don't want to put the years in, the apprenticeship, learning how to make a great chair anymore. They can just press a button and -- phhlooff! -- this inflatable piece of furniture flips up in front of them."
How would he describe his own music?
"The pop canvas," Mr. Partridge replied. "Songs that are immediate but go on forever saying a good thing. Songs with no spare flesh. Songs full of surprises that delight on first hearing but hopefully you don't tire of easily; like naive art or toys. Though some of my music can be miserable" -- he paused -- "but delightfully miserable."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Fauquier County, Va.; 
Flurry of Development at Former Intelligence Post

BYLINE:  By JAMES R. HARDCASTLE 

DATELINE: WARRENTON, Va. 

 BODY:
THE closing of a United States Army post used for decades to eavesdrop on military and diplomatic communications has become the unlikely catalyst for a burst of new development in a largely rural county 40 miles southwest of Washington.
 The post is the former Vint Hill Farms Station, a 700-acre compound surrounded by horse farms and rural dwellings in eastern Fauquier County. Until it was closed in 1997 and its intelligence-gathering equipment removed, the dominant feature of the base was a vast field of antennas inside security fences. 
 Probably the first antenna installed by the Army at Vint Hill was in July 1942, when a long wire was strung out a window from the first floor of the recently acquired farm's estate mansion to a nearby tree to intercept messages transmitted in Nazi Germany. By August, a barn complex behind the manor house had been converted into a permanent intercept station and powerful rhombic antennas were installed. 
In 1943, according to an Army history of the post, a soldier working in the barn copied a coded radio message from the Japanese ambassador to Berlin to his superiors in Tokyo that gave a detailed description of the German Atlantic Wall defenses at Normandy and Calais. Because the Japanese diplomatic code had been broken, the intercept provided Allied planners with details needed to overcome German defenses.
Over the years, the Army suspended miles of antenna wire from poles in the fields at the base. The antenna arrays, which eventually spread over 450 acres, could be tuned to collect high frequency radio messages being transmitted to and from embassies in Washington.
From the late 1960's to 1974, Army Security Agency troops with special wide-band receivers were recording all signals that reached the agency's field stations around the world on inch-wide audio tape. The tapes were shipped to a bunkerlike operations building at Vint Hill where "signals of interest," according to the Army history, were extracted using highly classified techniques developed by the National Security Agency.
Most of the wide-band signals processed came from the Soviet Union and its satellites, but the Army admitted that on at least six occasions the Vint Hill facilities were used to spy on antiwar activists' radio communications in the United States.
When the Pentagon announced in 1993 that Vint Hill Farms would be shut down, people in Fauquier County feared the worst, said Hunton Tiffany, chief executive of the Fauquier Bank in Warrenton and chairman of the economic adjustment task force created by the county to study the reuse of the base. With its 2,656 workers, Vint Hill Farms was far and away the largest employer in this bucolic county of 55,000 on the fringes of Washington's northern Virginia suburbs. 
With its fabled horse farms in the northern part of the county and median household income of $62,103, Fauquier County was too affluent to qualify for economic aid offered by the Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration to many communities faced with base closings. Instead, the closing "presented Fauquier County with the kind of opportunity that only comes once in a hundred years," Mr. Tiffany said. 
In 1999, the Defense Department sold the land; the base's water, sewer and telephone systems; and an assortment of more than 200 structures for of $925,000 to an authority created by the state to redevelop the property. 
After lengthy negotiations with the authority, the county rezoned the site to allow for office and industrial use and 300 detached homes. The development authority, in turn, agreed to deed a 30-acre middle-school site, the base's former clinic and 18.5 acres of developed recreation facilities to the county. Recreation facilities at the base include a movie theater converted into a theater, a gymnasium, tennis courts and lighted ball fields and basketball courts.
Shortly after taking title to the base, the authority scored a major success when the Federal Aviation Administration purchased a 30-acre parcel for $1.66 million. The F.A.A. plans to open a 95,000-square-foot Terminal Radar Approach Control Center on its Vint Hill site early in 2003. The new facility , will consolidate radar control centers at the Baltimore-Washington, Dulles, Reagan National and Richmond airports and Andrews Air Force Base at a single site. The F.A.A. center will employ about 300 people making an average of $90,000 a year.
The F.A.A. purchase gave the authority needed cash. Even more important, it gave Vint Hill great visibility and validated it as a business location, Mr. Tiffany said. 
Pat White, the authority's marketing director, said recreational amenities at the base are a major plus in attracting new tenants and owners to Vint Hill. The authority also hopes to add to Vint Hill's attractiveness by restoring the 1860's Colonial Revival mansion that served as an inn and the base's officers' club. The former club is now used by Scott and Dawn Donaldson for a catering operation. In time, they plan to open a pub, an upscale restaurant and a bed-and-breakfast on the mansion property. 
In more than 200 buildings on the base, the authority has identified 400,000 to 500,000 square feet of space suitable for reuse. About 300,000 square feet has already been leased. Besides the F.A.A., the largest employer at Vint Hill is Gaithersburg Cabinetry and Millwork, a manufacturer of premium corporate interiors, which employs about 50 in the base's former commissary. 
Other major employers at Vint Hill are the Science Applications International Corporation, a large-scale systems integrator, which employs about 30 Web designers in a leased 9,000-square-foot building, and Log.Sec, a startup logistical engineering and information technology company with about 30 employees. 
Last summer, the authority sold a bunkerlike 80,000-square-foot concrete structure and 12 acres to Zumot Real Estate Management Inc. of McLean, Va., for $1.2 million. The building's features include eight-inch reinforced concrete walls, a concrete ceiling and multiple backup power systems. The company's president, Rajai Zumot, said he planned to convert the structure into a conventional office building. 
IN many ways, Vint Hill's modest sewage treatment plant is the most important building on the base. The 240,000-gallon-per-day plant is old and in need of renovation, but the plant has a permit that allows it to be expanded up to 1 million gallons a day. 
When that capacity is available for public use, new home and commercial construction is likely to soar both within Vint Hill, where 300 homes are to be built adjacent to the F.A.A. center, and on nearby properties to which sewer lines can be extended. 
Last year, permits for 581 new homes were issued in Fauquier County, double the number issued the year the base closed. This number is expected to grow in the years ahead. 
Miller & Smith, a builder and developer in McLean, Va., has options from the authority to buy the 78 lots that make up the first phase of Vint Hill's 300-unit residential component. Its two model homes have recently opened, and the company has already sold 12 units, with nine of the homes under construction. The homes have been averaging about $400,000 after options are selected. 
A development plan for 967 detached units to be built on nearly 1,000 acres that have been assembled next to Vint Hill was approved by the Fauquier County Board of Supervisors in May. . The developer, Edward L. Miller, said the focal point of the development, to be called Brookside, will be an existing 65-acre lake. The target price for new homes there will be $350,000, with some costing more, some costing slightly less.

HEADLINE: Almost Everyone Gets a Piece Of the U.S. Open Business Pie 

BYLINE:  By DAVID WINZELBERG 

DATELINE: FARMINGDALE 

 BODY:
A COUPLE of months ago, few Long Islanders looked forward to this week's United States Open more eagerly than Kelly Hicks. She couldn't tell Ernie Els from David Duval, but she's a real estate agent in Farmingdale and could recognize a potential for profit.
 Thousands of out-of-town fans, contestants, officials, media people and business representatives are descending on Bethpage State Park for the championship, which begins with Monday's first practice round and concludes on Sunday. Ms. Hicks figured some of them might show up without a place to stay. 
 "There is nothing available here," Ms. Hicks said. "No hotels, no motels, not even a bed-and-breakfast." 
Hotels as far away as Ronkonkoma have been sold out for the Open for months, many at rates between 30 and 70 percent higher than normal. The $160-a-night rate for two people at the Hampton Inn in Commack becomes $250 a night this week. Hotels close to the Open have been sold out for years. The Huntington Hilton was sold out for this week in 1999. The Inn at Fox Hollow in Woodbury was sold out for the Open before the hotel was built last year.
"If you work it a little you can find a room," insisted Michael Hollander, president of the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau, who expected some last-minute cancellations to free up a room or two.
After going door to door in the neighborhoods surrounding the park, Ms. Hicks signed up nearly 50 homes to rent, asking anywhere from $10,000 to $55,000 for the week. But by midweek, every one of them was still available, though Ms. Hicks is still hoping for some last-minute business.
"It was worth a chance," said Edgar Glascott, who offered his four-bedroom colonial-style house off Bethpage Road for $40,000. "We have a condo in Maine, so we could disappear for 10 days."
Whatever market existed was mostly satisfied by the United States Golf Association, organizer of the tournament, which arranged its own housing by compiling a list of area homeowners who had applied to the championship office six months ago.
Debbie Cichon, whose backyard faces the park, said she turned down $25,000 from a corporate representative. "It's a tough week," she said. "I have three boys in high school, and they have Regents and finals. If I'm going to pick up and stay with family in Queens, there would be a lot of commuting back and forth. For us to do that, it's got to be really, really worthwhile."
Some of her neighbors on Parkview Court have relinquished only parts of their homes, so they can stay put and still cash in. One rented his driveway as a motor home berth, and another gave up his front lawn for two of the hospitality tents that have grown like mushrooms around the course.
"There is not a huge market for houses for spectators," said Jonathan Barker, tournament manager. He said "only about five players" had rented homes here for this year's tournament. As for the rest, he said, "ticket holders are local and companies have rented hotel rooms." 
But no one should imagine that interest in this Open is lukewarm. The 42,500 tickets for each day's play are the most ever sold for an Open, and they sold out faster than any other Open. The 76 corporate hospitality tents are the most ever. This event has one of the largest corps of volunteers in Open history, and they enlisted in record time. The organizers estimate that a record 60,000 people (ticket holders plus staff and paid and volunteer workers) will be coming to the tournament each day.
It all adds up to big opportunities for business, and big logistical headaches.
"There's been more work in this Open than any other," said the U.S.G.A.'s Steve Worthy, who has planned parking and traffic for the last 11 Opens. "It's difficult anyway around here on a daily basis. We just want to make sure that we can get our people back and forth."
Road closings include the section of Round Swamp Road, from Quaker Meeting House Road to Winding Road, that bisects the Black Course, Quaker Meeting House Road in front of the course from Round Swamp Road to Merritts Road, and the entire Bethpage Parkway, which will reopen from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. this week.
"If people follow directions, I think the traffic plan will work," said Lt. Robert Nuzzo of the State Police.
The biggest part of the plan is limiting the number of vehicles in and around the golf course area. Which is why many of the 42,500 ticket holders will be heading to the beach. About 7,500 to 10,000 cars are expected at the parking lots at Jones Beach each day of the tournament, with shuttle buses taking them the rest of the way. About 5,000 cars, driven by some volunteers and some ticket holders with ZIP codes closest to SUNY-Farmingdale, will be using the park-and-ride service being offered from the university's lots off Route 110.
Organizers are urging ticket-holders to take the Long Island Rail Road to the Farmingdale station, where shuttle buses will also be waiting.
The police are hoping traffic tie-ups will be minimal. "We think there will be a trickle effect," Lieutenant Nuzzo said. "They don't come all at once. But I've heard about 40 percent of the crowd leaves when Tiger Woods finishes."
Mr. Glascott, whose home is a five-minute walk from the Bethpage clubhouse, was skeptical. "I think it's going to be a big inconvenience," he said. Residents of the area have been issued permits that will allow them access to and from their homes, but Mr. Glascott worried that no one would be able to visit him all week.
While traffic is a big concern, security is certainly another. The state, Nassau County and state park police, as well as the F.B.I., will have officers in and around the park during the week, and spectators are forbidden to bring backpacks, large bags, coolers and cellphones. Fanny packs and purses will be subject to search. And like at all P.G.A. Tour events, fans can bring cameras and camcorders only during the practice rounds on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
Much of the crowd management will be handled by a corps of 4,850 volunteers. The U.S.G.A. signed up its first volunteer for this week's event in October 2000. "Normally, it would take us about 14 months to sign up enough volunteers," Mr. Barker said. "Here it only took 7 months. It was the fastest we ever did it."
Volunteers are provided breakfast and lunch in their own hospitality tent. Of course admission to the tournament itself is the biggest perk. Volunteers can also cherish their official uniforms, although they had to shell out $140 apiece for them.
"They treat you very, very well, and we get to go in free every day," said Kathy Chagnon of Southold, who also was a volunteer at the 1995 Open at Shinnecock Hills in Southampton.
An additional 2,000 people were hired for trash pickup, to help build tents and bleachers, to help direct traffic and to wait tables or tend bar. And even though many of the companies providing services at the event are from out of town, plenty of business is done right here.
"We buy everything locally," said Susan Lacz Niemann, chief executive of Ridgewells, the Bethesda, Md., company that will cater the Open. Ms. Niemann said her company had hired around 800 people for the event, most of them from the Island.
Fred Heffel, a New York City fireman from Farmingdale, was hired along with several of his firefighter buddies to set up the hospitality tents with refrigerators, ice machines and other food service equipment. Mr. Heffel, who described himself as "a big golf addict," was a spectator at Shinnecock in 1995, but for this Open he has volunteered as a marshal.
Michael Rogers of Manhasset was hired to distribute beverages from tent to tent via golf cart. A recent graduate of Hofstra University, where he studied sports management, Mr. Rogers now works for the National Hockey League. He worked at Shinnecock in 1995. "I enjoyed the experience so I went for it again," said Mr. Rogers.
About 350 people, mostly college students and retirees, have been hired for parking lot duty by Country Club Services of Springfield, N.J. Charles Yeates, from Freeport, is a parking manager in charge of hiring and organizing the yellow-safety-vested attendants who will be directing traffic for $8 an hour.
Marie Kupfer, general manager of the Huntington Hilton, said she expected food and beverage sales to be at least 20 percent higher than a normal June week, when the hotel is usually only 80 percent full.
"The bigger picture is Long Island getting international exposure," Ms. Kupfer said. "Maybe it will help convince some people to move their businesses here."
Six years ago, when the U.S.G.A. first announced that the Black would be the site of the Open, experts estimated the tournament would pump at least $25 million into the local economy. Now Mr. Hollander said the figure should be closer to $85 million, with more in years to come.
"After the U.S. Open leaves, there will be people who will want to play a U.S. Open course," Mr. Hollander said. "This will get tourists coming out here from Manhattan. The repetitive business will be very substantial."

HEADLINE: A Personal-Injury Law Firm Is Shrunken by Sept. 11 Fallout 

BYLINE:  By MAGGIE JACKSON 

 BODY:
PROMPTED by personal and professional soul-searching after the Sept. 11 attacks, the senior partners of one of New York's pre-eminent personal-injury law firms have given away many cases, let much of their staff go and quietly transformed their big practice into a small boutique operation.
 Schneider, Kleinick, Weitz, Damashek & Shoot, a powerhouse of colorful personalities known for their multimillion-dollar verdicts, has shrunk from about 34 lawyers before the terrorist attack to 6 today, a downsizing that left some former employees bitter. Many of the firm's cases were given to two practices spun off by the senior partners' sons and a protege. One of those who left was Brian J. Shoot, a nonequity partner whose name was on the letterhead. 
 The restructuring of the firm, located in the Woolworth Building on lower Broadway just blocks from where the Twin Towers stood, shows how the attacks are still being felt in the local economy. They forced the firm to deal head-on with its future, including long-unresolved succession problems and differences among the senior partners. 
"This was the right time to say, 'Hey, let's stop the carousel and restart it the way we want it to be'," said Harvey Weitz, one of the four equity partners in the firm. "It made everybody reassess where they are and where they're going."
Mr. Weitz stresses that he and his partners, all in their 60's or older, are not closing shop, but rather are shifting gears. Lost business after the attacks made meeting the cost of the firm's overhead and 60-member staff "a headache," he said. "We had an empire," he said. "I'm frankly happy that we no longer have an empire."
Even though his wife has urged him to relax, "I don't intend to retire, nor does my partner Schneider," he said, referring to Ivan S. Schneider. Arnold L. Kleinick, however, wants to slow down, and Philip M. Damashek's plans are unknown, said Mr. Weitz, the only one of the four who agreed to be interviewed for this article.
In an area of the law known for showmanship and big verdicts, all four partners have long been major players. In 1993, in the largest verdict in New York State history, Mr. Weitz led a team of lawyers that won $197 million for five people injured when their rental car hit a parked truck, a case that was ultimately settled.
Mr. Schneider, Mr. Weitz and Mr. Kleinick became partners in the mid-1960's, then joined forces with Mr. Damashek in 1994. At that time, the newly merged firm had about 40 lawyers on staff. In 1999, in a move that made headlines, it allied itself with Johnnie Cochran, the West Coast lawyer best known for defending O. J. Simpson. That alliance remains intact, Mr. Weitz said.
Some of the firm's former lawyers regret the course that the senior partners have taken. "It's just a shame that a firm that appeared to have so much potential after the merger in 1994 should wind up in this position at this point of time, as opposed to growing and maintaining its position as the premier personal-injury firm in the city or state of New York," said Robert B. Jackson, a nonequity partner who ran the firm's medical malpractice department before joining Trolman, Glaser & Lichtman in April. "You'd think they'd have been training other lawyers to step into their shoes."
But Mr. Weitz said that after taking a hard look at the loss of incoming work after Sept. 11, the partners decided they could no longer rationalize keeping a big firm afloat. "We promised all these people we'd keep them on the payroll," he said. "We also said to ourselves, 'Let's take a look at this business.' We were saying that it's not worth the effort now that we're faced with the reality of cutting costs and cutting costs."
Sept. 11 brought many matters to a decisive point at the firm. For at least two weeks, employees could not return to their offices on lower Broadway, and some refused to return ever. Mr. Weitz said some phone lines were not restored until late May. 
A severe disruption in business is particularly damaging to a personal-injury firm, which depends on referrals from other lawyers and advertising, rather than on the long-term clients that fuel a white-shoe downtown firm. Also, personal-injury firms depend on unpredictable revenue from contingency fees instead of a steady stream of fees.
"It's a far more entrepreneurial business," said David Barnard, an adjunct professor at Columbia Law School who teaches a course on the legal profession. "They're being paid by the success of their litigation. They're only as good as the last case they've been able to obtain."
After the attack, the senior partners assembled their staff in Mr. Schneider's Fifth Avenue apartment and promised to keep them on the payroll, Mr. Weitz and former employees said. But as the disruptions continued, the layoffs and departures began. One who left was Mr. Shoot, who had been with the firm and its predecessor 23 years.
A number of lawyers laid off felt they were not given enough explanation and at least one felt betrayed -- especially because in 2001 the firm was awarded $98.4 million in fees from New York State over the next 20 to 25 years for suing the tobacco industry. "They sucked it all dry and they tossed us all out," said one former high-ranking lawyer at the firm, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "They used the excuse that they were having problems and financial difficulties internally when it turned out that they really just wanted to get out" of the business.
Mr. Weitz dismissed that criticism. "I wanted to get out?" he asked. "That's why I'm trying a case a month -- something most 40-year-olds don't do." He also rejected any idea that the settlement should have been used to keep the firm going at its former size. "To say, 'I'm going to reach into my pocket and pour money into this,' that doesn't make sense," he said. "Everybody who's ever worked for us who's been terminated, in the end will have benefited from whatever time they spent with us."
Still, he says he knows that the changes in the firm have left some unhappiness. "I know some people were clearly disappointed," he said. "We couldn't work out a succession." He said that it was not until March, when Mr. Kleinick brokered an agreement among the four, that the partners could agree on final arrangements for the future.
The senior partners will continue to try cases and the firm will continue to operate as Schneider, Kleinick, Weitz & Damashek until 2005, when Mr. Damashek will leave. But most of the caseload has been transferred to two new firms housed in the same offices: Weitz, Kleinick & Weitz, made up of three sons of the founders; and a firm led by Gregory J. Cannata, a close associate of Mr. Schneider for more than a decade.
The three sons -- Andrew L. Weitz, Paul B. Weitz and Keith A. Kleinick -- had previously worked or were working at the firm. But differences between their fathers had prevented effective planning for the future, a not-uncommon problem in a field full of somewhat flamboyant risk takers. After Sept. 11, the partners took a hard look at the business -- and their future.
"As long as the business was going along, nobody bothered looking," Mr. Weitz said. "We never thought twice about it. Then you wake up and say, 'Where are we going, and what's this all about?' "

HEADLINE: Center-Stage Living, at Balcony Rents 

BYLINE:  By NAHMA SANDROW 

 BODY:
IT took 10 years for Jim Houghton, the founding artistic director of the Signature Theater, and his wife, the actress Joyce O'Connor, to get their sunny two-bedroom apartment in the midtown luxury high-rise Manhattan Plaza -- long enough to have two children in the interim. But it was worth the wait. 
 Mary Jane Gibbons, principal dresser for the American Ballet Theater, calls Manhattan Plaza "a gentle society in the middle of the urban jungle." 
 The playwright Oscar A. Colon has a name for the entire city block that contains the project: 42nd to 43rd Street and Ninth Avenue to 10th. Besides the apartments, the building includes restaurants and shops, rooftop gardens and a health club; all of it, he said, adds up to "Happy Block." 
Sylvia Herscher, a theatrical manager, agent and music publisher who has lived here since it opened 25 years ago, calls it "the most talented village in New York City." The reason: roughly three-quarters of Manhattan Plaza's tenants are involved in the performing arts. 
Thus, notices in the lobby include announcements of the availability of voice lessons and collectible Playbills. Tickets for shows and concerts are available to tenants daily for a dollar, and there is a sign-up list for volunteers to give them out. A flier for a free "alternative health fair" is headed "Better Wellness and You" -- with the acronym, in giant capital letters, "BWAY."
As a cheerful young man carrying three full grocery bags plus a wiggly toddler passes through the lobby, a neighbor calls, "Hey, I saw you on 'Law and Order' last night!" Too encumbered to lift a hand or even turn his head, the young man turns once completely around and beams. "Yeah. Thanks." Then somebody pushes the elevator button for him, and he and his toddler ride up and home. He is not thinking -- and may not even be aware -- of the delicate combination of finance, politics and inspiration that produced this singular fusion of small town and Broadway.
Manhattan Plaza started going up in 1973: a pair of towers, 46 stories each, housing 1,689 apartments, from studios to two bedrooms. It was hoped that a Mitchell-Lama outpost in Hell's Kitchen, which was then dirty and dangerous, would stimulate economic revival, especially in the Times Square area. 
But costs and therefore prospective rents went up, and it was felt that nobody who could afford the spectacular views and plush amenities would be willing to live in a slum. The city government, riding out a fiscal crisis, had nothing to contribute. Construction stopped, leaving a completed tower and half of another beached like a shipwreck.
What rescued the project was what Irving Fischer calls a fluke convergence of circumstances. He and Richard Ravitch, general partners of Manhattan Plaza Associates, the limited partnership that owns the building, put together new financing, with a large public garage as the building's most important sustaining factor. Just then funds became available through the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 8 housing subsidy program in a one-time allocation to the city, and Manhattan Plaza was the only building in Manhattan to meet HUD's criteria. 
As a result, while 10 percent of the tenants would pay rents pegged to the market the remaining 90 percent would have their rent heavily subsidized by the federal government under the Section 8 program. And, at the suggestion of a builder, Daniel S. Rose, and the producer Alexander H. Cohen, Manhattan Plaza was reconceived as "the bedroom of Broadway."
A sampling of the negotiating parties gives some notion of how many constituencies the enterprise was supposed to make happy: the city's Housing and Development Administration; the Board of Estimate; the Settlement Housing Fund; Community Board 4;, the Clinton Community; the Broadway Association, an organization that promotes the economic health of the Times Square theater district; and eight performing arts unions. 
The formula they worked out after complex negotiations has held ever since. Of the 90 percent of the tenants subsidized by HUD, 70 percent must earn at least half their income as stage, film or television actors, singers or dancers; make-up artists, costumers or designers; voice coaches or composers of soap opera background music; stagehands or publicists or ushers. These stalwarts, who are essential to the arts but do not earn star salaries, can live somewhere decent and walk to work. (They may stay in the apartment even if they later change their professions.) 
The remaining 30 percent of the Section 8 tenants are drawn from Hell's Kitchen residents who are living in substandard housing or who are are elderly and disabled.
In 1977, when the building opened, theatrical unions and neighborhood churches posted fliers urging eligible tenants to apply for apartments. By 1978, Irving Fischer says with relish, Manhattan Plaza was "harder to get into than Harvard."
The final defining moment in shaping life in Manhattan Plaza came with the choice of Rodney Kirk, an Episcopal priest, as its first director. "Rodney," recalled Richard Hunnings, the late Father Kirk's companion and his successor as director of operations, "knew how to run a parish." 
SOON, there were tenant committees and get-togethers in the comfortable Ellington Room. December brought Christmas caroling, Three Kings celebrations and a menorah with candles. Summer brought free swimming for resident children in the health club pool. (The health club remains a private facility, but residents can take memberships at a discount.)
Like a bustling little village with about 3,500 residents, Manhattan Plaza has its own post office and polling place, its own preschool, Halloween pumpkins and Passover seders. 
For 25 years now, children have made friends in the playground between the towers and graduated from the slide to their big brothers' basketball team. Celine Havard from the West Tower and John Whitney from the East Tower, both married to other people at the time, met as parents on that playground; now they have a son together, and he's almost old enough to climb the slide himself.
Father Kirk's vision for Manhattan Plaza, Mr. Fischer said, "created the spirit and gave it a soul." In the early days, an elderly resident was discovered to have died and lain alone in his apartment for three days. Father Kirk was deeply shaken. Under his direction, the Staywell Center opened to guide elderly tenants to available services, help them in dealing with bureaucracy and coordinate visits and care, with the explicit aim of keeping tenants at home till the end of their lives. When one elderly resident, an opera singer, returned from the hospital in a wheelchair, the maintenance employees had already been alerted and had widened her doorway.
When a resident dies, the management places a vase of white lilies on the polished shelf just inside the lobby. A black-bordered card tells in careful script the name, dates of birth and death and apartment number. In this village, nobody lives or dies unnoticed.
And when Father Kirk died last year, the only memorial he wished was a vase of white lilies in the lobby.
More than one-third of the residents are 62 or older, Mr. Fischer said, and very few are inclined to move away.
Millie Pollio, who has lived her entire 83 years within a 10-block area, raised her children by herself in cold-water walk-ups in Hell's Kitchen. When she moved into Manhattan Plaza, her sister and her cousin got apartments too; she still cooks Sunday dinner for the family. She goes regularly to the senior citizens' coffee breaks in the Ellington Room and joins their bus trips to Atlantic City. For her, living in Manhattan Plaza is "vacation every day."
In 1985, when Manhattan Plaza was "the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic," Mr. Hunnings said, Father Kirk set up the AIDS Project to help stricken tenants feel part of the community. At lunches every Thursday, for example, resident clients share information about services and compare notes on drugs. Volunteers take AIDS patients to the theater. 
Dan Cronin expected to survive six months at most when the Actors Fund approved moving him into an apartment in Manhattan Plaza that had been designated for AIDS patients. That was seven years ago. Last St. Patrick's Day he was leading the Manhattan Plaza seniors in a program of Irish songs. For him, his new home turned out to be "absolutely a lifesaver." He added, "It's the little family things that when you're sick make a huge difference."
Manhattan Plaza's maintenance standards are high. "As far as we are concerned," Mr. Fischer said, "this is the Waldorf-Astoria."
Management maintains "constant vigilance." The corridors and back stairs gleam. Apartment walls are soundproofed -- important in a building with so many musicians. There are no forced break-ins. The head of security, Howard P. Slender, said, "We're better than the police."
At the same time, the property's management explicitly demands civic responsibility in residents. Mr. Hunnings, who has succeeded to many of Father Kirk's functions, recently explained it this way to a group of teenagers: "If we have to clean graffiti, we won't have time or money to improve the playground."
Actors make good neighbors, according to Jan Buttram, artistic director of the Abingdon Theater. "We sense people's feelings," she said. "It's our business. Besides, we do long tours in close quarters. We know how to give people space." 
Since performers are often free in the daytime -- in fact, they are often unemployed -- they are available to water a neighbor's plants when he is on tour. Or they understand that a last-minute audition callback means the need for an emergency baby sitter, fast. And if the actor does not get the job, they will sympathize.
It is natural that a new generation of Manhattan Plaza youngsters has stayed in the community by entering show business, among them Laron Holt, currently touring in "Stomp," and the pop singer Alicia Keys.
Although building etiquette forbids presuming on your status as a neighbor to try to get work, proximity often helps. Ms. Buttram was swimming in the health club pool when the director Peter Masterson suggested she check out auditions for the national tour of "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" -- and she got the role of Doatsey Mae.
The songwriter Susan Dias-Karnovsky loved the piano music she used to hear from behind a closed door opposite the laundry room. Needing an accompanist at the last minute, she knocked on the door, introduced herself and found not only an accompanist but also, eventually, a collaborator. Together, she and Armen Donelian created the improvisational singing segments that were a highlight of National Public Radio's popular "Kids America" in the 80's.
Miriam Cruz and Oscar A. Colon had been living in Queens when their apartment came through. "Out in the hinterlands," they recall, "you have to generate your own energy, but in Manhattan Plaza, there's that stimulating feeling of the arts." 
EVERY day there are likely to be people in the Ellington Room with its grand piano, in the basement practice room or in someone's living room, reading a new play or testing a new song or stand-up routine. "Here," the actor Michael Shelle explained, "we can take risks." 
As a result, a number of theater companies have begun in Manhattan Plaza, including Playwrights Horizons and Manhattan Punchline, which were pioneers on the emerging Theater Row across 42nd Street. (In fact, several of Theater Row's spaces got their first coats of paint from building residents who just stopped by to lend a hand.)
Kenny Kramer calls all this "cross-pollination." Yes, that's the Kramer from "Seinfeld." He and Larry David, both comedians, met when they participated in a cabaret evening planned as a new tenants' get-together. Next day at noon, Mr. David rang Mr. Kramer's doorbell for the first of many lunches. (In the process they tracked the commercial development of the immediate neighborhood from slum to chic, from a couple of take-out possibilities to a drawerful of menus.)
When Mr. David moved to the West Coast and co-created "Seinfeld," he included a character based on Mr. Kramer and named him -- Kramer.
Some apartments are museums of theatrical memorabilia. The actor Bruce Adler has a poster from his parents' appearance on the Yiddish stage in Paris. Harry Edwards has an autographed photo of an ineffably debonair Noel Coward whom he "dressed" in London half a century ago.
Ms. Cruz has a shelf of acting awards, including the ACE (Asociacion de Cronistas de Espectaculos, the Association of Hispanic Theater Critics) Lifetime Achievement Award for Contributions to Hispanic Theater. Linda and David Laundra, co-creators of the Writers Theater, which moved to Chicago in 1992 after almost 20 years in New York, have a pasteboard fireplace that they bought at a building rummage sale from a neighbor who built it as a stage set. 
HUD's Section 8 program specifies that tenants pay no more than 30 percent of their annual adjusted gross income up to the market price; the rest of their rent is subsidized.
Since people in the business generally have, as Mr. Fischer put it, "very little control over their income," the Manhattan Plaza system is extraordinarily flexible. If income suddenly falls or suddenly rises, the year's rent is adjusted. Tenants are not allowed to sublet while on tour, but they are allowed to deduct professional expenses, like answering service, glossy photos, musical arrangements, voice coaching and backstage gratuities.
The paperwork is intense. Every resident must verify income sources and assets annually through bank statements and notarized affidavits. In addition to this recertification process, the 90 percent who are eligible for Section 8 subsidies must annually file copies of federal and state income tax returns and forms, as well as of all contracts, receipts and other relevant documents. These documents fill hefty packages, and management scrutinizes each package every year because performers' working lives are likely to change every year. 
But the result for the Laundras is "freedom to do what we want to do with our lives because we know we have a place to live," Linda Laundra said. "Without it, we wouldn't be in theater." Certainly, with all the film and television jobs on the West Coast, she added, "We wouldn't be in New York City." 
Ms. Buttram thinks of it as "this wonderful grant to pursue a career in the arts -- the closest we have to a national theater."
Unfortunately, if you are a hopeful young artist thinking about living in Manhattan Plaza -- forget about it. As of June 1, the waiting list contained 1,195 names for the Section 8 apartments and 176 for the others. And the preliminary waiting list -- to get into the lottery for a place on the real waiting list -- is closed.

PERSON: DAVID N. SIEGEL 

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
In a Hurry to Sell Bitter Medicine

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
DAVID N. SIEGEL'S days have become a whirlwind of speeches and hand-shaking. He served Gatorade to US Airways ramp workers on May 24 in Philadelphia. Last week, he delivered his pitch to employees in Boston, and Orlando and Tampa, Fla., his words honed and his throat made rough from hours of giving the same talk.
 Mr. Siegel, the chief executive of US Airways, has met with workers at nine airports and other sites in the last two and a half weeks. He knows that he does not have much time, and he wants his employees to know that, too. This is what he tells them: His plan for revamping the airline, which he drew up to apply for $1 billion in federal loan guarantees, requires him to cut more than $1.2 billion in annual costs -- $950 million of it from labor. The application is likely to fail if the unions do not agree to concessions by Saturday, possibly forcing US Airways into bankruptcy. 
 The talk is simple and direct and would never be mistaken for the battlefield oration of Henry V, though Mr. Siegel has as much troop-rallying to do as any besieged monarch.
"We all have a vested interest in the future of the company," Mr. Siegel said in an interview. "The employees want to keep it going as much as they can. What's not in their interest is to see us fail."
Mr. Siegel, 40, took charge on March 6 with one goal in mind: to get the sickest of the major airlines out of intensive care and at least into rehab, if not back on its feet. He took the chief executive's job at Avis Rent a Car System only a half-year earlier. But the offer from US Airways, the country's sixth-largest airline, gave him a chance to revisit some of the ground he had covered at Northwest and Continental, only this time with the opportunity to play savior. He is moving from Houston to a suburb of Washington with his wife, Melissa, and daughter, Emily, 11.
"He's acting more like a surgeon coming to the rescue of a company that's dying on the table," said Gordon M. Bethune, the chief executive of Continental.
No airline suffered after Sept. 11 as much as US Airways, which is based in Arlington, Va., and has most of its routes on the East Coast. The government shut down Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, one of the airline's busiest centers, for several weeks. Many business travelers, already angry about the high price of walk-up fares, switched to trains, cars or videoconferences.
The airline reported a loss of $269 million for the last quarter, its seventh consecutive loss, and $2 billion in red ink last year. Just as worrisome, its $561 million in cash at quarter's end was draining away at $3.5 million a day. 
Facing a government deadline of June 28 for the loan application, Mr. Siegel started presenting the proposed cuts to unions last month. He opened the airline's books for union leaders to scrutinize and was confident that the raw numbers would convince them that US Airways was in an "unsustainable situation."
The unions have yet to form strong opinions about Mr. Siegel's tenure. Several labor officials say he has been more open about the bleak financial situation than Stephen M. Wolf, a former chief executive who is now chairman. But the unions say that Mr. Siegel was too slow in presenting his plan and that he now expects them to rubber-stamp it in some form.
"We can't let US Airways as a company off the hook for forcing the workers into this corner," said Jeff Zack, a spokesman for the Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 7,500 active workers. "The demands are absolutely unreasonable because of the time line and the severity of the cuts within such a short period. That said, the carrier does need help from its workers in order to survive."
Roy Freundlich, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents 4,800 active workers, said his union had met with executives several times and would try to work out reasonable concessions. But he said Mr. Siegel's talk of declaring bankruptcy if the loan application fails reminds employees of what he called the rhetoric of "deadlines and threats" used by Mr. Wolf.
The four largest unions say the concessions expected by Mr. Siegel are too much, although managers usually start with high figures and work down. But several executives who have worked with Mr. Siegel say they have faith in his ability to reorganize the airline. The travel industry seems to pervade his life, as evidenced by his interest in collecting antique maps.
Mr. Siegel graduated from Brown University magna cum laude, with a joint degree in applied mathematics and economics, and earned an M.B.A. at Harvard. He was a consultant for Bain & Company before landing at Northwest, where he was director of corporate planning.
But Mr. Siegel's trial by fire came at Continental, which underwent a broad restructuring after Mr. Bethune took over in 1994. Mr. Siegel helped close the airline's no-frills arm, Continental Lite, which had lost $140 million since it began. He later was president of Continental Express, the regional jet operator.
"Dave is an architect of our revitalized airline," Mr. Bethune said. "You couldn't ask for a better executive in charge of scheduling. He's no slouch on the other side either, when we had to make the company profitable and reliable. He put the investment in the maintenance programs that make the company work reliably."
When Mr. Siegel joined Avis, he brought along people he knew at Continental and Northwest. He set out to broaden Avis's customer base beyond business travelers and to raise revenue with an airline technique called yield management. "He's a rare combination of an excellent strategic thinker with very good operating skills," said John Chidsey, chairman of the vehicle services division of Cendant, Avis's parent. "He certainly helped us focus much more on the leisure business."
As he did at Avis, Mr. Siegel has hired colleagues from previous jobs. He says he needs people who can not only deal with labor, but can also carry out his other restructuring plans, which include finding a code-share partner, increasing the use of regional jets and strengthening hubs. 
When asked why they would join him at a floundering company, he said: "I don't know. Clinical insanity?" Then he gave what he said he believed to be the real answer -- the chance to experience the pure rush of transforming a company in a matter of months, something many executives yearn for.

HEADLINE: ENVIRONMENT; 
State to Buy Ski Area's Land To Preserve a Mountaintop

BYLINE:  By STEVE STRUNSKY 

DATELINE: VERNON 

 BODY:
After years of contention over plans to develop the top of Hamburg Mountain, the site of the Mountain Creek ski area, the state and the area's owners have come up with a arrangement intended to preserve the spot.
 In the deal announced last week by Governor McGreevey and other other officials here in Highlands in the state's northwest corner, the state agreed to pay $7.1 million for 1,700 acres atop the mountain, and the ski area's owners said they would drop plans to build a golf course. 
 "What we have put forward strikes the right balance between economic development in the valley and permanent preservation of the mountain," Bradley Campbell, the state's environmental commissioner, said in a telephone interview. 
Technically, Intrawest Corporation of Vancouver, British Columbia, will sell the state 467 acres for $7.1 million, and donate another 1,262 acres, on which it reserves the right to cut new trails within the existing ski trail system at Mountain Creek, New Jersey's largest ski area.
Intrawest, which owns with Stratton Mountain in Vermont and Whistler in British Columbia, had planned to put a golf course and more than 800 residences atop the mountain. Lorne Bassel, Intrawest's executive vice president, said the company still planned to spend more than $500 million on condominiums and shops, and perhaps a golf course, at the base of the mountain, in a plan that he insisted dovetailed with preserving the mountaintop. 
"Basically, its the right thing to do, environmentally and for business," Mr. Bassel said.
Last fall, the Sierra Club of New Jersey filed a lawsuit to block the company's mountaintop development plans, which had already been approved by the Vernon Township Planning Board. A state Superior Court judge issued a ruling in February sharply limiting development of residences on the mountaintop, but held off on the golf course after learning that the state was negotiating to buy the property. 
Meredith Robson, Vernon's township manager, said that though the mountaintop would not be developed and thus bring in taxes, local officials were satisfied with the agreement.
"We're always disappointed when we lose revenues," she said. But, she added, "I think we're satisfied with the results."
However costly the purchase, which used Green Acres money already set aside in a bond referendum, Mr. Campbell said it was a worthwhile remedy to the state's sale of 1,400 acres of the same property in 1988 for just $340,000 to a local developer who sold it to Intrawest for an undisclosed sum 10 years later. 
Another official at last week's announcement was the area's State Senator, Robert Littell, a Republican who is chairman the Senate Budget Committee. Mr. Littell's wife, Virginia Newman Littell, a former Republican state chairwoman, is a consultant whose clients include Intrawest. Mr. and Ms. Littell both denied that her business relationship with the company influenced the sale price or any other aspect of the deal. 
"I have never traded on my husband's name," Ms. Littell said. "There absolutely is no conflict." 
Jeff Tittel, the Sierra Club's executive director, said that the deal was an especially good one for Intrawest and Mountain Creek and that he was concerned about the environmental effects of the resort village Intrawest still plans at the mountain base.

HEADLINE: Personal Business; 
These Vacations Are on the House

BYLINE:  By JANE L. LEVERE 

 BODY:
ALLEN HEMPHILL, a retired Navy officer and real estate broker from the San Diego area, recently returned from what he calls a fantasy vacation with his wife, Jean: a five-week stay in a 1,800-square-foot house on 10 acres overlooking the ocean on the Hawaiian island of Kauai.
 But the best part of the trip, he said, was that their lodgings were free. 
 The Hemphills, both in their late 60's, stayed at that tropical house this spring as part of a home-swapping arrangement made with the owners through the International Home Exchange Network of Daytona Beach, Fla. The network is among a growing number of businesses that provide home listings and help arrange exchanges. The owners of the Hawaiian home have also stayed at the Hemphills' home, near the sixth green of the Meadow Lake Golf Course in North Escondido, Calif. 
Home exchanges are certainly not new. The concept was first developed in Europe in the 1950's. But the arrangements have become more popular worldwide with the help of the Internet; about 50 home-exchange companies have started online in the last three years alone. Many agencies are reporting increased interest of late, especially in North America, because of the weak economy and reluctance to fly overseas.
Before most of the industry went online, people interested in home exchanges often had to wait for printed listings that came out two or three times a year. Now members of the online services can scan updated listings on an agency's Web site, then send e-mail messages to other members whose homes interest them. Deals can sometimes be completed in a matter of hours.
Of course, the main advantage to a home swap is the savings. Vacationers do not have to pay for a hotel, can cook as many meals at home as they want and, in some cases, can even borrow the homeowner's car. (Gasoline and long-distance calls may be extra.)
And you live not as a tourist, but as a native.
"You move into a nice little house in the middle of town; the neighbors invite you out for dinner," said Bill Barbour, a retired publishing executive from Fort Myers, Fla. who has written books about home exchanges. "You get a feel for the country." 
But there are obvious disadvantages. Many people may not feel comfortable having strangers staying in their homes, and there is a chance that personal property can be broken or stolen, although the agencies say that rarely happens.
A few steps can be taken to increase the comfort level. The first is to work with a reputable home-exchange agency. There are many agencies from which to choose, and most will charge an annual membership fee, usually less than $100.
The two oldest home-exchange companies -- HomeLink International (www.homelink.org) and Intervac International (intervac.com) -- list more houses than others, charge steeper fees and continue to publish directories, a service that many of their competitors have discontinued. HomeLink, which lists some 13,000 homes, mostly in Western Europe, charges an annual online membership fee of $60 and an additional $50 for its directories. Intervac, which lists 6,000 homes in 30 countries, offers a $50 Web-only membership and a $99 membership that also includes a printed directory.
Other home-exchange companies, all with Web sites, offer listings for anywhere from 500 to 5,000 homes and charge fees that range from $6 for a two-month listing to $50 for a one-year online membership. These include Digsville (digsville.com); the Global Home Exchange (4homex.com); HomeExchange.com (homeexchange.com); the International Home Exchange Network (home-exchange-network.com); the Landfair Home Exchange Club (landfair.com); Latitudes Home Exchange (home-swap.com); and Vacation Homes Unlimited (vacation-homes.com).
Exchange members prepare descriptions of their homes for the online listings, including details about the layout and furnishings, the neighborhoods and nearby attractions -- and their cars, if they intend to lend them. Photographs and videos are also useful.
Some members, of course, have far different considerations than others. If your home is filled with valuable antiques, for example, you may not want to arrange an exchange with a family with small children.
Once you find a suitable candidate, it is important to negotiate details and, if desired, to put them in writing, home-exchange experts say. Specifically, you must negotiate the dates; the exchange of a car; who pays for utilities, telephone and cleaning expenses; and who takes care of pets. The experts also suggest asking homeowners for references from previous home exchanges.
It's not always necessary to swap for a home of similar value. To many people, the location is most important.
"Although I've stayed in a $2 million home in London, my favorite home there was a small apartment in the middle of Kensington, because that's where my wife, Mary, and I wanted to be," said Mr. Barbour, who uses a home that he owns in Sanibel Island, Fla., for his exchanges.
INSURANCE is another issue. Although your homeowner policy usually remains effective when a guest stays in your home and the same should hold true for the house where you stay, car insurance can be trickier. Policies should be checked.
Lois Sealey, the owner of Home Base Holidays (homebase-hols .com), in London, says the most serious problems her clients have encountered concern "differences in housekeeping standards, which you can't legislate."
Pauline Frommer, a contributing editor to Arthur Frommer's Budget Travel magazine and a home exchange participant herself, said, "People who do this seem to be honorable, lovely people, and you both have each other's house as hostage."

First the College Diploma, Then the Internship

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS 

 BODY:
FACING one of the worst job markets in years, many recent college graduates are heading directly to graduate school or biding their time with volunteer work or temporary jobs outside their fields. An increasing number, though, are discovering another fallback: post-graduate internships.
 The arrangement seems to make sense for all parties involved, at least on paper. 
 The graduates get their feet in the doors of potential employers while building professional resumes. The employers, meanwhile, can supplement their work forces, many of which have been reduced, while building a pool of candidates for future hiring. 
But not everyone is happy with the trend. Some employment agencies complain that the postgraduate interns may be butting heads with temporary workers and professionals with one or two years of experience. 
"In taking these internships, they could be taking away work from these other two groups," said John A. Challenger, the chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm. "Companies are definitely exploiting the situation; they're getting good-quality work for very low pay."
Some internships are unpaid, while many others provide only small salaries or stipends, without benefits. The highest salaries, experts say, are usually from larger companies, particularly in financial services.
John Gramer, branch director for the New York office of Spherion, a professional recruiting firm, says financial services companies have been stepping up their use of interns. Many of them, he said, have cut jobs because of weakness in the economy and on Wall Street. He estimates that large accounting firms like PricewaterhouseCoopers typically hire one out of every 10 interns they employ.
THE hope for permanent work -- not the money -- prompted Rona Cooper, 23, an honors student who received a bachelor's degree in communications from George Washington University in May 2001, to accept an internship recently at the Bohle Company, a public relations firm in the Century City section of Los Angeles. She is paid about $1,200 a month and receives no benefits.
But Ms. Cooper is grateful for the opportunity to work. She sent dozens of resumes and had many job interviews over the last year, but to no avail. The internship is her fifth; she had four as an undergraduate.
"Everybody is teasing me because I still don't have a real job," said Ms. Cooper, who lives in Beverly Hills, Calif., with her parents.
Forty-eight percent of college students graduating this spring said they did not expect any job offers by graduation day, according to a recent survey by MonsterTrak, an online job site. Eighty-five percent said that they would accept a part-time internship, paid or otherwise, just to be working this summer.
Employers are hiring 36 percent fewer new college graduates this year than they did in 2001, according to survey results released in April by the National Association of Colleges and Employers.
Hiring projections declined most among consulting firms, plummeting nearly 90 percent, followed by automotive and mechanical equipment manufacturers, down 63 percent, and computer and business equipment manufacturers, down 59 percent, the association found. 
Concerned about such prospects, Julie Claggett, 23, who graduated last month from the University of Central Oklahoma, extended her internship in the marketing department of Express Personnel Services in Oklahoma City. Ms. Claggett says she earns $300 a month for full-time work and has to wait tables at night to make ends meet. But she hopes to have a permanent job in September, when company officials say their hiring freeze is expected to end.
She is gaining job experience, she said, by working on projects normally handled by more senior employees. 
Ms. Claggett said she was recently asked to create a recognition program commemorating the anniversaries of the company's 400 franchisees.
"My boss told me to be as creative as I wanted," she said. "It's an opportunity to demonstrate my knowledge and interest in the company."
Of course, a postgraduate internship does not always translate into a full-time, permanent job. Interns must make themselves stand out if they hope to be hired, or at least receive good references. 
Judy Steele, who supervises Ms. Claggett at Express Services, says she hopes to hire the intern after the summer as a public relations specialist, in part because of Ms. Claggett's enthusiasm for the job and her problem-solving abilities. 
Ms. Steele oversees about 15 interns a year. She says she will consider hiring only those who treat their internships like real jobs and show initiative. That may include asking to attend strategic business meetings, asking questions of colleagues and observing problem-solving processes.
"There are some interns who sit at their computer waiting for something to do," Ms. Steele said. "They don't ask questions or talk to anyone outside of their department."
She said she has hired four interns in the last five years. Among them was Maurissa Buchwald, 23, of Frederick, Okla., who joined the staff about 18 months ago. Ms. Buchwald, who grew up on a farm, apparently impressed her superiors with take-charge abilities and her knowledge of horses.
As an intern, she was assigned to help Ms. Steele coordinate a media tour that involved Clydesdale horses visiting some of the company's franchises. Rather than just following orders, Ms. Steele said, the intern identified a major problem with the tour.
"The franchise owners were responsible for taking care of the horses when they arrived, and she realized that they were baffled at how to do so," Ms. Steele said.
Without being asked, she said, Ms. Buchwald created a checklist to help the owners make arrangements for the horses, which included everything from stables to finding the right kind of hay.
Ms. Buchwald is now a permanent public relations coordinator -- and part of her job is to lead the Clydesdale tours.
EVEN if they are not hired permanently, interns can meet networking sources who can eventually lead them to other jobs.
Debra Condren, a clinical psychologist and career strategist in San Francisco, advises recent graduates to make a list of all the people they have worked with as interns and to select a few to consult for help in finding a job, creating "an informal career advisory board."
"Then, hold a 'quarterly board meeting' in a nice restaurant, and pick their brains about what you should be doing to find a job, and who you should approach," she said. "Bring a tape recorder so that you can capture all of the good ideas that will be flying across the table."

Bond Funds, Now Up to the Minute

BYLINE:  By ABBY SCHULTZ

 BODY:
EXCHANGE-TRADED funds, which track the equity markets like indexed mutual funds but trade throughout the day like stocks, have been among the most popular Wall Street innovations of recent years.
 Barclays Global Investors is now preparing to introduce in the United States the first exchange-traded funds that track bond indexes. Late last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission gave Barclays tentative approval to offer seven fixed-income funds in late July. ETF Advisors, a new investment firm in New York, is also seeking approval to start its own such funds. 
 The funds are intended to provide investors with many benefits of stock E.T.F.'s, which offer a relatively inexpensive, tax-efficient way to buy and sell investments with continuously updated prices.
Barclays has been offering exchange-traded bond funds in Canada since November 2000. There, small investors can effectively buy a portfolio of 5-year or 10-year government notes by buying only a few fund shares. Because they are in a huge investment pool, the investors receive the same discounted bond prices as big traders, said Steve Rive, general manager for iUnits, the E.T.F.'s offered by Barclays in Canada. "That's the real value proposition of these funds," Mr. Rive said. "People are able to get access to wholesale pricing," he said.
Still, exchange-traded bond funds may face a more difficult reception in the United States than E.T.F.'s that track stock indexes. Some of the selling points of such stock funds may not be as compelling for bonds.
"Two of the big supposed advantages of E.T.F.'s, that apply strongly with equity E.T.F.'s, don't shine as brightly in the fixed-income area," said John Loftus, a managing director at Pacific Investment Management, referring to intraday trading and tax advantages. The firm manages $254 billion in bond assets, but he said it has no immediate plans to start such funds.
Yet exchange-traded funds have advantages. Costs tend to be lower than those for actively managed mutual funds, because the E.T.F.'s track indexes and trade infrequently. Unlike conventional indexed funds, exchange-traded funds must be bought through a broker, so investors pay a commission each time they make a trade. 
In 2001, the average expense ratio for exchange-traded stock funds was 0.48 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., compared with 0.89 percent for traditional stock index funds. Bond index mutual funds had an average expense ratio of 0.35 percent.
Barclays has not disclosed the pricing on its new funds. But the firm's exchange-traded stock funds often have the lowest cost among E.T.F.'s, and the firm intends to price the bond funds "aggressively," said Lee T. Kranefuss, the chief executive of Barclays's individual investor business.
Day traders have embraced exchange-traded funds because they can be traded often. By contrast, a traditional mutual fund can be traded only at its price at the end of the day. Mr. Loftus contended that day traders are unlikely to flock to exchange-traded bond funds because the bond market generally does not fluctuate as widely as the stock market, and few traders would feel the need to capitalize on short-term moves.
That is generally true for most individual investors. "We don't give a hoot whether we get the 10 a.m. price or the close of market price," said Michael Fitzhugh, a financial adviser in San Francisco.
Still, Barclays says exchange-traded bond funds offer trading versatility. Someone who thinks stocks are undervalued, for example, could sell exchange-traded bond funds and buy exchange-traded stock funds at the same time, Mr. Kranefuss said.
Professional traders may find the continuous repricing of E.T.F.'s for bonds useful in large transactions, where tiny changes in price add up to big differences in profits. Institutions with large amounts at stake could use the funds to take advantage of sharp market moves -- if the Federal Reserve unexpectedly changed interest rates, for example. The new funds may also be useful to traders who want constant exposure to the bond market when moving cash from one investment to another, he said.
THE bond E.T.F.'s are also expected to give individual investors more access to price information on bonds. While investors can buy bonds directly from the Treasury, secondary market offerings and corporate bonds are sold through brokers, and prices of most of these securities are not centrally listed, as stocks are. "By packaging these bonds in the form of an E.T.F. you are pulling that bond trade out into the daylight," said Mr. Rive at Barclays.
Because many bonds are not widely traded, brokers typically add a fee to the price. "You can pay a 5 percent premium -- a year's worth of interest," said Mr. Kranefuss at Barclays, adding that his firm had the market power to minimize such fees.
Exchange-traded stock funds have generally not incurred the capital gains distributions borne by traditional mutual funds, but that is not likely to be a great advantage for bond investors. Except for municipal bonds, which are tax-sheltered, virtually all bonds and bond funds generate substantial taxes because most of their return comes from ordinary income, not capital gains.
The Vanguard Total Bond Market fund, which tries to match the performance of the Lehman Brothers aggregate bond index, has distributed 6 cents a share in capital gains since the start of 1994 while distributing $5.23 a share in ordinary income, said Eric Jacobson, an analyst at Morningstar. The actively managed Pimco Total Return Bond fund has a potential capital gains exposure of 1 percent, Morningstar says.
Before investing in a bond E.T.F., Mr. Fitzhugh, the San Francisco financial adviser, would consider whether the savings are enough to justify the brokerage fees. His firm, Kochis Fitz Tracy Fitzhugh & Gott, says investors in taxable accounts can save a tenth of a percentage point through lower expenses and higher tax efficiency in a stock exchange-traded fund if they have at least $10,000 in the account and plan to hold it at least two years. In this example, the investor would save about $100 a year, enough to justify brokerage fees.
He expects to make similar calculations before recommending that investors buy the bond E.T.F.'s instead of index funds like those offered by Vanguard. "There's not a lot of room to price them lower than the Vanguard funds," he said. The new funds will have advantages, he said, but they are not likely to be overwhelming for most of his clients. "It's better than a poke in the eye, but it's not a revolution," he said.

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF; 
An Ivory Tower Embrace of Views in the Streets

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

 BODY:
FOR several years now, a fractious debate about the role of the big financial institutions in the globalized economy has encircled the world's policy makers, moving from the initial grumblings of the often-unheeded developing world through the street protests of Seattle and elsewhere and on to a much broader agenda.
 With "Globalization and Its Discontents" (W. W. Norton, $24.95), Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in economic science in 2001, has taken the discussion a step further. He shows just how much the protesters' misgivings about and outright hostility toward some of those institutions have moved from the fringes into influential, mainstream thinking. 
 Professor Stiglitz, a former top economic adviser in the Clinton administration and chief economist at the World Bank, is now an economics professor at Columbia. He has long been associated, of course, with the economics of growth and development in the third world. With this accessible, provocative and highly readable study, he brings an insider's insights into the crises of the 1990's and beyond, from East Asia to Russia and on to Argentina. 
His central thesis is simple -- that the "market fundamentalism" of the International Monetary Fund, with its insistence that markets themselves will achieve a balance between supply and demand, furthering growth and development, is fundamentally flawed. The I.M.F.'s prescriptions in times of economic crisis, he writes, have caused far more human suffering than they have resolved economic problems.
Globalization has been badly managed, he contends, colliding head-on with some of the nostrums of the I.M.F. and what is sometimes called the Washington Consensus. Those include the idea that poverty is eased by the trickle-down effect of prosperity for the elite and that governments should not get in the way of the markets.
He goes further, embracing ideas once thought the exclusive preserve of the street protesters: the I.M.F. and the United States Treasury Department, he contends, pursue the interests of the big investment banks rather than the poor most directly affected by their macroeconomic solutions to crises like those in East Asia and Russia. Indeed, those interests seem intertwined in the very personalities who exerted such enormous influence as globalization emerged as the dominant force of the 1990's.
After all, he says, did not Robert E. Rubin, the former United States Treasury secretary, hail from Goldman, Sachs and move on to Citigroup after his spell in Washington? Did not Stanley Fischer, the former No. 2 executive at the I.M.F., go directly from that job to a well-paid position at Citigroup?
"One could only ask: Was Fischer being richly rewarded for having faithfully executed what he was told to do?" Professor Stiglitz writes.
The World Trade Organization, too, Professor Stiglitz asserts, promotes the interests of the developed world. The developing world, he says, still labors under unfair rules that restrict access to richer nations that preach trade liberalization but keep their own markets closed.
That is a hypocrisy, he says, that extends to the readiness of the global institutions to bail out their "client" states, differentiating between the strategically significant and the rest. "The I.M.F. is a political institution," he writes, saying the fund was ready to ignore runaway corruption in Russia to rescue Boris N. Yeltsin while suspending aid to Kenya on grounds of corruption.
Of course, it would be disingenuous to ignore Professor Stiglitz's own background as chief economist at the World Bank for almost three years, from 1997 to early 2000. In this study, the bank is spared the searing indictment that Professor Stiglitz reserves for the I.M.F. Yet the two are sister organizations, set up together after World War II. And much as he inveighs against what he calls the I.M.F.'s hard-nosed approach to economic crisis, the World Bank itself withholds loans to developing countries that fail to secure the I.M.F.'s imprimatur on their economic performance.
To that extent, the World Bank itself creates part of the pressure, particularly on developing countries, to accept those same I.M.F. prescriptions that Professor Stiglitz finds so distasteful. Often enough, however, officials of the two institutions behave more as rivals than as colleagues.
Not surprisingly, part of the book's purpose seems to be an attempt to ensure that events during his World Bank tenure do not besmirch his own reputation. In the process, one suspects that some score-settling may well be in play.
Significantly, though, Professor Stiglitz dismisses any illusion that the protesters on the streets of Prague, Seattle or Genoa were some kind of lunatic fringe whose arguments will disappear easily. "For decades the cries of the poor in Africa and in developing countries in other parts of the world have been largely unheard in the West," he writes, and it was only the street protesters "who have put the need for reform on the agenda of the developed world."
Once the issue is on the agenda, of course, the discussion moves on to reform issues that have absorbed some strategic thinkers since the late 1990's. Part of his message reflects his argument that the global financial institutions have drifted away from the Keynesian principles on which they were founded. The I.M.F.'s "market fundamentalism" -- placing much faith in freewheeling markets -- has not worked, he contends, as much as the economic policies of nations like Malaysia, where government intervention provided protection from the worst of the East Asia crisis.
The countries that have benefited most from globalization, he writes, "have been those that took charge of their own destiny and recognized the role government can play in development rather than relying on the notion of a self-regulating market that would fix its own problems." Equally, though, he says that far greater openness and democratic responsiveness are long overdue, both in the governments of developing countries and in the secretive global institutions where decisions are routinely made in private.
AS much as anything else, Professor Stiglitz says, all countries should have a clear picture of what development is supposed to achieve. "It is not about bringing in Prada and Benetton, Ralph Lauren or Louis Vuitton for the urban rich, leaving the rural poor in their misery," he says. Development, he says, "is about transforming societies, improving the lives of the poor, enabling everyone to have a chance at success and access to health care and education."
Judged from that viewpoint, the record of globalization has been patchy to date. 
And, Professor Stiglitz says, "if globalization continues to be conducted in the way that it has been in the past, if we continue to fail to learn from our mistakes, globalization will not only not succeed in promoting development but will continue to create poverty and instability."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Bernard R. Horn Jr.; 
Polaris Global Value Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
IN some respects, investing overseas was more challenging two decades ago, says Bernard R. Horn Jr., who runs the Polaris Global Value fund.
 "It was difficult to make overseas telephone calls in 1980, and even more difficult to get annual reports, let alone that most of them were written in different languages," Mr. Horn said from his office in downtown Boston. 
 All those tasks have become much easier, he said. But in some of the most important areas of financial accounting, significant disparities remain, and they are big enough to make the difference between a profitable investment and a losing one. These include policies on pension liabilities, depreciation, amortization and other issues that may vary from country to country. 
Such accounting differences, combined with the possibility that earnings have been managed to please investors -- a practice hardly unknown in the United States -- make earnings a very unreliable indicator, Mr. Horn said. A better standard for comparison, he said, is cash flow from operations after interest and taxes. 
The fund returned 8.4 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with declines of 1.7 percent for all world stock funds and 6.5 percent in the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe Australasia Far East index, according to Morningstar Inc. The portfolio gained 11.8 percent in the last 12 months, compared with losses of 13.3 percent for its group and 12.7 percent for the index. The fund has $35 million in assets.
Mr. Horn, 47, is president of Polaris Capital Management, the fund's adviser, which also manages about $150 million for institutions and individuals. The Global Value fund, which started as a limited partnership in 1989, was converted to a mutual fund in May 1998.
He chooses the 55 to 75 stocks in the fund among companies of all sizes around the globe, including the United States, with no limit on the amount he can invest in any country. He looks for what he calls the "most undervalued streams of cash flow."
Two computer models whittle down the 20,000 or so companies in his universe to about 500. The first model uses multiples of price to cash flow and price to book, as well as other valuation measures and macroeconomic indicators like interest rates and inflation, to screen 44 countries and 23 industries worldwide.
A second model screens cash flow statements, balance sheets and other financial data, looking for securities that may be mispriced. He aims to buy companies at discounts of at least 25 percent to what he believes they are worth.
Cash flow is important -- particularly free cash flow, the amount remaining after capital expenses are paid. 
He also looks for growth in operating margins and revenue, and he prefers companies that have little debt.
Mr. Horn estimates that he spends about 90 percent of his time poring over financial statements of the companies on his short list, paying special attention to executive stock option plans, convertible bonds and other indicators that shareholder value may be diluted. 
Right now, he sees much value among the United States financial services companies, British home builders and natural resources companies in South Africa. 
Mr. Horn started buying shares of the Astoria Financial Corporation, based in Lake Success, N.Y., just eight days after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, and has paid an average price of $28. They closed on Friday at $34.75, compared with his two-year price target of $50.
Astoria, which specializes in residential mortgages, has very low default rates, Mr. Horn said, and a loyal base of depositors in the New York metropolitan area. The company's high level of customer service, he said, makes Astoria more attractive to customers as bigger banks consolidate. 
HE recently added to his holdings of Barratt Developments, a home builder in Britain. He starting buying the stock in November 1998 and has paid an average price of 206 pence a share, or $3.33, for the entire position, he said. The shares now trade at 450 pence, or $6.58, compared with his target price of $7.33.
Barratt is benefiting from stable interest rates and a government program encouraging builders to create residential developments.
In South Africa, Mr. Horn likes Sasol Ltd., which converts coal and natural gas into liquid fuels and chemicals. Sasol has little exploration risk, he said; it uses natural gas that would otherwise be discarded by big oil companies, and it can easily mine additional coal. 
He started buying shares last November and has paid an average price of 83 rand, or $9.23; the shares now trade at 113.5 rand or $11.48, compared with his target price of $15.56. 
The American depository receipts of Sasol, which are traded on Nasdaq, closed on Friday at $11.69.

Many Signs of a Recovery, Except Among Investors

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
THE economic outlook is positive, even if it is not as robust as it was a few weeks ago. Some forecasters are talking about a 4.5 percent annual pace of growth in the second quarter and almost 5 percent for the full year.
 But investors are not convinced. 
 The three major stock indexes have fallen for three consecutive weeks and are now at their lows for the year. The Nasdaq composite is down 21.3 percent in 2002, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is off 10.5 percent and the Dow Jones industrials are down 4.3 percent. 
Analysts are still predicting that corporate earnings will turn around soon, ending a five-quarter decline. The current forecast for operating-earnings growth in the second quarter is 3 percent compared with the same period last year, according to Wall Street estimates compiled by Thomson Financial/First Call. 
But that is not enough to offset the damage to investor sentiment as Congress investigates when and what the government knew about terrorist threats ahead of Sept. 11. Investors have also been bothered by repeated warnings of terrorist attacks in the future.
The punters who wager on changes in the Federal Reserve's short-term interest rate target are still counting on a rate increase by September. That means there is confidence in the economic rebound already under way. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said last week that the economy is in an upswing.
But even positive statistics are not helping investor confidence. The number of new nonfarm payroll jobs rose by 41,000 in May, the government reported Friday, the biggest gain in 15 months, while the unemployment rate fell unexpectedly to 5.8 percent, from 6.0 percent in April. 
Executives are not helping with their trimming of corporate expectations. Intel has lowered its second-quarter sales forecast to as low as $6.2 billion from $7 billion.
Investor confidence in corporate executives and accounting is also at a low, a point made last week by Henry M. Paulson Jr., the chairman of Goldman, Sachs.
Gold, sometimes a haven for worried investors, is signaling some of these concerns. Its price, at $325.10 an ounce on Friday, is up more than 16 percent for the year.
William E. Rhodes, chief investment strategist at Rhodes Analytics in Boston, detects investor skepticism in the performance of various stock market sectors. He says he is not seeing the rotation from one sector to another that he would expect at this stage of the economic recovery. 
Investors, especially institutions, normally try to get ahead of the market by picking the next winners and getting rid of the next losers. These investors would expect materials and manufacturing stocks to do well as production revived, then a rally in financial stocks as interest rates rose, increasing profits, then gains in consumer cyclical stocks, like automobiles, as consumers spent more.
While the market never moves exactly in this pattern, Mr. Rhodes thinks that the current performance shows that the market "really does not know where it is going."
Financial stocks, for example, are not performing as well as he would have expected, in part because they have been held back by the big diversified banks that have bought investment banks. "The market usually does well when financial stocks do well," he said. "But I have cold feet about finance; I have sweaty palms."
Consumer staples, like food and retail drugs, usually do well when the economy is down, because investors bet that consumers will still be buying these products. But, Mr. Rhodes points out, this sector is also doing well now, sending off a contrarian signal.
He is also concerned about industrials, although many of these companies should benefit from the economic turnaround. And he thinks that health care stocks, which have been an important strong performer in the market, are now near or at their peaks.
"The market is less likely to rally as long as it is locked in this position," Mr. Rhodes said. "You should be in early recovery mode, but the stock market is in an 'I want to roll over and take a nap' mode."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
A Bull Is Taking One Step Back

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
WITH the recent sell-off, major stock market averages have fallen below the levels they held before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
 Steve Leuthold, president of Leuthold/Weeden Capital Management in Minneapolis, was a longtime bear. But back in February 2001, he became bullish. 
 Mr. Leuthold took some time last week to talk about his current views. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. In the beginning of 2001 you increased your position in stocks, betting on an economic recovery. What is your view now?

A. We are more cautious than we were a month ago, and about 10 days ago we shifted from positive to neutral on the stock market, paring back our equity exposure to 50 percent from 60 percent.

Q. Why the new caution on stocks?

A. Part of the caution is economic. The dollar is weaker, interest rates are on the rise, and inflation seems to have bottomed out. Those are negatives.
Also, while midcap and small-cap stock valuations are pretty much at normal levels, the big cap-weighted indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite are still high relative to their historical range. Also, we have been losing quite a bit of ground in the supply-and-demand area. There have been net redemptions from stock mutual funds over the last three weeks. And last week we had about $3 billion to $4 billion in secondary stock offerings, which is a negative when taken against the selling pressure. 

Q. How much would big-cap stocks have to fall to return to their historical norms?

A. To get to median valuation level, big-cap indexes would have to fall about another 20 percent.
If this turns into a secular bear market like 1972-1974, those indexes could go down another 35 percent to 40 percent from here. That is the potential, but I don't look for that to happen. That's why we're still 50 percent invested in stocks. We could go as low as 30 percent.

Q. What would increase your concerns about the market?

A. I am worried about more deterioration in technical indicators like the advance-decline line. If you get much more selling pressure, a lot of those technicals would turn negative. And if you were to see a flood of net redemptions out of mutual funds, that could be quite dangerous. The more you hear about terrorism and see the president on television, the more concerned the public becomes.

Q. Is the unstable international situation more important to the market at this point than recent financial scandals?

A. Questions about financial integrity have been around since the start of the year. But once you call attention to the problem you are on the way to solving it. These issues are about two-thirds of the way behind us.
The real problems are geopolitical, be it Iraq, the Middle East or India and Pakistan. To me, that is the thing that is really disturbing the public even more than the financial integrity issues. And it is the thing that really worries the old-time professionals, people who have been around for 30 years. In my opinion, we haven't seen this unstable an international environment since the Cuban missile crisis. 

Q. Given the problems, why do you still recommend a substantial investment in the market?

A. If you total up the negatives and the positives, you have more of the former.
But the big positive is the recovering economy, which did fine in the first quarter and which I think will expand around 4 percent this quarter. 
Historically, the economy and the stock market move together in the first half of a recovery. Historically, at this point the market should be up 30 to 35 percent off its lows. That isn't happening. We are still 50 percent invested because we think there will be a reconnect between the market and the economy.

Q. What parts of the market do you like?

A. We have been adding to our positions in a number of smaller semiconductor manufacturers, which now represent about 10 percent of the portfolio. They are a leading indicator on the economy, and the signals from that group, Intel notwithstanding, are turning up. We also like specialty retailers, consumer electronics companies and employee services companies.

Q. Are there values to be had in sectors that have been clobbered?

A. I love the drug stocks. If there was a group that I would buy now and hold for the next 10 years, it would be this group.
I also think utilities are probably a bargain, if you can sift through the garbage. Demand for what they provide is not going away. 
And telecom stocks look pretty good for the long term. You are starting to see pricing in this area begin to firm up.

For Dad, Some Things That Go Beep

BYLINE:  By MACAULAY CAMPBELL 

 BODY:
An improved economic outlook may mean more gifts for fathers this Father's Day. The National Retail Federation says the average American household is expected to spend $95 on Father's Day gifts, up from $52 last year. 
 Fathers with children in college should not expect the traditional tie as a gift. According to a recent survey by the federation, 18-to 24-year-olds are most likely to give electronics or computer gadgets. Clothing and dinner are most likely to come from women. 
 Adults aged 45 to 54 plan to spend the most on their fathers -- an average of $163. Women plan on spending more than men on gifts, by $107 to $82. MACAULAY CAMPBELL

A Third Week of Declines, and Dejection

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock market declined for a third consecutive week, bringing the three major indexes to new lows for the year.
 Investors seemed discouraged by the threat of terrorism and by disappointing corporate announce-ments. 
Intel, the computer chip maker, said late Thursday that its sales for the second quarter would be as low as $6.2 billion, down from earlier forecasts of $7 billion. Its stock dropped 20.3 percent for the week. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, led down by Intel, Alcoa and American Express, was off 3.4 percent for the week, closing at 9,589.67. The Nasdaq composite index was dragged lower by RF Microdevices and Flextronics International. It was down 5.0 percent for the week, closing at 1,535.48. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, paced by declines in Tyco International and the Williams Companies, dropped 3.7 percent for the week, to 1,027.53.
 Bonds moved little until Friday, when the Labor Department said the unemployment rate fell unexpectedly, to 5.8 percent in May from 6.0 percent in April. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 5.07 percent, from 4.98 percent on Thursday and 5.04 percent a week ago. JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

An Economic Success, But at Whose Expense?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Passing the Torch" (May 26): Fred Carriere, executive director of the Korea Society, notes that Korean entrepreneurs want their children to go to Harvard. One grocer quoted wants his son and daughter to get "fancy jobs." 
 Koreans follow an American dream to which most immigrants aspire. Korean merchants have created a thriving ethnic niche that New Yorkers appreciate. This would have been impossible without their own hard work and sacrifice. But we should not forget that the immigrant dream should also be accompanied by adopting fair wages and employment practices for workers.
In 2000, the state attorney general's office found that many workers, most of whom are Mexican and Central American, earned as little as $2.60 an hour for 72-hour weeks. That agency is continuing to investigate and work for better conditions in these stores.
Hard work has paid off for some of these entrepreneurs; it would be good if it could pay off for their workers who cannot share these dreams, and who lack the capital to work their way up the economic ladder and take over these businesses as their owners move on to more prosperous endeavors.
As a society, we should make sure that one immigrant group does not prosper at the expense of another.

Behind the Scenes, the Sexism Is Now Subtler

BYLINE:  By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
Back in the good old boy days, female coaches were allowed to use the gym whenever they wanted, so long as it was before breakfast and after midnight. They were welcome to all the boys' old junior varsity uniforms they needed, unlaundered. Their most experienced head coaches were paid less than the men's assistants. 
 After the enactment of Title IX, which is celebrating its 30th birthday, discrimination against female athletes became less obvious. Male coaches and administrators forgot to invite female coaches to university events. If the women showed up, the men would forget to introduce them to visiting politicians or to rich boosters. 
 Such petty incidents of disrespect and inconvenience can cumulatively become soul-killing. Is this what eventually got to Cheryl Burnett, who is still struggling to understand why "my dreams have been squelched by frustrations and discouragements?" She didn't quit over money. Burnett made more than anyone at Southwest Missouri State University, including the president and the football coach. 
She wasn't frustrated by a lack of success. During her 15 years as head women's basketball coach, the Lady Bears won 319 games and lost 136. They went to 10 N.C.A.A. tournaments and reached the Final Four twice, most recently in 2001.
She hadn't lost her popularity in the community. Burnett was a major celebrity in Springfield, Mo., as a jock goddess and as a spokeswoman for United Way and other charities. Women packed her Fast-Break Club fund-raisers, and shook out the pockets of their bosses and their husbands. 
So when Burnett, 43, resigned abruptly seven weeks ago, citing philosophical differences, everyone in the Southwest Missouri State administration expressed shock.
"A total surprise," said Dr. Darlene Bailey, who has been the associate athletic director for the past four years. "Yes, there are always situations between coaches and administrators. She was coaching one sport and we were administering 21. There could be differences in philosophies."
But this is not happening in the philosophy department. Burnett was hired to teach female athletes, to win games and to attract fans. She won more games than any other basketball coach in the university's history. The Lady Bears outdrew the Men Bears. One of her recent players, Jackie Stiles, now with the Portland Fire of the Women's National Basketball Association, set National Collegiate Athletic Association scoring records.
"What happened to Cheryl is puzzling," said Dr. Mary Jo Wynn, who retired four years ago as associate athletic director after 41 years in the department. "I had a wonderful experience with her. I was honored to work with her."
Wynn, then director of women's athletics, promoted Burnett from assistant to head coach in 1987 because she was so impressed by Burnett's enthusiasm, her work ethic, her knowledge of the game and her willingness to pay the personal costs of becoming a champion. Burnett coached the Lady Bears to more Missouri Valley Conference victories, 200, than any other coach. 
Did she just burn out? She sounds ready to coach some more. There are no rumors of scandalous behavior. For years, she has turned down jobs in fancier places. How can the administration keep shrugging in public, while supporters of Burnett express outrage? 
" 'Philosophical differences' sounds like a nice way for Cheryl to say they lied to her," says Joyce Mahoney, a political activist, who was inspired by her Lady Bears fandom to bring a Title IX complaint against the university.
Wynn said: "As long as we were nonentities, the men didn't pay any attention. Then, when we became more than just there, when we won games and got attention and put people in the seats, they started -- well, it's hard to talk about because it was so subtle."
It's clearly hard for Burnett to talk about it. "It became less and less fun to go to work," she said last week in a long and halting telephone interview. 
She was concerned that publicity would make her unemployable. "Little things," she said. "I began to hear myself described as a bad person, the bitchy one, lazy and selfish and ungrateful. Demanding, that's O.K. Maybe if I had been less successful I'd have had less of a problem. Maybe it was an ego thing with the good old boys, but that's your word."
In conversation, Burnett sounds more wounded than angry. Because her friends include Coach Roy Williams of Kansas, Charlie Spoonhour, a former men's S.M.S. coach now at Nevada-Las Vegas, and the present S.M.S. men's coach, Barry Hinson, she is uncomfortable characterizing her problems as gender-related. She is aware that the undramatic little incidents seem individually petty, and open to interpretation. But their corrosive accumulation did her in.
In an exception to university policy, for example, the men's basketball team and many of its supporters received rings from the university for making the Round of 16 in 1999. Meanwhile, the women's team was told it would receive fewer rings of lesser quality for reaching the Final Four in 2001. And they have yet to get them.
Burnett's Final Four incentive bonus, a simple check to cut, was run through the payroll system in such a way that the contracted amount was more than halved. She had to fight for what should have been hers routinely. Money she had raised publicly for a trophy case disappeared into the system and the case was never built. Burnett experienced the incidents as humiliating.
One incident directly affected the team. When she attempted to hire a strength and conditioning coach who had specific expertise with female athletes, she was told there was no money in the budget. Yet after she privately raised $20,000 in two weeks, she said the administration ordered her to use football's weight coach. That never worked out. She said he seemed "totally offended dealing with women coaches," and quit working with the women in midseason.
Bailey and an athletic department spokesman, Mark Stillwell, were generous in their praise for Burnett. After all, they said, her contract kept being renewed and enhanced (her annual "package" was close to $250,000 in salary and the usual TV and radio deals.) But they would not comment on specific matters. Both denied that a negative recommendation that surfaced at Vanderbilt University had come from their department. Burnett was never seriously considered for a job for which she was certainly qualified.
Wynn, who senses something "vile and evil" in Burnett's treatment, had been the coach's most powerful protector at the university. Burnett lost that protection when Wynn retired in 1998.
Along the way, Burnett picked up two powerful fans, the 72-year-old Mahoney, who is a local golf champion, and the 82-year-old Bee Payne-Stewart, mother of the late pro golfer. Both women are political activists, particularly for women's issues. 
"I was inspired by one of Cheryl's fund-raisers, the Free Throw Extravaganza," Mahoney said. "It was such fun. I could imagine myself at the foul line in a real game, in the final moments. I saw the strength that women have now. I was born in 1930 when you were only supposed to be a baby maker."
Mahoney and Payne-Stewart became aware of the disparity in the university's spending on men's and women's sports. After several years of fruitless meetings with university officials, Mahoney filed a Title IX complaint last year charging that the university is nowhere near mandated gender equity. The university, which has a year to show at least an effort toward compliance, claims it was on that track anyway.
The local reaction to Mahoney's complaint was vicious. ("I was compared to Osama," she said.) But with no economic ties to the university and married to "a retired investment guy," she felt the freedom to make the case. As a veteran of various political, health care and arts financing campaigns, she fought right back when a radio personality attacked her. Using the federal protection provisions for whistleblowers, she filed a second complaint; the radio personality worked for the university and thus might be charged with seeking retribution.
Burnett said she had nothing to do with either complaint, although she was blamed for them. She says she is just looking forward to a quiet summer. She would like to sell her home and buy a house on a lake. She wants to coach again but refuses to engage in speculation that if she can sit out a year, a job for her will open at Kansas, her alma mater.
Meanwhile, S.M.S. has hired a new coach and is careful to avoid any disparaging public remarks about Burnett. 
"Once she's out of the news long enough," Mahoney said, "they think they'll just do away with her. But her followers will never forget what she did here. The town came alive when the Lady Bears season started. 
"You know, Title IX is peripheral, it's really about big-time sports corrupting higher education. And it's about all those good old boys thinking, 'What can two old women do?' "

HEADLINE: Cutting Class on Fridays To Cut School Budgets 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: EDGEMONT, S.D. 

 BODY:
Short $240,000 in a $1.4 million budget, the first thing the leaders of the Edgemont School District did was combine the middle school and high school, eliminating three teachers and a principal.
 Next they dropped the gifted program, chopped the guidance counselor's hours in half, ended full-time kindergarten and recruited volunteers to coach track and wrestling. 
 Now, they are cutting Fridays.
"For us it's a matter of keeping the school open, having a community with a school that's worth going to," said Susan Humiston, a mother of four and president of Edgemont's five-member school board, which also gave up its $50-per-meeting stipend. "I think we have cut as deep as we can cut and still have a school I'll send my kids to." 
In the fall, this tiny district of 200 students here in the Black Hills, along with nearby Hot Springs, will join about 100 rural districts nationwide using a four-day school week, adding minutes to each class to make up some of the time.
With at least 15 states sharply reducing education spending this spring, the radical-sounding four-day week, last tried in the energy crisis in the 1970's, is back. In Colorado, 36 of 180 districts have gone to four days, with 20 of 48 districts in Wyoming, and a smattering in Arizona, Louisiana, Utah and here in South Dakota. About 20 districts in eight states, including some in the Minneapolis suburbs and in Florida, Nebraska and South Carolina, have considered the approach this year. Several legislatures, including those in California, Arizona and Arkansas, have recently passed laws to allow for the shorter week. 
Drawn to the short week for financial reasons, several districts said they stuck with it only after discovering hidden benefits: better attendance and morale; less time lost to extracurricular activities, teacher training and doctor's appointments; and longer class periods. 
But others abandoned the idea because of complaints from working parents, concerns over elementary students' exhaustion and the realization that cost savings were minimal. The short week reduces some transportation costs, but not personnel costs, which make up 80 percent of a typical district's expenses.
The new schedule runs counter to the national trend of trying to improve student achievement by extending the school day, week and year. Already, most schools require far fewer days than their counterparts in Europe and Asia.
"It's backwards," said Ruy Teixeira, who has been studying changes in the school calendar as a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a liberal-leaning Washington research organization. "It's definitely moving in exactly the wrong direction, so one hopes it won't catch on."
As for the notion that less might be more, Diane Ravitch, a conservative education historian, said the four-day districts were "pretending there's a pedagogical explanation for what is really cost-cutting."
"If you follow that logic, you should only have school one day a week," she said sarcastically. 
Administrators here and in Hot Springs, 24 miles to the east, admit that if they had the money, they would keep school open into the evenings and through the summer, rather than shut down one day a week. But they expressed confidence that the new schedule would make everyone more wary of wasting time. 
Little research has been done, but experts have documented increased attendance, higher morale, and fewer disciplinary problems in four-day schools. From the few papers that have been published, there appears to be no measurable effect on student achievement.
In Custer, a 1,000-student district 40 miles north of here that changed its calendar in 1995, student participation in activities has jumped and standardized test scores have risen slightly, though no one can confirm a correlation. The district saves about $70,000 a year, mostly on busing.
"The students in the hallways are happy," said Tim Creal, Custer's superintendent.
Here in Edgemont, a town of 906 surrounded by bison and buffalo ranches, next year's bells will be at 7:50 a.m. and 3:38 p.m., rather than 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. Lunch shrinks from an hour to 30 minutes. Officials predict elementary students will get up to 80 more hours of instruction, while those in grades 7 through 12 will lose about 10 hours, as the district moves from 172 days to 151.
Edgemont's business manager, Barbara Little, is only counting on a $10,000 savings -- but even that is significant, she said, in such a small district with such a big budget gap. 
Teachers are thrilled to gain minutes in each class period, particularly in hands-on subjects like chemistry and home economics. 
"I'm just really looking forward to being able to get in all the things I want to do every day," said Doreen Schultz, Edgemont's third-grade teacher. "As the kids get tired, there's a lot of activity-based things you can do."
Students are split, eager for an extra day off, but dreading longer classes with more homework.
"It gets tiring going to school five days straight," said Jacob Lively, 18, an Edgemont junior. But Robert Pritchard, 16, a junior in Hot Springs, said that "sitting at your desk for like an hour is going to get kind of tiring."
Perhaps the biggest challenge is what to do with the children on Fridays.
In Hot Springs, where final approval of the plan is expected in June, the district will have 147 days instead of 175, and expects to save $17,000 on busing alone. Deann Arneson, a single mother of six, said she would put her grade-school-age children in day care on Fridays. 
"I think it's a better idea than a lot of other things they tossed around," said Ms. Arneson, an administrator at a Veterans Affairs hospital. "I don't want academics cut. I don't want extracurriculars cut. I don't want busing cut."
Instead, Fridays.

HEADLINE: An Actual Internet Success Story 

BYLINE:  By Richard Rayner; Richard Rayner is the author of "Drake's Fortune: The Fabulous True Story of the World's Greatest Confidence Artist," published last month by Doubleday.

 BODY:
'The Internet has not only turned the used-book business inside out; it has flipped it on its head and spun it around once or twice," says Keith Waters, an instigator of one of the virtual era's more curious and less sung revolutions. Back in the mid-1990's, in the pre-dot-com dark ages, Waters was a computer consultant. One day, his wife, a used-book dealer, complained to him about how difficult it was to find any particular out-of-print book. Basically the only way to go about this was to scuffle through the local used-book stores or to pore through the 30 or so pages of AB Bookman, a weekly magazine that published lists of titles. 
 Waters examined AB Bookman and had his flash of inspiration: why not create an Internet equivalent, a searchable database that would connect thousands of dealers, instead of only a few, and list millions of books, instead of thousands? And so in 1996 he founded Advanced Book Exchange, www.abebooks.com. Abebooks now links some 10,000 used- and rare-book dealers worldwide, each paying a monthly subscription according to how many titles they put online. Abebooks currently lists more than 38 million books, with 50,000 to 100,000 added every day. If you want to search for a newer book, Robert A. Caro's "Master of the Senate," say, or an old paperback of Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451," you simply go to the Web site, type in the author's name and title and scores of choices pop up. You take your pick, depending on price and condition. In this fashion, the market itself makes the price for a given book, and no book, in or out of print, is hard to find anymore. 
 Waters wasn't the only one who had this idea. Abebooks soon had a competitor, bibliofind.com, which was swallowed by Amazon soon after Abebooks teamed up with Barnes & Noble in 1998. Used books now account for more than 15 percent of Amazon's sales. EBay and its subsidiary half.com sell books; alibris.com, Bookavenue.com and BookFinder.com are other sites that centralize supply. "The increase in the number of used books sold is staggering," Waters says. "It's maybe 100 times what it was in 1995."
A shift is underway in how we buy and think about books. People seek out books on the Net because it is easy and cheap. Often they don't care whether a book is new or used. Someone in Illinois might buy a used copy of a hardback from half.com or a dealer in New York, read it and then sell it to someone in California, having spent, in effect, only a few dollars. 
It seems curious that with the pricking of the dot-com bubble, with the demise of the vast majority of all the weird and wonderful things that were explored in digital commerce, such a seemingly unsexy business as used books should survive and flourish. But this is what the Internet does best: bringing a disparate and disorganized group of people together into a community, and an economic unit. 
In fact, the used-book industry so well illustrates the classic economic model that it could replace widgets in Econ. 101 and no one would know the difference. The demand was always there, but exploiting it was never in the interests of the chains and publishers who dominate the book industry. So the market, such as it was, languished in the hands of tiny, back-street booksellers. With the Net, however, supply was centralized and advertised, prices stabilized and a market was established, or rather, a market that was frozen started to happen.
I am a used-book nut myself, a haunter of library sales and the dusty, chaotic shelves of thrift stores. It was a couple of years back when I noticed that everyone I bumped into in these places was buying more books than usual. When questioned, they tended to be a little sheepish, almost squirrelly about it. They would glance around furtively, as if they were about to confess to a cocaine habit, before saying, "I sell them on the Internet."
Then gradually, as the months went by, I began to see these people develop their own angles or niches. One friend, a teacher, was supplementing his regular income by scouring for science-fiction and fantasy paperbacks. His particular gimmick was to put together entire sets of books by writers that only the comic book geeks knew about. "A rich lawyer in Seattle paid me $250 the other day for an entire set of Tarzan paperbacks by Edgar Rice Burroughs that I'd picked up for 25 cents a pop," he says. "There's a couple in England who pay $8 for any Michael Moorcock paperback. Why do they do this? Because I'm making it easy for them." 
There is an ex-cop who runs an online business in modern first editions, especially mysteries. He orchestrates forays to the yearly BookExpo America to collect boxes of advance readers editions (the advance galleys of books given away by publishers as promotional material that are highly sought after by some collectors). During the recent L.A. Festival of Books, he had a team of helpers and strode about like General Patton with a walkie-talkie, dispatching runners to get books signed by big names like Michael Connelly and T.C. Boyle, thus increasing their value. 
Another guy, who lost his job in the downturn, was helping his wife keep their kids in one of the best private schools on the west side of Los Angeles. He had got hold of a catalog listing books used as college texts and had made a specialty of hunting for those. Some specialize in history or in pre-World War II hardbacks. Others still just grab whatever they can get. 
At the most recent Santa Monica library sale, dealers were lining up at 10 a.m. for an event that wouldn't begin for another nine hours. As the day wore on and people drifted in and out of the line, leaving only their book boxes behind, there were the inevitable squabbles over who had arrived first. "You're waiting for books?" asked a local bum, uncomprehending. "No, we're making a line, and they're giving away free money," one dealer said. "That would make more sense," the bum replied, and the dealer smiled and shook his head. When the door finally opened, and the tally-ho dash into the basement began, the library was, in effect, giving away free money.
One dealer I know used to be a book scout, a guy at the bottom end of the food chain, but someone whose life had a free-and-easy "On the Road" quality to it. He would hunt for books, take them to used-book stores and be rewarded with cash. He happily remembers stumbling into a thrift store, finding a box full of John Steinbeck first editions, taking them to a dealer and the both of them laughing and feeling it was Christmas. 
That doesn't really happen anymore, not since the Internet transformed everyone on the planet into a potential used-book dealer. Yet there are still good things to be found -- you just have to be a lot more organized and purposeful. These days, that same dealer scurries all over West Los Angeles in his beat-up Ford Fairlane, hunting for books he can sell quickly on Amazon or eBay. He got into the business in the first place because he didn't want to think like a businessman. Now he has to think like a businessman. 
His day divides into a rigid schedule: driving, searching, going home and logging books online, packing up the books he has sold and toting them down to the post office. He has only a limited amount of storage space, so he is making constant evaluations: which will sell quicker, this computer paperback, published a year ago, or this handsome copy, a lovely first edition with a dust jacket, of Francis Steegmuller's "Flaubert and Madame Bovary"? The answer is a no-brainer, and not the same one it would have been five years ago. It's the computer book, stupid!
"There used to be a romance to it," he says. "Now you're just a person who schleps. People have the idea that the book trade is a polite business for gentlemen. In fact, it's a lot more like the Mafia." He remembers how one dealer beat another with a tire iron in a dispute over a book and how a dealer was arrested for stealing the contents of an entire store when he realized the store's owner had died. 
This sort of thing has always gone on, because books can be converted readily into cash. But now, with so many more people involved, the scene is wilder. If several dealers happen to be in the same thrift store when boxes of books are brought in, a feeding frenzy may ensue. Thrift-store workers have themselves learned that books can be traded on the Internet. There are fights. To avoid this, smart people try to make deals with thrift-store managers or library-sale organizers so they can take a look at whatever comes in before it's dumped out there for general consumption. 
Such arrangements, leading to further merry-go-rounds of jostling and resentment, tend to be short-lived, but they can be effective while they last. My dealer friend himself had the nifty idea of helping out at a local Salvation Army store, putting the crates of donated books up on the shelf -- meaning, of course, that he was the first to see those books. One afternoon he found a signed first edition of photographs by Ansel Adams. Idly, he picked up another book, the autobiography of the basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. It, too, turned out to be signed. The book dealer's life has always been given purpose by the possibility of such serendipitous, almost magical, discoveries. It's the thrill of the hunt. My friend paid 50 cents for each of these books and sold them quickly on Amazon. For the Adams he got $600; for the Jabbar, $150. 
The middleman has been eliminated; what used to be the purely regional value of a particular title no longer applies; and the Internet has transformed the world into a huge marketplace for used books. This has happened within a few years, utterly transforming a business that had gone its own way unobserved by almost everybody for centuries. Dan Adams runs Waverly Books out of his home in Santa Monica, with 20,000 titles listed on Abebooks. Most of the books are in the range of $20 to $500, although he has some very expensive ones, including a Knopf first edition, still in its dust jacket, of "The Big Sleep," by Raymond Chandler. The volume once belonged to Tod Browning, the director of "Freaks" and "Dracula," and would make a great addition to the library, should you happen to have around $20,000 to spare. 
Adams's first experience as a bookseller was running an independent new-book store; then he set up a used business, generating his own catalog and traveling around to the various antiquarian book fairs that are held every month or so in the big cities. He saw the writing on the wall pretty early on: he has been doing e-sales for five years, and now his sales are almost exclusively online. "There are times when it seems like I'm selling more to England, Australia and Japan, and it's surprising sometimes what does sell. A woman bought a book from me the other day because her grandfather had signed it. That's a connection, a sale, that would never have happened without the Internet."
Will the increased sale of used books impinge on demand for new ones? It's too early to say. The hope among publishers is that an increased awareness of books will increase the market, just as those authors who mourn the royalty they don't get on sales of used copies can comfort themselves with the thought that at least someone is reading them -- a profile is being raised.
This isn't like Napster putting music up on the Internet so you can download it free, but the market has broadened in a way all but unthinkable seven or eight years ago. Anirvan Chatterjee, who started BookFinder.com, says: "You're almost guaranteed that if there's a copy of a book out there, anywhere, you have access to it." A foreseeable consequence of this, he adds, is that publishers are monitoring what does sell on the Internet, with a view to keeping more and more books in print and in the catalog -- push-button technologies allow them to do this. In other words, the numbers of available new books will continue to grow, and sharply.
The immediate victim of all these changes has been the owner of the traditional neighborhood used-book store. Many have simply been wiped off the map by a combination of the arrival of the Internet and the growth of chain stores, which draw off potential customers with coffee bars, readings and stuffed armchairs. "More than 65 percent of our dealers only have a virtual storefront," Keith Waters at Abebooks says. "And more and more of those who have one are giving it up. Why pay the rent and pay someone to sit in the store all day?"
The storefront businesses, those that have stuck around, have done so because they've moved with the tide. Eddie Sutton, who manages the Internet side at the world's biggest used-book store, the Strand, at the corner of 12th and Broadway in Manhattan, recalls his moment of epiphany: "A couple of years back, a guy came in, a really devoted customer, someone I was accustomed to seeing every day, and said: 'Know what? It's easier for me to buy books on the Net than it is to walk over here from my apartment on Fifth Avenue.' I just went pale. I thought, This could be over for us." 
He went to the Strand's owners, Fred and Nancy Bass, who recognized the problem and invested $250,000. A result was what is currently one of the Web's best book sites, with links to Amazon, Abebooks and all the other virtual outlets. "It turned out to be a natural progression," Nancy Bass says. "We already had a catalog, a shipping room, our reputation as a long-running family business. We haven't changed much. We're not trying to be anything we weren't. We just got bigger." The Strand has yearly revenues in excess of $20 million, and only a year after its inception, strandbooks.com accounts for more than 15 percent. Sales of used books rose more than 15 percent last year; rare books went up 34 percent. "The Internet has been a total boon," she says. Indeed, the store itself is now undergoing a big physical expansion and facelift. The famous red and white sign, "Eight Miles of Books," will soon read, "Sixteen Miles of Books." 
When I ask Bass about the logic of this -- isn't the Strand bucking a trend? -- she seems surprised. "We want to sell more books, to display our inventory better, to have a better store," she says. "Why wouldn't we want to do that?" 
Coincidentally, while I was in the Strand, I spied a copy of my own new book on Eddie Sutton's desk. He had a veritable stack of them, he said, and was going to feature them on the Web site at half the full price -- gratifying, except this was four weeks before the book's publication date, four weeks, therefore, before anyone would have a chance to buy one in Barnes & Noble at full price. Reviewers had brought these into the Strand, and I'll get no royalty on them, a prospect that makes the Authors Guild queasy.
But selling review copies has always been a part of the trade. It's just that until recently only visitors to the store would ever get the chance to buy them. Now everyone can, another instance of how this market has suddenly become more expansive and topsy-turvy. Nothing is more usable than a 'used' book -- especially if it's brand new. While they may not like it, writers are going to have to get used to the idea that small quantities of their books are going to be discounted before they are even published. 
The Strand's particular niche as a business is its fame, its sheer size and its consequent ability to utilize the economies of scale. Other businesses have maintained physical storefronts by specializing ever more closely in a particular sector of the market. For example, each major American city has at least one specialist mystery bookstore, selling both new and used titles. These have not only formed a thriving network but they have also played a crucial factor in the slow-burn and then breakthrough careers of writers like George P. Pelecanos. 
At the very highest end of the rare-book market, customers like to see, touch and smell what they're going to buy. So the Net hasn't revolutionized that aspect of the business. Bauman Rare Books, which already had stores on Park Avenue and in Philadelphia, recently opened a new gallery on Madison Avenue, the first time that a rare-book dealer has opened a physical storefront in Manhattan in some 20 years.
Natalie Bauman, a co-owner, says: "At this end of the market, it's very physical. We're selling extremely rare objects, and the Internet, which has been very useful to us, tells people just how rare they are. But most likely they'll want to handle the books first, to see them, as if they were paintings. It's astonishing how many very successful and famous people will come and spend time and just hang out."
For those of us not in a position to pay nearly $20,000 for a first edition of "The Big Sleep" or $12,500 for Ken Kesey's "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," perhaps this is the pleasure missed most, a sad trade-off against the benefits of progress, convenience and predictable pricing -- the social and literary ambience of the average workaday used-book stores. Wherever I went in the world, to whichever city, I used to make a ritual of touring them, hunting or killing time, wondering what brightly colored dust jacket my eye might alight on next. What the Internet robs you of is the sensual thrill of the chance find, the discovery of lovely old things, these totems of learning and aspiration, the dotty collector's privilege of holding them, knowing that, in exchange for mere money, in a few moments they can be yours. 
"You had the whole history of books in these places," says Ray Bradbury, who himself does not own a computer and still likes to do things the old way. His favorite used-book store, Acres of Books in Long Beach, Calif., still exists, and he tries to head down there whenever it's raining. All the fiction is in a big room with a tin roof at the back. There's a wonderful smell. I go in, and I just breathe, and I feel refreshed. I walk through the dark corridors, listening to the sound of the rain on the roof. And I pull out my old friends."

An article on Page 112 of The Times Magazine today about the lucrative market for used books on the Internet misstates the amount paid for a first edition of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" at a rare-book shop in Manhattan, which benefits from customers' wish to see and touch high-priced items in person. The sale was $8,000, not $12,500.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Far From Wall Street, Intel's Bad News Was No Surprise

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
WHEN Intel dropped the bomb late Thursday, ratcheting down its forecast for both sales and profit margins in the current quarter, Wall Street analysts were caught again like so many deer in the headlights. As Intel's stock plummeted on the news in after-hours trading, Joseph A. Osha, Merrill Lynch's semiconductor analyst, spoke for most of the Street when he said, "Nobody saw this coming."
 In truth, somebody did see it coming -- Fred Hickey, publisher of The High-Tech Strategist in Nashua, N.H., and a card-carrying nonmember of the see-no-evil brokerage firm crowd. In recent months, Mr. Hickey has repeatedly warned his subscribers that shares of Intel, the largest producer of computer chips, were headed for a fall. 
 For instance, back in March, Intel management predicted that gross margins in the second quarter would be 53 percent. But Mr. Hickey speculated that Intel's impressive margins were mostly a result of a buildup in inventory, not sales to end users, and that the margins were therefore unsustainable unless demand picked up. It obviously has not. And so, on June 6, Andy D. Bryant, Intel's chief financial officer, cut the anticipated profit margins to 49 percent in the second quarter, citing weakened demand for chips in Europe. 
Mr. Hickey said Intel "tried to be a hero in the first quarter."
"They continued to produce at high levels, which improved their gross margins, and then talked about efficiencies and productivity when it was only an inventory buildup," he added. "Now they have to pay the piper."
While some Intel watchers may hope that the reduced forecast represents a near-term hiccup, Mr. Hickey has a different view. He thinks the days of mighty Intel's hegemony are over and that it will soon come under severe pressure from competitors -- particularly Advanced Micro Devices. Adding to his gloom is a belief that even if the economy keeps improving, technology companies will not likely participate.
"Intel is in a very difficult position, in the short-term and long term," Mr. Hickey said. "They've got to cut production, which will send costs up. That will put pressure on a stock that is still grossly overvalued even at today's lower price." Down the road, the company faces an Advanced Micro chip -- known in the industry as the Hammer -- that many industry experts consider superior to Intel's Itanium chip.
Advanced Micro plans to start shipping the chip by year-end. Software designers and box manufacturers like the chip's ability to run both high-speed and lower-speed software programs. This so-called backward capability sets it apart, giving Advanced Micro a chance to break Intel's lock on the server market.
"The Hammer is where Advanced Micro breaks into the business-computing market," Mr. Hickey said. "And Intel has had the protection of relatively high gross margins in that area."
If Advanced Micro's new chip is as good in production as it looks in tests, computer manufacturers like Dell and Hewlett-Packard may flock to it. At a minimum, having an alternative to Intel's chip will give the company's customers new leverage when negotiating on price. That would be more bad news for Intel profit margins.
Intel has dominated the semiconductor industry for what seems an eternity. Not long ago, its market value exceeded the combined total of the 16 other chip stocks in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index. For many investors, Intel is not just a stock; it is a religion. Even following the company's reduced sales and profit forecast, Intel carries a $147 billion market capitalization and a price-to-earnings ratio of 42. Quite a price tag, given what Intel is up against.
