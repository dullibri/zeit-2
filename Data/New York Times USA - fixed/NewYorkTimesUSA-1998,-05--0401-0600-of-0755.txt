HEADLINE: The Nation;
Reining in the Market, Gently

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
NOT so long ago, people responsible for managing the economy were pretty sure they had all the necessary tools. They could use them to tinker, making the economy grow faster or slower by lowering or raising interest rates, or doing the same with taxes, or by pumping money into highway construction and other public projects that created jobs.
Whichever way the economy went in response to this tinkering, the stock market fell into line. It reflected the economy and followed it, like a cart behind a horse. But nowadays the stock market has shifted roles. With the Dow Jones industrial average over 9,000, many Americans have not only bought stocks but are encouraged by the rising value of their shares to spend more. The cart is ahead of the horse, pulling it. And increasingly the problem becomes how to rein in the market gently before it goes down hard and damages the economy. 
 Adding urgency is the rapidly spreading view that the stock market is overvalued, that a euphoria has set in, perhaps even a frenzy, and people are buying stocks in a blind faith that prices will keep rising, or at least won't really fall. They are doing so without paying much attention to the value of the companies the stocks represent, or the profits those companies generate.
"It is absolutely clear that the stock market is overvalued," said Steven Rattner, deputy chief executive of Lazard Freres & Company, the investment bank. From Peter L. Bernstein, an economist and consultant, comes this warning in his latest newsletter: "Irrational exuberance is now firmly in control of the U.S. equity market."
Ever more frequently, and perhaps inaccurately, comparisons are made with 1928, before the crash that ushered in the Depression, and the late 1980's, before Japan's stock market bubble finally burst, bringing down that nation's economy. "You can make the argument that the bubble here is just as big as it was in Japan," said Barton Biggs, chief global strategist for Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company.
Not surprisingly, economists, policy makers and Wall Street experts are casting about for ways to quiet the stock market, bring it back into line with the economy and put the cart behind the horse. Jawboning, even by President Clinton, has not worked.
The potential dangers are sure to be on the agenda when the Federal Reserve's leaders gather in Washington on Tuesday for a policy session at which they will decide whether or not to raise interest rates. Rates are normally a fine tool. Raising them usually slows the economy in a more or less predictable way. But raising them now, or at the next policy meeting in the early summer, could finally frighten shareholders. And a sharp decline in stock prices could result in more damage to the economy than the Fed ever intended.
"The situation has so many bubble aspects," said Albert Wojnilower, a Wall Street economist, "that if you precipitate a downturn in stock prices, you have no assurance you will be able to manage it."
 
Sand in the Wheels
 That concern is generating proposals for quieting the stock market in less dangerous ways, or throwing sand in the wheels, as John Maynard Keynes, the great British economist, once said. He proposed raising brokerage fees to raise the cost of trading stocks.
Similarly James Tobin, the Nobel laureate in economics, favors a transaction tax on each trade. Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist, would require mutual fund investors to give 30 or 60 days notice before they could redeem their money. And David Collander, an economic historian at Middlebury College, would require a company to issue more shares each time the price of its stock rose past a certain point. The additional shares would dilute the stock price and raise money for new investment.
Many of these proposals came up after the 1987 stock market crash, but the only action was the creation of "collars" that temporarily halt trading when the Dow falls too far during a trading day. And the proposals have their downside, in Mr. Bernstein's view. They make it harder to buy and sell stocks, and thus investors become less willing to take risk.
Forty years ago, the margin rule was a common tool for managing the stock market. The Fed sets the margin, or the amount an investor can borrow to purchase stock, using the stock as collateral. Since the 1960's the maximum margin loan has been 50 percent of a stock's purchase price. Some experts argue that the Fed should raise the margin. Not that a higher margin would discourage borrowing. People can take out home-equity loans to buy stock, or they can buy options. Options, which arose in the 1970's, are a form of borrowing. They allow investors to risk only a few cents of their own money for every dollar of stock they get the right to purchase in the future.
"Still, a higher margin might do some good as a signal," Mr. Biggs said.
Then there is the indicator approach. Some indicators are designed to measure the restraint that exists on economic growth. A new one would include stock prices along with such standard elements as the dollar's value and Treasury bond yields. Canada has such an indicator and Goldman Sachs & Company is experimenting with one that the Fed some day could cite as a reason for raising or lowering rates.
Take out stock prices and the Goldman Sachs indicator suggests that interest rates are already restricting economic growth. Put them back in, and the indicator shows rates to be low relative to the economy. That suggests to Edward McKelvey, the firm's senior economist, that the economy will accelerate and so will inflation.
Whatever the Fed's concerns about the stock market, the policy makers will focus Tuesday on the economy, as they always do. Their concern will be how fast the horse is running, not whether the wagon is pulling it. They will debate, for example, whether corporate America is sufficiently productive to sustain the profits that in turn can justify rising stock prices, and whether raising rates would bring more damage to Asia, just when it is going deeper into crisis.
"It is quite appropriate that the Fed conduct its debate on the basis of the economy," said Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist and a former Fed vice chairman. As for the stock market, he said, the right thing is to "minimize the fallout when the bubble does burst."

HEADLINE: The World;
Indonesia Is Not the Philippines, Yet

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia

 BODY:
PRESIDENT SUHARTO himself may have been one of the unintended victims last week when Indonesian troops opened fire on protesting university students here, killing six.
In Asia, killing peasants is often forgiven, if it is noticed at all. But firing on students, who are considered guardians of the national conscience in a region with broad respect for education, is one of those pivotal actions that can haunt a dictatorship for years -- maybe even topple it. The reaction to the student deaths in Jakarta on Tuesday was widescale rioting later in the week, leaving some 200 dead, and more people than ever talking about the possibility of a popular revolt against Mr. Suharto. 
 Could Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, be upended by the kind of "people power" movement that unseated Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines in 1986?
It is now a reasonable question. But overthrowing a determined dictator is more difficult than it looks, and one of the lessons of modern Asian history is that, in the short run at least, guns trump principles.
When Americans think of people power, they tend to recall the Philippines and the unforgettable images of vast throngs of peaceful protesters overthrowing the Marcos regime. But while a few democracy movements in Asia have won out over authoritarian regimes, as in South Korea in the late 1980's or Mongolia in 1990, the more common ending is bloodshed.
Thailand's army massacred pro-democracy protesters in 1976. South Korean troops killed hundreds in crushing a similar student movement in 1980. The same thing happened in Burma in 1988 and at Tiananmen Square in China in 1989. Happy endings have been the exception; the more common conclusion to a student democracy movement has been violence and more repression.
The people power movement in the Philippines succeeded because of a constellation of factors: a snowballing popular movement that was backed by the Catholic Church and united around a single leader, Corazon Aquino; a population emboldened by the judgment that the Government would not go so far as to massacre its opponents; military leaders who switched sides to back the demonstrators, and strong pressure from the United States to force President Marcos to leave the country peacefully.
A similar constellation may be coming together in Indonesia, but for now the situation is quite different. Most important, the incipient people power movement in Indonesia is short of two things: people and power.
 
Skittish People, Hesitant Generals
The shortage of people is manifest: the student movement consists of tens of thousands of demonstrators around the country, but not the millions needed to bring the Government to its knees. Young workers and unemployed people managed to paralyze Jakarta on Thursday with their rioting and looting, but they were unorganized, and their occassional thuggery tended to undermine the protest movement's legitimacy along with Mr. Suharto's authority. The more formal anti-Suharto demonstrations consist largely of students. Almost every ordinary Indonesian worker seems sympathetic with the students, but members of the general public have been reluctant to join the demonstrations.
"Who has the courage to stand up now, except the students?" whispered an elderly man near Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city. Not him: he started a conversation by saying how much he supported the student protests, but when a reporter asked his name, he hastily decided he had no opinion about the demonstrations and nothing further to say.
In short, Indonesians are more scared of their Government than Filipinos were of theirs. Indonesia still is haunted by the brutal political repression that began in the fall of 1965 and ended with some 500,000 deaths -- and Mr. Suharto firmly in power.
As for power -- the other ingredient of people power -- it lies most obviously not in the hands of the demonstrators but in the weaponry of the 400,000-strong armed forces. It is romantic to think of ordinary citizens overthrowing a dictator, but whether that is possible usually depends on the stance of the army. In the Philippines, for example, people power succeeded only because two top military leaders, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and the Army Chief of Staff, Fidel Ramos, betrayed Mr. Marcos and backed the people.
In the same way, it may well be the generals who ultimately decide the course of Indonesia. If the commanders want to move Mr. Suharto aside, then they can probably do so. And if they want to suppress the student movement, they can probably do that, too.
Uti Mutiawati, a 23-year-old woman who is studying economics in Surabaya, seemed a fairly typical student. In a conversation before the latest killings, she said she supports the demonstrations, but when asked whether a harsh crackdown would drive her to action or intimidate her into silence, she scarcely paused.
"I'd be more scared than ever," she said. "I'd be quiet."
In Indonesia, the Army is still sitting on the fence. The shooting of the students in Jakarta on Tuesday was the exception, and army leaders like Defense Minister Wiranto appear reluctant to use force to suppress a national student movement that has popular support. The generals seem torn between their close personal ties to Mr. Suharto, who appointed them in large part because of their loyalty to him, and their aspirations to create a modern professional army and not just a praetorian guard. Ironically, the Indonesian Army's last massacre of protesters -- in East Timor in 1991 -- so embarrassed the generals that it may reduce the likelihood of bloodshed today.
Mr. Suharto, who is 76, last week dropped hints that he might consider resigning, but he is a wily politician and nobody is counting him out. The United States Government seems disgusted with him but for now is not quite ready to try to heave him into retirement. And in any case, Mr. Suharto might well heed the advice of his dukun, or traditional Javanese spiritual healer, more than that of President Clinton.
That leaves the main show these days on the streets of the cities, where the university students are consciously modeling their movement on the Philippine and South Korean democracy campaigns and trying to create a mass movement.
 
Appeal for Support
"We realize that for change to take place, we need support from people outside the universities," said Yus Santos, a 25-year-old student leader at Airlangga University in Surabaya. "So we're sending representatives out to various sectors of the population: women's groups, rickshaw drivers, factory workers, and so on. In the end, this movement isn't going to work if it originates only from the campuses."
There are many possible outcomes: a successful revolution, a harsh crackdown, a military government, a long stalemate or simply national chaos and confusion. That would be the least likely scenario of all, but also the most dreadful, worse even than the Chinese or Burmese kind of repression following student movements in those countries. The Indonesian upheavals during the last political transition left so many hundreds of thousands of people dead, the economy so wrecked and the nation so scarred that for decades it accepted Mr. Suharto's autocracy and growing family wealth as the price of national stability.
These days, Mr. Suharto is so vilified that it would be difficult to imagine Indonesians remembering him fondly. But if the nation falls apart along with his rule, it is not impossible that there will be some nostalgia for his corrupt dictatorship.

HEADLINE: The World: Pitching Peace;
Imagine Politics Without TV. Now Think About Ireland.

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: BALLYBOGEY, Northern Ireland

 BODY:
IF opponents of the peace accord that will be put to referendum here and in the Republic of Ireland on Friday were looking for the perfect 30-second television commercial to make their point, they need not go farther than the 1988 Presidential campaign in the United States. Their model could be the infamous Willie Horton commercial declaring that Michael S. Dukakis, as Governor of Massachusetts, let a murderer go free on a weekend pass.
The spot could open with the menacing face of a guerrilla for the Irish Republican Army. Cut to grisly photographs of a victim. The announcer then warns viewers that under the agreement the same terrorist would be let out of prison early -- and his mentor could be elected to a new governmental body. 
 The tag line: "Do you want terrorists running your schools? Your hospitals? Vote no on May 22."
 
A Case Study
But neither this nor any other commercial will pitch the virtues or the dangers of the peace agreement. Although the referendum is widely viewed as the most important election in Northern Ireland's history, laws here and in Ireland have inhibited both sides from using paid television in this campaign.
As a result, the referendum presents something of a case study for the United States, where campaigns are waged over who can cram the best zingers into 30-second sound bites -- and where the scramble to bombard the airwaves with costly commercials is blamed for transforming the entire political culture into a money-grubbing enterprise. Can a campaign really be a campaign without television commercials?
Here at least, the result seems to be a relatively peaceful, though not always civil, campaign where -- of all things -- proponents do not respond to their foes' television commercials but to each other.
Technically, parties are allowed to buy commercial time, but proponents decided not to do so this time for fear that courts would rule that out of fairness, smaller, financially strapped opposition parties would be granted equal time.
As a result, provisions of the complicated peace treaty are not flashed on the screen, distorted beyond recognition. Instead of television, both sides make their pitches on billboards, posters and in leaflets. They buy full-page advertisements in newspapers.
While the rhetoric can still be brutal, it is more difficult for politicians here to play on voters' emotions with black-and-white newspaper advertisements. And rather than battle through 30-second attack ads, politicians are forced to make their cases in debates and call-in shows on television and the radio.
"What's always struck me about political ads in the states is the high degree of knocking about," said David Lyle, chief executive of the Belfast office of McCann-Erickson, the advertising agency that designed the only paid political commercials on the air here: ones in which the Government informs people about the referendum but does not advocate a yes or no vote.
Mr. Lyle said the best way for politicians to sway voters here was through televised debates.
 
Aversion to TV
Though it is hardly quaint, the process is certainly different from the brand of jarring commercials that voters in California have been subjected to for months in advance of the primary there in June.
There is such an aversion to political commercials here that the British Government shelved plans to escalate its informational television campaign about the referendum out of fear that it would come off as a sneaky effort to win support for it.
In a confidential strategy memorandum leaked to the press in Belfast, Tom Kelly, communications director of the Northern Ireland Office of the British Government, explained the risks of mounting such an effort. "Serious consideration needs to be given to the timing and content of any messages," Mr. Kelly wrote, "because it could be seen as 'big government' imposing its view -- which would be entirely counterproductive."
Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster in Washington who has done a lot of campaign work overseas, said paid advertising could never succeed here because the issue -- the fate of a nation -- is far more consequential than matters on ballots in the United States.
"With so much loss of life that has intruded into so many families," he said, "there is a demand for a more serious public debate. Cheap 30-second ads would almost be insulting."
Yet the downside to the absence of paid television ads is that it may be harder to engage voters who have been disappointed before and may suspect that genuine peace will never come. Apathy has been a major concern of the referendum's supporters in Ireland, who fear that low turnout in the voting on Friday could cloud the long-term prospects for peace.
Viewers can watch television here for hours, free of any fears that their viewing pleasure will be intruded upon -- some would say polluted -- by political pitches.
Without television to help them break through, sometimes parties get desperate. In Ireland, one campaign poster features a naked woman and man in a compromising position, with the slogan: "Yes Yes Yes. Passion for Europe."
 
The Apathy Factor
The party that produced the placard was seeking to draw interest to a treaty that will also go before the voters Friday, calling for further economic cooperation with Europe. But while the steamy scene may be stopping traffic in downtown Dublin, there is no evidence that it has boosted support for the treaty.
Even up here in this tiny stretch of pasture land near the northern tip of Northern Ireland, some voters, blissfully unaware of the advertising deluge to which American voters are subjected, fret about the interminable political debates over the peace agreement. "I get fed up looking at it," said Sandra Carrothers, who works at a convenience store here. "I turn the TV off."
For Ms. Carrothers, thankfully, the attack spot has not invaded Ballybogey. For Americans, the lesson may be that somewhere, there are politicians who speak in more than 30-second sound bites.

From Guru to Rogue: America Re-Examines India

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
JOHN KENNETH GALBRAITH remembers India as a nation that "stood apart and above the conflicts of the world," scorning arms races and alliances. "That was very much the tradition of Gandhi and Nehru," he said last week, as the United States imposed sanctions after five nuclear explosions shook the Thar desert of Rajasthan -- and Mr. Galbraith's faith in a country where he was ambassador more than 30 years ago. "There was a strong feeling here that they took a position that was related to the survival of us all. That's why India was sought out so much."
Half a century ago, India loomed large in the consciousness of intellectual America. But long before last week's blasts forced Americans to think about this huge nation again, it had retreated into the background, its relations with Americans and their Government thinned and strained by decades of disagreement interspersed with neglect. 
 India has long been defined in America by stereotypes, said Joseph Schwartzberg, a cultural and economic geographer at the University of Minnesota. "The image that Americans have of India is essentially that peddled by the National Geographic," he said -- a land of colorful vistas and people washed by a haze of mysticism.
 
A Spiritual Vision
When a vision of India first formed in the American consciousness, it was a cerebral, spiritual, inspirational one. The Hindu reformer Vivekananda made a strong impression in intellectual circles on a visit to the United States in the 19th century. Mohandas K. Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru were figures of great respect as they brought a mighty nation and old civilization to the brink of independence without violence in the 1930's and 1940's. (The carnage, between Hindus and Muslims, came later.)
"A great deal of the image of India in the 1940's came to an extraordinary degree from church groups, specifically the pacifist, socialist Christians," said Ainslie Embree, who went to India in 1948 as a college teacher and later became a leading scholar at Columbia University and a writer on Indian cultural history. "It was also an image of a people fighting the British the way we fought the British." The thought, he added, captivated Franklin D. Roosevelt, whom Indians still remember as a supporter of their independence in the face of British reluctance.
Americans soon took to India for other reasons, Mr. Embree said. Some strategic thinkers saw India, a democracy, as a partner against Communist China. And aid experts flocked to Indian villages, determined to elevate these poor, plucky people. Mr. Embree regards many of them as patronizing, hungering for gratitude that proud Indians would never give.
Mythologies soon formed around India and its role, some fostered by New Delhi's own sense of self-importance and others by Americans who fell uncritically in love with all things Indian. In retrospect, American and Indian experts say, those Americans were quite small in number; after a time their influence would fade.
Arthur Lall, who was India's representative at the United Nations in the 1950's, while the acerbic cabinet minister V. K. Krishna Menon was routinely castigating the United States, said he believed there never was as much interest in India or knowledge about it as Americans like to think. Which made neglect of India easier.
The cold war -- during which Americans thought India was too friendly to Moscow and Indians felt America was too close to Pakistan -- put a chill on Indian-American relations among scholars as well as officials, said Sumit Ganguly, a professor of political science at the City University of New York. Indian suspicions contributed to the alienation at a time when intellectual America was drawn to other causes in Southeast Asia and then Central America.
"The culminating blow that led to a decline in American interest in India was the Indians' fault," Mr. Ganguly said. "When Nehru was there, India's nonalignment at least had some meaning. When Nehru was gone, nonalignment took on an Alice in Wonderland quality under Indira Gandhi." After 1971, when the United States sent the aircraft carrier Enterprise into the Bay of Bengal as Indian troops moved into East Pakistan to create Bangladesh, "She got it into her head that lurking behind every bush in Lodi Gardens was an American agent," he said.
"Legitimate scholars were hounded by the Indian bureaucracy," Mr. Ganguly said. "Visas were denied, often on the most tenuous grounds. American scholars -- who were the biggest supporters of India, who were passionate about India and who found ways to defend Indians' actions, saying that they have a different vision of world order, they really don't mean us any harm, we have to understand the colonial legacy that makes them sensitive, and so on -- were the constituency most alienated. We lost a generation of American scholarship."
 
A Way to Get Noticed
After the cold war, say Mr. Embree and Stephen P. Cohen of the University of Illinois, American policy makers did not draw on the considerable scholarship that remained on American campuses and in research institutes to formulate new policies toward India. "The Indians were confused by our inability to come to a coherent policy," said Mr. Cohen. " One-third of the Clinton Administration saw India in terms of arms control, one third saw it as an economic opportunity and one third or less saw it as a possible strategic partner or player. There was no policy review, no attempt to bring all this together."
A new Indian Government took stock of this and concluded it needed to do something to get attention, said Mr. Cohen, who recently traveled to the subcontinent. "The group that's come to power believe strongly that they aren't going to get anywhere by being good boys. They've been very acute to our response to North Korea and the Chinese. We're looking for rogues and they are volunteering to be the rogue of the decade."

BABY BELLS
Dial 'M' for Merger
Can Edward E. Whitacre Jr., chairman of SBC Communications, put Humpty-Dumpty back together again? It seems as though wants to reassemble the telephone monopoly the Government broke up in 1984 when it forced AT&T to divest itself of the Baby Bells. SBC, based in San Antonio and the dominant local telephone company in the West, announced that it would acquire Ameritech of Chicago for about $62 billion in stock. The deal, which follows SBC's acquisition last year of Pacific Telesis and an agreement in January to acquire Southern New England Telecommunications, would re-create much of the old Bell system and make SBC by far the nation's biggest local phone company. Enough? No, Mr. Whitacre said; SBC will aggressively seek to move into the playgrounds of other Baby Bells. New York City is the prime target. 

OTHER DEALS
DuPont to Offer Conoco
DuPont plans a stock offering for 20 percent of its $22 billion Conoco oil subsidiary and will dispose of the other 80 percent soon. DuPont plans to concentrate on drugs, genetically engineered crops, agricultural chemicals and other life-sciences products. . . . Monsanto announced two deals valued at $4.4 billion that would give it control of DeKalb Genetics and the Delta Pine Land Company. . . . Jefferson Smurfit agreed to acquire Stone Container for $2 billion in stock and to assume $4.35 billion in debt. The combined company will be one of the world's largest makers of paperboard and packaging products. . . . Consolidated Edison of New York plans to acquire Orange and Rockland Utilities for $790 million.
 
MEDIA
Yeltsin, the Internet Star
Russians are discovering the Internet. But never before had Moscow seen anything like President Boris N. Yeltsin's on-line chat on the Web site maintained by MSNBC. For 30 minutes on Tuesday, Mr. Yeltsin responded to questions as varied as the role of women in politics (Russian society would not accept a woman as President, he said, because it is "not quite mature enough") and the thickness of his hair (no Irish ancestry, he assured a coif-conscious Irish questioner; he's from the Urals). Nearly 5,000 people from around the world submitted questions, the most ever for MSNBC's live chats.
 
THE ECONOMY
Inflation Awakening?
Consumer prices rose in April at the fastest pace in six months, the Labor Department said, in a report that suggested inflation might accelerate from the 30-year lows reached earlier this year. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent last month after remaining unchanged in two of the three previous months. Retail sales rose 0.5 percent in April, and inventories of goods at American businesses increased 0.5 percent in March after rising 0.7 percent in February. The higher inventories indicate that companies expect demand for goods to remain strong.
 
MARKETS
Still Resilient
Investors had excuses enough to sell stocks: an earnings warning from Hewlett-Packard, Indonesia's worst riots in three decades and a rise in core inflation in the United States. But opportunities, not exits, seem to be what investors want, and stocks held their ground. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at an even 9,096, up 40.85 points from last week, after closing at a record 9,211.84 on Wednesday.
 
PEOPLE
A Pledge From Nike
Bowing to pressure from critics who have accused it of exploiting child labor, Nike pledged to improve working conditions abroad. Nike, which employs through subcontractors about 350,000 people in 150 Southeast Asian factories, said it would raise the minimum age for athletic-shoe workers to 18, from 14, and for apparel workers to 16, from 14. It also said it would adopt American standards for indoor air quality and would expand its independent monitoring system. . . . Two former Texaco executives, Richard Lundwall and Robert Ulrich, who had been taped discussing the destruction of documents demanded in a racial-discrimination lawsuit against the company, were found not guilty of trying to obstruct justice. The verdict angered civil rights leaders . . . The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania announced that Jon M. Huntsman, founder, chairman and chief executive of the Huntsman Corporation had given it $40 million, the largest single donation ever to a business school.
 
WASHINGTON
Banking Overhaul Advances
Handing Travelers Group and Citicorp a victory, the House, by only one vote, approved legislation to allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies to merge into financial conglomerates able to operate globally with far fewer regulatory curbs than they now have. The Senate is expected to take up the legislation this year, but chances for passage remain unclear. And, if approved, such a measure could face a veto from President Clinton. . . . In a unanimous vote, the Senate authorized big fines and penalties against telephone companies that switch the long-distance service of customers without their permission, a practice called slamming. . . . Vice President Al Gore announced an "Electronic Bill of Rights" to help insure the privacy of medical records, Internet transactions and other computerized personal data.
 
AIRCRAFT
Checking the 737's
The Federal Aviation Administration grounded scores of old Boeing 737's for inspections to fuel-pump wiring. Damage was found in half of the first 71 inspected. Saying engine vibration was probably the cause, agency officials added that they feared frayed insulation could lead to a spark from the 110-volt wires that could cause a fire or explosion. Flights around the nation were canceled. Among the carriers affected were United Airlines and Canadian Airlines, which had stranded passengers at LaGuardia.

HEADLINE: Here We Go Again

BYLINE: By John J. Mearsheimer; John J. Mearsheimer is a professor of political science at the University of Chicago.

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
It is often argued that nuclear weapons have no redeeming value, and that any state that goes nuclear is engaging in dangerous and self-defeating behavior. Thus, President Clinton maintains that India's recent nuclear tests were a "terrible mistake." The implication is that nuclear weapons should be eliminated altogether.
In fact, nuclear weapons are a superb deterrent for states that feel threatened by rival powers. Simply put, no state is likely to attack the homeland or vital interests of a nuclear-armed state for fear that such a move might trigger a horrific nuclear response. Not surprisingly, therefore, states are often tempted to acquire nuclear weapons to enhance their security. 
 This logic explains America's longstanding love affair with the bomb and why it will never junk its nuclear deterrent, even as it tries to deny others that option.
Israel is another case in point. Although it enjoys an overwhelming conventional superiority and none of its Arab foes have nuclear weapons, Israel still built an impressive nuclear deterrent. This is hardly surprising, given the legacy of the Holocaust and the fact that Israel lives in a dangerous part of the globe. Would President Clinton argue that Israel made a terrible mistake in going nuclear?
India's decision to bring its bomb out of the basement is based on equally reasonable strategic logic. India shares a long and disputed border with China. Not only does China have its own nuclear arsenal, but it also may be on the road to superpower status.
Moreover, China has been supplying nuclear and missile technology to Pakistan, its close ally. Pakistan has fought three wars with India in the past 50 years, has unsettled territorial disputes with India, and remains India's most bitter rival. Indian officials are understandably fearful of a hostile encirclement by China and Pakistan, and perhaps even the United States, which has historical ties to Pakistan and is now trying to improve relations with China.
So it is surely in India's self-interest to build a nuclear deterrent -- as it will be for Pakistan to follow suit. But from the perspective of the United States, the ideal world is one in which it alone has nuclear weapons. Then the United States would not risk direct attack on its homeland or indirect damage from the fallout from nuclear wars between other nations. It could also use its nuclear monopoly to coerce or intimidate other states, and could intervene with conventional forces around the globe without fear of nuclear attack on its forces. For these reasons, the United States has gone to great lengths since 1945 to thwart nuclear proliferation.
During the cold war, the United States and the Soviet Union could dampen proliferation with relative ease. The global nature of their competition meant that both superpowers became deeply involved in most world trouble spots. Neither superpower wanted its allies in those contested regions to have nuclear weapons, so they gave security guarantees to vulnerable allies, as the United States did with Germany and Japan. Or they issued nuclear threats on behalf of allies during crises, as the Soviet Union did for Egypt in 1956 and for Egypt and Syria in 1973. Or they pressured allies not to go nuclear, as the United States did with South Korea and Taiwan in the late 1970's.
But today the Soviet Union is no longer there to dampen proliferation in its former sphere of influence. Instead, its collapse has raised the risk that nuclear weapons, materials and scientists will seep to the rest of the world.
And the United States must now exert more conscious effort to curb proliferation. During the cold war, nonproliferation was a natural side effect of American global activism. This ambitious agenda gave the United States reason to protect its many allies from Soviet aggression; this protection also had the benefit of easing those allies' appetite for nuclear weapons. Now it is harder for the United States to summon the will to remain a provider of global security. The Americans still have many carrots and sticks to use against proliferation, but perhaps less will to use them.
The new international situation also presents the United States with three other management problems. First, in the absence of the Soviet threat, the American military has shrunk in size by roughly one-third and will likely shrink more over time. This means that the United States will be less able to extend credible security guarantees to vulnerable nations or issue effective threats on their behalf in order to prevent proliferation. The arms race among East Asia powers, for example, is motivated in large measure by growing fear in the region that the American pacifier will not be there for the long haul.
Second, nuclear knowledge will continue to spread, and the cost of developing nuclear weapons will continue to fall. In the 1940's only the richest states could contemplate building nuclear forces. Today more nations can aspire to nuclear status, and the number of potential aspirants will grow in the future as the price of building these weapons drops further. The Soviet collapse accelerates this trend by creating a potential cheap underground marketplace for nuclear materials.
Third, without a clear and present danger to force an ordering of priorities, myriad competing interests and values vie to dominate American foreign policy, sometimes producing contradictory policies that make proliferation more likely.
 Consider NATO expansion. This new alignment makes Germany and NATO's three new members feel more secure, but it also angers and offends the Russians, giving them reason to undermine American policy in other regions of the world. On the proliferation front, the result is that Russia is supplying Iran with technologies that will help make Iran a nuclear power and pushing to weaken and ultimately end sanctions on Iraq. It is also unwilling to punish India for going nuclear. Thus one hand in Washington undoes the work of the other.
Another case of clashing interests involves China and India. The United States wants to avoid a confrontation with China by engaging it diplomatically and economically, which is why President Clinton will visit Beijing next month. India fears China's growing power, however, and is already suspicious that the United States is trying to reach an accommodation with China at India's expense. So Mr. Clinton's visit may solve one problem but worsen another by causing anxiety in India, making it feel less secure and more convinced than ever that it needs a robust nuclear deterrent.
All these factors combine to make it likely that other states will follow in India's footsteps. This means that the United States will have to learn to live with the spread of nuclear weapons in the decades ahead. We should try to manage and contain this process, but we cannot stop it.

HEADLINE: Rich Leaders Turn Eye to Crime and Debt

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, England, May 16

 BODY:
With concern over India and Indonesia lurking in the background, the leaders of eight major countries turned their attention today to other issues, agreeing to cooperate more in battling international crime and pledging to do more to help the world's poorest countries.
Meeting in the quiet of a country estate 20 miles outside this industrial city, President Clinton and the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and Russia put aside the crises of the day to focus on longer-term issues of common concern, including how to create more jobs and stop global warming. 
 It is the sixth such gathering attended by President Clinton, and for the White House it offered a welcome opportunity to get away from the relentless grind of legal and political problems in Washington.
After meeting one-on-one with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia on Sunday morning, Mr. Clinton will spend Sunday night as the guest of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain at his country home, Chequers. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Blair will go to London on Monday to discuss the relationship between the United States and the European Union.
Before flying home to Washington, Mr. Clinton will stop in Geneva late Monday to address the World Trade Organization, where he is expected to call for further efforts to knock down trade barriers.
As the leaders met today in the 17th-century manor at Weston Park in the village of Weston-under-Lizard, thousands of protesters encircled the convention center in central Birmingham that is the summit meeting's headquarters, demanding more action by rich nations to relieve the poorest countries of their debts.
The issue has long been a vexing one for the industrial countries, leaving them trapped between pressure to help poverty-stricken counterparts and the risk that debt forgiveness would undermine the economic discipline they have urged developing nations to adopt.
Many African countries in particular amassed huge debts to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other governments and private lenders, and now find themselves unable to spend as much on health, education and economic development as they would like because of their huge repayment burden.
Through a program agreed to by the seven largest industrial democracies, the I.M.F. and the World Bank have made seven countries eligible for a $5.7 billion package of debt relief -- Uganda, Bolivia, Guyana, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Mozambique.
But many poverty-fighting organizations have argued that the program is being carried out too slowly and that too many countries are being excluded.
A study by the relief group Oxfam International said that in Africa, where only half of children go to school, governments spend four times as much on debt repayment as on health and education. In Ethiopia, Oxfam said, more than 100,000 children die each year from preventable diseases but the Government spends four times as much on debt as on health care.
In response to today's protest here, Mr. Blair, as the summit meeting's host, issued a statement reaffirming the commitment of the leaders to "speedy and determined implementation" of the program.
He made no commitment to speed up or expand the program, but American officials said the leaders had agreed to support a broad effort to insure that all African children had the opportunity to go to school and that infant mortality rates be reduced.
On issues closer to home, the leaders discussed what policies can help create more jobs -- a topic of particular interest and sensitivity in France and Germany, which are plagued by double-digit unemployment.
American officials said Mr. Clinton pointed to welfare-to-work programs and the earned income tax credit, which provides incentives to low-income working people, as initiatives that have helped in the United States.
The leaders discussed efforts to curb global warming, a subject on which the United States has come under considerable criticism from European countries for its refusal to make ironclad commitments to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases.
And they spent considerable time discussing arrangements for international cooperation in fighting cross-border crimes like money-laundering, computer fraud and arms smuggling.
In a communique, the leaders endorsed efforts to negotiate a United Nations agreement to provide law enforcement officials with more tools to fight international organized crime.
They called for talks with the business community on an international legal framework for obtaining computer data as evidence in criminal cases, while preserving privacy protections.

HEADLINE: Hard-Pressed, Suharto Plans To Shuffle His Cabinet

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, May 16

 BODY:
Retreating another half-step in the face of national outrage, President Suharto announced today that he would shuffle his unpopular Cabinet. But several Indonesian and foreign analysts said he must make deeper changes in his autocratic rule if he is to stay in office.
Relaying the President's remarks to reporters, Harmoko, the Speaker of the House, said changes would be made in the Cabinet, which is packed with Mr. Suharto's relatives and cronies, just two months after the President appointed it in defiance of public calls for change. 
 Mr. Harmoko suggested that Mr. Suharto was listening to the complaints of his countrymen, which were conveyed to him today from Parliament leaders.
"The main points are demands for reforms soon and a desire for improvements in all sectors and also a Cabinet reshuffle and demands for an extraordinary meeting of the National Assembly," said Mr. Harmoko, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. "The President will soon take steps in accordance with his authority for the safety of the nation and state. The reforms will continue to run in all sectors."
Today's announcement followed Mr. Suharto's rollback on Friday of recent fuel-price increases that had stoked the anger that burst into three days of rioting this week.
As rescuers continued to pull bodies out of burned buildings, military officials said the death toll had risen to almost 500 -- most of them looters trapped in shopping centers that were set ablaze by other rioters. Though scattered outbreaks of looting and arson continued in Jakarta today, the capital was largely peaceful as armored vehicles rolled through the streets, with soldiers calling for calm over loudspeakers.
But rioting was reported in several other cities, and neighborhoods in Jakarta were organizing to protect themselves.
Foreigners continued to flee the country, with about 1,000 Americans and Canadians preparing to leave on three jetliners chartered by the United States Embassy. These followed two other aircraft chartered by the embassy that left during the night with 800 passengers. A number of other countries are also working to evacuate their citizens.
There was a sense among analysts and people on the street here that Indonesia has reached a turning point and that if Mr. Suharto is to stay in office, he must remake the style of the Government, which he has used to control this fractious nation of 210 million people for 32 years.
In addition to the more open economy demanded by the International Monetary Fund, free of cartels, monopolies and cronyism, many Indonesians now demand a more open and accountable Government with an honest judiciary, a freer press and a more responsive system.
"This is it; it's over," said an American businessman with long experience in the country. "Whether it's two days or two weeks or two months or a year, he's finished."
But analysts also agreed that Mr. Suharto, 76, would do everything in his power to hold on to office, and that his power remains considerable.
"He'll say, 'I'm not going to step down because of rabble in the streets,' " said a well-connected political analyst. "The President is not a quitter, and he will see this as a war of nerves. And in a war of nerves, Suharto does not usually lose."
But opposition to his presidency now goes far beyond any rabble. There is a widespread sense among the middle class that only Mr. Suharto's departure will allow real reforms to take place or foreign investors to begin to re-enter the economy.
"There's just no confidence in him any more," said Emmy Hafil, who directs an environmental lobbying group called Walhi.
But Mr. Suharto's possible departure poses as many dangers as solutions. Over the years, he has systematically removed any potential rivals or successors. There is no reliable scenario for a transition to a new leader. His Vice President and close friend, B. J. Habibie, has little power base of his own.
"Everyone is saying the President must go," the analyst said. "But I don't know whether that will solve the problem, or whether it will then be like having dogs fighting over a bone."
The immediate future of the country is in the hands of the powerful and politically active military, and Jakarta was filled today with nervous speculation about the loyalty of the top commanders and about possible splits among them.
"At the moment I think there is a lot of discussion within the military as to how they should proceed," said a high-ranking Government official.
One approach that is being put forward, he said, is to continue to support the President in the hope that the violence has created a public desire for stability rather than immediate political change, and that Mr. Suharto can ease public unhappiness by bringing quick improvements to the economy.
The other view is that public dissatisfaction has reached a point of no return and that the time has come to call a special session of the National Assembly to make a leadership change. Mr. Suharto has said repeatedly this week that any changes must follow constitutional procedures.
"Yes," the Government official said, "I think there may be some cracks in the armed forces leadership. I think there has been a snap in the contract between the middle class and the President. I'm not sure what will happen."
In addition to the politicized middle class, he said, the urban poor have emerged as a powerful and unpredictable force. "They are the most politically volatile factor in Indonesian politics at the moment," he said. "No one can really control them, not even the religious leaders."
Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a political scientist who works as an aide to the Vice President, said another troubling social factor had emerged, a clash of values between the angry poor and the politicized middle class.
"I'm ashamed of being an Indonesian now," she said. "I realize how uncivilized we are. People don't see what is right and wrong any more, looting, burning and killing people, and the overt racism. All those people, they were laughing and they just say, 'Burn, burn, burn.' "

HEADLINE: Voters' Anger at H.M.O.'s Plays as Hot Political Issue

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Public anger over the state of managed care has burst into this year's election campaigns as a major issue, up there with perennials like education, crime and Social Security. In speeches and television advertising, Democrats and a few Republicans are seizing on consumer complaints and calling for a sweeping "patients' bill of rights."
In at least a score of states, including New York, California, Texas, Florida and North Carolina, candidates in primaries and general elections for governor and Congress typically are promoting access to more doctors, a right to appeal managed care organizations' decisions on restricting care to impartial tribunals, and freedom to sue the organizations for malpractice. 
 "We're seeing it in various parts of the country," Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, said of the anger. The association represents more than 1,000 managed care organizations.
In North Carolina, John Edwards, a wealthy lawyer, ran a successful campaign for the Democratic nomination for the Senate on patients' rights and education and will challenge the conservative Republican Senator Lauch Faircloth in the general election in November.
In Texas, Garry Mauro, the Democratic Land Commissioner, has made two 30-second television commercials to date in his bid for governor, both attacks on H.M.O.'s and the health care record of Gov. George W. Bush. "It's the biggest issue we have going right now," said Mr. Mauro's spokesman, Joe Cutbrith.
In H.M.O.-packed California, all three Democratic candidates for governor -- Representative Jane Harman, Lieut. Gov. Gray Davis and Al Checchi, a businessman -- are promising major new controls of the managed-care industry. "H.M.O.'s must start putting people ahead of insurance company profits," Ms. Harman, the daughter of a doctor, says in a new television commercial.
And California Republicans are hardly springing to the defense of the industry. "The one thing the California Republican Party will not do," said Michael J. Schroeder, the party chairman, "is defend the status quo because we do not believe the status quo is defensible."
Glen Bolger, a partner of Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican consulting concern that helped turn the public against the Clinton health plan four years ago, said: "It's a good issue for Democrats. It's a 'damn right' issue," the kind that elicits a clenched-fist response from crowds.
"If you see Democrats winning with it" in primaries and subsequent polling, Mr. Bolger said, "you're going to see it catch fire."
The candidates' assault on H.M.O.'s marks a striking shift in public sentiment from the time when the insurance industry and the Republican-controlled Congress beat back the President's sweeping attempt to overhaul the health care system and extend health care to all. Back then, it was government bureaucracy that was the whipping boy on the campaign trail and the nation's airwaves.
Insurance companies helped kill the plan with the "Harry and Louise" commercials, which featured a couple fretting that the Clinton plan would deprive people of the right to choose their care. "They choose," Harry said. "We lose," Louise said.
That argument has now turned against the industry. As enrollment in managed care has climbed from half the work force four years ago to 85 percent, largely driven by employers trying to contain health care costs, millions more Harrys and Louises are complaining of choices they do not like and of no choices at all.
In the view of some political analysts, Louise's heir in the popular culture is Carol, who in the movie "As Good as It Gets" slams H.M.O.'s with a string of gutter epithets. "I'd never seen an audience clap about a policy issue," Mr. Schroeder said after seeing the movie.
The industry is aghast at the way passions over managed care's failings have drowned out its achievements and brought demands for regulatory legislation. "This is a very simplistic and shortsighted response to the transition we have gone through in health care," Ms. Ignagni said of such legislation.
The managed-care plans have nearly stabilized the once-soaring costs of health care. Ms. Ignagni said they had introduced businesslike discipline to doctors' offices and hospitals in purging the system of waste, in measuring doctors' successes in treating patients and in making preventive care commonplace.
The managed care organizations and insurance companies and employers, who typically pay about 70 percent of their workers' health insurance premiums, are clearly mobilized in their own defense: They have formed a coalition to block enactment of most patient rights proposals in Congress and to respond to the accusations in the campaigns.
The coalition is also developing commercials warning that tighter control over H.M.O.'s would produce a regulatory "monster," along with unemployment, higher premiums for health insurance and the loss of coverage for more families.
Small employers, especially, could be crippled by the cost if managed care organizations' had to fight malpractice suits, said Bill McInturff, of Public Opinion Strategies.
"That is an explosive issue," Mr. McInturff said.
Charles N. Kahn 3d, chief operating officer of the Health Insurance Association of America, said, "The message should be no matter how compelling" the anecdotes that candidates repeat about bad care, "the costs will increase" if regulatory legislation is enacted.
Such arguments carry some weight with the public, consultants say. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey early this year showed that strong public sentiment for restraint on H.M.O.'s weakens when people are asked if they are willing to pay more for it -- but not to the point where support falls below 50 percent. A survey last month by Wirthlin Worldwide found that 56 percent of the people polled would be willing to pay more for less restrictive care.
"Those are the same arguments they used in the days of the Clinton plan," said Gary Cuneo, executive vice president of the American Chiropractic Association, which has joined 70 other professional organizations in promoting the bipartisan legislation to regulate the industry, proposed by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, and Representative Charlie Norwood, Republican of Georgia.
The cost issue may be a particularly hard sell in states, generally the most populous, with high H.M.O. enrollment. "When you have an angry voter," Mr. Schroeder said, "it is difficult or impossible to make that kind of a nuanced argument."
New York is a cauldron of H.M.O. bashing, from both the left and the right. Two of the Democrats vying for the party's nomination to take on Senator D'Amato, Representative Charles E. Schumer and Mark Green, have made health care a major issue. Mr. Schumer, who represents Brooklyn and Queens, is co-author with Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, of one of Congress's patient protection bills. And Mr. Green has dedicated much of his work as New York City's public advocate to battling H.M.O.'s.
On that issue, however, Senator D'Amato stands right beside him, with the bill he is sponsoring in Congress. "Al D'Amato, who polls every morning before breakfast, has jumped on this bandwagon," Mr. Green said. "No one has better antennae than he, so you know it's hot."
The issue seems just as lively in Florida, where more and more of the state's retirees have joined Medicare-managed health care plans. There, one candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor, Lieut. Gov. Buddy MacKay, complained that another, Rick Dantzler, a former State Senator, had stolen his patient protection proposal.
Peter Fenn, a consultant to Democrats, noted the rising number who have no health insurance at all. Since the demise of the Clinton plan, that number has climbed to more than 41 million from 38 million. At the same time, he said, there is a torrent of anecdotes about inadequate care.
"Everyone has a story of something that happened to a relative or a friend," Mr. Fenn said. "It's a big issue that hasn't been solved, and it's getting worse."
Voters do not want wide government intervention in health care, said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who helped develop Speaker Newt Gingrich's Contract With America four years ago. On the other hand, he added, "Support for setting minimum standards is a mile wide and a mile deep."
It is too soon to gauge the issue's vote-getting potential, political consultants say, but one case they cite was a special election in March in Santa Barbara, Calif. There, Lois Capps, running to succeed her husband, Representative Walter Capps, who died in October, soundly defeated State Assemblyman Tom Bordonaro, an anti-abortion Republican.
Early analyses attributed Mrs. Capps's election to a rejection of the far right. But Mrs. Capps said, "I think I won because of who I am, and who I am is a nurse and I care about health care." In a television commercial, she promised to fight for wider choice of doctors. Cathy Duvall, her campaign manager, said, "Lois was out there talking about education and health care, and that's what they were talking about."
To be sure, the political climate could change. The industry has time to refine its response, and Congress is debating several "patient protection" bills. The industry steadfastly opposes legislation like the D'Amato-Norwood bill, but political consultants say enactment could give Republicans cover in their campaigns.
Because the legislation is likely to include concessions to the industry, Democrats believe H.M.O.-regulation will keep fueling their campaigns. "Republicans are far too indebted to industry to do more than a fig leaf," said Daniel H. Sallick, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

HEADLINE: Argentina Arrests 8 Iranians and Ousts 7 in Anti-Jewish Bombings

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, May 16

 BODY:
The Argentine Government, saying it is nearing a breakthrough in the investigation of two bombings of Jewish centers in recent years, has arrested eight Iranian residents and ordered the expulsion of seven of Iran's eight embassy employees stationed here.
Senior officials say Argentina is close to breaking relations with Iran, acknowledging that American and Israeli intelligence officials have been correct for years in asserting that Teheran played a direct role in the 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy here and the 1994 bombing of the Argentine Israeli Mutual Association, the city's main Jewish community center. A total of 114 people died as a result of the two attacks. 
 At a news conference on Friday night, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said "potential but very significant evidence" had prompted the Government to downgrade relations with Teheran and consider even stronger actions in the next few days. He said Argentina would remove one of its two remaining diplomats in Teheran. Both nations had withdrawn their Ambassadors after the 1994 bombing.
Abdolrajim Sadatifar, Iran's senior diplomat here, denied any Iranian involvement in the bombings in interviews with Argentine journalists. "We don't want to break, destroy or damage our bilateral relations," he said, asserting that Buenos Aires was responding to "international pressures."
Iran announced that it was preparing economic sanctions against Argentina, hinting that it could block more than $600 million in annual Argentine imports.
The deterioration in Argentine-Iranian relations came only days after the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Louis J. Freeh, arrived in Buenos Aires and met with President Carlos Saul Menem to discuss improving cooperation against international drug trafficking and terrorism. Mr. Freeh told reporters that American and Argentine investigators had made major strides in recent months in determining who was behind the bombings, and that the F.B.I. would deliver a detailed report on its findings to the Argentine Government next month.
A federal judge, Juan Jose Galeano, the lead Argentine investigator in the case, has heard testimony in recent days linking Mohsen Rabbani, the former cultural attache at the Iranian Embassy, to the two bombings. Several Iranian witnesses reportedly told the judge that the Iranian diplomat had falsified passports and even given orders to terrorists who carried out the attacks.
Mr. Rabbani left Argentina 10 months ago, and was told by Argentine officials never to return.
Islamic Jihad, one of the armed groups linked to Hezbollah, which is based in Lebanon, has asserted responsibility for the attack on the Jewish community center. But no one directly involved in either bombing has ever been caught. Four Argentine police officers have been arrested on grounds of having aided the terrorists in the 1994 bombing.
Argentine officials have given few details about their investigation, but Argentine newspapers reported today that Government intelligence agents had intercepted telephone conversations from inside the Iranian Embassy strongly suggesting the complicity of Mr. Rabbani in the bombings.
Ismanian Khosrow, one of the Iranians arrested on Friday, reportedly threatened Iranian officials in one of the intercepted conversations that he would reveal what he knew of Iranian involvement in terrorist actions here unless he was paid an unspecified amount of money.

HEADLINE: Vegetarians And the Aged Eat the Best

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Women generally eat healthier diets than men, and both the elderly and vegetarians eat the healthiest diets, the Agriculture Department said in a report issued on Friday.
One major reason was that vegetarians and the elderly tended to be better informed about nutrition and the link between poor diet and certain diseases, the department said. 
 Miley Gonzalez, the department's undersecretary for research, education and economics, said, "The report demonstrates a strong case that information and knowledge are the keys to open the door to better diets and in turn to better health, longer lives and children with improved cognitive and learning abilities."
The so-called healthy eating index, developed by the department's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, measured how closely an individual's diet conformed with the guidelines published every five years by the Government and with the department's food pyramid, which recommends daily serving levels.
The guidelines call for restricting daily fat calorie intake to less than 30 percent of total calories. Saturated fat intake, the Government said, should be less than 10 percent of total calories, and high levels of cholesterol and sodium should be avoided.
The food pyramid suggests a daily diet based on 6 to 11 servings of grain, 3 to 5 of vegetables, 2 to 4 of fruit, 2 to 3 of milk and 2 to 3 of meat, with some variations for age.
The new report not only found a correlation between nutrition knowledge and the healthiness of a person's diet but also between age, race, income, sex and education levels.
With 100 being a perfect score, people below age 30 had an average score on the healthy eating index of 59.28, compared with 67.17 for people in their 50's and 60's. People 70 and older had a score of 69.33, the highest of any group.
Whites had a score of 64.78, compared with 59.66 for blacks, But the difference between Hispanic people, 64.04, and non-Hispanic people, 64.11, was slight.
Vegetarians scored 67.21 -- the second highest of any group -- compared with 63.95 for non-vegetarians. Women outscored men on the healthy eating index by 64.79 to 60.59.

HEADLINE: Budget Cuts Open a Rift For Democrats

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 16

 BODY:
Deep fissures have emerged in the Democratic campaign against Gov. George E. Pataki's $1.5 billion budget vetoes, with Democrats from conservative districts reluctant to attack a Republican governor who is popular among their constituents.
The mixed response of Democrats, combined with the lack of any widespread public outcry, suggests that the Governor's bold effort to reshape the budget may have little political fallout on Election Day. 
 After the vetoes of more than 1,000 budget items, the Democratic leaders of the Assembly had vowed an all-out public-relations war, instructing rank-and-file members to stir up voters with everything from letters to public hearings decrying the pain he had caused in their districts.
But while Democratic Assembly members in more liberal areas like New York City have stuck to the script, attacking Mr. Pataki as a callous budget cutter, their colleagues in more conservative districts, mostly suburban and upstate ones, either have been silent or have tempered their rhetoric.
Sandra R. Galef, a Democratic Assemblywoman from Westchester, said that she had no intention of leveling attacks on the Governor over vetoes that few people in her district are complaining about.
"I'm not out there to attack the Governor," Ms. Galef said. "Those are his decision. He will stand by them. He has a rationale for them." She added: "I realize that everybody has different priorities."
William Magee, a Democrat from the central New York community of Oneida, said any effort to characterize the Governor as cruel would not fly in his district, where he hasn't "had a significant number of people" complaining about the vetoes and where Mr. Pataki is popular.
As for the few constituents who have contacted him, Mr. Magee said he responded with a straightforward letter expressing "disappointment" over the cuts, nothing more.
He said he did not think the Governor's standing would suffer among his constituents as a result of the vetoes. "I represent a fiscally conservative district," Mr. Magee said. "I don't see it hurting him."
The schism among Democrats underscores the institutional divisions that have long plagued the Assembly, where the 97 Democratic members who form the majority represent constituencies that range from New York City ghettos that are highly dependent on government to upstate farm communities that are wary of it. It also reflects the statewide Democratic Party's inability to weave together a theme that resonates with voters.
"These budget cuts provided a great opportunity for Democrats to elevate an issue to take the Governor on with," said one Democratic strategist who spoke on condition of anonymity. "But too many Democratic politicians in this state are cowards. And the party is fairly useless because it has to rely on these Democrats to carry its water."
But Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, played down divisions in the Democratic ranks, asserting many members from upstate districts were scheduling hearings, sending letters and employing other tactics to get the word out about how harmful the Governor's vetoes are.
"The overwhelming majority of the members of the conference are invested in this campaign," Ms. Lynch said. "The campaign is just beginning. We're now moving from a legislative cycle to an election cycle. The ultimate test is Election Day."
In all, the Governor cut $760 million in new spending this year and more than $800 million in borrowing in future years, including $500 million for school construction projects. The vetoes allowed the Governor to seize control of the budget-making process after the Legislature took the unprecedented step of adopting a budget through public conference committees without Mr. Pataki's involvement.
It now seems increasingly unlikely that any of the vetoed items will be restored because talks between the Pataki administration and Democrats in the Legislature have essentially broken down.
Zenia Mucha, the Governor's spokeswoman, said the lack of any significant public protest underscored the fact that the final budget provided more than adequate funds to address the needs of New Yorkers. She added that as far as the administration was concerned, the budget was complete.
"What lawmakers should not underestimate is the people's ability to understand the budget process and to know when enough is enough," she said.
Initially, the Democratic leaders of the Assembly saw the vetoes as a huge political misstep, allowing them to cast Mr. Pataki as a politician who is insensitive to the needs of New Yorkers. Many Democrats felt that he would ultimately have to capitulate and restore many of the cuts as voter outrage grew.
But so far, with the economy generally good, there has been little evidence of widespread public anger as Democratic Assembly members have held hearings, most recently in Manhattan, that have at times been sparsely attended and subdued. There have in fact been a host of editorials in communities across upstate New York praising the Governor's vetoes as fiscally responsible.
In western New York near the Pennsylvania border, William L. Parment, a Democrat Assemblyman from Jamestown, said he had not heard anyone in his district describe the Governor's cuts as "cruel."
Nor did he think such a characterization was appropriate. Sure, he said, he disagreed with some of the vetoes, particularly in the area of education. But as a fiscal conservative himself, Mr. Parment said he agreed with some of the cuts and thought there should be more in areas like state borrowing.
"When people say, 'What do you think about the Governor's cuts?' I say, 'Which ones are you talking about,' " Mr. Parment said. "He should have vetoed some of the things in the budget that he vetoed, and he shouldn't have vetoed other things."
He said he realized that his position did not sit well with many fellow Democrats, but he saw no political advantage in using the cuts as the basis for a partisan attack.
Another upstate member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, put it more bluntly. "I could never take the approach of a Richard Brodsky," the member said, referring to a colleague who is known around the Capitol for his relentless attacks on the Governor. "I'm on the list of upstate Democrats the Republicans target each election. So I have to pick my fights on the merits, not on the politics."
On Long Island, Robert K. Sweeney, a Democratic Assembly member from Lindenhurst, said that he, too, had steered clear of politicizing the vetoes in a district where, he acknowledges, the Governor has "a lot of support."
Instead, Mr. Sweeney said he had simply let people know about the cuts and let them come to their own conclusions. "If people perceived it as a partisan attack," he said, "it wouldn't be effective in swaying public opinion. It probably wouldn't do me any good either."
That sort of restraint is by no means limited to suburban and upstate districts. In a conservative pocket of New York City where the Governor has had strong support, one Democratic Assembly member doubted that the public relations war against the Governor would achieve much of anything in that district, since voters barely mention the vetoes.
"To engage a Governor who has broad support in my district would not be perceived as the right thing to do," said the lawmaker, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "I don't know if it would hurt me. But it certainly wouldn't help me. It just isn't necessary. I don't want to go to war with this Governor."

HEADLINE: Many Customers Still Balk At Push-Button Banking;
Skipping A.T.M.'s for Tellers and Passbooks

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
In an age of money machines, on-line banking and the quicksilver transfer of cash via computer, Maria Russo, a 38-year-old typist, is holding fast to another age. Hers is the gentle -- some might say fusty -- world of teller windows, withdrawal slips and passbook savings accounts.
"I never use the automated teller machines, because you never know who's lurking behind you," Ms. Russo said, passbook in hand, as she paused recently beneath the soaring ceiling of the Flushing branch of Queens County Savings Bank. "And I prefer the passbook. I have to be able to see each entry that goes in there." 
 For many baby boomers the passbook is a quaint relic of childhood, when the concept of earning interest on money made from mowing the neighbor's lawn was new and thrilling. But passbooks, those passportlike booklets that document the ebb and flow of one's savings, did not go the way of camera flashbulbs and stereo turntables.
In fact, Ms. Russo is one of a sizable number of holdouts who have simply refused to get with the program. At savings banks in New York City, 40 percent to 60 percent of customers still use passbooks.
Their very existence may surprise those who think nothing of zapping money from one stock fund to another before breakfast. But when considering the fees that customers are sometimes charged to use automated teller machines, the hassle of correcting electronic mistakes and the temptation that round-the-clock access to money brings, old-time banking is not without its merits.
Rather than try to convert customers clinging to an earlier era, some banks seem happy to allow them to remain fiscal dinosaurs because they can be so profitable, parking money in savings accounts yielding less than 2.5 percent at a time when the stock market is showing annual gains of more than 20 percent.
These customers prefer thrift institutions, which offer the option of a passbook (as opposed to a monthly statement). They visit the same branch every week to deposit their paycheck, withholding enough cash to carry them through to the next payday. They hurl verbal darts at A.T.M.'s, accusing them of being unsafe, confusing and prone to error. And they relish the face-to-face contact at the teller's window.
"It's a very serious thing for people who have sacrificed greatly to know that the person handling their money is a good person," said Joseph R. Ficalora, president of Queens County Savings Bank, where well over half of the 41,500 customers still use passbooks. "They want to look you in the eye."
Some customers go a step further, wanting to look George Washington, Alexander Hamilton and Andrew Jackson in the eye.
"We get tremendous lines of people manually depositing their paychecks and bringing their passbooks to be stamped," said Charles J. Hamm, chief executive officer of Independence Savings Bank in Brooklyn. "Some of them even withdraw the money to make sure it's there. They want to see it, smell it, feel it. And then they'll get back on line and redeposit the cash."
To a large extent, the customers who bank the old-fashioned way fall into one of two groups. They are either new immigrants skittish about the security of financial institutions who may not have enough command of English to navigate the electronic superhighway, or they are older people who may have had direct experience with stock market crashes and who are comfortable with lifelong routines.
But banking experts say young customers are also in the mix. "That's one of the myths, that it's a function of age," said Ed Furash, chairman of Furash & Company, a banking industry consulting firm in Washington. "It's an attitudinal thing, and there are many young people who are technophobes."
At the Bensonhurst branch of Independence Savings Bank, however, most of the passbook holders there on a crystalline spring day were longtime residents, like Elizabeth Minacapelli, a 77-year-old retired dressmaker.
Mrs. Minacapelli said it never occurred to her to switch from her navy blue passbook to a monthly statement. "You look at it, and you know what's there," she said. As for the automated teller machines, she does not need extra cash after bank hours. "I'm from the old school, I guess," she said.
Joseph Cotugno, another customer at the same branch, where there is no Plexiglas distancing the 22 teller windows from the customers, gave similar reasons for not getting an A.T.M. card. "I come once a week to take out $100, and I'm never out at night anyway," he said.
A retired mechanic with New York City Transit, Mr. Cotugno has banked at the Bensonhurst branch since 1953 and now, at 73, has his life savings -- $83,000 -- on deposit there, mostly in conservative savings vehicles like one-year certificates of deposit. The branch welcomes its elderly customers with a large sitting area near a special window from which a teller calls out, "Next."
"A lot of the money that actually resides in the banking system belongs to this more traditional group, and the last thing you want to do is to alienate them," said David S. Berry, director of research for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, an investment bank that specializes in financial institutions.
Although many passbook holders also have money in the stock market, Mr. Berry said, "There are people who leave a shocking amount of money in what are fairly low-interest savings accounts."
All that money has helped savings banks reap profits through mortgage lending and refinancing. Mr. Ficalora, the president of Queens County Savings Bank, said the bank had "far more money on deposit by people who do not use A.T.M.'s than by people who do use A.T.M.'s."
Savings banks profit from such customers by taking the money on deposit in their savings accounts -- generally earning less than 2.5 percent -- and lending it out at a rate of about 7.5 percent. The spread may not be as wide as that realized by commercial banks from credit card accounts and commercial loans, but the default rate on residential loans is lower.
Queens County Savings Bank, with $1 billion on deposit, is now the 10th largest multifamily housing lender in the nation. Since the bank started to trade publicly in 1993, the stock has split four times, its value rising 800 percent. By comparison, an index of the nation's 24 largest commercial banks rose 329 percent during the same period.
Banking consultants say Brooklyn and Queens are hubs in the New York region for the more traditional banking customer, reflecting the demographics of age, ethnicity and income. Although savings banks have a disproportionate share of such customers, even a large commercial bank like Chase Manhattan reports that about a third of its three million branch customers in the region do not use cash machines.
But passbooks have been kept alive in only a half-dozen of the bank's 500 branches, mostly in Chinatown, in lower Manhattan, and in immigrant neighborhoods in Queens. "It's not a technology issue in those branches," said Ken Herz, a bank spokesman. "It relates to the fact that in their home countries there's a tremendous lack of confidence in the banking system."
But technology is an issue with many customers.
"I will not use an A.T.M.," said Carl Meyer, a 64-year-old sales executive in Manhattan, as he left the North Fork Bank branch at Avenue of the Americas and 37th Street. "I don't think they're safe, and I'm concerned about errors."
Even some bank officials are empathetic. David R. Jones, chairman of the board of Carver Federal Savings Bank in Harlem, said he watched as his 11-year-old daughter tried to withdraw $200 from a machine in another bank. Distracted by music, she hesitated a few moments when the money slid forward. "I saw the money being sucked back into the machine," Mr. Jones said.
He spent the next two and a half months trying to get his $200 from the bank, since the withdrawal had been recorded on a computer. "People say the elderly are not willing to get with it," he said. "But this is not silliness. It's not irrational. The machines are, in many cases, very difficult and are not very forgiving."
Yet banks say they are noticing a shift toward more modern ways of banking on the part of technophobes. "Even older, more conservative customers are finally coming around and doing more and more business through A.T.M.'s," said John Adam Kanas, president and chief executive officer of North Fork Bank. "But it has probably taken 15 years for them to break down those barriers."
North Fork Bank, a commercial bank with headquarters in Melville, N.Y., has systematically bought up seven savings banks in the last 10 years, including Eastchester and Home Federal, increasing its customer base to 700,000 and expanding its number of branches in the New York area to 110. The bank is soon to open a second Manhattan branch at Amsterdam Avenue and 72d Street.
Mr. Kanas views the high-maintenance customer base the bank has acquired as an asset. About half of his customers do not use the automated teller machines, while about half still have passbook accounts.
"A lot is made in our industry about the cost of our delivery system -- that is the branch," he said. "But very little is discussed about the fact that these types of traditional customers are willing to leave deposits with thrift institutions at lower-than-competitive interest rates. So it more than makes up for the cost of the delivery system."

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: IN INDIA;
Hindu Nationalists Move to Rule India's Atom Era

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 16

 BODY:
As India adjusts to its new status as a nuclear weapons state, many Indians are wondering whether they should prepare for a new era of dominance by the Hindu nationalist leaders who ordered five nuclear tests this week in the country's northwestern desert.
In effect, the nuclear tests have forced India to reset its political as well as its philosophical compass. They brought worldwide condemnation to a country that had long preached the gospel of peace, with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee proclaiming India to be the possessor of "the capacity for a big bomb" that had given it a new measure of international power. 
 But as the test series ended, many Indians concluded that the repercussions abroad, including severe economic sanctions imposed by the United States, could be matched by similarly far-reaching political effects at home.
In effect, those Indians said, Mr. Vajpayee, in approving the tests and winning the support of more than 90 percent of Indians in opinion polls, has struck a powerful blow against the opposition parties, rearranging the political landscape in the nationalists' favor.
The tests' political effects were suggested by a columnist today in The Asian Age, a newspaper that has supported the nuclear tests but warned against India's sliding into "jingoism." The writer, Seema Mustafa, a Muslim, said the Hindu nationalists were riding a tidal wave of support.
"To express a doubt about the political wisdom of this decision is to risk being dubbed an anti-national, and if you carry a Muslim name, as this columnist does, it will probably be sufficient to throw you across the other side of the border," Ms. Mustafa wrote, referring to Pakistan.
Only 10 weeks ago, the Bharatiya Janata Party that Mr. Vajpayee leads, the B.J.P., emerged from a general election with its best showing in 50 years of Hindu nationalist electioneering -- 171 seats in the 545-seat lower house of Parliament. For a nationalist movement long tarred by its link to the Hindu fanatic who assassinated Mohandas K. Gandhi, the independence leader, it was a moment of historic vindication, and enough for the nationalists to put together a governing coalition of 14 parties.
But the election showed the Hindu nationalists' weaknesses, too. Essentially, they remained a movement rooted in an arc of populous Hindi-speaking states in the country's north and west, known in India as the cow-belt states because of the region's strict adherence to Hindu traditions of cow worship. In at least 16 of India's 25 states, the nationalists remained political outsiders, dependent on alliances of convenience with regional allies that have a history of hostility with the nationalists.
Yet the election had been held in circumstances that favored the nationalists. The Congress Party, which governed India for 44 years but is increasingly rudderless and corrupt, staved off a rout only by drafting Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born heir to the legacy of the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty, as campaign leader. The only other contender, the United Front, a broad coalition of leftist and regional parties, was discredited by its chaotic performance in national government in the 20 months after a 1996 general election.
Still, the nationalists won the support of only 26 percent of the 345 million voters, and clawed their way into government only by scrapping measures intended to shift India from its secular tradition toward a new era of dominance for the country's Hindu majority of 700 million people.
Among other things, the nationalists were forced to set aside a potentially incendiary plan to build a Hindu temple in the northern city of Ayodhya on the site of an ancient mosque that a nationalist mob razed in 1992, an event that set off the worst Hindu-Muslim rioting since 1947.
Events in the new Government's first two months in office did not favor the nationalists. Mr. Vajpayee was depicted by newspapers as a "toothless tiger" as his Government was buffeted by internal feuding, and by a relentless series of demands for special treatment. They included the quashing of criminal charges by a 27-seat parliamentary group loyal to Jayalalitha Jayaram, a former movie actress who was ousted from power in Tamil Nadu state in 1996 amid accusations that she and her associates had looted state coffers.
Indian political commentators predicted that the nationalists might be discredited for failing to fulfill their campaign promise to provide a stable administration that would break with the ramshackle governments of the past. After abandoning Hindutva, a term that refers to the notion that India should be a Hindu state, the promise of stability was their main plank. To many middle-class, upper-caste Indians who are the nationalists' political backbone, "good governance" was far more important than razing mosques.
But quietly, the Vajpayee Government was taking steps to entrench its power. The governors of several key states were replaced with known supporters of the far-right nationalist group that many regard as the real power behind the Government, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S. Bureaucrats with Hindu nationalist sympathies were moved into top posts in key ministries in New Delhi and the states. Rumors abounded of plans to use national powers to dismiss inconvenient state governments, including the one in Tamil Nadu that has prosecuted Ms. Jayaram.
The most important move of all, the decision to carry out the nuclear tests, was apparently made as soon as Mr. Vajpayee took office on March 19. Indian newspapers have reported that top nuclear officials, including A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, regarded as the father of the Indian bomb, met with Mr. Vajpayee the same day, and left smiling broadly. About the same time, villagers in the area around Pokharan, where the tests were held, began seeing a step-up of military activity, especially at night, in sand storms and in bad weather, when American and Russian spy satellites would be blinded.
Much else is speculation. But many Indians were surprised by how openly the R.S.S. leadership displayed its influence over the new Government, many of whose leaders, including Mr. Vajpayee, are longtime party stalwarts. Key Cabinet appointments were blocked, or approved, by the group's leaders, who announced that they would keep a close watch on the new Government. Mr. Vajpayee has said the tests were motivated by a concern for India's national security, not by partisan considerations. But in an interview published on Friday by India Today, a news magazine, he hinted at the political benefits that nationalists expect to reap.
"Millions of Indians have viewed this occasion as the beginning of the rise of a strong and self-confident India," he said. "I fully share this assessment and this dream."
In another interview, with Outlook magazine, Mr. Vajpayee said "no more nuclear tests" were planned by the Government, Agence France-Presse reported today.
Opposition leaders have said the nationalists may be planning to rush into a new election in the hope of winning a parliamentary majority, something Mr. Vajpayee has denied. In any case, the nationalists could be blocked by India's Constitution, since President K. R. Narayan would be obliged to ask other parties in the current Parliament to form a new coalition. Mrs. Gandhi, the Congress Party leader, would almost certainly seek to lead a new government, pushing the nationalists into opposition.
But few doubt that the tests have created a new vulnerability for the opposition groups. One faction of the Communist Party condemned the tests as a breach of faith with India's poor, but almost every other group lined up with the Government. United Front leaders who led the last Government hastened to say they would have approved the tests if they had been re-elected, and Mrs. Gandhi, after dithering for four days, issued a statement of support, calling the testing "a national issue" that precluded partisan dissent.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Kuhn, Now Selig: Different Lines on Big Trades

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, has given his blessing to the latest -- though not necessarily the last -- round of the Florida Marlins' game of payroll purge. The trade that sent Gary Sheffield, Bobby Bonilla and Charles Johnson to the Los Angeles Dodgers, Selig said, is no different from so many others in baseball history.
Indeed, the Marlins did not ship those stars out for nothing in return. The Dodgers gave them Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile, two established and productive hitters. Before long, however, Piazza and Zeile will end their vacation in Florida and move on to another place of employment. And in return for them, the Marlins will get minor league prospects of the variety they received in last winter's trades. 
 The Marlins will not compete in the near future with Derrek Lee, Fletcher Baines, Steve Hoff, A. J. Burnett, Robert Stratton, Jesus Sanchez, Jesus Martinez, Eric Ludwick, Rafael Medina, Joe Fontenot and Oscar Henriquez. They have taken the place of players like Moises Alou, Kevin Brown, Devon White, Jeff Conine, Al Leiter and Robb Nen. Piazza and Zeile will bring more of the same.
Marlins General Manager Dave Dombrowski, who said yesterday that he had already heard from five teams about Piazza, and his staff might be sharp enough to have plucked some plums out of other teams' minor league systems and to have laid the foundation for the Marlins' next World Series championship team. But prospects have a funny way of turning into suspects.
In that regard, then, have the Marlins' deals been any different from the ones Charlie O. Finley made in 1976 when he was the maverick owner of the Oakland Athletics? Finley sold Vida Blue to the Yankees for $1.5 million and Joe Rudi and Rollie Fingers to the Boston Red Sox for $2 million. Bowie Kuhn, then the commissioner, vetoed the sales.
"Public confidence in the integrity of club operations and in baseball would be greatly undermined should such assignments not be restrained," Kuhn wrote in his decision. In his book, "Hardball," Kuhn later wrote, "If we let Finley's deals go through, how were we going to stop the weaker clubs from selling off players to the stronger ones, and what would become of competitive balance?"
What else have the Marlins done but "sold off" players to stronger teams? Although Kuhn believed Finley was liquidating his championship team, Finley said he planned to use the money he received for Blue, Rudi and Fingers -- who could have left as free agents -- to sign amateurs and rebuild his team.
Substitute minor league players for amateur players, and that is what the Marlins are doing. Minor league players might be closer to playing in the majors than amateur players, but Finley did a good job signing amateur players who became major league stars.
So has Selig erred in allowing the Marlins to decimate their championship team? One could conclude that he has if one wishes to use Kuhn's ruling as precedent.
Maybe Selig is right and Kuhn was wrong. Kuhn did not like Finley, and perhaps was predisposed to act against anything Finley did. Perhaps Kuhn would have viewed such sales differently had they been tried by, say, Walter O'Malley, his confidant and the owner of the Dodgers.
If Selig is right and it is O.K. for the Marlins to decimate themselves and make strong teams stronger, what was wrong with the Athletics, the Yankees and the Red Sox engaging in the same practice?
H. Wayne Huizenga, the grinch who gave Florida fans the World Series championship and then snatched it away, is in the process of selling the team to a group headed by the club president, Don Smiley. With a payroll that was slashed from $53 million at the end of last season to $33 million at the start of this season and now has plummeted, with the trade, to $24 million, Smiley is still not pleased. He is aiming for no more than $16 million in each of the next three years.
Such a paltry payroll does not make a team competitive. Montreal and Pittsburgh have learned that economic fact of baseball life. The Marlins know they will not be competitive for a few years. The Athletics would not have been competitive either for a few years had Kuhn allowed Finley to sell his players.
The Yankees, who won the American League pennant in 1976, and the Red Sox, who finished 15 1/2 games back, would have been stronger if they had been allowed to buy the players. The Dodgers expect to be stronger on balance after their trade with the Marlins. Sheffield, if he finally can find happiness, should flourish offensively; Johnson will help the underachieving pitching staff in ways Piazza could not, and Bonilla will replace Zeile at third base. If the trade serves as a catalyst to get them into serious division contention, they will have Selig to thank.
Perhaps this is one time where the later non-action (Selig's) should have served as the precedent for the earlier action (Kuhn's).

HEADLINE: Can Multinationals Be Trusted?;
A Global Absurdity

 BODY:

To the Editor:
American human rights advocates pressured Nike to accept further inspection of Asian factories (Business Day, May 13). They might call this progress, but we are losing the focal point of the criticism of Nike. The point is not only the child labor and low wages in Asia; it is also the absurd enterprise of American manufacturers in the global economy. 
 Jobs are taken away from American workers, and inordinately profitable products are sold to American consumers. This may be the reality of the market economy, but who thinks that it is decent to watch the birth of a number of billionaires on one side and the destruction of the American working class on the other?

HEADLINE: A New Major Player Joins Winery Business

BYLINE: By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
TEN years ago, Long Island's maritime wine industry, then still in its adolescence, sought gurus among chateau executives and grape-growing experts in maritime Bordeaux. It invited a team of renowned grape-cultivation and wine-making experts, and picked their brains during four days of field trips and symposiums.
Today the 25-year-old industry, 20 wineries strong -- with more on the way -- has moved into young adulthood. And the French connection is as strong as ever, perhaps even stronger, because of the imminent opening of Macari Vineyards in Mattituck. 
 When the winery-visiting season unofficially begins on Memorial Day, Macari will make its debut, and, it seems, may immediately become one of the most important players in the East End wine trade.
Conceivably, Macari may inherit the mantle of the East End's most Francophile estate, which for a quarter-century has been held by Alex and Louisa Hargrave, who are selling the Hargrave Vineyard in Cutchogue.
The 1998 growing season also brings three smaller producers on stream for their first agricultural year in brand-new wineries: Laurel Lake Vineyards in Laurel, Ternhaven Cellars in Greenport and Channing Daughters in Bridgehampton, which hopes to open its winery on July 4. Corey Creek in Southold, whose wines are made elsewhere, opened a tasting room recently.
Macari's resources are considerable. They begin with nearly 115 planted acres on a 334-acre estate. Thirteen varieties of grapes are planted, all but one of them French. In addition, the vineyard manager, Bernard Ramis, and winemaker, Gilles Martin, were both born in France. Mr. Martin, who is 33, has worked in France, Germany, Australia, Virginia and California.
The wines will definitely have a French orientation, said Joseph T. Macari Jr., who with his father, Joseph Sr., are co-owners. "You can make wine easier in the French style with our fruit than with California fruit," Mr. Macari Jr. said.
"I believe in the appellation controlee system," Mr. Martin said, referring to the French law intended to insure that wine expresses local conditions. "My job is to have the wines have a Long Island style. My blends, of course, are conducted through my French taste buds."
The winery, at the site of the former Mattituck Hills Winery, is opening two years after the Macaris bought the bankrupt operation from the North Fork Bank. Mr. Macari Sr. said that, over many years, more than $9 million has been invested in the enterprise: in land and planting, redesigning and redoing the former Mattituck Hills installation and buying equipment.
The Macaris own 2,000 feet of waterfront, including a bluff overlooking Long Island Sound. "We have been thinking about putting a chateau up there," Mr. Macari Sr. said.
If all goes as the Macaris plan, the winery will ultimate join the ranks of the East End's high-production estates.
The biggest is Pindar in Peconic on the North Fork: 251 acres planted in 18 different grapes, and 67,000 cases of 15 kinds of wine produced in 1997. But that's only part of the story. Duck Walk, Pindar's sister winery in Water Mill on the South Fork, has 84 acres planted: 41 on the South Fork and 43 on the North Fork (32 once belonged to Mattituck Hills). Last year it produced nearly 20,000 cases of 10 different wines from 15 grape varieties.
Second in size is Palmer in Aquebogue: 126 acres owned and leased; 11 different kinds of grapes; in 1997, 23,500 cases of 11 kinds of wine.
Before opening its doors, Macari has produced 12,000 cases in a building that is designed to handle 20,000, with further expansion possible. "Our goal is to do 30,000 cases, all with our own grapes," Mr. Macari Jr. said.
Mr. Martin joined Macari last August. He holds an enology degree from Montpellier, France's great viticultural school, and did an apprenticeship in the Vacqueyras appellation in the Rhone. He worked at Weingut Hans Lang in the Rheingau region of Germany, at Houghton in western Australia, Oasis Winery in Virginia, as a consultant for Cotes du Rhone producers and as manager and wine maker at Delas Freres in the Rhone. For six years he was assistant wine maker at the Roederer Estate in Mendocino, which some critics (myself included) consider California's best sparkling-wine house.
Macari is ready to go with five wines (the prices are approximate): a 1996 barrel-fermented chardonnay ($14); a simpler 1997 chardonnay fermented in stainless steel ($12); 1996 merlot ($16); 1997 sauvignon blanc ($12) and a 1997 rose called Rose d'une Nuit, made of about 50 percent cabernet sauvignon and 50 percent cabernet franc ($11).
A 1997 barrel-fermented chardonnay is to be released in August or September. And sometime in 1999 Macari will release a brand-named Bordeaux-style proprietary wine composed of cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, merlot and malbec.
In addition, 500 cases of sparkling wine, a blend of chardonnay and pinot meunier, were made for release in 1999.
The Macaris are longtime North Fork residents. Part of the estate is a 140-acre potato farm that has been in the family for 35 years. The Macaris also own a total of 190 more acres in the vicinity, 20 of which will be planted to chardonnay this year, as well as 4 acres of 8-year-old merlot vines around the winery, their oldest vines.
In addition to such reds as merlot (24 acres), cabernet franc (14), cabernet sauvignon (3), malbec (2), petit verdot (2), the property also has pinot noir (2) and pinot meunier (14 acres, of which 7 will be grafted over to merlot and 3 to pinot noir this year). There are also two acres of Dornfelder, a German grape.
As for whites, in addition to the chardonnay (26 acres), viognier (9), sauvignon blanc (7), there are pinot blanc (4) and semillon (nearly 2).
The quality of Macari fruit is respected, and it has been bought by other local producers: Laurel Lake, Palmer, Pellegrini and Schneider Vineyards (which has a Cutchogue office, owns no vines or winery but buys fruit and contracts with Bedell to make wine).
Managing that fruit is Mr. Ramis, Macari's 36-year-old vineyard manager, the son of a vineyard manager in the Languedoc region of France. "I am not a graduate from the university or something like that," he said. "Everything I know, I learned in the vineyard." He worked for an organic-wine producer in St.-Chinian, a red-wine appellation in the Languedoc, before taking a job with Mr. Macari in late 1996.
"Our long-term goal is to be organic," Mr. Ramis said. "This year I am going to do 2 acres 100 percent organic. I want to see the results. If it works, more next year."
The Macaris are looking for a distributor, and hope for placements in Long Island and New York City restaurants and retail stores before long.
Laurel Lake, representing an investment that the owner, Michael McGoldrick, puts at $3 million, opened in October. His winemaker is Gregory Gove, who previously worked for Pindar and the Hargrave Vineyard.
At present it is selling six wines: 1994 and 1996 regular chardonnays (each $15) and 1995 chardonnay reserve ($16), all made from Laurel Lake fruit by Dan Kleck at Palmer before the winery was built; a 1995 cabernet sauvignon ($24; made from purchased fruit by Eric Fry at the Lenz Winery); 1997 Lake Rose, a rose of cabernet sauvignon ($10), made by Mr. Gove, and nonvintage Wind Song ($8; a blend of chardonnay, pinot blanc and Cayuga White made in the Finger Lakes region upstate).
Mr. Gove has produced a 1997 reserve chardonnay from Laurel Lake fruit, which may be released in late summer.
Laurel Lake, whose production is 6,000 cases, was started in 1994 when Mr. McGoldrick bought the nearly 30-acre San Andreas Vineyard in Laurel. Only chardonnay is planted there: 15 acres, all planted in the early 1980's.
Like the duties at every serious boutique winery, Laurel Lake's is all-consuming. Mr. McGoldrick left the real estate and automobile-transmission-repair business only to find, not surprisingly, that he doesn't so much own the winery as it owns him.
He's working systematically around the handsome New England-style building, which houses a tasting room and the wine-production equipment, focusing recently on the landscaping. Some replanting of vines is under way, and planting of cabernet sauvignon and merlot are envisioned for 1999.
Channing Daughters, the most recent South Fork winery to go into business, was bonded in 1997 and started selling wine, made elsewhere, last winter. It hopes to open a winery, a converted six-year-old barn, on July 4. Larry Perrine, the former wine maker at Gristina Vineyards, is general manager and wine maker.
He is also a partner with the proprietors, Walter and Molly Channing, who named the winery for their four young daughters.
Winegrowing, like most agricultural enterprises, is capital-intensive and high-risk -- something appreciated by Mr. Channing, a partner in a Manhattan-based venture-capital fund specializing in the medical field, the C. W. Group. He puts his gearing-up investment in the business at $1 million to $1.5 million.
The first portion of his 20 acres of vines (on a 125-acre parcel), currently overseen by John Witherspoon, the vineyard manager, was planted in 1982. The unusual label depicts another passion -- in fact, a second profession -- of Mr. Channing's: wood sculpturing. The trees he carves can be seen on his property.
At 1,500 produced cases now, Channing Daughters could increase the quantity to 3,000 without adding tanks. At present it is selling a 1995 merlot (called Sculpture Garden; $17) and 1996 chardonnay (Brick Kiln; $17). This summer will bring a 1997 Brick Kiln chardonnay ($17), a lighter 1997 Scuttlehole chardonnay ($12) and a nonvintage merlot-cabernet franc blend called Fresh Red ($12). All are estate-grown.
The winery will also release a second label, Channing Perrine, whose wines are based on North Fork grapes. The first wines will be a 1997 sauvignon blanc carrying a Mudd Vineyard designation ($14), and a 1997 riesling with a Rolling Ridge Vineyard designation ($12), the grapes having come from that tract at Peconic Bay Vineyards.
The Channings' 20 acres consisting of chardonnay (9), merlot (4), cabernet franc (1), pinot gris (2), pinot blanc (2) and Lemberger (2), a versatile red grape that has been successful in Washington State.
The co-owner of Ternhaven Cellars, Harold Watts, a professor of economics at Columbia University for 22 years, recently taught his last class. But retirement won't mean a life of ease.
Establishing Ternhaven, the East End's smallest and easternmost winery -- 550 cases a year -- needs plenty of attention, and Mr. Watts's partner, Carole Donlin, a business consultant in Manhattan, pitches in. He is prepared for the heavy work. "I recently took delivery on a used forklift," he said.
Mr. Watts made the leap into professionalism from amateur wine making. He owns five acres of land, four in vines, on Alvah Lane in Cutchogue. He puts his overall investment in the wine business at about $400,000.
His business card announces "Traditional Bordeaux Style Reds," and so far they have taken the form of 1994 and 1995 cabernet sauvignons and merlots ($15 to $20), made by Russell Hearn at Pellegrini.
All the 1997's (to appear in 1999) were made by Mr. Watts at his winery, which is partly a converted, long-vacant gasoline station. Both partners are sales managers, taking the bottles around and finding placements in Long Island and New York City outlets.
Mr. Watts's grapes are also put into a blend drolly called Claret et d'Alvah ($17), which, he says, sells particularly well on the East End. Apparently the name marries well with local boosterism.

HEADLINE: HOW CHINESE WON RIGHTS TO LAUNCH SATELLITES FOR U.S.

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
On Oct. 9, 1995, Secretary of State Warren Christopher ended a lengthy debate within the Clinton Administration by initialing a classified order that preserved the State Department's sharp limits on China's ability to launch American-made satellites aboard Chinese rockets.
Both American industry and state-owned Chinese companies had been lobbying for years to get the satellites off what is known as the "munitions list," the inventory of America's most sensitive military and intelligence-gathering technology. But Mr. Christopher sided with the Defense Department, the intelligence agencies and some of his own advisers, who noted that commercial satellites held technological secrets that could jeopardize "significant military and intelligence interests." 
 There was one more reason not to ease the controls, they wrote in a classified memorandum. Doing so would "raise suspicions that we are trying to evade China sanctions" imposed when the country was caught shipping weapons technology abroad -- which is what happened in 1991 and 1993 for missile sales to Pakistan.
The Secretary of State's decision to keep satellites on the munitions list, making it harder for them to be exported, did not stand for long. Five months later, President Clinton took the unusual step of reversing it.
Control of export licensing for communications satellites was shifted to the Commerce Department, then run by Ronald H. Brown, who was deeply interested in promoting American businesses overseas and had been one of the Democratic Party's key fund-raising strategists. Several licenses have since been approved.
A reconstruction of Mr. Clinton's decision to change the export control rules, based on interviews and documents, shows that it followed a turf war between the State and Commerce Departments, and a broader debate over how to balance America's security concerns and commercial competition in the hottest of all the emerging markets.
It also illustrates the intersection of the interests of both large American donors and surreptitious foreign donors to the 1996 campaign.
Both American satellite makers and the Chinese were delighted with the decision because the Commerce Department has dual responsibilities: licensing sensitive exports and promoting sales of American goods around the world.
One of the beneficiaries of that decision, it now turns out, was China Aerospace because its rockets could launch American satellites. An executive of the state-owned Chinese company, Liu Chaoying, is said to have provided tens of thousands of dollars from Chinese military intelligence to the Democratic Party in the summer of 1996.
Ms. Liu's involvement was described to Federal investigators recently by Johnny Chung, a Democratic fund-raiser who says he took $300,000 from Ms. Liu -- who is also a lieutenant colonel in the Chinese military -- and donated almost $100,000 of it to Democratic causes, apparently keeping the rest for his businesses.
President Clinton's decision was announced in March 1996, several months before the donations were made. But the actual change was delayed until the fall.
The White House said it did not know the source of Mr. Chung's donations and denies that the decision was influenced by campaign donations, domestic or foreign.
"This was motivated by competitiveness and streamlining bureaucracy concerns, and nothing else," Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, said in an interview two weeks ago.
On Friday, Mr. Berger's spokesman, Eric Rubin, said the decision was also part of the Administration's China policy, and specifically its effort to encourage China to clamp down on military exports.
"On many occasions, this was discussed with the Chinese Government because we believe that policy on satellite licenses is one of the tools we have to strengthen our nonproliferation policy," Mr. Rubin said.
Mr. Clinton's decision took place after months of tension with Beijing.
In January reports of China's export of nuclear technology to Pakistan and missiles to Iran caused considerable concern in Congress and the Pentagon. In early May, two months after Mr. Clinton reversed the Secretary of State, the Administration said China had agreed to curb its missile and nuclear exports. But that announcement was greeted with considerable skepticism by Republican critics, including Bob Dole, who was well on the way to getting the nomination for President.
During the campaign, the Republicans attacked Mr. Clinton for failing to curb China's sales of nuclear and missile technology to other countries.
The satellite decision in March was one element of the Administration's "carrot-and-stick-approach to working with China," said James Lilley, a former United States Ambassador to Beijing.
But in the way business and diplomacy mix in Washington's dealings with China, the decision also resonated in boardrooms on both sides of the Pacific. It satisfied the commercial interests of the American aerospace industry, which had long sought access to China's low-cost ability to launch satellites into space, aboard rockets called the Long March.
And it bolstered China's own commercial interests. Ms. Liu's parent company, China Aerospace, owns a large piece of a Hong Kong satellite operator. It also owns the China Great Wall Industry Corporation, the rocket company that launches both private satellites and tests and provides equipment for the missiles in China's nuclear arsenal. It was Great Wall that the State Department sanctioned in 1991 and 1993 for selling missiles to Pakistan.
Other powerful Chinese state enterprises also had multibillion-dollar stakes in getting access to American satellites. Among them was the China International Trade and Investment Corporation, whose chairman, Wang Jun, gained unwanted attention in the United States last year when it was revealed that he attended one of Mr. Clinton's campaign coffee meetings in the White House. The day of Mr. Wang's visit, Mr. Clinton, in what Mr. Rubin said was a coincidence, signed waivers allowing the Chinese to launch four American satellites -- though they were unrelated to the business interests of China International Trade.
"Any suggestions that these decisions were influenced by Wang Jun's presence in the U.S. is completely unfounded," Mr. Rubin said.
It is not known what motivated Ms. Liu or the Chinese military to make the donations. Ms. Liu's father, Gen. Liu Huaqing, was not only China's highest military officer but a member of the leadership of the Communist Party.
The White House and the Democratic National Committee deny any knowledge of the source of Mr. Chung's $366,000 in donations, most predating his connection with Ms. Liu, and all of which was returned.
But there is no doubt that American companies -- partners and suppliers of China International Trade and China Aerospace -- put enormous pressure on the White House. They were also important campaign contributors. For example, the chief executive of Loral Space and Communications gave $275,000 between November 1995 and June 1996 to the Democrats.
 
The Precursor
A Lobbying Effort To Persuade Bush
China's drive to obtain a steady stream of satellite technology from the United States preceded the Clinton Administration's arrival in Washington.
In 1990, just a year after the killings at Tiananmen Square, officials from China Aerospace and the Chinese Government approached Mr. Lilley, the American Ambassador, pressing for President Bush to waive restrictions enacted in the aftermath of Tiananmen that barred China from launching American satellites.
"They hit me very hard," Mr. Lilley recalled recently. "It was a prestige national program. It was putting China on the map as the big space country of the 21st century."
Mr. Bush, who became America's first permanent representative in Communist China in 1974, granted a waiver that allowed a launching on one of China's Long March rockets. In 1992, a number of Senators -- including Al Gore, then still a Senator from Tennessee -- wrote to the Bush Administration warning that China was using the launchings to "gain foreign aerospace technology that would be otherwise unavailable to it."
In the last days of the 1992 Presidential campaign, Mr. Gore made the waivers an issue, contending that President Bush "has permitted five additional American-built satellites to be launched by the Chinese."
"President Bush really is an incurable patsy for those dictators he sets out to coddle," Mr. Gore said in a speech at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
 
The Argument
Business Leaders Pressure Clinton
Almost as soon as Mr. Clinton took office, business leaders began their campaign to drastically change his views about China.
Both Chinese and American companies were working to get satellites off the State Department's munitions list. The rules for exporting goods that are on the list are particularly tough. Congress must be notified 30 days in advance. Moreover, the State Department considers only nonproliferation issues and defers to the Pentagon's judgments.
In contrast, the Commerce Department's export-control administration solicits a host of views and must weigh the effects of its decisions on America's competitive position.
Mr. Christopher's aides also noted in their 1995 classified memorandum that "U.S. firms remain concerned there could be additional sanctions imposed on China precluding future munitions licenses," exactly the kind of sanctions that had been only recently lifted for China Aerospace's subsidiaries.
And there was a lot at stake: an estimated 14 commercial communications satellite launchings a year worldwide, costing several hundred million dollars apiece.
"The business community regarded the inclusion of civilian satellites on the munitions list as an insult," said William A. Reinsch, the Under Secretary of Commerce for export control, who fought Mr. Christopher's decision. "We're the only country that treats them that way."
The Chinese also understood that they had a huge stake in the outcome of the decision. Zuoyi Huang, president of the California subsidiary of China Great Wall, a part of the China Aerospace empire, said in an interview that his company was eager for any changes that would insure easier access to American technology.
"The license takes time," he said. "You have to get a waiver from the President. The customers can't wait. It's just pure commercial use. It's not a military threat to the United States."
 
The Review
A Decision Against And a Quick Appeal
The arguments came to a head in 1995. C. Michael Armstrong, then the chief executive of Hughes Electronics and newly chosen as the head of President Clinton's export council, asked to meet Mr. Christopher. He urged that satellites, which his company produces, no longer be treated as military goods.
The Secretary of State promised that he would conduct a detailed review in consultation with the Department of Defense, the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency and the Department of Commerce.
But the majority of the interagency group quickly found itself at odds with the aerospace industry. A major issue was how to protect encryption equipment, which is built into a satellite and interprets instructions from ground controllers who manipulate the satellite once it is in orbit. Similar devices are used to communicate with American spy satellites, and the Pentagon and intelligence agencies worried that anyone who could crack the code could take control of the satellites themselves.
On Aug. 17, 1995, a memorandum prepared for the interagency group noted that the chief executive of a satellite company told Mr. Christopher that "once it is embedded in the satellite, the encryption device has no military significance." Thus, the industry argued, there was little risk that the Chinese would get their hands on the encryption devices -- especially because American military officials are supposed to watch the satellites with care when they are in Chinese hands.
But, the memorandum went on, "the national security position" is that "the nature of the device itself," not its location, "should be used to determine whether it must be controlled as a military item."
The encryption issue was one of the main reasons the interagency group -- over the objections of the Commerce Department -- recommended that satellites remain on the munitions list. Mr. Christopher concurred. Soon after Mr. Christopher put his initials on the decision memorandum, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown appealed the decision to the President.
 
The Turnaround
The Commerce Dept. Wins a Turf Battle
The debate surrounding the appeal did not heat up for four months. The nature of the arguments that went to the White House is still unclear: many of the documents remain classified. But those that have been reviewed by The New York Times show that the White House and the Commerce Department began communicating again about the issue on Feb. 8, 1996, two days after President Clinton broke a backlog of applications for launchings by China, by approving four of them that day.
Mr. Clinton signed those waivers the same day that Wang Jun, the man who was often referred to during the campaign finance investigations as a "Chinese arms dealer," visited Washington. His company, the China International Trade and Investment Corporation, has a multibillion-dollar stake in one of Hong Kong's largest satellite companies.
That same day, Mr. Wang met with Mr. Brown, at his expansive office in the Commerce Department. And that evening, Mr. Wang attended a coffee at the White House, an event Mr. Clinton later called "clearly inappropriate." Others at the coffee said Mr. Wang never spoke during the session.
By mid-February, for reasons that are still murky, there seemed to be some urgency at the White House to decide whether to reverse Mr. Christopher's decision, shifting satellite export licensing to the Commerce Department.
A Feb. 15 State Department memorandum talks about speeding up the process because "the Administration wanted to wrap this up."
In the end, the State Department relented. Participants in the final debate said that the President concluded that the technology could be protected through the Commerce Department, just as the department protects supercomputers and other sensitive technologies.
The President's decision was announced on March 14. Commerce officials, who had just won one of Washington's nastiest turf wars, were jubilant.
"Good news," officials were told by E-mail. The electronic message went on to recommend a "low key" spin on the news that would "not draw attention to the decision."
Internal Commerce Department documents show that officials were anticipating questions from reporters and Congress about whether the decision represented an effort to ease technology transfers to China and remove items from sanctions -- some of the same concerns that figured in Mr. Christopher's decision.
In the days preceding the announcement, China had raised tensions with its Asian neighbors and the United States to new heights, firing M-9 ballistic missiles, which carried dummy warheads, into target zones 30 miles off the shore of Taiwan.
The March 14 announcement said that regulations putting into effect the President's decision would be issued within 30 days. But the bureaucratic infighting continued.
Finally, the State Department issued the regulations shifting most satellite licensing to the Commerce Department.
They were published on Nov. 5, 1996, the day President Clinton was re-elected.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 24, 1998, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A chart last Sunday about China's effort to win the right to launch American satellites referred incorrectly to the message conveyed in September and October 1993 to President Clinton by Michael Armstrong, the chief executive officer of the Hughes Electronics Corporation, an American maker of communications satellites. Mr. Armstrong, in letters to Mr. Clinton, complained that State Department sanctions against Chinese missile companies hurt his business; he did not mention the China Aerospace Corporation specifically.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "From Sanctions to Satellite Licenses"
Between 1993 and 1996, the Clinton Administration dropped its sanctions on China Aerospace, a state-owned Chinese company, for selling missiles to Pakistan and gave the company permission to launch private United States communications satellites, despite some lingering concerns in the Administration about security.
 
August 1993 -- State Department imposes economic sanctions against subsidiaries of Beijing-based China Aerospace for selling missiles to Pakistan. The sanctions bar American companies from doing business with the concerns.
 
Sept.-Oct. 1993 -- Michael Armstrong, the chief executive of Hughes Electronics Corp., tells the President the sanctions hurt his company because China Aerospace is a low-cost launcher of satellites.
 
Nov. 1993 -- The Administration signals it might ease satellite licensing procedures and Mr. Armstrong relays to the White House an encouraging reaction from his contacts in China.
 
April 1995 -- Secretary of State Warren Christopher begins an interagency review of restrictions on the export of communi-cations satellites at Mr. Armstrong's urging. The companies want to see responsibility for the issue shifted to the Commerce Department.
 
Oct. 9, 1995 -- Following hte recommendation of the Pentagon, intelligence agencies and his advisers, Mr. Christopher keeps satellites under the purview of the State Department. The Commerce Department appeals this decision to President Clinton.
 
Feb. 6, 1996 -- With the relations between the United States and China tense over Beijing's military operations and sales, President Clinton approves the launch of four American satellites by Chinese rockets.
 
Mid-February 1996 -- The White House revives the effort to ease restrictions on satellite exports, reviewing anew Mr. Christopher's decision.
 
March 8-15, 1996 -- China conducts missile tests near Taiwan, signalling its displeasure over talk of Taiwanese independence during Taiwan's elections.

ACHIEVING OUR COUNTRY
 Leftist Thought in
 Twentieth-Century America.
 By Richard Rorty.
 159 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
 Harvard University Press. $18.95. 
 Richard Rorty is a scandal to his profession. He is a philosopher who thinks that philosophy is a distraction from more important matters. He has for years argued that the pursuit of Truth -- as distinct from the humbler search for usable truths -- is fueled by self-deception. He has insisted that even if humanity all too often behaves cruelly and sadistically, we would be better off without a sense of sin. Nevertheless, Rorty has a substantial streak of filial piety. It was his hero, John Dewey, who first scandalized his philosophical readers almost a century ago by urging them to turn away from "the problems of philosophy" to "the problems of men." "Achieving Our Country" is an appeal to American intellectuals to abandon the intransigent cynicism of the academic, cultural left and to return to the political ambitions of Emerson, Dewey, Herbert Croly and their allies.
What Rorty has written -- as deftly, amusingly and cleverly as he always writes -- is a lay sermon for the untheological. Walt Whitman, another of his heroes, memorably wrote, "And I call to mankind, Be not curious about God, / For I who am curious about each am not curious about God." Rorty's gloss on this is that "there is no standard, not even a divine one, against which the decisions of a free people can be measured." We do not need to know what God wants but what we are capable of wanting and doing. Americans, at any rate Americans pre-eminently, have embarked on a voyage into uncharted waters. They have set out to realize the American dream, knowing that they will change their minds about what it is, but sharing a religious attachment to the idea of a society devoted to earthly happiness, freedom, tolerance and mutual affection.
In fact, Rorty's argument against intransigent leftists and superstitious conservatives has a still longer pedigree. At the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, a London Dissenting minister, the Rev. Richard Price, preached a "Discourse on the Love of Our Country," which provoked the greatest of conservative tracts, Edmund Burke's "Reflections on the Revolution in France." Price defended a rational love of country. A democratic country that cared for all its people, and governed them equitably and intelligently, we might justly take pride in. Habitual allegiance to kings and aristocrats was no condition for a free person. Price was so comprehensively buried by Burke's ragings against revolutionary excess that it has been difficult ever since for the left to express pride in country.
But Rorty thinks that national pride is the political equivalent of individual self-respect. Without it, nothing can be achieved. The obvious corruption of national pride occurs when it turns into national self-aggrandizement or into a brutal enthusiasm for simple military might. A proper love of country is entirely consistent with wanting a more effective United Nations to preserve world peace, and with regarding the Vietnam War as an unmitigated disaster -- and Rorty is indeed an internationalist who regards the Vietnam War as an unmitigated disaster. It is also consistent with being entirely unforgiving about the atrocities that besmirch the history of the United States, as they do the history of every other country. The conservative wish to take our eyes off our country's shortcomings is not one that Rorty shares.
But his main target is his allies rather than his more obvious opponents. The title "Achieving Our Country" is drawn from the famous last sentence of James Baldwin's "Fire Next Time." There, Baldwin called on the saving remnant, "the relatively conscious whites and the relatively conscious blacks," to "end the racial nightmare, and achieve our country, and change the history of the world." The point of invoking James Baldwin, of course, is that he was entirely unforgiving of his country's sins and still looked forward with hope to a better future. A left that fights for the political and economic changes that will "achieve our country" is the left that the United States once possessed and needs as much as ever, but is hardly to be seen.
This is not an unfamiliar complaint. Many writers have lamented the decline of the so-called public intellectual, and have blamed the post-1945 explosion of higher education for taking intellectual life off the street and into the ivory tower. The novelty of Richard Rorty's version of the complaint, however, lies in the very particular and very American gloss that he puts on it. Borrowing one of John Dewey's most famous and most contentious claims, Rorty, who is University Professor of Humanities at the University of Virginia, argues that some philosophical views -- almost all philosophical views, in fact -- take a "spectatorial" view of the world and therefore of human life. Philosophers have wanted to find ultimate standards, absolute standards, eternal standards, whether of Truth, Beauty or Goodness, and have supposed that their task is to measure the world by them.
FEW thinkers other than the American pragmatists have had the courage to insist that it is life itself that justifies our ideas about what is true, good or beautiful. But only someone who thinks that, or who believes it without raising the question in the first place, can have the kind of "participatory" grasp of the world celebrated by Whitman and Dewey. The bearing of this on our current discontents is the substance of the Massey Lectures on which this short book is based. The standing temptation for intellectuals is to mistake theoretical radicalism for something politically more useful. Marxism, Rorty says, is something that Americans could well have done without: "It would be a good thing if the next generation of American leftists found as little resonance in the names of Karl Marx and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin as in those of Herbert Spencer and Benito Mussolini. It would be an even better thing if the names of Ely and Croly, Dreiser and Debs, A. Philip Randolph and John L. Lewis were more familiar to these leftists than they were to the students of the 60's."
Marxism, however, is hardly the flavor of the month on American campuses. The more present threat is posed by the approach to literary and cultural studies that consists essentially in unmasking every event and every text as a shield for or a response to patriarchy and racism. It is not that Rorty thinks that the cultural left has no achievements to its credit; its attacks on the cruelties of private life and on racial and sexual insult have done a lot of good. But it has ignored the issues that the reformist left once made its own: jobs and job security, income inequality, money in politics. Combating sexism in literature is a good thing, but less good than preventing the corporate bagmen from making their rounds in Congress.
Those of us who share Richard Rorty's view that the United States of America is a grand romantic poem to which we should all contribute our best stanzas will enjoy "Achieving Our Country." What of those whom it criticizes -- despairing Heideggerians, or Foucaultian antihumanists, or even the disciples of Reinhold Niebuhr, decent liberals smitten with a deep sense of original and inescapable sin? It is hard to say. Sometimes Rorty shrugs, as if to signal that they have their visions and he has his and the facts cannot choose between them. In which case he will surely find himself saying, "I played and you did not sing; I piped and you did not dance." More often he argues, as any good social democrat might, that we would do better to try to improve the world than lament its fallen condition. On that he will carry with him a good many readers, even those who might be inclined to quibble with his views on poetry, philosophy and the history of the United States.

The on-line version of Playboy, with 25,000 paying customers, is not going to obscure the magazine's 4.5 million subscribers worldwide anytime soon. But the Internet business was the only bright spot in an otherwise dismal quarterly report this month.
The magazine publishing group reported minuscule earnings last quarter and a 30 percent decline in newsstand revenue compared with the corresponding quarter in 1997. Advertising revenue was down 11 percent. The World Wide Web site, a mixture of advertising and subscriber-supported content from the magazine, as well as a catalogue of Playboy-brand merchandise for sale, showed 84 percent growth, to $1.42 million from $772,000. 
 What does Christie Hefner, chairwoman and chief executive of Playboy Enterprises Inc., the empire started by her father in 1953, make of this? In a statement, Ms. Hefner said she thought Playboy could become "the first true global multimedia brand and do so with a much lower investment in marketing than is needed by other Internet companies."
Besides the brand, analysts say, the on-line service has another thing going for it: its content. "Adult revenue is one of the very few areas where people are willing to pay, and that opens a whole new revenue stream that The New York Times or ABCNews.com does not have available to it," said Bill Bass, an analyst with Forrester Research in Boston.
Purchased each month on the newsstand, Playboy magazine costs $61.40 a year. On line, it is free -- unless you choose a premium subscription service called Playboy Cyberclub, which offers additional features like chat rooms and archives of every Playmate and cover in the magazine's 45-year history. That costs $60 a year. LISA NAPOLI

HEADLINE: U.S. vs. Private Industry: A Look Back

BYLINE: By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
If the Justice Department and Attorneys General of 20 states file antitrust lawsuits against Microsoft today, as they are expected to do, the ensuing fight could be one of the biggest ever between the Government and private industry over what constitutes unfair monopolistic business practices. Here are some of the biggest past cases. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

GRAPHIC: Chart:
 
DEFENDANT -- Standard Oil of New Jersey
CHARGE -- Monopolizing oil business by buying rivals, forcing rail-roads to discriminate against other rivals and buying up pipelines so that competitors could not use them.
HOW LONG THE CASE LASTED -- 5 years (1906-1911)
OUTCOME -- Found guilty
RESULT -- Standard Oil was split into 34 companies, many of which are now among the world's largest oil companies, including Exxon, Mobil, Chevron and Amoco.
 
DEFENDANT -- American Tobacco
CHARGE -- Monopolizing the cigarette trade through practices like predatory pricing and excluding rivals from access to wholesalers.
HOW LONG THE CASE LASTED -- 4 years (1907-1911)
OUTCOME -- Found guilty
RESULT -- Split into 16 pieces, including American Tobacco, Reynolds, Liggett & Myers and P. Lorillard.
 
DEFENDANT -- U.S. Steel

HOW LONG THE CASE LASTED -- 9 years (1911-1920)
OUTCOME -- Found not guilty
RESULT -- The Supreme Court ruled that sheer size alone did not constitute a monopoly. The decision brought a halt to big antitrust cases for almost 20 years.

Paramount Pictures and four other studios
 
DEFENDANT -- I.B.M.
CHARGE -- Monopolizing the computer market, including computer hardware, software and services.
HOW LONG THE CASE LASTED -- 13 years (1969-1982)
OUTCOME -- Case dropped
RESULT -- After the case was prosecuted by three different administrations, the Justice Department decided that the suit had no merit.
 
DEFENDANT -- AT&T
CHARGE -- Using its monopoly of local phone service to keep competitors out of the long-distance and telephone equipment markets.
HOW LONG THE CASE LASTED -- 8 years (1974-1982)
OUTCOME -- Settled

HEADLINE: SIMON & SCHUSTER IN SALE TO BRITISH

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT with ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
Pearson P.L.C., Britain's largest publisher, and a Dallas investment firm agreed yesterday to buy most of Simon & Schuster's operations from Viacom Inc. for $4.6 billion in cash, accelerating the flow of America's publishing houses into foreign hands.
In one of the largest publishing deals to date, Pearson, which already owns the Penguin Group, a prominent consumer trade player, will add Simon & Schuster's education division for $3.6 billion, while the leveraged buyout firm Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Inc. will take the reference, business and professional divisions for $1 billion. 
 Pearson's empire includes such varied interests as Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum and The Financial Times. The deal will make it the largest publisher of educational textbooks in the United States, a market it believes is growing because of a new baby boom and a trend toward increasing spending on education. Though trade publishing is more glamorous, educational books are more profitable.
Viacom, a media conglomerate that owns Paramount Communications and such cable television channels as MTV and Nickelodeon, will keep the consumer trade division, which last year accounted for about one-fifth of Simon & Schuster's $2.47 billion in revenue. Its imprints publish authors like Frank McCourt and Stephen King.
The deal was completed after heated competition from another leveraged buyout firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, and a group headed by Michael R. Milken, the financier who was convicted of securities fraud. It further restructures the American publishing industry, which has undergone considerable consolidation in the last decade.
Foreign companies have been aggressively buying American trade publishers. In March, Bertelsmann A.G., a German media conglomerate that already owned the Bantam Doubleday Dell Group, agreed to buy Random House from Advance Publications for $1.4 billion.
But Pearson has been the only major purchaser of educational publishers, having already acquired Scott Foresman in 1996 and Addison Wesley Longman in 1988.
Pearson's determination to seize a larger share of this side of the business fueled its victory over the two other well-financed bidders.
However, Pearson had widely been considered the front-runner. It already had a large publishing business and could benefit from major economies of scale in a merger, making the high cost of the purchase less onorous. Originally, Hicks Muse had indicated it would bid alone, and joined with Pearson only recently.
For the Viacom chairman, Sumner M. Redstone, the price was considered a strong one, since analysts had forecast the sale would fetch $4 billion to $5 billion. Mr. Redstone is considered a savvy salesman and even over the weekend bidders were still revising their offers before the Viacom board held a 10 A.M. meeting by telephone yesterday.
Mr. Milken's group, which was said to include Tele-Communications Inc., the News Corporation and two leveraged buyout firms -- the Thomas Lee Company and Apollo Advisors -- raised its bid late last week to $4.1 billion from $3.8 billion, according to a person close to the discussions. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts reportedly bid about $4.2 billion, according to a person close to the talks.
Then yesterday, the Milken group learned that the Pearson-Hicks Muse team had the highest bid and so it tried to buy pieces of the company it wanted. It believed that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts was itself trying to acquire other pieces and that combined, the two offers might be greater than Pearson-Hicks Muse's, the person close to the talks said. But that plan fell apart.
The Milken group had offered to buy the entire company, including Simon & Schuster's trade publishing unit, according to two people involved in the negotiations. The News Corporation, which owns HarperCollins, was said to have sought the trade book operation for itself, though its bid was very low, and was not taken seriously.
The sale will net Viacom $3.8 billion. Morgan Stanley was advising Viacom, Goldman, Sachs was advising Pearson and Greenhill advised Hicks Muse.
But even for companies heavily committed to print, the educational business has broad appeal. As Marjorie M. Scardino, Pearson's chief executive, put it yesterday in a telephone interview from London: "This is a very good time to be in the educational business. For us, this is perfectly complementary, and we believe the education market is very fast growing."
For Pearson, which had 1997 revenue of $3.8 billion from holdings that also include interests in trade and educational publishing, 50 percent of The Economist and a television programming business, the purchase is a heavy bet on print publishing.
But Marta Nichols, a research analyst who follows educational services and book publishing for Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, pointed out yesterday that school systems in many states are adopting new curricula that require the development of instructional materials. She added that there is a swell in the school-age population from kindergarten through college and that a strong United States economy has prompted governments at both the state and Federal levels to pour millions of dollars into education.
Pearson had an operating profit of $531 million in 1997 of which roughly $100 million came from its educational publishing business. With the acquisition, Pearson, whose educational publishing had revenue of $900 million, will add $1.4 billion in sales from Simon & Schuster for a total of $2.3 billion. Simon & Schuster's educational operations will contribute $232 million in operating profits.
Pearson will compete with McGraw-Hill and Harcourt in the textbook field.
Ms. Scardino said the merger would generate cost savings in marketing distribution, back office and warehousing that could be more than $100 million. The sale will make its combined elementary and high school operations -- which had been, in the words of one publishing expert, "an also ran" -- the second- or third-largest in the business. The deal will also provide it with a strong technological offering in computer based education.
Pearson will become the leader in college publishing, bringing together Simon & Schuster, which was already the market leader with roughly 23 percent of the market, with Pearson's 8 percent of the college market.
Pearson is paying roughly 15 times Simon & Schuster's estimated 1998 cash flow of $320 million. Over the years, Pearson has been criticized for overpaying in some cases, particularly in its acquisition of Mindscape, a California computer game outfit. Though it is paying a full price for Simon & Schuster, analysts generally said yesterday that in selling off parts of the business to Hicks Muse, Ms. Scardino had found a savvy way to get the businesses Pearson wanted. It is financing the deal with bank debt.
Meg Geldens, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in London, said yesterday that she believed Pearson had paid a high price, but that if the company generated that level of cost saving, it could be a good deal. "Strategically, it certainly makes sense," she said.
For Hicks Muse, the purchase of the Simon & Schuster divisions augments a media empire that already includes major interests in radio, movie theaters and television. The firm has effective control of Chancellor Broadcasting, the nation's second-largest radio chain after the $1 billion purchase of several stations from Viacom last year. Chancellor's presence in most of the nation's major markets includes four stations in New York.
In partnership with Kohlberg Kravis, Hicks Muse also controls the nation's largest chain of movie theaters. Last October, Hicks Muse joined with NBC to buy the Lin Television Corporation for $1.7 billion.
Michael J. Levitt, a Hicks Muse partner, said that the Simon & Schuster purchase would form a foundation for further acquisitions, especially in reference, business and professional publishing.
He described the purchase as consistent with the firm's acquisitions in other areas, including branded foods. "We're interested in buying high-quality assets with excellent management teams in industries which we can consolidate," he said. "In terms of our investment strategy, it's right down the middle of the fairway."
From Simon & Schuster, Hicks Muse will receive titles that include the Betty Crocker cookbooks, Webster's New World Dictionary, Frommer's travel guides, and Macmillan computer books including the Idiot's Guide series. Mr. Levitt acknowledged that his prediction of double-digit growth in the acquired divisions would depend in part on the continued popularity of the computer guides, but noted that the same content could also be offered over the Internet.

HEADLINE: MEDIA;
Even without 'Seinfeld,' NBC is the network that others build their fall schedules around.

BYLINE: By Bill Carter 

 BODY:
FOR sheer intensity and nail-biting suspense, nothing on any show on any television network compares with what will happen this week inside suites of rooms here in New York that will be occupied by executives trying to decide which shows will go where in prime-time schedules next year.
In the space of four days, four networks and two would-be networks will announce their fall programming plans to the advertising industry in a series of elaborate stage presentations in atmospheric show business locales ranging from Radio City Music Hall to Carnegie Hall and the New Amsterdam Theater. 
 As one senior executive involved in the process put it, "Things have never been so unclear this late in the process." And the process, known as the upfront -- because the goal is to get advertisers to commit money to the networks in advance of the start of the fall season -- has never been so compressed, with all the activity crammed into 96 hours. It usually takes up to 10 days.
Driving much of the uncertainty is the situation that faces NBC, television's dominant network, which will lead off the round of schedule announcements today at Radio City.
NBC's decisions, which network executives were still mulling on Friday when programmers flew to New York from Los Angeles to prepare for the presentation, are crucial to the strategies at all the other networks because of the perception that NBC could be more vulnerable next year than in any recent year.
The reason is the absence of "Seinfeld," the pillar around which NBC built its Thursday night fortress over the last five years. Even though NBC continues to own more hits than most of the other networks put together and is coming off its best performance in a May ratings sweep in 10 years, there is a sense in the business that somebody may finally take a shot at going after NBC.
NBC has often put the other networks in its own sights and fired off programs to compete head to head with the hits on those other networks. That is one reason that no other network took the step of announcing its schedule before NBC.
No rule says that the leading network has to take the first step in this annual spring dance. NBC, whose executives have never been accused of a lack of confidence, has gone first for the last several years. NBC even went first five years ago when it was in third place.
But this season NBC gave all its competitors a chance to slide up their announcement dates by moving the NBC date one week later into May. For several previous years the network selected the second Monday in May as its announcement date. But each year that turned out to be the Monday after Mother's Day. Many executives' families protested, so NBC moved the date this year.
Another network could easily have picked last Wednesday or Friday for its presentation and helped ease the logjam this week -- none did. "They knew they had to go after NBC," said one executive with interests in many programs. "So many calls were riding on the moves NBC made."
ABC, for example, has been trying to figure whether it makes sense to move its hit comedy "The Drew Carey Show" from Wednesday to Tuesday to try to forestall NBC's growing success on that night. CBS, looking for a safe haven for comedies, has wanted to know if NBC will still try to start Wednesday night off with comedies.
Most of all, the whole industry has been on edge awaiting NBC's decisions about Thursday, a night of television so powerful that no other network has even tried to challenge NBC there since "Friends" and "E.R." began four years ago.
But Thursday has become the supreme prize in the Cracker Jack box of the television economy because of the amount of movie advertising money that has flowed into television in the last decade. Movie companies will pay premiums to reach the right audience on Thursdays because most movies open on Fridays. (Movie ads were everywhere in the "Seinfeld" finale last week.)
No network has watched NBC's Thursday machinations more closely than Fox, which would love nothing better than to get a beachhead on Thursday and some access to that movie money.
The question being debated in many program circles is, will Fox move its brush-fire hit, "Ally McBeal" to Thursday?
Even the would-be networks, WB and UPN, have had an eye on NBC, looking for a possible discard from NBC's well-stocked pile that might enhance their schedules.
Canceled shows moving from one network to another have become a new trend during upfront week. Last year ABC picked up "Something So Right," a last-minute cancellation by NBC. It did not do any better on ABC, however, possibly because ABC made the mistake of keeping it off the air for half a season.
CBS grabbed "JAG" off the NBC reject pile two years ago, and the show has become one of the most successful on the network. This year WB may be interested in picking off such likely canceled offerings as CBS's "Gregory Hines Show."
"Shows more than ever are going to be looking for a different network to pick them up," a leading TV talent agent said. "The studios have so much invested, and if a show gets canceled any time in the first year or two, they lose their whole investment. They'll be pushing every button to keep a show alive."

HEADLINE: Dominican Opposition Wins Without Chief

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, May 17

 BODY:
Despite the death of its charismatic leader, this country's main opposition party has won a sweeping victory in congressional and municipal elections that were being closely watched in the United States because of their probable effects on efforts to curtail drug trafficking and to modernize the economy.
Based on nearly-complete official results made public today, the left-center Democratic Revolutionary Party has won at least 23 of the 30 Senate seats that were at stake in Saturday's balloting and will have a comfortable margin in the lower house of congress. 
 The party also won the most important mayoral race, in the capital, where the merengue singer Johnny Ventura, a last-minute replacement for the party's leader, Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, swept to victory.
The outcome is a sharp blow to President Leonel Fernandez. He had been looking to the midterm vote to break a congressional impasse that has made it difficult to enact legislation that would open the economy and impose harsher sanctions for drug trafficking.

DEAR DIARY:
Floyd Landis was walking along East 61st Street when he heard the loud bark of a dog, seemingly coming from an air shaft covered by an iron grill. A fellow stroller who had also heard the barking was peering down the shaft, and both men wondered how the dog had got there. They wondered, too, whether they would be able to get him out -- until they spotted a small sign near the shaft.
ATTENTION
The dog is not trapped in a
hole, he is in a full basement
with a ramp that leads to a
nice little backyard
We understand your concern
but assure you that we treat this
dog better than we treat
ourselves.
We would appreciate not
being insulted by
unwarranted accusations.
Thank you

 At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Dan Rustin overheard this interesting, if impractical, observation: "With all the people here to be seen, they ought to let the pictures walk around and hang the people on the wall."
Teresa Schmittroth took Allison Balter, her 5-year-old niece, to the Museum of Modern Art. To her aunt's amazement, Allison, who apparently had seen it on Sesame Street, said, "Let's go see the gypsy painting, the one with the gypsy laying down."
They made their way to the Impressionist galleries and Henri Rousseau's "The Sleeping Gypsy" where Mrs. Schmittroth read aloud the information on the wall label: the artist's name, nationality, date of birth and death. "What? He's dead?" Allison exclaimed. As she began to approach the painting, her aunt cautioned her not to touch it. "Why?" Allison asked. "What does he care? He's dead."
Judy Cohen was sitting on a bench in a sports store with Sasha, her 17-year-old son. While they waited for the salesman to return with some sneakers, Mrs. Cohen put her arm around her son and leaned her head on his shoulder.
"I wonder why some kids don't let their Moms hug them," she mused aloud.
She didn't wonder long. Her son knew exactly why. "Because it's annoying," he said.
Dr. Claude W. Springer, a bass singer with the Great Neck Choral Society, was relaxing during the rehearsal break when a soprano raised her hand and announced that she was moving to Vermont. "If anyone is interested, I am leaving behind. . . " she said and paused. Her fellow singers speculated -- car? furniture? books?
"A wonderful cleaning lady," she concluded. Five hands shot up.
Ruth F. Braun, whose age grants her special privilege on public transportation, recently offered her bus seat to a very visibly pregnant young woman. "I'm not sick, I'm pregnant," the woman responded. Mrs. Braun did not reply but another passenger couldn't resist. "Maybe your baby would like to sit," she said.
Dear Diary:
I was in the men's locker room of my gym talking to a friend who had reduced his weight and toned his body by exercising. He was returning from the shower with a towel wrapped around him when a new member, displaying substantial girth and sweating from exercising, looked at him and said, "You're a real inspiration to me."
My friend, thinking the remark referred to his improved physique, thanked the man and told him that he, too, could add muscle if he stuck with it.
"Muscle?" the new member exclaimed. "I'm looking forward to getting the towel to fit around my waist." DENNIS H. GREENSTEIN
Down in the subway, at 53d Street and Third Avenue, Geraldine Meeks stopped at a token window to refill her Metrocard. She was greeted by the following Catch-22 sign: "The computers are down so cards cannot be refilled. You will have to purchase tokens or new Metrocards in the following denominations (here the amounts were listed). If you cannot read, please identify yourself and I will explain it for you."
Still down in the subway, this time it's Joanne Cole going uptown on the Lexington Avenue line. A woman enters and immediately announces that she is unemployed, alone in the world and struggling to care for two teen-age sons, both of whom have dire but apparently not life-threatening diseases. A not-too-unusual subway panhandle but no, this one is different. She finishes her soliloquy, looks around, takes a deep breath and repeats the whole speech -- in Spanish.
The man who wrote this sign on his delivery hand-cart may be a curmudgeon, but he leaves more than a few passers-by with smiles. The sign: "I can only please one person a day. Today is not your day. Tomorrow doesn't look so good either."
The supermarket clerk was obviously in a bad mood, and Jerome Coopersmith was surprised at her actions -- mishandling groceries and snatching the money from customers' hands. The elderly man in front of him, who had just sampled her rudeness, looked at the clerk as he awaited his change.
"Aren't you going to tell me to have a nice day?" he asked.
"I don't have to," she snapped. "It's on the receipt."
Back above ground, a friend who flips through magazines on her daily bus journey reports that she was reading an article the other day when she noticed, or at least suspected, that the woman seated beside her was reading along with her. As she began turning the page, her suspicion was confirmed.
"Just a second," the neighbor said. "I haven't finished yet."
There was a moment of silence while the magazine owner recovered her equilibrium.
"I'll tell you what," she said. "I'll read at my own pace and I'll give you the magazine when I get off."
Not good enough.
"What if I get off first?" the woman asked.
Some things never change. Sheldon Sobel was walking in Central Park last week when he overheard the following conversation:
Father, speaking to a child about 5 years old: "Put on your sweater."
Child: "But I'm not cold."
Father: "A sweater is an article of clothing you put on when your mother is cold."
There will be an end to "Titanic" stories one of these days but this isn't the day.
Helen Graf was leaving a theater showing you-know-what when she heard a little girl, about 6 and obviously savvy in the art of propaganda, addressing her mother.
"See Mommy," she said. "That's why children should go to camp and learn how to swim."

HEADLINE: Times Mirror Weighs a By-the-Numbers Approach to Expanding Coverage of Minorities

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
In his latest challenge to the established mores of American newsrooms, Mark H. Willes, the chief executive of the Times Mirror Company and the publisher of The Los Angeles Times, is devising an unorthodox plan to give more coverage and to sell more newspapers to women, African-American, Asian and Hispanic readers.
"I have this simple-minded way of thinking you tend to do better if you measure performance," Mr. Willes said in an interview Friday. He has asked Mary E. Junck, an executive vice president of Times Mirror, to convene a meeting of senior editors in New York this month to find ways to quantify and improve coverage of women and minorities. 
 A recent exercise at The Los Angeles Times, he said, counted bylines, sources, pictures and quotes. The results confirmed Mr. Willes's perception that coverage of women and minority groups does not reflect "to the degree that it should and must, the diversity of the community that we're both reporting on and want to be read by," Mr. Willes said.
His proposed solution, however, hits one of the most sensitive nerves in any newsroom: the integrity of news coverage. A sampling of journalists turned up very few who objected to the publisher's goal and very few who were comfortable with his approach.
Indeed, Mr. Willes's determination to challenge the underlying precepts of the news business has made him a controversial internal critic in an industry more accustomed to criticism from outsiders. He has a recognizable plan of attack: identify a problem. Find quantitative measures to define it. Propose a solution that defies the profession's basic assumptions. Then proselytize to win skeptics to the cause.
To reverse circulation declines at The Los Angeles Times, he paired business and news executives and set out to measure and increase the readership of individual sections. The move provoked some scathing criticism, but also led to industry-wide debate over the need for the traditional wall between editorial and business departments.
To improve coverage of women and minorities, Mr. Willes wants the company's papers to use new quantitative models to establish a baseline of how well their coverage reflects community demographics. Then editors will be expected to do better.
"My understanding is that there's considerable flexibility here," said John Carroll, the editor of The Baltimore Sun, which is owned by Times Mirror. "No avenue has been foreclosed as long as we come up with ideas that have a high chance of success." Times Mirror also publishes Newsday, The Hartford Courant and The Advocate of Stamford, Conn.
Mr. Willes's latest suggestion for a quantitative approach to quality journalism was introduced in an interview Friday in The Wall Street Journal. In a telephone interview, he said the goal was both a moral and a business imperative. Marketing research among women and the Hispanic population, he said, showed many potential readers in these groups who feel little connection with The Los Angeles Times.
A newspaper's coverage of any issue, however, is the product of numerous factors. "You can't quantify everything," said Sharon Rosenhause, the managing editor of The San Francisco Examiner. "It sounds very arrogant when an editor says, 'I know what news is,' " she added.
"But there is some truth to that. If you don't know what news is in your community, you're not going to be an editor very long."
Nonetheless, she said, Mr. Willes "has a way of identifying problems that are not unique to The Los Angeles Times." Her preferred solution, however, centers on diversity in hiring and imagination in coverage. The Examiner has reporters covering the Hispanic, Asian, African-American and gay communities.
Vanessa Williams, the president of the National Association of Black Journalists, shares Mr. Willes's goal. "I do think you have to focus on it, otherwise it won't happen," said Ms. Williams, who is a reporter with The Washington Post. "But just as important is having a newsroom that is diverse, so that you don't have to set up all these artificial measures."
Jim Amoss, the editor of The Times-Picayune of New Orleans, agreed that newspapers fail to reflect the economic and racial diversity of their areas. But, he said, "unless the solution grows organically out of the community that's being covered, readers are going to suspect it of being phony."
To base incentive pay on such factors, he added, "warps the editorial process; it's inimical to everything newsrooms ought to be about."
Mr. Willes said that bonuses for editors who made measurable improvements had been discussed, but not developed. "If we can develop the right way to measure it," he said, "one of the good things is that we won't have to interfere with editorial independence at all. We won't have to say you have to have more stories on this or that. We'll say there are multiple ways" to get to a prescribed goal.
The message, he said, will be: "Find a way to get there."

HEADLINE: One of 3 Potential Polygram Bidders Is Said to Have Dropped Out

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
One of the three potential bidders for the music company Polygram N.V. has decided not to make a bid, a person close to the group said yesterday.
The investment group that is said to be dropping out comprises Texas Pacific; Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, and A. Jerold Perenchio, the chairman and chief executive of Univision Communications Inc. 
 The Seagram Corporation, widely considered the lead bidder, is said to be offering roughly $10.3 billion in a package that includes $8 billion in cash and roughly $2 billion in Seagram stock.
It was not clear yesterday whether a third group, consisting of Forstmann Little & Company and the Thomas H. Lee Company, two leveraged buyout firms, would make a bid. That team was examining Polygram financial documents yesterday.
Seagram, which already owns a record company, is thought to be the most likely to acquire Polygram. More than any rival, Seagram can justify the price because of the economies of scale such a merger offers.
Royal Philips Electronics N.V., the Dutch company that owns 75 percent of Polygram -- the balance is owned by the public -- has scheduled a board meeting for Wednesday in the Netherlands. And Polygram itself has scheduled a board meeting tomorrow. It was unclear yesterday how Philips might respond if a higher offer did emerge from the Forstmann Little team. Philips was said to have promised Seagram not to negotiate with other bidders through today. The Seagram and Polygram switchboards were closed yesterday.
The question of who would run the merged company has been widely discussed. Seagram's music operation is run by Doug Morris, a highly regarded executive but one whose expertise is primarily in the United States music industry. Polygram has an enormous overseas business, so that the question remained whether Mr. Morris would take it over, whether it might remain in the hands of current management under Alain Levy, who, as Polygram's president, oversees its worldwide operations, or whether new managers might be brought in.

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE OVERVIEW;
INDIA DETONATED A HYDROGEN BOMB, EXPERTS CONFIRM

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 17

 BODY:
In a disclosure with potential to accelerate further a nuclear arms race with Pakistan, Indian scientists confirmed today that the largest of the five underground nuclear tests they conducted last week involved a hydrogen bomb, a device with potentially enormous power that is known in American military circles as a "city buster."
When the first round of three tests was announced last Monday, India described the largest weapon tested as a "thermonuclear device," a term that set off a debate among weapons experts around the world about what type of weapon was involved. "Thermonuclear device" literally refers to a device that burns hydrogen fuel and, thus, has more punch than an atom bomb, the type that the United States dropped on Japan in 1945. 
 The scientists, appearing at a news conference, gave technical details of a bomb code named Shakti-1, after a Hindi word for power commonly used when referring to the most potent of the Hindu gods. The scientists said the bomb was a two-stage device involving a so-called fission trigger and a second stage that gave the bomb its main explosive force. The design, they said, was popularly known as a hydrogen bomb.
According to figures released by the scientists, the bomb had an explosive force equivalent to 43,000 tons of TNT. That would be small by comparison with the most destructive nuclear weapons built by the United States, Russia and other established nuclear powers, which have tested hydrogen bombs with explosive powers equivalent to several million tons of TNT.
But the Indian scientists said their weapon was deliberately kept small to avoid damage to populated villages near the test site in the northwestern desert of India.
The chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission, Dr. Rajagopal Chidambaram, said the bomb design gave India the ability to increase its explosive power virtually at will. "In fact, we could have got much higher yields than we got," Dr. Chidambaram said. "We were limited by possible seismic damage to the villages."
Another scientist, Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, regarded as the "father" of the Indian bomb, said of the possibility of building bigger bombs, "If there is a demand, we will do it."
Hydrogen bombs come in two types. In the first, American specialists said today, scientists fill the core of a small atom bomb with hydrogen fuel, a trick that can boost its power 10 times or more.
But making a true hydrogen bomb hundreds or even thousands of times more powerful requires a more complex method. In this second variety, the secret is to harness the radiation from an exploding atomic bomb and use that to compress and heat a packet of hydrogen fuel situated not internally, but nearby.
It was such a weapon that the Indian scientists described at their news conference. Drs. Chidambaram and Kalam repeatedly emphasized that the weapon they detonated involved a "fission trigger," meaning a small atom bomb that set off the main blast, and not the other type of thermonuclear weapon, which they described as a "boosted fission" device.
They said they had developed designs for that type of weapon in laboratories, but did not test one.
In theory, the amount of hydrogen fuel ignited by the two-stage method has no limit. America's first hydrogen bomb, exploded in 1952, was 700 times more forceful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The Pacific isle of Elugelab, one mile in diameter, where it had been detonated, simply vanished.
But the practical considerations of putting the bomb atop a missile can quickly lead to difficulties, and it was not clear from the Indian scientists' statements today that they had been resolved.
Dr. Harold M. Agnew, former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the birthplace of the bomb in New Mexico, said the Indian assertion of having manufactured a true hydrogen bomb was quite believable. "It's not a giant step if you have smart people and understand the basics," Dr. Agnew said in a telephone interview.
"They could probably make bigger ones," he added, referring to true hydrogen bombs. "If you can do a little one, you can do big ones."
The news conference in New Delhi turned into another occasion for Indians to demonstrate soaring pride over the nuclear tests. The scientists were applauded by Indian reporters, asked for their autographs and generally treated much like the early American astronauts as they returned from space.
In their remarks the scientists repeatedly emphasized that they had developed the versions of the weapons tested last week on their own, without any foreign help.
But their statement that they had detonated a hydrogen bomb appeared quite likely to increase tensions with Pakistan, where Government officials have spent the days since the first Indian blasts weighing whether to respond with a nuclear test of their own and risk being punished with the same economic sanctions that the United States and other nations have imposed on India or whether they should hold off in the hope of isolating India.
For years Western intelligence experts have known that Pakistan had the ability to build an atomic bomb. But American nuclear experts have said it is far from clear that the Pakistanis could detonate a hydrogen bomb.
As India released the first technical details of its tests, the Foreign Minister of Pakistan, Gohar Ayub Khan, was quoted today as having said that it was not a question of whether Pakistan would stage a nuclear test, but when. It was unclear, however, if he was speaking on behalf of his Government.
The details from the Indians also appear to clear up uncertainty among Western geologists and weapons experts over the number of weapons tested and their explosive power. The Indians said the four other weapons, also code named Shakti, had an explosive force equivalent to 12,000 tons and 200 tons of TNT in the case of the two weapons tested with Shakti-1 on May 11 and 600 and 200 tons for those tested on Wednesday.
Immediately after the first tests, American seismologists said that they had detected only one blast and that it appeared to be much smaller than the first Indian estimates, no bigger than the equivalent of 25,000 tons of TNT. But the Indian scientists said American confusion over the size of the biggest blast could have arisen from the fact that the Shakti-1 device was detonated in a shaft separated by 1,100 yards from a second shaft containing Shakti-2, the device with 12,000 tons of TNT equivalent.
The scientists said the simultaneous detonation of the two devices had probably caused "interference" in the seismic signatures of the two blasts that misled American experts.
The scientists released a videotape of the blasts on Monday that showed a dramatic countdown at the test site in the Thar desert of Rajasthan state, 350 miles southwest of New Delhi. As the English-language count reached zero, a deep boom rang out across the desert, the ground shook violently, and a huge cloud of dust rose into the sky over the test site, a fenced area about a third the size of a baseball field. Cheers could be heard.
A chart prepared by the scientists showed that the blast occurred 5.7 seconds after 3.45 P.M., the time scheduled for the tests.
Views taken from a helicopter shortly afterward showed a crater that appeared to be 70 feet deep and several hundred feet across. A tower that had been draped in camouflage netting at the center of the site had disappeared, revealing what appeared to be a concrete walkway leading into the shaft, its sides shattered and covered with a debris of netting, twisted steel and broken sandbags. What appeared to have been tin huts on the edge of the fenced area had collapsed like a deck of cards.
At the news conference, the scientists' remarks spoke for their pride, and India's, that a country that is one of the poorest in the world, and often described as one of the most chaotic, had achieved with the nuclear tests something that only five other nations, the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, have done.
The scientists noted that the "fissile material," or bomb fuel, was "completely indigenous," produced from nuclear reprocessing plants designed and built by Indians, and that many other systems needed to make the tests successful, including warhead designs, high-voltage triggering devices, "safety interlocks" and a command-and-control system, had all been developed by Indians, many of them in the face of an international effort to block the Indian program.
The point was made expressively by Dr. Kalam, whose official title is chief scientific adviser to the Indian Defense Minister. Dr. Kalam is of Muslim origin, a fact that lends a special irony to his role in view of the alarm about the Indian tests in Pakistan, a nation carved out of British India in 1947 as a home for Muslims.
He noted that unlike several other major figures in the Indian program, he had no training in the United States or another Western country. "I'm completely indigenous," he said.
The scientists were keen to emphasize, as Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has, that India regards its nuclear power as defensive and that it has no plans to mount a first-strike against Pakistan or China, its potential foes.
"For 2,500 years," Dr. Kalam said, "India has never invaded anybody."

HEADLINE: A World Away, Strife Hits Home;
Indonesian Students Look Back With Guilt and Unease

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

 BODY:
In the basement of a mosque in Astoria, Queens, the New York chapter of the Indonesian Students Association dispensed with much of its agenda. Members discussed a fund-raiser and a Boston trip for an athletic meet. The ticklish item involved what to do about the riots and student uprisings back home.
The 25 or so young people who gathered on Saturday night are among Indonesia's children of privilege, many of them the sons and daughters of diplomats based in New York. While students in Indonesia are protesting against poverty and abuses of power by President Suharto, these students are struggling with whether to criticize a Government that includes their parents. 
 "That's how we were taught when we were kids, that we shouldn't say anything about the Government," said one student, Gigin, who declined to give his last name because his parents are diplomats. "Basically, we had to hide it. We're sick of it, but we don't know how to react."
Thousands of miles removed from the violence and upheaval, Indonesians in New York -- by one estimate about 5,000 people -- described a complicated mix of guilt, revulsion and admiration over events at home. About two dozen students and adults interviewed at the Indonesian Muslim Community Center in Astoria condemned the rioting, the targeting of ethnic Chinese and the killing of six university students by Government soldiers. They also seemed to agree that President Suharto should step down.
But the class divisions sundering Indonesia were evident at the Astoria mosque, too. As the students held a closed meeting in the basement, a group of men spoke upstairs. One man, Iskandar Rasyid, 34, a scholarship graduate student, sadly shook his head because the students were discussing an athletic competition. "They are not mature enough to know what is going on," he said.
"The students in Indonesia care about the people," he said. "But they" -- he pointed downstairs -- "they don't know. They have never felt suffering. I have a guilty feeling, actually, because I can't do anything. I can't do anything for my country."
Another man, Bambang Priatno, a union official with an A.F.L.-C.I.O. affiliate, said, "they don't care about what happens in Indonesia because their families work for the Government." Mr. Priatno 47, said he joined the student movement in 1965, the "year of living dangerously," when half a million people died after President Sukarno was removed. But Mr. Priatno tempered his criticism, saying all of the Indonesians in New York "are a family. We don't talk about politics."
The large number of Indonesian Government officials in New York may explain the absence of any anti-government demonstrations locally. Mr. Priatno said Indonesian groups in Australia and Germany have held protests. He said they sent him E-mail asking, "Where are you?" He said he replied that people were "too busy" with daily life, though plans for some sort of protest, perhaps on Wednesday, a national holiday in Indonesia, are being discussed.
After the downstairs meeting ended, the students munched potato chips and lingered for an open discussion. If it was an experiment in free speech, it was not an easy one. Several students said they had never publicly criticized the Indonesian Government.
Danni Sutresna, 23, is the group's president. He is also the son of Nana Sutresna, a high-ranking official in the Indonesian Foreign Ministry and a former delegate to the United Nations.
"I'm really in a very bad position," he said. "The bottom line right now is, I think, something needs to be done. Some change needs to be done very quickly."
Several students said they worried that speaking publicly could create problems for their parents. Many would give only a first name. Some anguished over keeping quiet.
"Unlike in the United States," one student said, "we don't have freedom of speech. So if we say something bad, they come to get you."
One woman, Tassi, 21, a Baruch College student, said, "It is like screaming from inside." She said, "It doesn't mean that because our parents are working in the Government that we have to agree with what their bosses tell them to do."
Several students, though, said they thought the students in Indonesia had gone too far. "Why can't they just do civil disobedience?" asked Arnandha, a student wearing a "Rage" rock-and-roll T-shirt. "Riots? Why make it worse?"
But another student, Rinaldo, 25, of Baruch College, interrupted. "You know that students didn't make the riots. Other people made the riots."
The slaying of the six students by Government soldiers is the incident that seems to have resonated most deeply. Many of the students at the mosque have lived in New York for several years. They spoke in American accents and wore the latest fashions. The six slain students at Trisakti University in Jakarta, like themselves, were from middle- and upper-class families. When the young people were asked whether they could identify with students in Indonesia, particularly poor students, the group's vice president, Yulianto Mohsin, 21, stood, his voice trembling as he spoke. He promised to issue an official position statement soon.
"We do -- we can relate, and we do sympathize with our students in Indonesia," he said. "We are supporting them. We have to have a result from all this movement."
But what result?
"A change in leadership," one student said.
"And be more democratic," another said tentatively.
Several students said they worried about the safety of parents living in Indonesia. When one young woman agreed, adding, "you know, they are our source of income," everyone giggled a bit nervously.
As the group prepared to leave, Mr. Mohsin seemed frustrated and eager to convey a sense of commitment. "Some of us will have a role in our nation's way of developing," he said. "Deep down, we all want this change. We're hoping in the new Indonesia that we can do it better."
Yesterday, Mr. Mohsin's position statement arrived. It represented the Association of Indonesian Students in the United States, the umbrella organization for all the Indonesian student groups in the country. It condemned the killing of the students, urged President Suharto to step down and called on the National Assembly to install new leadership and implement political reform. It urged the international community to pressure Indonesia toward democratization and economic reform.
It was signed, simply, "with the greatest sadness at the standing of citizenship and governance of our home country."

HEADLINE: Voting for Higher Cigarette Prices

 BODY:
The Senate Finance Committee made a comprehensive anti-smoking bill stronger last week when it voted to increase cigarette taxes by $1.50 per pack over three years. That hefty increase should go far to deter youth smoking, and it is not apt to encourage widespread smuggling of cigarettes as industry propaganda suggests. Indeed, such smuggling can occur on a large scale only if the industry itself allows it.
Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Republican of New York, provided a key swing vote that allowed the committee to approve the tax increase by 10 to 9. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the committee's ranking Democrat, also voted for it. 
 The committee's proposal will be voted on by the Senate this week as an amendment to the tobacco bill approved earlier by the Senate Commerce Committee. The Commerce bill, drafted by Senator John McCain, would impose annual assessments on the industry that would raise per-pack cigarette prices by $1.10 over five years. Estimates are admittedly rough, but many public health experts say an increase of at least $1.50 is needed to cut youth smoking rates significantly, and experts convened by the National Academy of Sciences have recommended increases of $2 per pack.
The tobacco industry is raising the specter of a new black market in cigarettes if Congress forces a steep increase in cigarette prices. But such fear-mongering is insulting given the industry's apparent complicity in the growth of international cigarette smuggling.
Investigators of the European Union are now asking the United States Government to help combat illegal trade involving billions of American cigarettes that are smuggled into Europe to evade cigarette taxes. European authorities believe American companies knowingly sell to dealers who ship the cigarettes into the contraband pipeline, but they have been unable to get the companies to cooperate with their investigation. The companies' refusal shows they have no interest in shutting down an illicit trade that directly benefits them.
Contraband cigarettes currently in the American market are largely the result of interstate smuggling driven by vastly different levels of state tobacco taxes. A higher national tax would not add to that problem since the tax would apply to all states. Few experts believe that a black market will arise from foreign-made cigarettes because Americans are accustomed to cigarettes of higher quality than those produced in places like China.
Instead, the worry is that American-made cigarettes will be exported to avoid the new Federal tax, then smuggled back to be sold at lower prices. Just this kind of export-import operation developed in Canada after it raised tobacco taxes. Because Canada's exported cigarettes were not marked with "export only" labels, it was impossible to distinguish between contraband packs that were smuggled back and legally sold packs. Canadian officials concluded that their top domestic manufacturers, affiliated with American and British tobacco companies, were aware of and benefited from the illegal activity.
That need not happen here. Strict licensing and marking requirements can help authorities track the movement of cigarettes from manufacturers to wholesalers, distributors, exporters and retailers. Tight Federal regulations have long applied to alcohol distribution, effectively ending illegal sales of wine and spirits in this country. The Senate should ignore the scare talk and approve a strong bill that would reduce smoking by raising prices.

HEADLINE: Antitrust Talks Founder On Microsoft's 'Desktop'

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR with JOEL BRINKLEY 

 BODY:
The stakes and the drama, it seemed, could scarcely be higher. The Microsoft Corporation, emblematic titan of the nation's high-tech economy, was locked in last-minute, closed-door negotiations with the Justice Department and 20 state Attorneys General. The goal was to find a way to avert a major antitrust suit -- a confrontation that could rival the Government's assault on Standard Oil early this century in defining the ground rules of competition for decades to come.
Early Saturday afternoon, word spread that the talks had collapsed. 
 But, in fact, the negotiations did not break down. By all accounts, they never really started. After an inauspicious first meeting, they coasted to a close less than a day and a half later with little drama.
The parting shot was delivered shortly after 1 P.M. by Jeffrey H. Blattner, special counsel for information technology in the Justice Department's antitrust division. After finishing a phone call to his boss, Joel I. Klein, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the antitrust division, Mr. Blattner walked into the conference room of Microsoft's Washington law firm, and told William H. Neukom, the company's senior vice president for legal affairs, "I guess we're going to have to go our separate ways," people involved with the talks recalled.
The two days of talks succeeded only in convincing Microsoft on one side and the Justice Department and Attorneys General on the other side that a wide chasm divided their views of how the information-age economy does, and should, work.
Today, the Government and the states are expected to file antitrust suits accusing Microsoft of unfairly trying to maintain its monopoly in personal computer software and to extend that monopoly into the new markets of Internet software and commerce. Neither the Government nor the states will ask for a delay in shipments of Windows 98, the new version of Microsoft's operating system. Microsoft is scheduled to ship Windows 98 to computer makers today and make it available on store shelves on June 25.
The suits will ask that Microsoft be forced to loosen its contracts with personal computer makers to allow them to modify the company's software considerably. This step, the Government and the states contend, could amount to a new deal for the computer industry and open the door to genuine competition. It would allow PC makers to filter requests from consumers and decide what users see on their desktop screens instead of conceding most of that power to Microsoft.
The company says that the Government's position amounts to heavy-handed meddling in the marketplace and a threat to its corporate livelihood. "What the Government is asking would significantly hamper us from competing through innovation and would put everything we've worked for and built for the last 23 years at risk," said William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman.
The talks got off on the wrong foot on Friday morning. The Justice Department team, led by Mr. Klein, and the states group, led by Thomas Miller, the Attorney General of Iowa, and Richard Blumenthal, the Attorney General of Connecticut, were left sitting in Mr. Klein's conference room, waiting for the Microsoft team. After a half hour of waiting, one government official in the room recalled, a staff aide to Mr. Klein came in and told the group that Microsoft had apparently thought the meeting was at the Washington offices of Sullivan & Cromwell, Microsoft's law firm.
A harmless misunderstanding perhaps, but to the assembled government officials it seemed a telling one. Microsoft executives, one person in the room remarked, assume that the world will come to them.
Little more than an hour after the Friday talks began, the two sides encountered a major obstacle, which indicated that a negotiated settlement was out of reach. The issue under discussion was the control of what appears on a PC user's main screen, often generically called "the desktop." Today, Microsoft exercises a powerful control over that main screen because its Windows operating system is installed on more than 90 percent of new personal computer's sold. An operating system is the software equivalent of the computer's central nervous system.
Microsoft allows PC makers to put other software on top of Windows, but the company, through its contracts with PC makers, firmly controls the essential look and consumer experience of the desktop. Government officials said that it was an expressed willingness by Microsoft to negotiate the issue of the desktop -- sometimes called the "first screen" -- that encouraged the Justice Department to invite the company to Washington for talks on Friday.
The Government and the states had been expected to file suit against Microsoft last Thursday. But in late-night calls Wednesday that extended into dawn Thursday between Mr. Klein and Mr. Gates, the Justice Department came away convinced that Mr. Gates was suddenly ready to discuss loosening Microsoft's grip on the first screen, a government official said.
The 11th-hour Seattle-to-Washington phone calls last week followed a face-to-face meeting between Mr. Gates and Mr. Klein in Washington on May 5. Mr. Klein was encouraged enough by what he had heard to call Mr. Neukom, of Microsoft, the following day, to get further discussions started.
When the settlement talks began on Friday, the Government was expecting to negotiate over freeing up the main screen. In antitrust terms, the Government regards the issue as vital because the main screen can be seen as a gateway to the Internet -- a potential chokehold on the new but fast-growing markets for Internet commerce, news and entertainment.
In addition, the Government contends, if PC makers are free to load software on top of Windows, the freedom could, in theory, pose a threat to the Windows monopoly itself. Indeed, it was largely Microsoft's fear that the Netscape Communications Corporation's Navigator browser for viewing the World Wide Web had the potential to become an alternative main screen that prompted Microsoft to compete so fiercely in the market for Web browsers. Among other things, Microsoft decided to give its Internet Explorer browser away for free.
But shortly after the Friday talks began, Microsoft said it was not going to allow substantive changes to its main screen, government officials involved in the talks said. "Did they lie to us before?" said one government official. "Not necessarily. But they certainly changed their position between Thursday morning and Friday. That's what it broke down over."
Others representing the Justice Department and the states shared that view. "That was the point when people on our side felt this whole thing was futile," said another government official.
Microsoft executives fiercely deny that the company had an overnight change of heart. They say that Microsoft was willing to discuss giving PC makers more freedom than they currently enjoy to alter the main screen, though the company adds that there is no legal reason it should. Its main screen, Microsoft says, is intellectual property that by law belongs to company.
Nonetheless, Microsoft executives involved in the talks say they were willing to discuss giving PC makers greater freedom to customize the first screen to feature the services and trademarks of, say, Compaq, Gateway or Hewlett-Packard.
However, Microsoft has always resisted allowing others to modify Windows to the extent of offering substitute main screens from which other software applications can be started up, technically sidestepping the Windows desktop. "That would be tantamount to undermining our franchise by making Windows some bit of software plumbing that no one sees," one Microsoft executive said.
And Internet software, like the browser or Sun Microsystem's Java programming language, potentially has the power to undercut the control of modern computing that Microsoft enjoys with Windows.
To insure competition in Internet software, the Government also proposed the possibility of forcing Microsoft to load Netscape's Navigator browser on Windows as well as its own Explorer. Such a must-carry provision, a government official says, was only one proposal for addressing the problem of giving consumers genuine choice in the software needed for browsing the World Wide Web.
Microsoft likens a must-carry provision to telling Coke that is must include a couple of cans of Pepsi in every six-pack it ships. And antitrust experts say the courts may be skeptical about must-carry provisions because once the precedent is established for one product it could extend to many others.
Microsoft insists that it was the flexible party at the negotiating table. Its executives say they were willing to help software rivals and give PC makers more freedoms -- but not if it meant undermining its "fundamental right to determine what goes in our Windows operating system," one executive said. Throughout the talks, one company executive said, "the Government didn't move a muscle."
In any case, by the time the first day's talks concluded on Friday, the Justice Department and state representatives were doubtful that any progress could be made. Mr. Blumenthal, the Connecticut Attorney General, was discouraged enough that he returned home and did not attend the talks on Saturday. Neither did Mr. Klein, the Justice Department's antitrust chief.
When the talks resumed on Saturday at the law offices of Sullivan & Cromwell -- the venue switched from the Justice Department because the air conditioning is shut off in Government buildings on weekends -- they did not last long.
The two sides left with their opposing positions hardened, ready to do battle in court.
"It was certainly an illuminating experience," one government official recalled thinking as he gazed out the law offices overlooking the Old Executive Office Building, once the home of the nation's War Department.

Charts: "Government vs. Microsoft: The Battle Lines"
The conflict between the Government and Microsoft boils down to some very specific issues about what people see on their screens and what types of programs and services they use. Here is an overview:
 
WHAT MICROSOFT WANTS TO DO
About product integration -- Add new features to its Windows operating system without Government interference, especially its Internet Explorer Web browser, which it insists is now a fundamental part of Windows.
On the desktop -- Control what appears on a user's main Windows screen -- known as the desktop -- when the computer is first turned on, including Internet links to Microsoft's own sites and to sites that other companies have paid Microsoft to link to.
Regarding contracts -- Include clauses in Windows licensing contracts that prevent computer makers, Internet service providers and Web publishers from promoting products of Microsoft's competitors.
 
WHAT THE SUITS SEEK TO PREVENT
About product integration -- Limit Microsoft's ability to add features to Windows that are offered by other companies as stand-alone products, including a Web browser. This could be done by forcing Microsoft to include competitors' products or to erase links to its own features.
On the desktop -- Let computer makers determine which program icons and links to Internet sites will appear on the main Windows screen, either to satisfy customers or as part of agreements with Internet publishers or software makers. Regarding contracts -- Eliminate all contractual limitations by Microsoft on the promotion or use of competitors' products.
 
HOW CONSUMERS MIGHT BE AFFECTED
About product integration -- Microsoft says customers want new features and argues that limiting such features will stifle innovation. The Government says competition will accelerate innovation and result in lower prices.
On the desktop -- Alternative desktops would allow consumers to order the Internet options they wanted pre-installed on their PC's. A Microsoft-controlled desktop would insure a standard opening screen, regardless of computer brand.
Regarding contracts -- If the Government prevails, computer makers that license Windows would also be able to offer competing programs like Netscape's Navigator browser. (pg. A16)

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE DIPLOMACY;
Clinton Seeks to Limit Effects of India's Test by Pressing Yeltsin on Arms Pact

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, England, May 17

 BODY:
President Clinton urged President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today to press for the ratification of a pending nuclear weapons treaty even as the United States and its allies searched for ways to head off a nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan.
On his final day of meetings here with the leaders of the six other major industrial democracies and Russia, Mr. Clinton drew a link between American efforts to continue reducing the stores of nuclear weapons held by the former cold war antagonists and attempts to halt the spread of nuclear ability to other nations. 
 Throughout the day, the leaders awaited word -- sometimes exchanging conflicting reports -- as to whether Pakistan had detonated a nuclear device or made a decision to do so in response to the nuclear tests conducted last week by India, its neighbor and rival.
Having failed to win broad support here for economic sanctions of the type the United States is imposing on India, Mr. Clinton turned today to a strategy of branding India -- and Pakistan too, if it goes ahead with testing -- as swimming against the currents of history.
At a 45-minute, one-on-one session this morning, Mr. Clinton told Mr. Yeltsin that he would like to hold a summit meeting in Moscow this year to discuss further arms-reduction talks between the United States and Russia, but suggested that Washington would first like to see the Russian Parliament ratify the pending arms reduction treaty, known as Start-2.
Mr. Yeltsin and former President George Bush signed the treaty in 1993, and it was approved by the United States Senate in 1996, but it has become stymied in the Russian Parliament.
Ratification of Start-2 and the beginning of negotiations on Start-3, Mr. Clinton said, would send a signal to budding nuclear powers like India and Pakistan that they were moving backward while the rest of the world was moving ahead.
Any escalation in nuclear weapons development would be a "terrible signal" at a time "when the Russians and we are doing our very best to put everything in the opposite direction and to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in the world," Mr. Clinton told reporters after meeting with Mr. Yeltsin.
Mr. Clinton warned against seeing nuclear weapons ability as "the new measure of either national security or national greatness," a remark that seemed intended in part as a swipe at the pride displayed in India after the tests and in part as a plea to Pakistan's Government not to give in to intense domestic political pressure to match India's test.
In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, Mr. Clinton suggested that the industrialized nations could have done more to encourage India along a path of peaceful economic development, and he warned that an unchecked arms race on the Indian subcontinent could eventually draw bigger powers into conflict.
"Have we failed to acknowledge India, the incredible achievement of maintaining 50 years of democracy under the most adverse conceivable circumstances?" Mr. Clinton said. "Probably."
"But the answer is not for India to become a nuclear power and then for Pakistan to match it stride for stride, and then for China to be brought in to support the Pakistanis and move troops to the Indian border, and then for Russia to come in and recreate in a different context the conflicts of the cold war," Mr. Clinton said. "It is a nutty way to go."
Aides said Mr. Clinton pressed Mr. Yeltsin on a number of issues, including Russia's transfer of missile technology to Iran. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who was present at the meeting, said Mr. Yeltsin "reaffirmed in the clearest and most unambiguous terms" his commitment to cutting off the flow of missile technology to Iran.
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, who played host here to Mr. Clinton, Mr. Yeltsin and the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan, said the gathering had been "both concerned and frustrated" by the growing tensions between India and Pakistan.
Mr. Blair said there was a general consensus that the best path was to persuade India not to hold further tests and to join the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Mr. Blair said he had spoken to India's Prime Minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, on Friday, and that Mr. Vajpayee had told him India would promptly "begin discussions" about signing the treaty.
Mr. Clinton said Pakistan would do better in the eyes of the world not to go ahead with nuclear testing. There would be "specific political, economic and security benefits to the country if it does not test," Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. Clinton did not cite any specific examples. But for the last few days White House officials here have held out the possibility that the United States might be willing to resolve a dispute with Pakistan over 28 F-16 fighter jets. Pakistan paid $658 million for the planes, but delivery was blocked by President Bush under a law that barred military sales to nations with nuclear programs. Pakistan was refunded $157 million, but the return of the rest of the money has been blocked by Congress.
Mushahid Hussain, the Pakistani Information Minister, told CNN in an interview today that resolving the F-16 issue would be like giving aspirin to a cancer patient and that the proposal "is not the answer" to Pakistan's security concerns.
Mr. Hussain also criticized the leaders meeting in Birmingham for not taking a harder line against India by adopting tough sanctions. Aside from the United States, only Japan and Canada among the major industrial countries have taken any steps to halt aid payments or impose other economic penalties on India.
"It shows there is no price tag for bad behavior," Mr. Hussain said.
The leaders of the so-called G-8 countries ranged across an array of issues in their three days in this industrial city in the English midlands. The final session this morning featured a continuation of a discussion on Saturday about preparedness for the software problems that will be caused when computers reset their calendars for the year 2000.
Mr. Blair also used Mr. Clinton's presence to help rally support for the peace plan that will be put before voters in Ireland and Northern Ireland on Friday. And in their final communique today, the leaders gave their approval to a host of initiatives, some as specific as a stepped-up fight against malaria and others as general as support for restoring financial stability to Asia.

HEADLINE: Clinton Says Chinese Money Did Not Influence U.S. Policy

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 17

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that reported political campaign contributions from China to the Democrats had not influenced his foreign policy, but he welcomed further investigation into decisions that made it easier for China to launch American satellites and possibly obtain sensitive technology.
"The decisions we made, we made because we thought they were in the interests of the American people," Mr. Clinton said, responding for the first time to reports that a Democratic Party fund-raiser told Federal investigators of funneling thousands of dollars from a Chinese military officer in the President's 1996 re-election campaign. Mr. Clinton, speaking at the end of an economic meeting in Birmingham, England, said he would determine the substance of the charges before deciding whether they would affect policy toward the Chinese Government. 
 "In any case, I think the investigation ought to proceed," he said, "and then whatever the facts are, we'll take appropriate action at that time." Mr. Clinton is planning to visit China next month.
The Justice Department's campaign finance task force is investigating whether political contributions influenced the Administration's 1996 decision to reverse a State Department policy that had categorized satellites as "munitions," making it more difficult to export them for launching aboard Chinese rockets.
In addition, several Congressional committees are looking into whether the Administration's policy shift on exporting satellite technology helped China and other countries develop and use nuclear missiles.
The New York Times reported on Friday that Johnny Chung, the former fund-raiser, had told Federal investigators that a large part of the nearly $100,000 he gave the Democrats in the 1996 campaign came from China's People's Liberation Army through Liu Chaoying, a Chinese lieutenant colonel and aerospace executive. The Democratic National Committee subsequently returned the money to Mr. Chung, who began cooperating with investigators after he pleaded guilty in March to campaign-related bank and tax fraud.
Congressional Republican leaders have accused the Administration of being influenced by American aerospace manufacturers, citing Bernard L. Schwartz, chairman of Loral Space and Communications, who gave more than $600,000 to the Democratic Party, making him the single largest personal donor.
The Administration's decision to waive sanctions and ease the export control process allowed Loral and another aerospace company, the Hughes Electronic Corporation, to export satellites to be launched atop Chinese rockets.
In his remarks today, Mr. Clinton did not directly mention the policy on satellites. But he suggested that the decision to move the authority for exporting the devices from the State Department to the Commerce Department was unanimous within his Administration.
The Administration's decision to reverse State Department policy drew concerned comments today from a leading Democrat.
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the ranking minority member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the Administration's policy switch was "serious stuff." Interviewed on "Fox News Sunday," Senator Biden said any "correlation of quid pro quo" linking campaign contributions to a shift in national security policy should be ferreted out.
Representative Porter J. Goss, the Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, said an independent counsel may have to be appointed to investigate the Chinese contributions if the Justice Department failed to conduct a thorough inquiry.
"The sinister element comes in when we start reading that Chinese intelligence is inserting large amounts of money," Mr. Goss said on the same program. "Now, I admit it is possible for anybody to be duped in a campaign about where money comes from. But it is very clear that the Chinese had some reason to give large amounts of money. They wanted something for it. What was it the Chinese wanted?"
Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, said in a television interview that the United States began permitting the launching of American satellites aboard Chinese rockets in the Bush Administration.
"The reason for that is that the telecommunications industry has a tremendous need to put satellites up into the air and that exceeds the launch capacity of the United States," Mr. Berger said on the CNN program "Late Edition." He also denied that any campaign contributions had influenced foreign policy.
Mr. Berger said that American companies did not risk passing restricted technology on to the Chinese. The satellites, he said, "are put into a black box" under the supervision of the Department of Defense "and taken to China, put on top of the missile and blown up into the sky." He said there was "not technology transfer."

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY;
The Group of Seven Now Eight, Officially

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, England, May 17

 BODY:
This year, for the first time, the annual summit meeting of the world's seven major industrial democracies and Russia became formally known as the Group of Eight, reflecting the gradual effort to give Russia an expanded voice in global economic and political issues.
"The format is now the G-8," a spokesman for the British Government said today. "The idea was always that Russia would be included. It just took a while for the name to catch up with the reality." 
 The old Group of Seven will continue to exist in a certain sense. The seven -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan -- are free to meet without Russia on some issues, especially relating to global finance. The leaders of the seven nations gathered without President Boris N. Yeltsin during the first session here on Friday, primarily to discuss the Asian financial crisis. Mr. Yeltsin was present later when the nations discussed India, Indonesia and the situation in the Balkans.
For now, Russia will not take a place in the rotation as host of the annual event, although American officials say they expect that to happen within the next few years.
The summit meetings started in 1975.

HEADLINE: More Children Go Uninsured Despite Status For Medicaid

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
A new Federal study finds that 4.7 million children far more than previously estimated -- are eligible for Medicaid but are not enrolled in the program and have no health insurance benefits.
The finding means that two of every five uninsured children in the United States could have coverage through Medicaid, which provides comprehensive health benefits, if they or their parents would just apply for it. 
 The study, published today in the journal Health Affairs, said 21.2 million children ages 18 or younger were eligible for Medicaid, the Federal-state program for low-income people. But, it said, 22 percent of them were not in Medicaid or any other public or private health insurance program.
The White House had estimated that three million children were eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled. And in January, President Clinton ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to locate such children and sign them up.
Mr. Clinton has repeatedly proposed new health programs for children and has often complained that the number of uninsured Americans is increasing because of Congress's failure to enact his proposals for universal coverage in 1994. But the study suggests that the Government and low-income families have not made full use of the existing Medicaid program, which has been revised by Congress over the last decade to expand eligibility.
The main author of the new report, Thomas M. Selden, who is an economist at the Federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, a unit of the Public Health Service, said, "Over all, we estimate that 4.7 million children age 18 and under were uninsured despite being eligible for Medicaid." They represent 39 percent of uninsured children, a group that numbers 12 million.
Mr. Selden said he and his colleagues at the Public Health Service had identified "a much larger group of Medicaid-eligible but uninsured children than has previously been known to exist." Earlier studies focused on children ages 10 and younger and did not consider all the children who might benefit from recent state expansions of the Medicaid program, Mr. Selden said.
Changes in Medicaid since the late 1980's have nearly doubled the number of eligible children, the study found. The changes were pushed through Congress by Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, and Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California.
Children who received cash assistance through the old welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, were automatically enrolled in Medicaid. But the new study found that teen-agers and children who became eligible for Medicaid because of recent program expansions were less likely to be enrolled.
These families "may have been less aware of their Medicaid eligibility, given that they were ineligible for cash assistance," the study said. In addition, it suggested, "such families may have resided in neighborhoods with lower Medicaid prevalence, which might have reduced their awareness of the program and perhaps increased their sense of stigma" associated with Medicaid. The study also makes these points:
*Of the 4.7 million children who are eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled in the program, 3.3 million are younger than age 13, and 1.4 million are between ages 13 and 18.
*Young children eligible for Medicaid are more likely than older children to be enrolled in the program.
*Sweeping changes in welfare policy made by the Federal Government and the states in the last few years could inadvertently increase the number of uninsured children. The new laws impose time limits and other restrictions on welfare benefits. Many children may still be eligible for Medicaid after they lose cash assistance, but they and their parents may have to make special efforts to get such health benefits.
Another study in the same issue of Health Affairs documents changes in insurance coverage of mental health care. The proportion of insured workers with mental health benefits has increased in recent years, the study says, but the benefits have become less generous as insurers impose stricter limits on the use of mental health services and charge higher co-payments.
Health maintenance organizations and other managed-care plans generally impose such limits, and the number of Americans in such health plans has soared in the last decade, said one of the authors, Gail A. Jensen, an expert on employee benefits at Wayne State University, in Detroit.

HEADLINE: Insurers Swindled Jews, Nazi Files Show

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

 BODY:
In an outburst of anti-Semitic violence that presaged the Holocaust, mobs incited by the Nazis rampaged through Berlin and other German cities on Nov. 9 and 10, 1938, smashing and torching an estimated 171 synagogues and thousands of Jewish shops and homes.
Nearly 60 years later, fresh details surrounding Kristallnacht, or "night of broken glass," have been extracted from Government archives in Moscow that have been storing Nazi documents seized by Soviet troops in 1945. 
 The Nazi Government was known to have confiscated insurance payments to Jews whose property was damaged in Kristallnacht. But the newly unearthed documents suggest that German insurance companies not only connived with the Nazis to avoid paying Jewish policyholders, but also sometimes exceeded Government guidelines and canceled unrelated life, health and pension policies on which Jews had been paying premiums for years.
Some of the documents are to be presented today at a hearing in Manhattan scheduled by the New York State Senate Insurance Committee. The panel, headed by Guy J. Velella, Republican of the Bronx, is considering legislation that would penalize European insurers who do business in New York if they failed to pay claims related to the Holocaust.
The documents, which abound with anti-Jewish slurs, include a confidential industry estimate that at least 19 of the 43 German fire insurance companies stood to suffer losses for the year if they fulfilled their obligations to Jewish policyholders for Kristallnacht. That contradicts an assertion of some German insurers that they did not profit from the Holocaust.
An agreement reached last month commits four European insurers, including the Allianz of Munich, the world's second-largest insurance company, to open their books to an international tribunal and help expedite the claims of people whose policies were seized or not honored.
Many insurers mentioned in the documents no longer exist. Allianz is cited in the industry estimate as one of the 19 companies that could expect to lose money, but does not appear elsewhere. Company officials did not respond to requests for comment.
The Nazi documents, found in February and April, remain stored in Moscow. Photocopies of some excerpts were made available by Risk International Services Inc. of Houston, a company that specializes in "insurance archeology" by searching repositories, from archives to attics, to retrieve lost insurance documents and determine their significance.
The vice president and counsel of Risk International, Douglas L. Talley, said although the research was preliminary, the documents indicate how the Nazis, with the German insurance industry's complicity, established the practice of confiscating the insurance assets of German Jews. Mr. Talley found some of the documents in Moscow in a Nazi folder marked "Insurance Affairs -- Jewish Questions."
According to William L. Shirer's "Rise and Fall of the Third Reich," after the Kristallnacht riots, three Nazi leaders -- Hermann Goring, Josef Goebbels and Reinhard Heydrich -- met with an Allianz executive who represented the German insurance industry, Eduard Hilgard. Mr. Hilgard told them that confidence in the industry would suffer if Jewish claimants were not paid, but that reimbursing them could bankrupt smaller companies.
After the war Mr. Hilgard told Allied interrogators that he had helped the companies settle Kristallnacht claims at 3 cents to the dollar.
Foreign and non-Jewish claims were paid, but Field Marshal Goring confiscated the money due Jewish policyholders. In a document dated Nov. 29, 1938, the Nova insurance company informed insurance regulators that in keeping with the confiscation order, "Jewish members of the cooperative are excluded" from receiving benefits.
In a letter dated Nov. 17, 1938, the Isar Life Insurance Stock Company said that so many Jewish clients were desperately trying to cash in their policies "that the worst fears have to be asserted for the further existence of our company." Isar asked the Government's Oversight Office for permission to deny payment or to convert policies owned by Jews to nonredeemable status.
The Economic Ministry initially balked at letting insurance companies exploit Goring's confiscation of reimbursements for Kristallnacht as a pretext for not honoring other Jewish claims. On Nov. 21, 1938, a ministry official reminded insurers that the order affected "only the insurance claims confiscated from Jews of German citizenship for the benefit of the Reich, which came due because of the events of Nov. 8, 9 and 10, 1938."
"Other insurance claims, for example, life insurance, etc., are not affected," the official wrote. "Please communicate this to the companies involved."
Other documents to be released today suggest how swiftly some companies moved to cancel life, health and pension benefits of their Jewish customers after Kristallnacht A letter from a representative of a group of health insurers dated Nov. 14, 1938, said, "To the extent insurance conditions permitted, Jewish insured were canceled already." He reminded the Government that he proposed excluding Jews in 1935 and described them as "the worst risks" who did not belong in the same risk pool as Aryans.
On Nov. 23, 1938, another German insurer selling pension annuities notified Government overseers that "we will discontinue the payment of pensions and widows' pensions beginning December of this year, insofar as the recipients are Jews."

HEADLINE: Serious Crime Fell in U.S. For 6th Year in a Row in '97

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
Reports of serious crime fell across the nation in 1997, the sixth consecutive annual decrease, with the biggest drop in the Northeastern states and in big cities, the Justice Department said today.
Preliminary figures released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which collected them from 16,000 city, county and state law-enforcement agencies, showed that the overall rate of serious crime fell 4 percent, accelerating the decline of recent years. 
 Violent crimes declined by 5 percent, led by 9 percent decreases in murders and robberies. There were smaller decreases in the categories of aggravated assault, down 2 percent, and rape, down 1 percent.
Rape was the one type of crime for which the statistics showed less progress. Reported rapes declined 2 percent in 1996, 5 percent in 1995, and 4 percent in 1994.
Property crimes declined by 4 percent, led by an 8 percent drop in arson. Car thefts fell 5 percent.
The Northeastern states led the decline in virtually every category. Murders in the region declined 13 percent, total violent crimes declined 5 percent and property crimes declined 6 percent.
Experts have said several trends were contributing to the declining pace of crime. Among them were the aging of the population, a toughening of sentencing laws and the increasing numbers of people in prison. The healthy economy was also a factor, experts said.
Cities with populations over a million reported that murders and robberies each declined 11 percent. Cities with populations of half a million to a million reported murders and robberies each down 10 percent. Cities with populations of a quarter of a million to half a million reported murders down 14 percent and robberies down 10 percent.
In New York City, the total number of crimes counted in the report declined 7 percent, to 355,893 in 1997 from 382,555 in 1996. Murders declined 22 percent, to 770 from 983, and robberies dropped 10 percent, to 44,707 from 49,672. The number of reported rapes in New York City fell to 2,157 from 2,332.

HEADLINE: Republicans Have Grip on Pennsylvania Politics

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: HARRISBURG, Pa.

 BODY:
On the outskirts of this state capital, in a nondescript office building, Don Bailey, a beefy lawyer and former Congressman, is reviewing a legal case at his cluttered desk.
There is no overt indication that on May 19, when Pennsylvanians vote in their primary election, Mr. Bailey could wind up winning the Democratic nomination for Governor. 
 Mr. Bailey, 52, has not seen political action in a decade. He does not have his party's endorsement. He has no campaign headquarters, no campaign manager, no campaign spokesman. He does not even have a sign on his law office door here indicating he is a candidate. "Mostly," he says, "I've been working out of my car and a cell phone."
Still, he is favored in the polls to beat the endorsed Democrat, state Representative Ivan Itkin, 62, a mathematician and party veteran.
But whoever wins, neither is given much chance of unseating Tom Ridge, the successful Republican Governor who is looking at his expected second-term victory as a possible springboard to the Vice Presidential nomination in 2000.
Such is the political landscape these days in Pennsylvania, usually a robustly competitive battleground. For all intents and purposes, it has fallen under one-party rule.
Senator Arlen Specter, like Mr. Ridge a Republican, is also cruising to re-election in November. The other Senator, Rick Santorum, is also a Republican. The Republicans control both houses of the State Legislature and three of the four other statewide offices. They control 46 of the 67 counties and won 10 of the last 13 statewide judicial races.
Oddly enough, the Democrats have 470,000 more registered voters than the Republicans. But that seems a relic of the state's old manufacturing base and its weakening urban anchors in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The state Democratic Party has virtually collapsed, fractured ideologically and geographically. At its December meeting, it could not raise a quorum.
"It's anemic," Mr. Bailey said of the party. "Everybody knows it."
Analysts point to several reasons for the dramatic change in the last few years.
One is that while Pennsylvania is traditionally a culturally conservative state, Democratic leaders have drifted toward the left. "A lot of Democrats in the hinterlands, who are pro-gun and pro-life, are not happy about the party's orientation toward liberal urban policies," said Terry Madonna, a political analyst at Millersville University.
The cities remain Democratic, but turnout in elections has dwindled so that Philadelphia and Pittsburgh now account for a combined total of about 20 percent of the statewide vote, down from 33 percent in 1964. And organized labor, once a powerful force, has lost its grip.
Beyond that, the economy is as strong here as it is elsewhere. Pennsylvania has gained 230,000 jobs since Mr. Ridge took office in 1995. The state has an enviable double-A bond rating from every major Wall Street rating agency for the first time in 30 years, and unemployment in March was 4.8 percent, among the lowest levels in a decade.
Perhaps most important, the Democrats have had trouble fielding attractive candidates.
"It's embarrassing, the difficulty they've had recruiting," said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of The Rothenberg Report, a political newsletter in Washington. "It's one thing to say the Governor is strong, or this is a status-quo environment, but they're down to third-tier candidates for both Senator and Governor."
Mr. Rothenberg added: "It can be intimidating to run against an Arlen Specter. He's a tough politician, and he can raise billions of dollars. But he's a controversial guy, and as such he should have generated a credible opponent."
The races that are sparking the most interest are between Republicans for Congress. Two incumbents -- Bill Goodling in Gettysburg and Jon D. Fox in Montgomery County, a Philadelphia suburb -- are facing tough primary challenges tomorrow.
At the moment, the Democrats have a one-man edge in the 21-man Congressional delegation (yes, all are men). And they hope to pick up two seats in November. One is that of Mr. Fox, who has three opponents in the Republican primary. No matter who wins that vote, Joseph Hoeffel, a Montgomery County commissioner and a Democrat, is expected to run a strong fall campaign. (In Mr. Goodling's district, whichever Republican prevails tomorrow is expected to have little trouble in November.)
Democrats see a more certain gain in Scranton, where Representative Joseph M. McDade, a Republican first elected in 1962, is retiring. Most analysts expect Patrick Casey, son of a former Governor, Bob Casey, to sweep the district. Scranton is the hometown of the Casey dynasty.
But the Democrats' real hopes are down the road. They are already promoting three potential powerhouse candidates for statewide office. Ed Rendell, the Mayor of Philadelphia, may run for governor in four years. And Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, a former member of Congress, is running for lieutenant governor this year, which many observers see as preparation for a Senate bid in 2000 against Mr. Santorum. But both are perceived as liberals and could have problems statewide.
The Democrats' third bright spot is Robert Casey Jr., another son of the former Governor, who, as Auditor General, is the sole Democrat holding statewide office.
"We've got a strong farm team," said Leonard Barrack, a lawyer from Philadelphia and national finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
Still, Democrats are nervous that the top of the ticket this time is so weak that they could have a net loss in Congress and further down the ballot in November. This is why Mr. Bailey ambled into the governor's race -- because Representative Ron Klink, from near Pittsburgh, and other Democratic office-holders told him that Mr. Itkin was too light a feather to hang their hopes on.
"It was a selfish political decision on their part," Mr. Bailey said. "They called up and said, 'I can't carry Ivan in the fall. He's too left of center, too liberal, he's a burden I can't carry.' "
Meanwhile, Mr. Ridge could not be sitting prettier. He is credited with changing the perception of Pennsylvania as a state of high taxes and gritty industry to one that is more business-friendly and high-tech. He has cut business taxes by $2 billion and overhauled the state's costly workers' compensation laws.
"I got the House, I got the Senate, we got a Republican Governor," Mr. Ridge said cheerily the other day in his oak-carved perch in the Capitol. "We can cut taxes, we can do all those things that Republicans only talk about elsewhere."
Mr. Ridge has been using his popularity to help Republicans across the state, saying he wants to rack up even bigger margins in the state house. This would insure that Republicans would dominate redistricting after the census in 2000. The party would hope to make the Congressional districts more favorable to Republicans and cement its gains.
"I spend a great deal of time on party-building," Mr. Ridge said. "It's important to remind yourself every day that things could turn quickly if you're not careful. I view this as an opportune time, and shame on us if we don't build on these political advantages."

HEADLINE: In Long Run, Jobs Help Students;
New York City Lags

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The demand for young workers has bypassed many in cities like ours (news article, May 13). The fraction of New York City teen-agers who are employed has fallen sharply since the 1960's to a level less than half the national average, and dead last of all cities. 
 A recent survey of 424 employers in New York City found that years of sluggish job growth and corporate and government downsizing of full-timers has meant that most local employers report a still-abundant supply of displaced or moonlighting adult job-seekers.
Adult competition for entry-level jobs has intensified as employers have raised the minimum schooling and work-experience levels for new hires. This is less the result of rising skill needs than a reflection of the adult applicant pool and of employers' bleak impressions of the city's public schools.

To the Editor:
Paul Krugman (Op-Ed, May 15) writes: "If we need a domestic lender of last resort to deal with domestic financial crises, doesn't the globalization of financial markets mean that now, more than ever, we need a lender of last resort to cope with international crises?" 
 Mr. Krugman may want to stick to economic theory and leave history to the historians, for lenders of last resort have never done more than mitigate financial crises. Instead, controls on financial transactions have provided the only reliable guarantees of financial stability.
Indeed, John Maynard Keynes and the designers of the postwar Bretton Woods system made no provisions for any "lender of last resort." Rather, they designed a system of wage-price, interest and capital controls, one that provided the foundation for three decades of economic growth and financial stability.
Although these controls were dismantled during the oil shocks of the mid-1970's, officials of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have reconsidered their merits as more direct and less costly mechanisms than lender-of-last-resort assistance.

HEADLINE: WHERE FEAR LINGERS: A special report.;
A Neighborhood Gives Peace a Wary Look

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
In Washington Heights, until recently one of New York's most murderous communities, a disturbing truth reveals itself in the empty stoops on West 162d Street in late afternoon, in the thinly peopled parks overlooking the Harlem River, in the greetings not exchanged by lifelong neighbors on Audubon Avenue:
The gunfire may recede into memory, but the fear hangs on. 
 In 1991, there were 119 killings north of 155th Street in Manhattan. So far this year, the body count stands at just five. Yet while people in Times Square and other far less violent neighborhoods have greeted far less dramatic drops in crime with responses bordering on euphoria, hardly anybody is ready to celebrate here in Washington Heights.
Slowly, haltingly, after a decade and a half in a war zone, the survivors are beginning to emerge from their bunkers into the plain light of day.
New stores are opening, and without shields of bulletproof glass over the counters.
Police officers, once feared almost as much as the drug dealers themselves, have actually started hearing quiet thanks for their crime-fighting help.
And finally, at the relatively advanced age of 9, Roselia Montalvo has learned to ride a bike.
But at every step toward normal life, the memories, and the mistrust, seem to get in the way.
Hundreds of people are still recovering from some trauma of war -- the state assemblyman who saw a man shot in the back of the head and still hears the screams of the victim's wife, the eighth grader who remembers running for cover as a friend was gunned down by rival drug dealers, the woman whose 12-year-old son was killed because he had witnessed his father's murder.
Some simply discount the Police Department's murder statistics. They point out the apartments in their buildings where drugs are sold and used, or the shadows under parked cars where they see people stash guns, as signs that the supposedly safe streets are just so much hype.
Many more remain invisible, for want of a better word. Confined behind triple-locked doors, these battle-weary bystanders -- often single mothers, the elderly or immigrant couples with young children -- have yet to venture out and sense the difference for themselves.
They know that things are somehow better, but real safety still feels out of reach.
"Safe is when you could walk from the train station home, or from your corner to your building, or from the street downstairs to your apartment door, without nobody trying to bother you or follow you," said 15-year-old Ranflin Estrella. "They got a long way to go."
 
A Drug Capital Where Gunmen Ruled
The shooting started in the mid-1980's, when crack cocaine took hold in Washington Heights and gangs of recent Dominican immigrants established the area as the nation's largest wholesale drug market. Other neighborhoods, especially in Brooklyn and the Bronx, also had a strong local customer base for drugs, but Washington Heights was special.
Fed by six bridges and three major highways, Washington Heights was accessible from New Jersey, Westchester and Connecticut, as well as from the rest of the city. It had one of New York's largest and most thinly stretched police precincts, the 34th. And it had an economically desperate population of Dominicans, many of whom, law enforcement officials said, applied their rich tradition of entrepreneurship and their common language with Colombian cocaine suppliers to become the perfect middlemen for crack.
Soon, the neighborhood was to drug dealers throughout the Northeast what the Hunts Point market in the Bronx is to the region's grocery stores, but with sedans instead of semitrailers, and tenement doors in place of loading docks. Operating independently, four or five drug crews might share a single block, their street peddlers swarming over cars with out-of-state plates, vying for market share literally side by side.
That free-for-all competition often turned deadly. Isaac Sanchez, who is 15, remembers seeing one business dispute resolve itself in typical fashion several years ago.
"You see that white church?" he said, pointing to the corner of 166th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. "This guy who was a friend of mine used to own a drug spot there. He was going to sell it to someone, and they started arguing over the money, and the guy shot him. I had to run inside the cigar store across the street."
Today, Washington Heights remains the region's largest distribution center for narcotics, said Police Commissioner Howard Safir. Drug arrests there -- now occurring an average of once every hour and a half -- have yet to peak and, he said, are not likely to do so for some time. But the drug trade has been greatly diminished and, for the most part, forced indoors. The streets, he said, once again belong to the police.
The change took the better part of a decade, a series of prosecutions of violent drug gangs, aggressive police tactics, money and manpower. The District Attorney's office convinced the owners of hundreds of apartment buildings to allow police officers to patrol inside, resulting in thousands of arrests a year. A new police precinct, the 33d, with 200 more officers, was carved out of the southern half of the 34th in 1994, after a long community campaign. And in 1996, Mr. Safir organized a city-state-Federal task force that pools intelligence data and responds to every reported drug incident in Washington Heights.
Gun arrests, in fact, are already down, said Deputy Inspector John Romero, commanding officer of the 34th Precinct, which until April 28 had enjoyed more than five months without a murder.
"People now aren't going to take a chance at carrying a gun, because we're stopping people for quality-of-life crimes all the time," he said. "And if they're not going out with guns, they don't have them when their tempers flare up."
Other signs of change bear out the statistics.
Edward Rivera, manager of the Rivera Funeral Home on St. Nicholas Avenue, remembers when occupied coffins would be left in the hall because the private viewing rooms were busy. "Out of every five calls we'd get, maybe three were gunshot victims," he said. "Mondays were really bad, after the weekend. And the days after holidays. In the early 90's, we could've had 10 or 15 homicides a month."
Business is slow now, he said, adding: "I don't remember the last homicide we had."
At Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, the area's only hospital, gunshot victims once rolled in on gurneys almost nightly. But surgeons removed only four bullets last year. Today, kitchen accidents and sprained ankles receive the staff's full attention, said Dr. James F. Giglio, director of emergency medicine. The trauma surgery room is dark most of the time, its swinging door locked.
 
Showing Symptoms Of War Survivors
Bodily trauma may be on the wane, but psychic trauma is another story.
Marta Pepin recalls sitting in her rocker and watching TV one afternoon in 1988, when she heard five loud bangs through her first-floor window. She turned and saw a neighbor, Ricky Santiago, fall down dead a few feet outside on Audubon Avenue.
Mrs. Pepin responded to the constant gunfire not by shrinking in fear but by organizing her fellow tenants to buy their building, in which drug dealers controlled five apartments. Four have since been evicted. But Mrs. Pepin is still afraid. Last year, the building hired a guard to keep out unwanted night visitors. The extra $16,000 a year is threatening to drive the building into bankruptcy, but Mrs. Pepin says she is loath to leave its security up to her neighbors and the police.
"You can't trust anyone," she said, sitting on a plastic slipcover in her modest but immaculate living room. "You don't know who people are. We've got nice people, but sometimes you think someone's nice, then you hear they're drug dealers. You just can't tell."
Such doubts are all too common, said Dr. Randall D. Marshall, director of trauma research at Columbia-Presbyterian.
"Once somebody's view of the world is that it's dangerous and threatening, it's difficult to change," said Dr. Marshall, whose clinic treats hundreds of residents, many with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, an illness common among Vietnam veterans.
In wartime, at least, "it's very clear who your enemy is, who your comrade is," he said.
"The trouble here is that a lot of the threats are living within the community," he said. "People have learned that they can be exploited or harmed by anybody they come into contact with, and have to watch out."
In Washington Heights, even the most upstanding extended families lost relatives to the lure of drugs or drug money, making it impossible to see one's neighbors as simply good or bad. Savvy drug dealers carried bags of groceries for the elderly, delivered toys and meals at Christmas, held block parties in warm weather and generally cultivated their neighbors' goodwill -- and their silence.
Wary of one another, people hardly put their faith in the police. Tensions between the two have been worse in Washington Heights than anywhere else in the city, from the full-fledged riots that followed a police officer's fatal shooting of an unarmed man in 1992, to the April 1997 death of Kevin Cedeno, shot in the back by an officer who was named "cop of the month" by his colleagues soon after.
"At least the drug dealers are not here to hurt you -- they're here to make a profit," said Yvonne Stennett, who heads the Community League of West 159th Street.
Old complaints about do-nothing attitudes and slow response times only gave way to more suspicion after the new 33d Precinct brought in several officers transferred from the corruption-plagued 30th in Harlem. Since then, increasingly aggressive police tactics have convinced many law-abiding residents that officers see them as criminal suspects first.
"Nobody's really ready to let their guard down too far," said the Rev. Earl Kooperkamp, pastor of the Church of the Intercession on West 155th Street.
Lessons learned painfully, after all, are not quickly forgotten.
There are about 250 city blocks in Washington Heights and Inwood to the north. But aside from four "model blocks," where officers patrol 24 hours a day, there are few places where people seem to have relaxed. Parents still make their children carry beepers, or check in by phone every time they go from one friend's home to another. Teen-age boys stay away from parks that have supposedly been cleaned up. More and more stores are staying open in the evenings, but few women shop alone after dark.
The local Assemblyman, Adriano Espaillat, thinks a bicycle race might help. Mr. Espaillat, who like so many of his constituents once witnessed a murder in daylight, wants to hold the race this summer, to show outsiders that the neighborhood is safe to visit, but more important, he says, to prove to residents that it is safe to go outside -- a first step toward a more normal way of life.
Some people think those first steps have already been taken, that the old twisted alliances and enmities are beginning to straighten out. Deputy Inspector Garry F. McCarthy, commander of the 33d Precinct, recounted how two men he had stopped and frisked had actually thanked him afterward, once he showed them how closely they matched the description of two crime suspects. And when the police shut down five businesses on Broadway a few weeks ago for harboring drug activity, several passers-by quietly expressed their gratitude, he said.
Even young people are reexamining their past loyalties.
"The fun we had then -- now, I regret it," said Isaac Sanchez, talking about the days when his block was an open-air crack market. "Before, in the summer, the drug dealers used to do barbecues. Now, they're gone, and we can't do it any more. Nobody's got the money. But I feel guilty now. Because I used to take whatever anybody gave me. I never asked where they got it. I enjoyed it."
Others are taking risks to insure that the cease-fire holds.
Ramon Sanchez, who manages two adjoining buildings on West 162d Street, stands guard outside, making sure that the front doors lock and that no one gets inside who does not belong. He points out a "crackhead" across the street; gestures at several men, loitering near a garage, who he says are dope peddlers; and fingers a hole in the masonry that was blown out by a .357 Magnum shell.
One of the two buildings used to be overrun with dealers, said Mr. Sanchez, 58, who is not related to Isaac Sanchez.
"Out of 24 apartments, 16 had drugs," he said. "Once I caught my super selling drugs. You couldn't walk into this building. You might get held up, or you might not come back."
But he worked with the police, turning in the superintendent, turning over a batch of cocaine that a postman found in a mailbox, keeping track of who was doing what where. A year ago, largely on the strength of his information, the police hauled off 20 people living inside. Last month, again relying on Mr. Sanchez for intelligence, officers swept through the entire block and arrested 10 people on drug charges.
Mr. Sanchez is tougher than most in Washington Heights. In 1990, his daughter was attacked by a New Jersey drug dealer after she informed against him. Mr. Sanchez, then a tradesman at Columbia University, drove to the dealer's home and shot him to death. He spent four years in prison on a reduced count of manslaughter.
"I am afraid of nobody," Mr. Sanchez said. "But I was scared for my family. I was afraid to even send them to the store."
 
Neighbors Emerge To Meet as Strangers
The other afternoon, Alexandra Pena watched as her four children played outside their apartment building on West 163d Street, between Amsterdam and Broadway. Michael, 13, rode back and forth on his bicycle. Roselia, 9, danced around with a friend, announcing that she had just learned how to ride a bike herself. Justine, 7, tagged along with her sister. James, 6, scared his mother as he hung from a loose iron rail over a basement stairwell.
An unremarkable after-school scene in most places. But until a few months ago, Ms. Pena and her family were prisoners of the violent drug trade in Washington Heights.
"When Michael was 9 or 10 months old," Ms. Pena said, "we were looking out the window one day -- I was holding him -- and we saw a guy get shot in the head right here on the corner. That was Michael's first experience."
There were plenty of others; their street was one of the most dangerous in the 33d Precinct. Last August, Inspector McCarthy declared it the first of the "model blocks." After an all-out drug sweep, the police created checkpoints at both ends of the street, posted officers there around the clock, painted over graffiti and helped residents organize tenant groups and a block association. The barricades have since come down, but an officer patrols the block at all times.
And slowly, the fear has begun to lift on 163d Street. People who for years would only leave their apartments in a hurry have begun to step outside merely to be outside -- first by peering out of a doorway, then by taking a seat on a stoop, then finally taking the plunge by striking up a conversation with a stranger next door.
"We found people who lived across the street from each other for 25 years and had never seen each other," Inspector McCarthy said.
Ms. Pena said, "We were hibernating like the bears."
In safer parts of the world, her daughter Roselia might have started on a tricycle at 3, and moved up to training wheels at 5 or 6. But on 163d Street, she and her siblings could not play on the sidewalk. They could not even play in the lobby of their apartment building, where no fewer than four drug dealers would meet customers.
"I used to take them to school in the morning, pick them up in the afternoon, then take them to 101st and West End Avenue to play," said Ms. Pena, referring to her childhood home on the Upper West Side. "We lived here, but we didn't stay here. We'd come home at 8 or 9 at night. If we came too late, we'd be in danger. If we came home too early, we'd be bored, because we'd be locked up inside."
For fun, Roselia and Justine played with Barbie dolls or took rare turns at the Nintendo set that Michael monopolized. These days, Michael rides his bike, Justine has learned hide-and-seek and tag and Roselia has discovered the other children on the block. "I've made five new friends," she said, pointing to their windows in three different buildings.
Ms. Pena says her children, born into the violence, have already lost their fear. "They don't even remember most of this," she said. "The great thing is, they're getting a chance for a better life."
She envies them. "I've got to get over my fear, too," she said. "It controls you. It does not allow you to be. It makes you feel like a prisoner when you have not committed a crime."

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about a lingering fear of violence in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan despite a drop in crime misstated the circumstances of a fatal shooting by the police in 1992 that prompted rioting. A grand jury found that the man who was killed had drawn a .38-caliber revolver; he was not unarmed.

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE POINT MAN;
Berger Manages a Welter of Crises in the Post-Cold-War White House

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
When Samuel R. Berger arrived at the White House at 7:30 A.M. last Monday he was stunned to learn that India had just completed three underground nuclear tests.
Mr. Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, frantically tried to assemble the facts before breaking the news to a furious Mr. Clinton at their regularly scheduled daily meeting two hours later. How could this have happened without any warning, the President asked. 
 Only 10 days earlier, Mr. Berger, known as Sandy, met with India's Foreign Secretary, delivering a message that Mr. Clinton was determined to "make a quantum leap" in elevating the American relationship with India. While he made clear that the two countries disagreed on nuclear issues, Mr. Berger gave no warning of dire consequences if India carried out its threat to test a nuclear weapon, and even asked for advice on what sites Mr. Clinton should visit on his trip to India this fall.
And, so, at the White House, Mr. Berger had no explanation to give the President. He absorbed Mr. Clinton's wrath, recommended swift sanctions and promised to produce a decision memo within 24 hours.
Mr. Berger is dancing as fast as he can. The trade lawyer turned presidential adviser has little time or inclination to play geostrategic chess. Instead, he is struggling to manage a string of crises, work the bureaucracy, cut deals, woo Congress and spin journalists, all for a President whose passions don't normally extend beyond the water's edge.
In the six days before the India crisis erupted, Mr. Berger, 52, made an overnight, no-sleep trip to Moscow to warn Russia of possible sanctions if it did not curb missile technology transfers to Iran. He spent all day Saturday on the next steps for dealing with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and preparing for Mr. Clinton's European trip. He consulted for hours by phone on Mother's Day with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright on the Middle East. In between he dealt with Indonesia, Kosovo and the strategy on Iran. He tried to stop Congress from going ahead with its moratorium on land mines and finished an Op-Ed piece on religious freedom.
"I only know how to do it this way, which is full throttle," Mr. Berger said in an interview. "And I'm sure there will come a time when I start singing 'Showboat' tunes in the Oval Office and they'll carry me out."
What often gets lost is how the pieces fit together: how adding new countries to NATO fits in with promoting a stable Russia; how the problems with the Middle East peace effort fit in with long-term American interests in the Persian Gulf; how the failure to win trade negotiating authority for the President fits in with promoting the elimination of trade barriers around the world.
"I really like him," said Henry A. Kissinger, who was criticized for doing nothing but strategic geopolitics when he held the job under President Richard Nixon. "But you can't blame a trade lawyer for not being a global strategist. The security adviser reflects what the President wants, and I don't think the President asks him to come up with a global strategy."
Mr. Berger bridles at the suggestion that the Administration has no overall strategy. He ticks off the Administration's strategic goals: an undivided peaceful Europe, restoring America's relationship with China, dealing with terrorism and drugs and creating "a new architecture" for the global economy.
"You can't be successful if you can't think strategically, and you can't be successful if you're unprepared to be focused on every detail and make sure things get done," he said. "On the one hand you're an author, and on the other hand you're a garbage collector."
As the partner who built the international business portfolio of his law firm, Hogan & Hartson, Mr. Berger himself once acknowledged, however, that "grand strategies" can be overrated. "More often than not, they are rationales developed after the fact to explain a series of relatively ad hoc decisions that turn out reasonably well," he said during a panel discussion in 1991.
But at times, behind closed doors, even Mr. Berger expresses frustration that he is ground down by the crises du jour.
"Sometimes I think the only thing we're going to do in the next two years is bomb Iraq and bail out Indonesia," a colleague quoted him as saying recently.
 
Next Door to Clinton, A Command Center
The office of the national security adviser a few steps away from the Oval Office is where Mr. Kissinger plotted the secret opening to China, where Zbigniew Brzezinski thought up ways to outflank the Russians and where Robert C. McFarlane nearly brought down a President with a scheme to sell arms to Iran to finance guerrillas in Nicaragua.
Mr. Berger uses the office somewhat differently: as the command central to slog through the dozens of items on the "to do" checklist he prepares every Sunday night.
A veteran political speechwriter, Mr. Berger worries about how foreign policies will play in the heartland. In December, for example, he persuaded Mr. Clinton to change out of his Santa Claus tie for the announcement that American troops in Bosnia would not leave on deadline.
But the heartland is where Mr. Berger also suffered his biggest political defeat, enduring humiliation at a "town meeting" on Iraq in Columbus, Ohio, earlier this year when he, Ms. Albright and Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen were shouted down by angry protesters.
A risk-averse lawyer who worked for clients like Toyota and Payless ShoeSource, Mr. Berger believes more in global economic power than in the balance of power.
In his conversation with India's Foreign Secretary, Krishnan Raghunath, Mr. Berger raised the issue of India's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles only peripherally, stressing instead the need for the world's two largest democracies to build on the common agenda of health, economics, environment and information technology.
Even after the Indian nuclear tests, Mr. Berger urged Mr. Clinton not to cancel his trip, convinced that the United States has a better chance of modifying India's behavior by engagement rather than isolation.
Certainly, no one can fault Mr. Berger for being a shirker. He works 14- to 18-hour days, has the overnight intelligence reports delivered to his home every morning, reads 10 hours on Sunday but never for pleasure and has even carried two cell phones onto the golf course.
Certainly Mr. Berger's close relationship with Mr. Clinton, whom he met at a rally during the McGovern campaign in 1972, helps him along.
He spends a minimum of 20 minutes every weekday morning with the President, and is not afraid to give him unsolicited advice.
After a tense meeting between Mr. Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia in Helsinki in 1997, Mr. Berger suggested that the two Presidents take time before their news conference to coordinate their answers. Mr. Yeltsin replied with stony silence.
So Mr. Berger said, "President Clinton, why is President Yeltsin so much better-looking than you?" Mr. Clinton roared with laughter. So did Mr. Yeltsin. And at the news conference, the two men were feeling good again.
When Mr. Berger moved from deputy to national security adviser in January 1997, one of his first acts was to sit down with Ms. Albright and Mr. Cohen to draft what he calls "four rules for not killing each other."
Rule 1: No friendly fire. "We don't criticize each other publicly," Mr. Berger explained.
 Rule 2: Walk ourselves back. Rather than say " 'Well, Berger doesn't know what the hell he is talking about,' Berger himself walks back and says, 'Maybe I overstated it.' "
Rule 3: Presumption of innocence. "Before you accept the fact that your colleague has been engaged in some kind of mischievous, dishonest effort, you pick up the phone and talk it through."
Rule 4: No policy by press conference. "We ought to agree to things before we make policy."
 The three also help keep the peace by meeting in Mr. Berger's office for an "ABC" lunch (Albright, Berger, Cohen) every Monday. He and Ms. Albright talk on the telephone up to 30 times a day.
 
Colleagues Praise A Team Player
Largely because Mr. Berger hears out his colleagues and treats them fairly, they have only praise for him.
Ms. Albright: "The glue for the system."
Mr. Cohen: "Honest broker."
Gen. Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: "Runs a great meeting."
Leon Fuerth, Vice President Gore's foreign policy adviser: "A sensible American at the table."
And Mr. Berger, a one-time Congressional staffer, spends an enormous amount of time working Capitol Hill.
 Last fall, he led months of quiet diplomacy with the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, when the Senate was poised to defeat ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention, carrying a letter to him from the President to get the treaty approved.
And last month, when Mr. Berger was told that a "killer" amendment on NATO expansion might be introduced in the Senate, he abruptly ended a high-level meeting on Iraq and ordered Mr. Cohen and a top general to Capitol Hill to argue against it. Iraq would have to wait.
 But Mr. Berger has failed to improve his relationship with journalists much since his time as deputy national security adviser.
Some reporters complained privately to the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, that "background" conversations with Mr. Berger were outright misleading.
"I have never to my knowledge lied to a reporter," said Mr. Berger, seeming genuinely surprised by the thought. "Nor would I."
When confronted with a denial of a particular story that turned out to be true, Mr. Berger admitted, "Maybe I was trying to give you not the whole truth but part of the truth."
 
Taking the Long View Of Foreign Policy
On the evening of his 29th wedding anniversary late last month, Mr. Berger stood before representatives of refugee and development organizations in a hotel ballroom to read a speech about Mr. Clinton's recent trip to Africa.
Recounting that half a million people greeted the President in Ghana, he said: "I wish Americans could see us as others do. We are a beacon, an incandescent light that gives power through our ideals, our culture, our way of life." The applause was polite.
"He is so out of touch," said Tracy Hyter-Suffern, director of world relations for the Y.W.C.A. "Maybe he picked up the wrong speech."
"So patronizing," said Elizabeth Nesbitt, a program assistant for the Academy for Educational Development.
With Mr. Clinton's personal image tarnished, there is more pressure on Mr. Berger to work on the foreign policy record Mr. Clinton will leave behind. And though he says he hates discussions about a Clinton legacy, the Africa speech fit into the Administration's thesis that the United States must use its dominance to create a new global economy and build alliances that will contribute to democratic reform and prosperity.
So Mr. Berger will soldier on, with back-breaking days and nights and a telephone line in his bedroom linking him to the White House.
"He is the Cal Ripken of national security advisers," said William Danvers, who was the White House liaison to Congress until last year. "He consistently excels in his job. The thing people will remember most about him is his streak of playing every day."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 19, 1998, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of a production error, an article yesterday about Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, omitted the last line. The final paragraph, referring to Mr. Berger, should have read:
"He is the Cal Ripken of national security advisers," said William Danvers, who was the White House liaison to Congress until last year. "He consistently excels in his job. The thing people will remember most about him is his streak of playing every day."

HEADLINE: A Garden Caught in a Housing Squeeze

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Gardeners look at the corner of Crimmins Avenue and East 141st Street in the Bronx and marvel at the transformation of a vacant, garbage-strewn lot frequented by drug dealers into the garden of their dreams. There are flowers, vegetables and herbs. There are tables for dominoes, a scampering puppy and even a chicken coop.
The other day they planted a tree, a Canadian hemlock. "We are here to tell heaven and earth we are planting a new tree," a man said in Spanish, as two dozen people stood in a circle. "This will be its home." 
 Not for long. Others look at the site of the Crimmins Group Association Garden and envision houses rising from the spot where two six-story apartment buildings burned down more than a quarter-century ago. They endorse the Giuliani administration's decision to turn the city-owned lot over to a nonprofit group in November for construction of three two-unit homes -- the continuation of a housing renaissance that has added 30,000 units to the borough over the last decade.
And housing remains a critical need, particularly in this tattered corner of Mott Haven, where there are just six vacancies among 921 housing units, said Lee Stuart, lead organizer for South Bronx Churches. Her group is to build the homes on the garden site.
"There is literally no place where people can move," Ms. Stuart said. "It's just tight, tight, tight."
Both gardeners and builders are convinced that they are helping the neighborhood. The community gardeners point to their history of coming into devastated slums and transforming them with sweat into urban oases. Housing advocates assert that the city's greatest need is affordable housing, though many commend gardeners for filling in the temporary voids with blossoms.
For years, the two sides have maintained something of a truce. But City Hall has begun pressing for faster development of city-owned vacant lots, partly because of tightening space for housing. To further this goal, it recently transferred the bulk of the 750 community garden sites to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
Although the city has no immediate development plans for most of the sites, the gardeners fear that their dream has begun to wither. Beginning in the early 1970's, as squatters, they began to reclaim vacant lots one by one. The process was institutionalized in 1978 when a city agency, Green Thumb, was established to oversee the gardens, using Federal anti-poverty grants. The number of gardens grew to 410 in 1983. Then the growth slowed, and began to reverse in the last year, according to garden organizations.
"Community gardeners have earned the right not to have to fight for their gardens," declared Steven Frillmann, executive director of Green Guerrillas, a principal advocate. "They are like poster people for the quality of life."
Although there have been demonstrations and court battles over the loss of gardens on the Lower East Side and Upper West Side, those are aberrations. In most cases, the gardeners leave quietly. The strongest response from most gardeners at the Crimmins Avenue site was that they just wished it was not happening.
"Maybe they give me another one," Cruz Concepcion, the garden president, said quietly. "We are poor. We need a place like this."
When the group is evicted in November, it will be the second time it has been kicked out of a garden. Three years ago, they were evicted from a smaller plot on the other side of the same block. That was also supposedly to make way for housing, but the site has never been anything but a ragtag parking lot.
At the garden's center is a "casita," or little house, with a porch and a Puerto Rican flag fluttering from the top. Some garden advocates believe that casita gardens, where hens lay eggs, men drink beer and children roll in the dirt, are the most vulnerable.
"People who are white-collar bureaucrats are going to make decisions based on the appearance of gardens," said David Lutz, program director for the Neighborhood Open Spaces Coalition, a garden supporter. "Casita gardens are not necessarily the most beautiful."
The Crimmins group was joined this spring by another gardening group, one also evicted to make way for housing. The Hostos Herbal Medicine and Cultural Garden, organized by professors and students at Hostos Community College, is devoted to cultivating plants -- sometimes the very weeds found in vacant lots -- that are believed to have healing qualities.
The Hostos group had to give up its portion of a three-acre garden in Hunts Point after its last harvest to make way for two- and three-bedroom homes.
"To pit housing against gardens is too bad, but it's really where we're at," said William Frey, vice president of the Enterprise Foundation, which builds homes for lower and middle-income families.
Housing and garden advocates say that what is needed is a standard approach for weighing the best use for each site, one that begins years before a rumbling bulldozer turns up. "You can't have these political battles at the end of the process," said Kathryn S. Wylde, former president of the New York City Housing Partnership.
In fact, Ms. Stuart said that the Crimmins group's previous garden site -- taken by the housing agency in 1995 -- may not be ideal for housing development because of its size and shape. She said the church group may give it back to gardeners, something it has done several times in the past.
From the gardeners' perspective, each new garden means back-breaking work. It took nearly a year for the Crimmins group to remove garbage, including whole abandoned cars.
During a long day of work, the local people and the Hostos gardeners seem to get along nicely. They speak in Spanish, and share folk knowledge about plants -- how juniper fights viruses and periwinkle cancer. They share pizza. On other days, they have made Spanish cheese and roast pork with rice and beans.
Working very hard was Julio Reynoso, 42, who has built fences and flower beds. "This is a way for my children not to be cramped up in an apartment," he said, "and I love plants."
He pointed to a warbler vigorously bathing in a little pool the gardeners had created. "If they build a building here," he asked, "will the bird come?"

HEADLINE: MUSIC REVIEW;
Guest Conductor Offers A Composer He Favors

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

 BODY:
There is no shortage of familiar repertory from the Mahler-Strauss wing of the early 20th century. Yet several significant musicians have been trying to make space there for Alexander von Zemlinsky, who was born in Vienna in 1871 and died in Larchmont, N.Y., in 1942. Chief among Zemlinsky's advocates is the conductor James Conlon, who led an involving performance of "Die Seejungfrau," a fantasy for orchestra, with the New York Philharmonic on Friday afternoon.
Though born just three years before Schoenberg, Zemlinsky taught counterpoint to the younger composer and introduced him to the music of Wagner. Zemlinsky was an inventive and accomplished composer, but he did not follow Schoenberg's trail-blazing path to atonality. His music remained essentially tonal, and even its dissonant quotient is not high. 
 Yet in its way, "Die Seejungfrau" is a bold work, lushly yet lucidly scored. A 45-minute tone poem, it depicts the story of a restless mermaid, who, entranced with a mortal young prince, assumes human form at great physical pain to herself. But the emotional pain that comes is even worse. The music surges forward in waves of harmonic activity and long-spun melodic lines. The tremulous, quiet opening recalls another work that begins under water, Wagner's "Rheingold." In places the music bears a similarity to Schoenberg's sprawling early orchestral works, like "Pelleas und Melisande," though Zemlinsky's harmonic language is more rooted in tonality.
Yet for all the myriad subtleties in the score that are fresh and original, the music has a pattern of cresting and subsiding that becomes cliched. You did not have to watch the percussionist, his open arms readied for a big cymbal clash, to know that another climactic outburst was about to arrive. That said, it was hard to resist Mr. Conlon's impassioned, tautly shaped performance, which he conducted from memory. And the luxuriously orchestrated music summoned luminous playing from the New York Philharmonic.
The American pianist Garrick Ohlsson was the soloist for a bracing performance of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 1, originally written when the composer was 18, but revised extensively 25 years later. This crammed, dynamic but jumbled work is not top-drawer Rachmaninoff. But Mr. Ohlsson's virtuosic, clear-headed, incisive, no-nonsense yet sensitive playing was just what it needed.
The concert concluded with a stirring performance of Liszt's symphonic poem "Les Preludes," once a repertory staple but these days not often heard. Next to the other somewhat excessive works on the program, it sounded like a model of economy and craft, thanks to the spacious, crisp and vibrant performance by Mr. Conlon and the orchestra.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES;
As Commodity Indexes Fall, Palladium Still Seems Strong

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Political turmoil in Indonesia, the collapse of many economies in Asia and the threatened economic sanctions on India all sent a key commodity index to its lowest level in more than four years yesterday.
At the same time, the recent slump in the Russian stock market and the continued disruption of supplies from Russia sent the spot price of palladium over $400 an ounce -- and above the price of its sister metal, platinum, for the first time. Although the rally fizzled later in the day, palladium remains near an all-time high and could move higher. 
 The decline in the prices of copper, silver, oil, nickel, wheat and other commodities, which have been in a down trend for two years, have helped tame inflation in the United States and could give some policy makers at the Federal Reserve extra arguments against raising interest rates when they meet today.
In general, Wall Street analysts do not expect the central bank to take any action. But because of the recent strength of the economy, the sharp fall in unemployment and signs of rising wage pressures, the debate could be sharp. And any signs of easing price pressures are likely to be pointed to by policy makers who want to hold the line.
The Commodity Research Bureau/Bridge index of 17 commodities fell 2.69, to 219.27. The broader Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, which has 22 commodities, fell 1.59, to 160.50, just above its March low.
"The big story is that everything is for sale, and much of that is because of the downward spiral in the Asian crisis," said Dinsa Mehta, the managing director of global commodities at Chase Manhattan Bank.
One big decliner yesterday was silver. The price for July delivery fell 28.5 cents, to $5.287, its lowest close in almost six months. The price has now dropped 11 percent in a week, a move that was set off in part by the economic sanctions India faces because of its recent nuclear tests.
India is a major buyer of silver. Both the sanctions and the fall of the Indian currency, the rupee, are expected to cut into demand. The weaker rupee makes silver, which is priced in dollars, more expensive.
Also hurting silver is the apparent selling by investors who followed Warren E. Buffett into the metal after he announced in February that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, had bought 129.7 million ounces since July. These investors all began buying silver when it was more than $6 an ounce.
While the rally in palladium faded yesterday, it probably is not over because there is no sign yet that the Russians, the world's biggest producer, are going to ship any metal soon. The spot price of palladium rose as high as $425 an ounce yesterday, while platinum hit only $406. But palladium then fell to $387, down $15.50 on the day.
One reason the rally can continue, said Matthew Keen, J. P. Morgan's head trader for platinum group metals in London, is that "car companies are not particularly phased by the price of palladium." Catalytic converters are major users of palladium. But the unit cost per car of palladium is still relatively low.
"It is not having a material impact on our business," said Mel Stephens, the director of business news at the Ford Motor Company.
Another reason for a rally is that there are many investors who own palladium futures contracts that expire in June that can require them to deliver the metal to settle. The shortage of actual metal, therefore, could push the price much higher. "It looks like some crunch is coming," said Keith Green, the director of Johnson Matthey's marketing division, during the company's presentation of its annual survey of the platinum and palladium markets.

HEADLINE: Kohl Paints Opponent As Far Leftist

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BREMEN, Germany, May 18

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Europe's elder statesman and Germany's political colossus, launched his re-election campaign today with a harsh, personal attack on his main challenger, accusing Gerhard Schroder of steering the land toward a "leftist republic."
Seeking to offset Mr. Schroder's telegenic popularity and big lead in opinion polls, Mr. Kohl assailed the Social Democratic leader for recently permitting a political agreement with the remodeled Communist Party in the small eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt. 
 There, local Social Democrats have agreed to run the state government with tacit support from the former Communists.
If such arrangements spread to a national level, Mr. Kohl said, the result would be "insecurity, instability and the loss of the world's confidence in Germany."
Mr. Kohl was speaking at a special party meeting here of his Christian Democratic Union. Party loyalists were hoping to start reversing his flagging political fortunes. The German leader is 8 to 10 points behind Mr. Schroder in opinion surveys.
So far, Mr. Kohl seems to have drawn little benefit from a visit last week by President Clinton, who praised him as being "on the right side of history."
Indeed, as they listened to his two-hour speech -- and rose for a 10-minute standing ovation -- Mr. Kohl's followers may have concluded privately today that this was not just a call to arms, but also a valedictory for four terms and 16 years in office, spanning three American Administrations -- a record in modern Germany.
The attempt to link Mr. Schroder to a Communist threat may seem anachronistic outside Germany. But this country has long and bad memories of ideological extremes, dating not just to the cold war decades of Germany's division, but also to the rise of Communism and Nazism before World War II.
While eastern Germans routinely give a fifth of their votes to the Party of Democratic Socialism -- the former Communist Party -- the ex-Communists remain anathema to western voters. Mr. Kohl called the Social Democrats' agreement with the former Communists "highly dangerous."
Political radicalism, he said, "brought only misfortune" to Germany in this century.
Underlying Mr. Kohl's remarks is a battle for the middle ground of German politics. Mr. Schroder says he represents a "new center," challenging Mr. Kohl for the center ground that he has long regarded as his own. So Mr. Kohl seeks to depict Mr. Schroder as a Trojan horse of radicalism.
In his quest, Mr. Kohl faces the problem that many issues seem intractable: joblessness is at a postwar high, particularly in the east, where growth lags far behind western Germany. Attempts at economic reform have faltered in political stalemate.
It took no time at all for the opposition Social Democrats to point out that Mr. Kohl was 40 minutes into his speech today before he even mentioned unemployment.
"Helmut Kohl is yesterday's man," the Social Democrats said in a statement after the applause died down. "Kohl has missed his last chance."
The party gathering here was touted by Mr. Kohl's allies as a possible turning point, comparable to a similar congress before the 1994 elections. Then as now, Mr. Kohl was trailing the opposition in opinion polls and some wrote him off. Then as now, he used a pre-election party meeting to turn his followers' minds from defeat.
But then, unlike now, the voter surveys -- of which Mr. Kohl is scornfully dismissive -- were not telling quite such a tale of rejection and weariness with his rule. Then, Mr. Kohl could count on eastern Germans still hoping for the fruits of reunification. Then, there were not so many on the unemployment lines as the 4.5 million today.
And then he was 64, not 68. His age makes him an emblem of the wartime generation, while Mr. Schroder is 54 -- a slicker showman far more attuned to the baby boomers likely to shape Germany's destiny.
Even within his party there are doubts. A weekend poll found that 56 percent of the Christian Democrats surveyed predicted that Mr. Kohl would not win in September.
"Helmut Kohl stands at the end of a development," said Alexander Gaulland, an author and journalist regarded as a Christian Democratic intellectual. "He will not set foot in the promised land, like Moses."
Mr. Kohl was not so easily dismissed. "We know how to fight," he declared. "We know that without fighting, no election is won. We will not leave the field open to the others. We want to fight."
This year's vote is seen as critical, and not just because Mr. Kohl is pressing for an unparalleled fifth term . The election is seen as likely to determine how Germany -- and thus much of Europe -- is run as the Continent faces the strains of adopting a single currency, the euro, which could revolutionize its political and economic workings.
Whether Mr. Kohl fired up the party as he did in 1994 remains unclear. His image-makers called the speech combative and forward-looking. "There was a synergy," said a senior official. "He was aggressive, and the party wanted him to be aggressive."
Mr. Kohl, though, is in a particular bind. On his watch, Germany was reunified in 1990, and under his tutelage Europe has been pushed and cajoled toward integration.
"For someone like me," he said, European unity is all the more important, since in his teens he needed a pass simply to travel a few miles in Germany between the French and American occupation zones.
"Another generation will ask, 'What have you achieved?' And we will say, 'Europe,' " he said.

HEADLINE: Senate Votes to Increase Number of Foreigners Allowed in U.S. to Fill Technology Jobs

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
Heeding the calls of the high-technology industry, the Senate voted today to increase the number of foreign workers who would be allowed into the United States to fill thousands of short-term computer programming and other similar jobs.
The Senate approved the bill by a vote of 78 to 20 after a daylong debate that pitted the muscle of the high-technology companies, who say they face a crisis shortage of qualified United States workers, against the concerns of labor unions and immigration opponents. The bill would increase the number of foreign high-technology workers by 20,000 to 30,000 a year for five years. 
 "One only needs to pick up the want ads, and you will see, as these various newspapers here suggest, the spectacular amount of jobs going unfilled," said Senator Spencer Abraham, the Michigan Republican who wrote the bill.
"We need to be able to attract and find and bring to this country the highest skilled workers we can to fill these jobs, until we can find workers in our country to fill them," Mr. Abraham said.
Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman indicated she would recommend a veto to President Clinton, saying that the bill favors foreign workers over American ones.
But the House version of the bill, which takes steps to insure that Americans are not displaced by foreign workers or overlooked, could ease the Administration's labor concerns. That bill is opposed by the high-technology industry and by Mr. Abraham.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, tried to attach two similar provisions to Mr. Abraham's bill, but was voted down.
"I'm wondering what we have against Americans and American workers that we are so willing to turn over these good jobs to foreigners," said Mr. Kennedy, who added that the high-technology companies needed to do a better job of recruiting and training American workers for these jobs.
Mr. Abraham's bill, which would lapse in five years, would increase the number of visas allocated to highly skilled workers by 30,000 for 1998 and by 20,000 each year for the four years after that. If the crunch worsens, it would likely allow an additional 20,000 visas a year. Currently, there are 65,000 visas available for highly skilled workers.
Contributing to the bill's momentum on the Senate floor was the fact that this year's 65,000 visas have already been depleted, something that had not occurred before last year. Predictions for 1999 indicate that the number could be exhausted as early as February.
To accommodate the added high-technology workers, the legislation would cut back on the number of health care workers permitted into the United States, placing an annual limit of 10,000 on them and shifting them to a separate visa category.
It would also provide money to help train low-income students in high-technology skills.
For months now, high-technology executives have been making dire predictions about how the shortage of workers, mostly computer programmers, would hurt the economy and help blunt the industry's competitive edge. So eager were they to get this legislation passed that even the heavy-hitters, William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, for one, got personally involved in the lobbying.
Further complicating the problem, executives say, is that a number of workers have been diverted to work on correcting computer programs that will be thrown into chaos in 2000 for the simple reason that the year ends in 00.
Mr. Abraham said there were an estimated 330,000 existing vacancies for high-technology jobs, a void that could drive American companies abroad in their hunt for talent or could lure foreign workers to foreign competitors.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Major Indexes Show Decline For a Third Consecutive Day

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Major stock market indexes fell for the third consecutive trading day yesterday on the dampened demand from investors concerned about the chaos in Indonesia and the Government's legal action against the Microsoft Corporation.
Political uncertainty and rioting in Indonesia has refocused investor attention on the economic problems in Asia. Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, said it reminded investors that growth has slowed in the region and that American corporations could be affected. 
 While the news out of Asia weakened the stock market, bond investors interpreted the developments positively. The Asian turmoil and a sharp increase in the dollar's value bolstered bonds by encouraging foreign investors to seek a haven in the safety of dollar-denominated securities.
The dollar's advance also reflected the uncertainty in Asia, which caused a broad selloff of all Asian currencies, pushing the dollar to the highest level against the yen since September 1991.
Bonds also benefited from the belief that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise short-term interest rates when its chief governing committee meets today. Stocks, on the other hand, which had been volatile in recent weeks on interest rate expectations, virtually ignored that bullish sentiment.
"I think if the Federal Reserve were to tighten, it would surprise everyone," said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities.
Since it reached a new high of 9,211.84 last Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen for three straight sessions. Yesterday it lost 45.09 points, declining to 9,050.91. Standard & Poor's 500 index slipped 2.91 points, to 1,105.82, its third consecutive decline.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 15.17 points, to 1,831.62, the lowest in five weeks. It was dragged down by a 3.8 percent drop in the shares of Microsoft, which fell $3.375, to $86.0625. Yesterday, the Justice Department and 20 states filed antitrust lawsuits against Microsoft, contending the dominant software company has tried to stifle competition.
News of the legal action put a damper on the technology sector as several large issues slumped, including Hewlett-Packard, which had already fallensharply last week on unexpectedly weak earnings.
There were some spots of positive news. Dell Computer rose on expectations that today's first-quarter earnings report would exceed analyst forecasts. Promising medical treatment news sent several drug stocks higher and the market received another round of corporate mergers news. But stocks still traded lower.
The inability of the market to focus on the silver lining -- as it has done so often -- has some analysts believing that more declines loom.

Bond prices rose sharply yesterday, pushing yields to nearly one-month lows, in a rally fed by a surge in the dollar's value and expectations that the Federal Reserve would leave interest rates unchanged at its policy-making meeting today.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 22/32 , or $6.875 per $1,000 bond, pushing its yield down to 5.92 percent, from 5.97 Friday, the lowest since April 20. Results of the Treasury's auction of three-month and six-month bills yesterday:

HEADLINE: To Clear Air With Europe, U.S. Waives Some Sanctions

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: GENEVA, May 18

 BODY:
Trying to resolve two of the toughest disputes between the United States and Europe, the Clinton Administration waived sanctions today against three foreign companies that are doing business in Iran and said that it would seek legislation to head off sanctions against businesses that operate in Cuba.
In exchange the European Union and Russia agreed to tighten control of the export of weapons technology to Iran. The European Union also agreed with the United States to set up a system to govern confiscated property in Cuba and elsewhere. 
 Administration officials said the agreements, reached after more than a year of negotiating, had taken the poison out of two vicious disputes that had affected Washington's ability to win European support on other matters.
The accords involve the Helms-Burton law and the Iran-Libya sanctions act, both of which empower the United States to punish other countries for doing business with the third parties.
Congressional Republicans were outraged at the Administration's decision. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, said: "The decision is a mistake. It will send a signal to others that they can do business as usual with Iran at a time when Iran continues to pursue weapons of mass destruction and continues to sponsor terrorist acts."
Marc Thiessen, a spokesman for Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, said: "The Europeans offered the Administration absolutely nothing in exchange for this waiver. This sends a signal to Iran that the United States is not serious about isolating their terrorist regime."
Although Mr. Thiessen said changing the Helms-Burton law would be difficult, a senior Administration official said that much time had been spent with Mr. Helms in the negotiations and that "there is a lot of understanding on the Hill for what we're trying to do."
President Clinton said because the Europeans had agreed to restrict the exports of weapons technology further, the waivers were "part of our overall strategy to deter Iran from acquiring weapons of mass destruction and promoting terrorism."
Similarly, he argued that the accord on Cuba would protect American interests "far more effectively than the United States could have done alone."
Mr. Clinton made his comments at a joint news conference in London with Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, and Jacques Santer, President of the European Commission.
The Iran-Libya act of 1996 mandates sanctions but permits the Secretary of State to waive them in the national interest.
Senior European diplomats in Washington said the Administration had agreed that companies in all European Union nations would receive similar waivers. But senior American officials said there would be no automatic waivers for countries that invested in pipelines that ran through Iran from Caspian Sea countries.
Russia received no blanket assurances, because the Administration remains concerned about the reliability of its export controls.
In the case of the Cuba sanctions, the Administration will need the cooperation of a reluctant Congress. Those sanctions apply to companies that profit from property that Cuba's Communist Government expropriated from Americans. Administration officials said legislators whom they had contacted in recent days were impressed with the outlines of the evolving agreement.
After having announced the agreements in London, Mr. Clinton flew here to address a meeting of the World Trade Organization, where he called for "an ever more open global trading system."
"Globalization and the technology revolution are not policy choices," he said. "They are facts."
He urged the organization to speed negotiations and to begin examining next year how to reduce tariffs and subsidies in agriculture. He also proposed that the agency open to the public its hearings over trade disputes. The sessions are now closed.
The accords were reached after a weekend of debate over the usefulness of economic sanctions. Of the four major European democracies at the economic summit in Birmingham, England, none agreed to follow the American lead in imposing sanctions on India for testing nuclear weapons. Nor has Russia done so, although Japan and Canada, two other participants, have.
Standing beside Mr. Clinton today, Mr. Santer called the American sanctions policy toward Iran, Libya, and Cuba illegal and counterproductive. He praised the agreement today as "getting rid of the biggest problem in our relationship."
Mr. Blair observed that what the United States called sanctions policy the Europeans called interfering with the internal affairs of other nations.
The Europeans had already agreed to drop a suit against the United States before the World Trade Organization on that issue.
The United States had been weighing sanctions against three foreign companies -- French, Russian and Malaysian -- over a joint venture to develop Iran's South Pars gas field.
In a statement Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said that she remained opposed to the energy deal, but that she found it to be in the national interest to waive the sanctions. Doing so, Ms. Albright said, would encourage Europe, Russia and Malaysia to cooperate with the United States in isolating Iraq and addressing the Asian financial crisis. She also said the waivers would encourage the Russians to ratify the Start II nuclear arms control treaty.
American officials acknowledged that the waivers would put American companies at a disadvantage in Iran. "That is the price, if I may say so, of real leadership," an official said. American energy companies are prohibited from investing in Iran by an Executive Order issued in 1995.
According to Title III of the Helms-Burton act, Mr. Clinton may waive permission for former owners of contested property to sue the foreign companies for compensation in American courts. Under the law Mr. Clinton has to exercise that waiver, if he chooses to do so, every six months. He has done exactly that since the law passed in 1996.
Another provision, Title IV, requires the Government to deny visas to executives of foreign companies that profit from the disputed property. It is that provision that the Administration is seeking to amend, to permit Mr. Clinton to waive sanctions indefinitely for European Union nations. The Administration also committed to sounding out Congress about dropping the six-month time limit for Title III waivers.
In exchange the European Union has agreed to a series of so-called disciplines to limit investment in expropriated property in Cuba and elsewhere. The rules prohibit Governments from providing such businesses loans, subsidies, risk insurance or other support, including diplomatic advocacy.
Under the agreement people who feel that their property has been illegally expropriated would be able to list their claims with a new international registry. Governments would then check that registry when companies request help with particular ventures.
In his remarks today Mr. Clinton was at pains to emphasize the needs of consumers, workers and environmentalists, whom he referred to in London as "stakeholders in our economic lives."
After failing last year to win enhanced authority from Congress to negotiate trade deals, Mr. Clinton concluded that he had done too little to assuage the fears over free trade expressed by unions, environmentalists and others. As he pledged to continue pressing Congress for the authority, he said tonight that the trade representatives gathered here had to insure that "spirited economic competition among nations never becomes a race to the bottom in environmental protections, consumer protections and labor standards."
Mr. Clinton also suggested that China was becoming a more democratic nation. "Russia and China, where the shackles of state socialism once choked off enterprise, are moving to join the thriving community of free democracies," he said.

HEADLINE: UNREST IN INDONESIA: THE POLICY;
Halting Loans Isn't Enough, Both Parties Tell Clinton

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration came under intense attack in the Senate today for its unwillingness to call on President Suharto of Indonesia to step down, even as the United States and its allies changed policy by indefinitely suspending a $43 billion economic bailout of the country.
In a highly charged hearing of the Asian subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, both parties criticized the White House for putting economic stability ahead of actions to encourage democratic change and for wavering on whether to press Mr. Suharto to leave. 
 "The message should be simple and direct," said Senator John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat. "President Suharto has got to go." Senator Paul D. Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat, said: "I think our silence is betrayal. We have to be on the side of the students."
Their critique comes amid change in American policy toward Indonesia. Less than a week ago Treasury and State Department officials said that aid would continue to flow. But today the Administration and its major allies halted three loans totaling $2.7 billion, scheduled to go in the next 48 hours by the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. Both have been working with the International Monetary Fund.
This is the first time the Administration has even implicitly tied political change -- though not necessarily Mr. Suharto's departure -- to the $43 billion aid package put together after Indonesia was hit by economic and political crisis.
The public explanation was purely logistical: with Jakarta's streets in chaos and its financial system in collapse, there is no way to track what happens to the money. The World Bank, for example, evacuated 68 expatriate officials from Indonesia over the weekend.
In testimony today, Stanley Roth, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, declined to link future aid to political change in Indonesia. But privately officials described a different policy, as debate raged over how to influence events there without much leverage. A senior Administration official said it would take more than a mere restoration of order to restart the flow of money. "It will depend on a range of factors that include social, economic and political factors, as well as the logistic issues," the official said.
Referring to the Administration, a senior official of an international financial institution dealing with Indonesia said, "They are shifting gears at high speed," adding, "They were casting the suspension of aid as a 'technical' matter while there was chaos in the streets. Now there are political conditions. We have entered the world of subliminal diplomacy."
Washington has been reluctant to urge Mr. Suharto's departure for fear of the chaos that might follow. Moreover, it is unclear who Mr. Suharto's successor might be.
In the last week, however, the calculus has changed dramatically. The chaos, it is now believed, will worsen if Mr. Suharto stays. Yet the Administration has been unwilling to reverse itself, with officials saying they are looking for some kind of ill-defined "middle ground," supporting political reform without specifying that Mr. Suharto must go. For example, officials say they want to prepare for the possibility of Mr. Suharto's staying on as titular leader even if power is transferred to others.
"We have no idea what this might look like in a week," a State Department official said today. "It's not time to get in a box we'll have to extract ourselves from on Friday."
But Senator Kerry called the result "a muddled message."
"There is no linkage of policy to any principles about the rise of a democratic government," he said. "Or if there is, they won't say so."
Administration officials say one reason for their public caution is that Washington's relationship with Indonesia is much more tenuous than its ties with the Philippines 12 years ago, when Senator Paul Laxalt was sent to tell Ferdinand E. Marcos that the time had come for him to leave.
The Philippines, a former American colony, was defended by two major American military bases. Indonesia, on the other hand, has always had a far testier relationship with the United States. Until last week the only American calls for political reform in Indonesia came in private meetings between Mr. Suharto and a series of American envoys, most notably former Vice President Walter F. Mondale. But Mr. Suharto did not respond.
In public, however, the Administration only began talking about political reform in Indonesia last week, after the rioting had begun. And even today, Mr. Roth would not specify what kinds of reform the Administration had in mind, saying that like Mr. Suharto's future, it is "up to the Indonesian people."

HEADLINE: Alabama Governor's Race Tests Strength of Christian Conservatives

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: TUSCALOOSA, Ala., May 12

 BODY:
Even his campaign advisers are telling Gov. Fob James Jr. of Alabama to change the subject. But when it comes to his obsessive crusade to reconcile church and state, the Governor has maintained the relentless tenacity he once showed as a hunkered-down halfback for the Auburn University Tigers.
His defiant stands in defense of religious expression in schools and courtrooms, including threats to call out the National Guard and defy the United States Supreme Court, have earned the Governor a national reputation for zealotry -- and some serious opposition in the Republican primary for governor on June 2. 
 The campaign has exposed deep fault lines here in the heart of the Republican South. On one side are many of the Christian conservatives who have supplied the party with much of its energy and voting strength in recent years. On the other are many in the state's image-conscious business community, who fear that Mr. James is driving away investment.
"It's become a race about a set of issues that if rejected in a Republican primary will be a major setback to the pro-family movement across America," said Ralph Reed, the former director of the Christian Coalition and a consultant for Mr. James. "I think the pro-faith community is sophisticated enough to understand that."
Mr. James's opponents, who share his support for returning prayer to the public schools, counter that the race is not about beliefs. Instead, they say, it is about tactics, and whether the state can afford another governor known primarily for tilting at the Federal courts.
Although Mr. James, 63, is favored in the five-way race, many political analysts assume he will fail to win a majority in the primary and will be forced into a runoff on June 30. His most likely opponent is Winton Blount 3d, 54, a wealthy Montgomery businessman and party leader who has accused Mr. James of "playing to the worst instincts" of this notoriously populist state.
In the 1960's, one of Mr. James's predecessors, George C. Wallace, achieved legendary status in Alabama with his populist, court-bashing defense of segregation. Now, Mr. James has adopted a similar approach, with religion replacing race as the focus of his appeal.
Mr. James's stands on religion seem to be heartfelt, say those who know him best. But he has also chosen to advertise his views with stump speeches and legal briefs, making school prayer as prominent a feature of his re-election strategy as are his pledges to improve schools and hold down taxes.
In an effort to energize evangelicals, some of Mr. James's strategists have portrayed the race as a referendum on a distinct brand of social conservatism.
But Mr. James's aides also recognize that the campaign has revealed fissures within the conservative Christian movement between those who admire Mr. James's resolve and those who fear that his showmanship may undermine their cause. They have kept the prayer issue out of his television advertisements, preferring instead to aim their appeals to evangelicals through telephone calls and direct mail. And they have encouraged Mr. James to focus his remarks more on education, taxes, jobs and crime.
During the last 15 months, Mr. James has waged a guerrilla war against the courts over long-held interpretations of the First Amendment's establishment clause. The United States Supreme Court has consistently ruled in school prayer cases that the clause prohibits government from favoring religion over nonreligion. Mr. James has asserted that the courts have exceeded their authority, misread the Constitution and suppressed religious freedom.
In February 1997, he announced that he would call out the National Guard if necessary to defend the right of Judge Roy Moore of Etowah County Circuit Court to display the Ten Commandments in his courtroom. Another state court judge ruled that Mr. Moore must remove the wooden tablet, but the decision was overturned by the state Supreme Court on technical grounds.
Last June, Mr. James wrote a 34-page letter to Judge Ira DeMent of Federal District Court urging him to dismiss a challenge to a 1993 Alabama statute that permitted non-sectarian, nonproselytizing, student-initiated voluntary prayer in public schools. The letter essentially argued that the Bill of Rights does not apply to the states.
"We will have no justice in our courts or integrity in our government without the blessing of God upon us," Mr. James wrote.
Judge DeMent rejected the Governor's request, and later ruled that the school prayer statute was unconstitutional. When the judge issued an injunction last November explaining what forms of religious expression were allowed and proscribed in the schools, Mr. James vowed to "resist Judge DeMent's order by every legal and political means with every ounce of strength I possess."
This month, Mr. James petitioned the United States Supreme Court to overturn Judge DeMent's ruling, with a brief that encouraged defiance of the high court.
"In the absence of constitutional limitations, other constitutional officials throughout government owe no 'deference' to the decisions of this Court," Mr. James argued in the brief, which was written by his son, Forrest H. James 3d.
The Alabama Attorney General, Bill Pryor, a Republican, quickly distanced himself from Mr. James, saying the Governor did not speak for the state. Mr. Pryor, who was appointed by Mr. James to fill an unexpired term, has filed a separate appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. That appeal accepts the unconstitutionality of school prayer, but uses free speech grounds to challenge some of Judge DeMent's restrictions.
In addition to Mr. Blount, who finished third in the 1994 Republican primary for governor, Mr. James's other opponents in this year's primary are former Gov. Guy Hunt, 64, who was recently pardoned on a state ethics conviction and is running for the office he was forced to resign in 1993; Lewis Leslie McAllister Jr., 65, a Tuscaloosa manufacturer and local party leader, and Phillip W. Williams, 58, a former state finance director under Mr. James.
The most recent public poll, which was conducted April 27-30 for Southern Opinion Research, showed Mr. Blount (pronounced blunt) moving into contention with Mr. James. Among those who said they were likely to vote in the Republican primary, Mr. James was supported by about 39 percent, Mr. Blount by 30 percent, Mr. Hunt by 14 percent, Mr. McAllister by 9 percent and Mr. Williams by 2 percent. Seven percent said they were undecided. The margin of error was plus or minus five percentage points.
The Republican nominee, presumably with a depleted treasury, will probably face Lieut. Gov. Don Siegelman, a Democrat, in the general election. Mr. Siegelman is an experienced candidate who had raised $3.9 million as of April 15. With little competition in the primary, he has managed to save nearly all of it.
Support for Mr. James, who made a fortune manufacturing plastic-coated barbells before beginning his political career, is particularly anemic in Alabama's business community. Those Republicans blame Mr. James for failing to win legislative support for tort reform, for exacerbating the perception of the state as a backwater and for devoting more energy to religious issues than to economic development.
The Governor won a big victory last fall by bringing a Boeing rocket booster plant and 3,000 jobs to the city of Decatur with more than $140 million in state incentives. But it may have come too late to restore his reputation in business circles.
Mr. Blount, whose father was Postmaster General in the Nixon Administration, said the state was "thirsting to join the other states marching proudly into the 21st century." And while he emphasized that he, too, supported prayer in the schools, he said he would respect the rule of law and would not be "out running ragged on some strategy that doesn't make any sense."
After beginning their television advertising campaign, Mr. James's aides maintained that they had stopped Mr. Blount's momentum. But Mr. Blount has received endorsements in recent weeks from the leading newspapers in the state's four largest cities. And he has won the endorsement of the Coalition of Christians for Family Values, a group of evangelicals led by a Montgomery minister, Mickey A. Kirkland, who ran in the Republican primary for governor in 1994.
Mr. Kirkland said Mr. James had alienated many conservative Christians by turning the school prayer debate into a sideshow.
"I think people of faith see the sensationalizing of issues for political gain, and we despise that, detest that," Mr. Kirkland said.
He said Mr. James also lost support last month when a television station's microphone captured him cursing while signing a bill requiring silent reflection at the start of each school day. The Governor later apologized, but Mr. Kirkland said some evangelicals saw hypocrisy.
Other conservative Christian groups are firmly on Mr. James's side, and Mr. Reed expressed confidence that a heavy turnout of evangelicals would insure victory for the Governor. Robert J. Russell, chairman of the Christian Coalition of Alabama, which does not endorse candidates, predicted that Mr. James would win "tremendous support from the Christian right" because of his support for prayer in the schools and the Ten Commandments and his opposition to abortion.

HEADLINE: Bipartisan Plan for Rescue of Social Security Involves Markets and Retirement at 70

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
A commission including members of Congress from both parties will propose a sweeping plan today to shore up Social Security, calling for the establishment of personal investment accounts and a gradual increase in the retirement age to 70.
The report is the most comprehensive package of recommendations to date for remaking Social Security in preparation for the baby-boom generation's retirement. It says the changes would keep Social Security solvent for at least 75 years without raising taxes, even as it trades some reductions in guaranteed benefits for the higher if less certain returns of the financial markets. 
 Prepared over 15 months by the National Commission on Retirement Policy, a private group of lawmakers, economists, pension experts and business executives that was assembled by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the report is likely to wield considerable influence at the White House and on Capitol Hill as Democrats and Republicans seek solutions to one of the nation's most politically sensitive issues.
While the committee's main recommendations are sure to be hotly debated, the report underscores the speed with which once-radical options for Social Security, like the addition of an investment component, have become part of the political mainstream.
Powerful interest groups including the American Association of Retired Persons oppose creating private accounts within the Social Security system, as do many liberal Democrats.
While the Congressional Democrats and Republicans on the commission backed the investment-oriented approach, the panel had no members from labor unions or other groups that have fought to maintain Social Security as a guaranteed safety net against poverty in old age.
But with the stock market booming and people more comfortable than even a few years ago with investing on their own, Democrats including Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska have joined Republicans in backing private accounts.
"This report brought together people who really understand the issue," said Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, a Republican and a co-chairman of the commission. "It's bipartisan. It's the only plan out there scored by Social Security's actuaries as saving the system for the next century."
The report was unanimously approved last week by the commission's 24 members, including Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, a Democrat, and Representatives Charles W. Stenholm of Texas, a Democrat, and Jim Kolbe of Arizona, a Republican. Senator Breaux and Representatives Stenholm and Kolbe were also co-chairmen of the commission, along with Donald B. Marron, the chairman and chief executive of Paine Webber Group, the Wall Street firm, and Charles B. Sanders, the former chairman of Glaxo Inc., the pharmaceutical company.
Mr. Marron said the proposal should play a central role as Congress and the White House move toward drafting Social Security legislation next year.
"Unlike other proposals this one has a great degree of detail and a focus as far as turning it into legislation," Mr. Marron said.
The report calls for diverting into personal investment accounts two percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax levied on workers and their employers to finance Social Security. The change, which would not affect current retirees, would allow individuals a choice of investment options for the money accumulating in their Government-administered accounts, including stock-index funds and Treasury securities.
Advocates of private accounts said the higher rates of return available from investing in the financial markets would leave people with more money at retirement than they would have if they relied on the current system. Opponents say many individuals are already investing in the stock market, and that rather than making a bigger bet on Wall Street, the nation should tweak Social Security but not change its role in providing a guaranteed payment, regardless of stock prices or the economy.
Since allocating part of payroll tax receipts to investment accounts for current workers would eventually leave the system short of the money needed to pay benefits to current retirees, the report calls for the Government to make up the difference with Federal budget surpluses.
But the plan also calls for other steps to reduce the financial strain on Social Security as the 76 million baby boomers born from 1946 through 1964 start heading into retirement a decade from now.
The retirement age, already set to rise to 67 from 65 over the next few decades, would rise under the plan to 70 by 2029. The early retirement age would rise to 65 from 62 by 2017.
The presumed higher rate of return from the private accounts would be somewhat offset by reductions for many in the traditional guaranteed monthly Social Security payments.
But the cutbacks would be designed to hit the wealthy more than people with lower incomes. The report also calls for the establishment of a minimum benefit -- set at 60 percent of the poverty line for people who have worked at least 20 years, rising to 100 percent for people who have worked at least 40 years -- and would allow Social Security recipients to continue working without a reduction in their benefits.

HEADLINE: U.S. V. MICROSOFT: THE OVERVIEW;
U.S. AND 20 STATES FILE SUITS CLAIMING MICROSOFT BLOCKS COMPETITION OVER INTERNET

BYLINE: BY JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
The Federal Government and 20 state Attorneys General filed two broad, aggressive antitrust suits against the Microsoft Corporation today, launching the most concerted government attack on a single company in a generation.
The suits accuse the world's most powerful software company of using its monopoly in personal computer operating systems to win control of the Internet and software products, particularly browsers, which are necessary for viewing and interacting with the World Wide Web. 
 What is more, the Justice Department suit accuses Microsoft of having once approached its then-infant rival, the Netscape Communications Corporation, with an offer to divide the Internet market.
As Attorney General Janet Reno announced the filing of the suits this afternoon, with Attorneys General from Connecticut, Iowa and New York standing at her side, she said that Microsoft's business practices had "restricted the choices available for consumers in America and around the world."
In a meeting with reporters at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Wash., this afternoon, Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, said, "This is a step backward for America, for consumers and for the personal computer industry that is leading our nation's economy into the 21st century.
"How ironic," Mr. Gates added, "that in the United States -- where freedom and innovation are core values -- that these regulators are trying to punish an American company that has worked hard and successfully to deliver on these values."
The Justice Department and Attorneys General asked the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to issue a preliminary injunction to stop the practices described in the suits immediately.
But in a curious twist in their decision to take on the company that epitomizes the supremacy of the nation's high-technology industry, they stopped short of asking the court to block the release of Microsoft's latest version of its operating system, Windows 98.
Even as the lawsuits were being filed, Microsoft began shipping the product to computer manufacturers, and it announced that it was on schedule to sell Windows 98 in stores beginning June 25.
Joel I. Klein, the Assistant Attorney General for antitrust, said that the Justice Department would not try to block Windows 98 because the Government wanted to "create options, not restrict them, so we will not try to stop the shipment of the software."
With the final version of Windows 98 already shipped, it was clear that many consumers were likely to get the new operating system without the limits and remedies being sought in the lawsuits. But Mr. Klein also made it clear that his goal was not to block one piece of software but to force Microsoft to change its way of doing business.
"What cannot be tolerated -- and what the antitrust laws forbid," Mr. Klein said, "is the barrage of illegal, anticompetitive practices that Microsoft uses to destroy its rivals and to avoid competition."
In a decision that pleased the Justice Department, the case was assigned to District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who issued a ruling favorable to the Government in the antitrust case filed against Microsoft last October.
That suit charges Microsoft with violating a 1995 consent decree by forcing computer manufacturers to accept the company's browser, Internet Explorer, as a condition of licensing its Windows 95 operating system.
The new Federal and state suits would require Microsoft to sell a version of Windows 98 that does not include Internet Explorer -- or to package Netscape's Navigator browser, the principal competing product, with Windows 98.
The state suit also asks that Microsoft be forced to include a third Web browser of Microsoft's choice unless Internet Explorer is removed from the operating system.
Microsoft maintains that Internet Explorer is now part of the Windows operating system, not a stand-alone product, and therefore cannot be removed.
Dennis C. Vacco, the New York Attorney General, whose office will head the states' litigation team, said, "Our action today aims to protect consumers from a single power controlling and dominating an information infrastructure that one day may be our primary link to communications, commerce and information."
A senior Justice Department official noted that there were precedents for requiring a company to carry its competitors' products. Long-distance telephone companies, for example, have been required to allow competitors to use their lines, and one airline's reservation system has been required to carry the flight information of competing airlines.
But Mr. Gates said that neither of the alternatives described in the suits was acceptable.
"I don't think asking us to ship a competitor's product is an appropriate solution," he said. "And if they want us to re-engineer Windows to take these new features out, we'll have to turn to the courts."
The Federal and state suits also try to stop Microsoft from requiring that computer makers set up new computers so that consumers see Microsoft's main Windows screen, or desktop, when they first turn on their machines. This requirement is important to Microsoft -- and to the Government -- because the desktop can now serve as a gateway to the Internet and to every other service and piece of software available.
"At stake here," said Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Attorney General, "is whether Microsoft's control over gateways could throttle Internet commerce -- and indeed commerce itself."
In a statement, Microsoft said: "Consumers who purchase a new PC and see the Windows desktop as the first screen are assured of the product's quality, simplicity and reliability. Once that first 'boot-up' takes place, consumers can customize the desktop in any way they like."
That may be true, Mr. Klein said, but he added that it was "quite clear" that most consumers maintained the basic desktop they were given. And a senior Government official said that the prosecutors saw the first-screen requirement as Microsoft's way of maintaining its operating system monopoly.
Without it, Mr. Klein said, computer manufacturers would be able to bring their own "interesting, challenging opportunities to consumers."
The state and Federal suits also seek to end "exclusionary contracts with providers of Internet and on-line services" that are intended to make them favor Microsoft products and services. During negotiations between prosecutors and Microsoft lawyers over the weekend, that was one area where the company initially expressed some flexibility. But the talks foundered over other issues, so no agreements were reached.
Today, Microsoft said: "Like virtually all companies in the software industry and many other industries, Microsoft has entered into various cross-promotional agreements in which Microsoft agrees to help promote and distribute a company's products and services in exchange for promoting Microsoft's technology. These agreements are legal and commonplace."
The suit filed by the state Attorneys General follows the lines of the Federal suit in most areas but adds charges of its own. For example, the states charge that Microsoft is using predatory pricing strategies to gain monopolies in other software products, including word processors and spreadsheets that are packaged in office "suites," including the market-leading Microsoft Office.
The states' suit says that Microsoft offers steep discounts only if the company's office suite is purchased for installation on a manufacturers' entire line of computers. The manufacturers "cannot afford to pay the significantly higher royalties for per-copy licenses, because their profit margins are very narrow," the suit says.
"As a result of that pricing strategy," the suit goes on, "Microsoft Office has attained monopoly power in the field of office productivity suites. By calendar year 1995, Office accounted for over 85 percent of all sales of office productivity suites, and its share of sales has increased since that time."
That pricing strategy, the suit charges, has made it "economically impractical for manufacturers to offer competing office productivity suites for preinstallation on their PC's."
In his remarks this morning, Mr. Gates said the company's products had been successful "because we did a better product."
The state suit also accuses the company of trying to take control of the E-mail software market by bundling Outlook Express, the company's E-mail program, with Windows 98. The suit does not, as some state officials predicted last week, challenge Microsoft's inclusion in Windows 98 of WebTV for Windows, an electronic program guide that shows what is on television and on certain Web sites.
Still, the suit clearly leaves the door open so that new charges can be added if more states join the effort and bring their own concerns.
The Attorneys General said they were acting to protect consumers -- and aspiring entrepreneurs -- in their states.
Iowa's Attorney General, Tom Miller, chairman of the Antitrust Task Force for the National Association of Attorneys General, said, "We are taking this action to give a fair shake to competitors and free choice to consumers in one of the most crucial industries in the nation."
Scott Harshbarger, Attorney General of Massachusetts, said the intent of the suit, from his point of view, was to make "an opportunity for Massachusetts companies to compete with Microsoft on a fair and level playing field.
"It could mean new jobs, new innovations and new choices for consumers," he said.
The states collaborating on the lawsuit are California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin. The District of Columbia, represented by the United States Attorney, also joined the action.

HEADLINE: U.S. V. MICROSOFT: THE CASE;
Where Fine Lines Blur

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
The Government explained its landmark antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation today as a principled defense of the time-tested, bedrock values of capitalism, protecting consumer choice and economic competition from the predatory assault of a modern monopolist.
Standing before a battery of television cameras and lights, Joel I. Klein, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, described the case at times in business-as-usual terms. The principles, he insisted, were clear-cut; the remedies asked of the court were limited, and the theories behind the case were standard antitrust doctrine. 
 The Government's suit is aggressive in that it seeks to apply the Sherman Antitrust Act, enacted before the turn of the century, to millennium technologies. Even so, said Carl Shapiro, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a former senior Justice Department official, it asks the court to take more of a next step than a giant leap in jurisprudence. "The suit is carefully crafted to push the law a little perhaps," Mr. Shapiro said, "but not so much that a court is being asked to embrace sweeping new theories about how antitrust applies to the software industry."
Though carefully honed, the Microsoft case -- whatever the outcome -- seems certain to be a watershed in setting the ground rules of competition in the digital age as well as the guidelines for Government intervention in a high-technology economy.
The Government sees the Microsoft case as a crucial test of how antitrust enforcement can be applied swiftly and "surgically," in Mr. Klein's words, to protect innovation and competition in the fast-paced business of computer software.
The Microsoft camp replies not only that it is innocent, but that the Government fundamentally misunderstands the facts of economic life in its industry -- and thus is running a grave risk of hobbling a dynamic part of the economy.
Yes, the company says, competitors may suffer from its business practices, such as bundling software for browsing the Internet into its Windows operating system, but those practices also result in improved products that benefit consumers.
The Government, Microsoft insists, is mistakenly bringing an industrial-era mind-set to a fluid, fast-moving field of the future. Microsoft's operating system, the central nervous system of a computer, has changed dramatically, adding dozens of new features over the years to make computers easier to use. All Windows' features, from point-and-click icons to software for sending faxes from a personal computer, were once sold as separate products.
The line between what is in the operating system and what is a separate product, says William H. Gates, Microsoft's founder and chairman, changes every couple of years, and the borderline is elusive because it is all merely a collection of the electronic 1's and 0's of computer code. The software industry, Mr. Gates believes, is different.
"This is a war between two competing philosophies," said Robert Litan, a former senior Justice Department official and the director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. "It's very difficult to predict which philosophy is going to win."
The legal battle, analysts predict, will more likely be blitzkrieg than the slow trench warfare of the last big antitrust case the Government brought in the computer industry -- the 13-year suit against I.B.M., which the Justice Department abandoned as technologically irrelevant in 1982.
The Government's suit does not try to block the shipment of Microsoft's next-generation operating system, Windows 98, which the company released to computer manufacturers today and which is to reach store shelves in June.
But to try to level the current competitive field, while it pursues its antitrust suit, the Government filed a request for a preliminary injunction.
In seeking the injunction, the Justice Department is asking a United States district judge to require Microsoft to either remove its Internet Explorer browser from Windows, or include the browser of its main rival, the Netscape Communications Corporation. (The states' suit asks that Microsoft be forced to include a third Web browser of its choice unless Internet Explorer is removed.)
The proposed injunction also seeks new freedom for personal computer makers by giving them the right to install their own main screen that consumers see first when they turn on their computers. Today, Microsoft has control over the main screen -- which is important because it is viewed as a gateway from which people gain access to Internet shopping, news and entertainment.
Tactically, legal experts say, the preliminary-injunction phase of the confrontation may well decide the Microsoft case. A ruling on the Justice Department's request for an injunction will likely be made in six weeks or so. If the Government wins, it is not expected to require a product recall of Windows 98, since the remedies involve allowing PC makers to remove or alter its software.
Whichever side wins, the other side is sure to appeal -- with an appellate verdict likely to come within six months. At that point, experts say, the fast-moving nature of the software industry will surely shape the legal strategy, since six months is almost a product lifetime in software. Any forced product changes would be all but permanent, and if the Government is losing, the hightechnology marketplace may have left its suit in the dust.
"If Justice loses the preliminary injunction, time is on Microsoft's side," Mr. Litan of Brookings said. "If Microsoft loses, the Government has the upper hand."
The Justice Department's case, built around Mr. Klein's theory of a limited if essential role for antitrust intervention, inevitably raises the question of whether it goes far enough. Even if the Government wins its case, skeptics argue, a victory may well be toothless, doing little to loosen Microsoft's tight grip on computing. Indeed, some analysts say that anything short of a trust-busting-style breakup of Microsoft would likely have little effect.
"The political support isn't there in this round, but if the Government is really going to create a competitive environment, it is eventually going to have to split up Microsoft as it did with Standard Oil," said Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley lawyer who has worked for Microsoft rivals.
When asked if he might consider more drastic measures in the future, Mr. Klein ruled nothing out. Yet he emphasized that the goal of the Government's actions was not to insure the success of Microsoft's competitors. The Government, Mr. Klein said, is merely trying to open the door to some innovative company that might become the next Microsoft, rather than hobble the incumbent.
"Nothing we are doing here will or should prevent Microsoft from innovating or competing on the merits," Mr. Klein said. "What cannot be tolerated -- and what antitrust laws forbid -- is the barrage of illegal, anticompetitive practices that Microsoft uses to destroy its rivals and to avoid competition."

Excerpts From the Lawsuit Filed by 20 State Attorneys General

 BODY:
The following are excerpts from the complaint filed yesterday against Microsoft by 20 state Atorneys General in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. 
 The Internet browser is a separate product which competes in a separate product market from the PC operating system. Microsoft itself has consistently offered, promoted, and distributed its Internet browser as a stand-alone product separate from Windows, and intends to continue to do so after the release of Windows 98.
No other product duplicates or fully substitutes for the functionality of an Internet browser.
Internet browsers that work with one operating system will not work with another operating system without significant modification. The geographic market for Internet browsers is worldwide.
The Internet browser has the potential to enable "platform independent" applications. Internet browsers can be, and have been, developed to run on the major desktop operating systems. If an application is written to run on the browser, it can be platform-independent in the sense that it does not depend on compatibility with an underlying operating system. Rather, it depends on compatibility with the Internet browser and associated technologies.
By offering the possibility of a "middleware" layer which would, in essence, permit applications to run on any operating system, the Internet browser threatens Microsoft's Windows monopoly. If an application's ability to run no longer depends on the use of a particular operating system, consumers will no longer be required to purchase the dominant operating system in order to ensure access to a wide portfolio of desired applications. Accordingly, customers would no longer see any particular operating system as having intrinsic value simply by virtue of its ubiquity. This would, in turn, facilitate entry of other operating systems into the competitive market. Thus, while not itself an operating system, the Internet browser poses a significant potential challenge to Windows. In its current form, the Internet browser does not threaten to eliminate the Microsoft operating system, but to "commoditize" it. . . .
Through the actions described above, Microsoft has illegally attempted to prevent competition to its software products, with the following anticompetitive effects:
Actual competition between Microsoft and actual and potential competitors in the markets for Internet browser and related software, office productivity suites, and first screen and boot up access has been or is threatened to be curtailed and foreclosed;
OEM's (Original Equipment Manufacturers) have been denied, or are threatened with denial of, the benefits of a free, open and competitive market in the sale of licensing rights for Internet browsers and related software, office productivity suites, and first screen and boot up access;
Consumer purchasers of personal computers pre-loaded with software have been denied, or are threatened with denial of, the benefits of a free, open and competitive market for Internet browsers and related software, office productivity suites, and first screen and boot up access;
Barriers to entry into the markets for operating systems and office productivity suites have been raised and reinforced, tending to forestall the development of actual competition in those markets; and The states general welfare and economies have been injured through prevention of free and open competition in each of the States' economies. Plaintiff states and their citizens will be subject to a continuing, substantial and immediate threat of irreparable injury to the general welfare and economy and to competition in their states unless Defendant is enjoined from its illegal conduct.. . . .
Microsoft has monopoly power in the market for PC operating system software.
Through the actions complained of in this petition, Microsoft has willfully and illegally used its monopoly power to maintain and extend its monopoly in this market in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. 15 U.S.C. 2. . . .
Microsoft has attempted to monopolize the market for Internet browsers through the acts and practices described above in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 2. Microsoft has specific intent to achieve monopoly power in this market, and in furtherance of this intent has engaged in the exclusionary conduct described above.
There is a dangerous probability that Microsoft can and will achieve a monopoly in the market for Internet browser software through the actions complained of by the plaintiff states.

HEADLINE: Whitman Announces Plan To Improve Transportation

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 18

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman outlined a $30 billion transportation plan today, a mix of new and existing initiatives with a focus on expanding mass transit and repairing bridges and highways.
In a speech in Atlantic City before the Northeast Association of State Transportation Officials, Mrs. Whitman said she envisioned a transportation system that fostered both a strong economy and a "superior quality of life" without consuming major amounts of the state's dwindling open space. The plan, with a theme of Fix It First, includes replacing nearly 2,000 aging buses and trains, upgrading bridges and highways, and easing congestion and dangerous roadways. 
 Aides said she would outline the financing for the plan on Thursday. Federal and state money already exists for some of the mass transit projects that are now in either planning or construction stages but were listed in her plan.
How much new spending will be required was unclear today. The Governor's top aides and legislative leaders are discussing increases to the state's gasoline tax, now one of the lowest in the nation at 10.5 cents a gallon. Officials said privately that the proposed increase could range from 3 to 7 cents. Each penny increase would produce about $41 million a year.
The plan now is to submit any proposed increase to New Jersey voters in a referendum in November. If they accept a higher tax, some of the proceeds would go to a dedicated fund for the purchase of undeveloped land, and the rest would go into the state's Transportation Trust Fund for mass transit and highway projects. Currently, the state and Federal governments each contribute $900 million a year to the fund. About 70 percent of gasoline tax revenues provide some of the state's contribution to the fund.
The Governor said that, given the limited amount of undeveloped land in New Jersey, the state would build what is necessary and no more. "We cannot build our way out of congestion," she said. "It's been tried, and it doesn't work."
Her administration, she said, would insure that any new transportation projects correspond with objectives in the state's master plan to limit growth in rural areas. By the year 2010, she said, she envisioned a state where air was cleaner and people were healthier, where cities served as "hubs of business and meccas for performing arts" and "people have more leisure time to spend in fields of green."
One major element of Mrs. Whitman's pledge to improve the state's quality of life is the purchase of one million acres of undeveloped land in the next decade. The other element is transportation improvements.
Her biggest single proposed expenditure -- $18 billion -- is earmarked for her Fix It First campaign.
This part of the plan calls for replacing 1,400 of the 3,000 buses in New Jersey Transit's fleet in the next five years and replacing 424 rail cars and 17 locomotives, or about 63 percent of the rolling stock, on its mass transit lines within 10 years. It also calls for an overhaul of what it defines as deficient bridges -- currently about 413 of the state's 6,300 bridges.Some 290 of the 413 are on Federal interstates or state highways, and 123 more are on roads maintained by municipalities. The plan calls for making repairs, by the year 2010, to all deficient bridges on the interstates, half of those on state highways and 25 percent of those on local roadways.
Officials at the State Department of Transportation said none of the 413 bridges are unsafe. But they said some of the bridges are old and are now too narrow for the increased traffic of recent years, and need widening. Others need repaving or minor repairs to superstructures. The plan also calls for upgrading 20 of the most rundown stations on New Jersey Transit's rail system.
Environmental groups long critical of New Jersey's transportation planning praised the Whitman plan. Janine Bauer, head of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, said the organization has been calling for a fix-it campaign for three years. "We applaud the Governor's policy statements," she said.
The New Jersey Public Interest Research Group urged that laws providing new financing for the Whitman plan must mandate that the money is spent on her proposals. "Unless you put controls on the transportation bureaucracy and the road lobby, a speech is just a speech," said Curtis Fisher, head of the organization.
Another part of the plan calls for $3 billion to improve the state's 25 most congested roadways in 5 years and 15 more within 10 years, and $4 billion more to complete work by 2002 on three light-rail lines. They include the first 10-mile stretch of a trolley line linking 34th Street in Bayonne with the train terminal in Hoboken, a 33-mile trolley line linking Trenton and Camden, and a one-mile addition to Newark's subway system to provide a rail link between the Broad Street train station in Newark and the city's main terminal, Pennsylvania Station. Officials said that $1.2 billion in Federal money has already been allotted for these lines.
A $1 billion category dealing with safety improvements calls for a 25 percent reduction in deaths in car crashes and a 50 percent cut in pedestrian fatalities by 2010. The plan says those deaths can be reduced through improved safety technology, better highway design, and a public awareness campaign for safer driving.

Foreign diplomats in Islamabad said in interviews that China had suddenly emerged as the pivotal factor in Pakistan's decision. A5
 
U.S.-Europe Disputes Eased
The Clinton Administration waived sanctions against three foreign companies doing business in Iran and said it would seek legislation to head off sanctions against businesses operating in Cuba, in an attempt to resolve two of the toughest disputes between the United States and Europe. In exchange, the European Union and Russia agreed to tighten control of the export of weapons technology to Iran and take other steps. A6

Agreement Is Reached On Transportation Budget
Congressional negotiators said that they had reached broad agreement on a $200 billion transportation bill but had rejected a tough new national standard for drunken driving, a move that was denounced by highway safety groups as a capitulation to the liquor lobby. A1
 
Prostate Screenings Hailed
A new study provides the first evidence that routine screening of men for prostate cancer can substantially reduce the deaths from the disease.

A Divided G.O.P. in Alabama
Gov. Fob James Jr. of Alabama has earned a national reputation for zealotry -- and serious opposition in the Republican primary for governor on June 2 -- with his defiant stands in defense of religious expression in schools and courtrooms. A12
 
TV Stations Win Latitude
The Supreme Court has ruled that government-owned television stations that sponsor candidate debates have the discretion to exclude fringe or minor-party candidates who have little chance of success, as long as the exclusion is not based on the candidates' views. A16
 
A pair of Supreme Court decisions in which criminal defendants won the right to new hearings offered a tantalizing glimpse of a fault line among the Justices that is not often seen: a split between conservatives. A16
 
F.D.A. Nominee Is Chosen

HEADLINE: High Cost of Bailing Out Bankers;
Colonialist G-8

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your May 16 editorial "An Exclusive Economic Summit" was on target. The makeup of the G-8 -- the United States, Britain, Canada, Italy, Japan, France, Germany and Russia -- reflects neo-colonialism. It can meet annually for pontification, but the post-colonial nations of the so-called third world will not take it seriously. That the world's largest democracy, India, is not in this club makes the G-8 irrelevant to South Asia. That the world's largest nation, China, is excluded makes the G-8 irrelevant to most of the world. Surely Brazil, Latin America's largest nation, has more right to be in G-8 than Italy or Canada. 
 It's time to dismantle the prejudices of the colonial era and reconstitute G-8 to reflect the new millennium.

HEADLINE: Iran Smiles After U.S. Waives Sanctions Against 3 Companies

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, May 19

 BODY:
Iran today trumpeted a Clinton Administration decision to waive sanctions against three foreign companies that are doing business here as a moral victory for the European Union and one that should signal an end to American attempts to deter similar investments.
"The United States finally bowed down to pressure from the European Union," the official Iranian news agency declared in a statement that was reflected across the front pages of Iranian newspapers. 
 A Government communique called on the United States to repeal altogether the legislation that requires sanctions on companies that deal with Iran. The Administration waived that requirement in the case of French, Russian and Malaysian companies involved in a $2 billion energy deal.
Iranian officials otherwise withheld formal comment about the decision. But in private conversations, economists and executives have expressed hope that it might signal the abandonment of American attempts to enlist allies in the economic isolation of the Teheran Government.
Iran, and its energy sector in particular, have made clear their hunger for an influx of foreign investment. But for two years most European and other foreign companies have moved gingerly in negotiations with Iran, as they have watched to see how vigorously the United States would enforce legislation adopted by the Republican-led Congress. The laws require the President to penalize companies that invest more than $20 million a year in the oil and gas operations of Iran or Libya. The United States has singled out those countries, accusing them of a role in sponsoring terrorism and in opposing the Middle East peace effort.
In justifying the shift, American officials said they hoped to win greater cooperation from Europe and Russia in preventing Iran from sponsoring terrorism and acquiring weapons of mass destruction.
The waiver was granted to Total of France, Gazprom of Russia and Petronas of Malaysia, which joined last year in signing a $2 billion deal to develop the enormous South Pars gas field in the Persian Gulf.
Iranian officials have suggested that a more immediate result could be a flood of further investments from European companies that had been waiting to measure the United States reaction to the deal.
In Iran the decision could further boost the standing of President Mohammed Khatami, who, since winning election a year ago, has sought repeatedly to emphasize the importance of opening Iran to greater foreign investment. Mr. Khatami, a relative moderate, has been criticized by his conservative opponents for remarks perceived as too gentle toward the West, including the United States.
But Mr. Khatami may now be able to portray the removal of the barrier to the big energy investment as the first significant fruit of his policies of increased openness.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
An American at Pearson Shakes Up Status Quo

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 19

 BODY:
Pearson P.L.C. has been known as a somewhat dowdy, meandering, blue-blooded media group -- a conglomerate run more like an investment firm than an aggressive outfit. Its empire has been stitched together with interests as varied as the prestigious Financial Times, Madame Tussaud's famed Wax Museum, 60 percent of The Economist magazine, Pearson Television programming and Penguin, the consumer book publishing outfit, and a share in the investment bank Lazard Freres & Company.
"There were a lot of number fours and number fives but no number ones and twos," said Tim Rothwell, a media analyst here with Greig Middleton & Company. "It was a collection of trophies and prize assets that needed to be reinvented to raise shareholder value." 
 The announcement Sunday that Pearson would purchase most of Simon & Schuster's operations was a sign that the company was being prepared for a much tighter focus with an eye to the United States, a strategy shaped by an executive familiar with the American market -- Marjorie M. Scardino, whose eclectic career has given her such varied roles as small city lawyer to Pulitzer Prize winner to entrant to the upper tiers of the executive ranks in London, where few women have been.
Once approved by regulatory authorities, the purchase of Simon & Schuster's educational division will create a global publishing entity that ranks first in the United States. In describing the new venture Monday morning in a meeting with media analysts, the 50-year-old Mrs. Scardino said it would be "the world's leading education business."
Named chief executive 17 months ago, Mrs. Scardino set a goal, one close associate said, to realize double-digit annual growth for Pearson by refocusing the conglomerate's far-flung businesses into a sharper media orientation. She has, and as a result the company stock, which in August 1997 stood at 6.66 ($10.78), has since zoomed to 10.36 ($16.73), reached today.
Mrs. Scardino set out to get rid of some of the assets that could not achieve much more while consolidating others into strong businesses that lead in their field. The strategy, as outlined Monday by Mrs. Scardino, is to focus on specific areas of growth including trade publishing, educational publishing, and financial information, whether in print, such as The Financial Times, or in electronic forms. That included a $170 million investment to expand the United States circulation of The Financial Times to 100,000 from 30,000 -- an effort that is well under way. The Financial Times circulation in the United States has now risen to 55,000.
"For Pearson, the U.S. is a huge market and its appetite for business information is unrivaled anywhere," she said Monday in an interview. "We are appealing to people truly interested in international business."
There have been doubts. Pearson's bonds fell Monday, their price jumping 0.05 basis point amid concerns that the company had not set aside enough money to meet interest payments. Asked about this, Mrs. Scardino said she saw no problems. "We already have the borrowing set up at 7 percent interest and we have a strong balance sheet." She added that Pearson also had the option of selling some of its units that "will be better in some other's hands" to raise money.
Analysts have speculated that Mrs. Scardino, who has said she will only keep assets that are directly managed by Pearson, may move to sell its stake in "passive" investments over which the company has no management control such as its stake in The Economist or properties like Madame Tussaud's entertainment outfit, which in the words of a close associate "lacks scale, with little chance of really getting big."
Since she took over, Mrs. Scardino oversaw the sale of 700 million in assets ($ 1.1 billion). A former lawyer and newspaper publisher, Mrs. Scardino has compiled a impressive record of success, the most important of which was building up the circulation of The Economist in the United States during the nine years she served as chief executive of the Economist group. Before that, she published a small newspaper in Savannah, Ga., with her husband that won a Pulitzer Prize. She was also a partner in a law firm there.
Analysts say perhaps her best asset is her American identity and experience, having arrived in England without the burden of emotional baggage that has saddled previous managers of the conglomerate she now runs. She served notice that there would be no sacred cows and that nonperforming assets would go.
She has also installed two other Americans on the management team of six that runs Pearson. They are Michael Lynton, who manages Penguin, and Peter Jovanovich, the chief executive of Addison Wesley Longman, who was named Sunday to head the merger of Addison and Simon & Schuster's education division.
Mrs. Scardino and her team immediately set some high goals for the new merger: annual cost savings of $130 million by the year 2000 through "back office synergies" involving production, distribution, central management, property and administration. It was not clear what kind of layoffs might be in store, although some analysts expected that some similar imprints would be folded together or eliminated.
Her stronger reputation these days comes after a somewhat difficult start. The sensationalist -- as well as the serious -- British press described her, among other things, as "an unknown entity" and "not-a-big-hitter." It was enough to bring the company's shares down 2.4 percent in October 1996, when her appointment was made public.
For her part, the serene, somewhat shy executive suggested that her profile would remain indeed so low "as to be nonexistent." Monday, she described her approach as one that was military-like in its thrust: "Have a good plan, execute it decisively and do it today."
Since she burst onto the London corporate scene she has steadfastly refused to talk about her gender, personal life or family and has rarely granted interviews that departed from discussing business. Her husband, Albert, who is a freelance journalist and a former New York Times reporter, and her three children have remained completely out of the limelight.
Associates said Mrs. Scardino had initiated an engaging internal communications system, sending a "Dear Everyone" letter to Pearson's 18,000 employees. Monday morning, for instance, she sent an explanation of the Simon & Schuster deal.
Asked if she was pleased by the better response she had received in the press, she said: "It's not personal. They think we have done good things and produced some results. That's all."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Dip on Fed Inaction

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended slightly lower yesterday after the Federal Reserve, as expected, left interest rates unchanged.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32, to 102 22/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, edged up to 5.93 percent, from 5.92 percent on Monday. There was little reaction to the Fed's announcement at 2:15 P.M. 
 Until last month, many bond market participants were confident that the central bank would not move to raise short-term interest rates anytime soon. But that changed, and there is now some anxiety looking ahead to the the next meeting of Fed policy makers, the Federal Open Market Committee, in July.
"With signs of a slowing economy increasing, inflation still calm, the dollar still strong and Asia still in turmoil, the Fed decided to wait until its next powwow to see if an economic slackening actually materializes and thus provides the rationale to continue to adhere to a 5.5 percent Federal funds rate," said Donald Fine, the chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management.
However, he said, "in the absence of a significant moderation in business activity, many on the F.O.M.C. will want to be pre-emptive and tighten at the July 1 meeting because of fears that the extremely low rate of unemployment will exacerbate already budding wage pressures and lead directly to increasing inflationary tendencies in the overall economy."
Mr. Fine also said economic statistics over the next six weeks would be crucial to the Fed and would therefore come under intense scrutiny by bond investors.
The Government released its April housing starts report yesterday and reaffirmed what the market already knows, that the housing industry remained strong. Consequently, the housing report had little effect on the market.
Few analysts expect the market to move sharply this week. With a long Memorial Day holiday weekend looming, it is not likely that bondholders will make any large moves or make commitments.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Arms to Plowshares;
Cleaning Up Financially by Cleaning Up Oak Ridge

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
When the Energy Department looks around Oak Ridge, its huge weapons enclave some 20 miles outside Knoxville, Tenn., it sees a truly daunting cleanup problem. There are centrifuges, reactors, pumps, hundreds of acres of buildings and soil, all bearing troublesome radioactive memories of the roles they played in building nuclear bombs.
BNFL Inc. looks at the same stuff and sees $50 million worth of metals it can sell as scrap. The East Tennessee Materials and Energy Corporation sees a place to set up a waste-treatment center without fouling anyone's back yard. Blue Ridge Development sees a place where it can set up shop at a dirt-cheap rent. Bioneutrics Inc. sees a way to treat brain cancer. 
 "It seemed a crime to bury something that could be used for a purpose like this," said George F. Dilworth, president of Bioneutrics, which is building a cancer treatment center around a small nuclear reactor that the Government estimates would cost $8.5 million to dismantle, decontaminate and bury.
Apparently, lots of people agree. The disparate visions of Oak Ridge are melding, as a growing reindustrialization program lets companies clean up financially by cleaning up Oak Ridge.
Although each arrangement is different, in essence companies like Bioneutrics are bartering their services in return for materials or space. Typically, the companies agree to decontaminate a specified portion of Oak Ridge. They return cleaned-up classified equipment to the Energy Department for disposal. But they get to keep the nonclassified materials and equipment on their site, and they get to occupy the space at a deeply discounted rent.
"This program has moved up the decontamination and re-use of these buildings by at least two generations," said Robert Brown, Oak Ridge's operations asset manager.
It is also saving the Government hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup costs and creating jobs in an area that seemed poised for economic devastation.
Not that everyone is delighted. The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union, which represents many Oak Ridge workers, has tried, so far unsuccessfully, to force companies to give its laid-off workers first crack at new jobs. And while environmental officials in Washington say they have not paid close attention to the project, Environmental Protection Agency officials in Atlanta have expressed worries that the Energy Department will divert funds from cleanup to marketing.
Still, advocates seem to far outnumber critics. "It's win-win all around," said Joe W. Anderson, chairman of East Tennessee Materials. The company is cleaning up and re-using some 85,000 square feet of space, at a $2 million saving to the Energy Department, and is employing some 200 displaced Oak Ridge workers to boot. "The community gets jobs, the D.O.E. gets free cleanup, we get to resell whatever material we can salvage, and we get a place to set up shop," Mr. Anderson said.
If Oak Ridge were a private facility, industry would probably run the other way. It is a quintessential "brownfields" property -- land or buildings with a legacy of hazardous contamination. Companies often shy away from such facilities, fearing they will be held liable if the actual culprit in the contamination goes out of business, or otherwise escapes culpability for future harm.
Those are unlikely scenarios at Oak Ridge, a vast complex that was carved out of farmland during World War II, provided enriched uranium for the first atom bomb, and turned out components for nuclear weapons for years afterward. "The isotopes we used are unique to us, and there's no way 20 years from now that we could or would shift responsibility to anyone else," Mr. Brown said.
Oak Ridge probably could not afford to clean up on its own. Its budget, $3.2 billion in 1993, is now $1.9 billion and falling. The work force, 19,300 strong in 1993, is down to 14,500, and heading for no more than 7,500 within a few years. And Oak Ridge faces a domino effect: less money means fewer people means more shuttered facilities means more idle plants in need of cleaning up.
Other Energy Department weapons plants face similar budget cuts. Those that must remain open -- Sandia, in Santa Fe, N.M., which must maintain existing weapons stockpiles, is a notable example -- are bringing in extra money by letting companies use their people and facilities for industrial research. Those with particularly severe contamination -- like Rocky Flats, near Denver -- are cleaning up and shutting down. And a few facilities are experimenting with what Robert W. DeGrasse Jr., an Energy Department director, calls "the perpetual motion approach" -- they clean up some space, lease it out, and use the lease revenue to clean up other space.
But only Oak Ridge seems suited to a huge clean-it-and-keep-it approach. The gaseous diffusion process that it used to enrich uranium yields a lot of residual nickel, which has a high value on the scrap metal market. And uranium presents a less formidable health hazard and decontamination problem than do plutonium, tritium or other elements used in weapons.
"Sometimes, you can decontaminate an entire machine with simple solvent, hand-wipe, and good old elbow grease," said Joel W. Garber, vice president of American Technologies Inc., a $20 million engineering services company that is decontaminating 125,000 square feet and 200 machines at Oak Ridge.
In many ways, Oak Ridge is wiping away its history with similar ease. It recently changed the name of its old K-25 uranium enrichment facility, a 706-acre complex with 118 buildings, to the East Tennessee Technology Park. Its goal is to turn it into a self-sustaining industrial park by 2010.
The first lease was signed in May 1996, and 45 percent of the space is already in the hands of the private sector. One reason for the speed: with Congress's blessing, Oak Ridge circumvented the mountains of red tape that would normally accompany any industry-government deal by handling all transactions through the Community Re-use Organization of East Tennessee, or Croet, a nonprofit private-sector group set up expressly as Oak Ridge's real estate marketing arm.
"It would take the D.O.E. two years to do what we can do in a few months," said Lawrence Young, president of Croet (pronounced CROW-ette).
Start-up companies can get going even more quickly. Blue Ridge Development, a local real estate developer, has taken 54,000 square feet of already clean space, and is subdividing it to use as an incubator for fledgling companies.
Dan Barnett, a Blue Ridge partner, says the leases can be approved in weeks. "Someone who just needs a few hundred square feet doesn't want to wait for all kinds of negotiations and approvals," he said. "Let's face it, the private sector just knows how to move quicker."
In lieu of cleanup responsibilities, Blue Ridge gave Croet a check for $250,000 in advance rent. It will also share some of its rental revenues with Croet after two years.
Oak Ridge is not by any means getting away scot-free on its cleanup bill. In by far the biggest contract signed so far, it has agreed to pay BNFL Inc., a subsidiary of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd., $238 million over six years to clean up three contaminated buildings, comprising five million square feet of floor space.
BNFL, which has dismantled gaseous diffusion plants in England -- and which, in fact, has been decontaminating waste for commercial nuclear plants in the United States for three years -- calculates that there are at least 130,000 tons of copper, nickel and other metals it can salvage. It also figures it can resell a few electrical transformers and other pieces of equipment, particularly in developing countries.
John R. Smith, senior vice president of BNFL, which is based in Fairfax, Va., estimates that the company can get $50 million for the cleaned-up materials, bringing its total take to $288 million. That's about a quarter of what the Energy Department estimates it would cost to do the cleanup itself -- but then, Mr. Smith notes, that estimate builds in the cost of government bureaucracy and inefficiency.
"Their mind-set is making weapons, not decommissioning them," he said. "We have the experience, and at $288 million we can make a modest, sensible profit."
BNFL will hire some 300 former Oak Ridge workers to help with the cleanup and will turn the decontaminated space back to Croet to lease to companies without cleanup skills. That, in turn, will create a rental revenue stream that Croet can use to pay for even more cleanup.
While BNFL is plumbing the lion's share of metallic riches, smaller companies are being dazzled as well. American Technologies originally leased some 45,000 square feet in a relatively uncontaminated maintenance shop at Oak Ridge, with the idea of turning decontaminated metal scrap into containers for low-level radioactive waste. But soon after it moved in, it realized that the huge machine tool shop next door presented more lucrative opportunities.
So it stopped fabricating boxes -- "We realized we couldn't compete in price with cold rolled steel anyway," Mr. Garber recalled -- and agreed to decontaminate the whole area. In return, it will pocket anything it gets for the tools. The Energy Department estimates that the equipment is worth as much as $1.5 million, and Mr. Garber, who has arranged to auction it off in June, says he can get even more.
Already, the new Oak Ridge tenants are learning to use one another to maximize their profits. BNFL and American Technologies are joining forces to look for used-equipment markets in Southeast Asia. And Materials and Chemistry Laboratory Inc., an environmental testing company, is looking for a partner to help it clean up an underused Oak Ridge laboratory that it wants to use. The company wants no part of cleanup responsibilities, so it is looking to barter free laboratory testing services to a company that will do the cleanup.
"We'd pay maybe $2.35 for space that's worth $5 or $6 a square foot, so trading for the cleanup gives us a real bargain," said Barry A. Stephenson, the company's president.
Such side deals are just fine with Oak Ridge and Croet. Indeed, anything that gets Oak Ridge cleaned up more quickly sits well with them. Croet just leased clean space to Dynamic Tooling Systems, a tool-and-die company that will employ 30 local people, but that did not want to clean space itself. And Mr. Young is planning to build a conventional industrial park on 1,000 acres of uncontaminated farmland nearby.
"This area needs jobs," Mr. Young said. "And cleanup and jobs are inextricably linked."

HEADLINE: James C. McIntyre, Arts Executive, 49

 BODY:
James Carroll McIntyre, a fund-raiser for the arts and a former executive at Carnegie Hall and the Big Apple Circus, died on Friday at his home in Saylorsburg, Pa. He was 49 and also had a home in Greenwich Village.
The cause was not known, said Gary Dunning, executive director of the Big Apple Circus and Mr. McIntyre's successor in that position. 
 Mr. McIntyre was executive director from 1989 until 1995, when he resigned after testing positive for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Since then he had worked as an advocate for people with AIDS and as a consultant for arts organizations.
A native of Sanford, N.C., he graduated from Duke University in 1971. After graduation, he remained in Durham, N.C., and helped found the Durham Arts Center, serving as its executive director at a time when it played a pivotal role in revitalizing the downtown.
In 1971 he was named director of the corporate fund at Carnegie Hall. In that role, he oversaw the $60 million Campaign for Carnegie Hall, which financed the restoration and renovation of the auditorium. He was appointed director of development in 1985 and supervised the opening of the refurbished Carnegie Hall the following year.
He became executive director of the Big Apple Circus in New York, a popular not-for-profit performing arts center, in 1989. At his death he was a member of its board.
He is survived by his companion, Gary Rosard.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Regains Some Ground After Three-Session Decline

BYLINE: Bridge News 

 BODY:
Stocks closed slightly higher yesterday, rebounding from three days of declines as Federal Reserve policy makers left short-term interest rates unchanged.
Blue-chip stocks faltered late in the session, and the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 3.74 points, at 9,054.65, retreating from a gain of 62 points. 
 The market opened modestly higher across the board and held onto those gains into the early afternoon as investors took a cautious stance ahead of the Fed's much-awaited announcement. News that the Fed left rates unchanged failed to ignite a rally, and a flurry of sell programs in the last two hours of trading sharply cut the market's big gains as investors locked in profits.
Software makers, drug stocks and financial-related issues posted some of the biggest gains, while semiconductor companies retreated.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 14.25 points, to 1,845.87, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 3.70, to 1,109.52.
Aiding the Dow, Disney advanced 1 1/4, to 110 15/16, and J. P. Morgan climbed 1 1/8, to 129 11/16.
In technology, shares of Dell Computer extended recent gains, ending up 3/32 at 94 19/32, as investors anticipated the release of the personal computer giant's quarterly results after the close. Dell reported first- quarter results of 44 cents a share, which beat analysts' estimates.
High-flying Internet-related issues recovered some of their recent losses with Yahoo up 1 19/32 at 118 5/32 and Excite up 1 3/8 at 61.
Financial-related issues also ended broadly higher. Chase Manhattan rose 2 5/8, to 144 7/8 Citicorp climbed 1 1/2, to 155 1/2, and Republic National Bank edged up 5/8, to 132 5/8.
Oil companies finished higher amid rising crude prices. Mobil gained 7/8, to 81 3/8; Unocal climbed 13/16, to 37 13/16, and Pennzoil edged up 5/8, to 60 15/16.
Drug stocks extended their gains from Monday's rally following news of a breakthrough in the treatment of breast cancer. Warner-Lambert ended up 4 1/4 at 198 1/4, Bristol-Myers Squibb ended up 2 1/16 at 111 3/16, and Pfizer ended up 23/16 at 112 7/8.
Bucking the uptrend, semiconductor companies ended slightly weaker, with Texas Instruments down 7/8 at 58 5/16, Motorola down7/8 at 55 5/8, and Micron Technology down 1/2 at 26 1/2.
Airlines surrendered their gains after rallying earlier this morning. The AMR Corporation, parent company of American Airlines, dropped 2 1/16, to 145 7/8; the UAL Corporation, parent company of United Airlines, climbed 3/4, to 80, and US Airways fell 3/16 to 65.

HEADLINE: China Issue Resists Usual White House Defenses

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
The White House scandal-control brigade has answered many a call, from Arkansas real estate deals gone sour to the Paula Corbin Jones lawsuit, and has always found a way to mount a vigorous counteroffensive.
But the silence emanating from the White House this week says officials believe that reports of a "China connection" are different. Even James Carville, the most combative and vociferous of President Clinton's defenders, has been struck all but dumb. There is, it seems, no ready response to the accusations that a Chinese military officer sent nearly $100,000 to Democratic campaign accounts at the same time Mr. Clinton was overruling his own bureaucracy to relax export controls on the transfer of satellite technology to Beijing. 
 The disclosures of the past week are of a wholly new sort than the other accusations Mr. Clinton has faced in his five and a half years as President. This is not about business deals in the murky Arkansas past or the President's extracurricular activities. In this case, the Justice Department is investigating whether Mr. Clinton's official acts as President altered American foreign policy and affected the nation's security.
This campaign finance inquiry is also distinct from many of the investigations because it bears more directly on Vice President Al Gore's political fortunes than on the President's personal reputation. It was Mr. Gore who appeared at a Buddhist temple in Los Angeles to raise campaign cash in 1996, and Mr. Gore who has positioned himself as the high-tech candidate for the 21st century. Mr. Clinton has no more campaigns to run; Mr. Gore has at least one.
Mr. Gore faces added scrutiny, as well, because he has for many years spoken of the dangers of proliferation of weapon and missile technology. One White House official said that he expected Republicans to try to exploit the inquiry into transfer of satellite technology to China to tarnish Mr. Gore's image.
Having survived the dismissals of the White House travel office staff, the case of the purloined F.B.I. files, the sprawling Whitewater inquiry, the Jones suit and all its tawdry offspring, White House officials profess confidence that the President can weather the latest squall.
But there is a difference in the tone of the responses to the revelations of the Administration's dealings with China. Absent are the personal attacks on the President's accusers and the cries that the accusations are the product of mere partisan politics.
Instead, officials couch their denials in the narrowest possible terms or offer justifications of actions that are not in question. The official White House response to reports that a Chinese-American businessman, Johnny Chung, transferred almost $100,000 from an officer of China's army to the Democratic National Committee is that no one knew the true source of the money and that the money was returned when it was learned it came from overseas.
Officials also insist that the Chinese campaign cash has not bought a change in national policy on satellite exports. The policy switch -- made over the objection of then-Secretary of State Warren Christopher -- was to improve American "competitiveness" and to "streamline" bureaucracy, officials said.
During last year's campaign-finance hearings, White House spokesmen insisted that the Administration had not traded policy benefits for big donations. Now, with evidence of a major policy shift toward China, the Administration is saying that the President did not make the change because of campaign contributions.
Republicans in Congress are preparing to hold hearings on the matter in June, just before Mr. Clinton is to travel to Beijing for the first United States-China meeting on Chinese territory since the deadly crackdown on democratic protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Some Republicans are already calling on Mr. Clinton to delay or cancel the trip, which the White House has resisted.
But if the hearings produce new evidence of Chinese efforts to tamper with the 1996 election or to sway American policy on technology transfers, it could undermine the President's visit, which is supposed to focus on trade and democratic liberalization in China.
A certain sign that this matter is being handled differently is the absence of the bark of Mr. Carville. With no Republicans or alleged anti-Clinton conspirators to attack, Mr. Carville, in an interview, fell back on a generic defense of the President. "In no way, shape or form do I think the President or anyone else swapped out policy for money," he said.
White House lawyers and public relations officials have discussed the new evidence of Chinese contributions at morning meetings since late last week but have not devised a strategy for responding to it.
In the ordinary course of events, the White House or its surrogates would deny the accusations, attack the integrity or credibility of the accusers and try to change the subject. The approach has served Mr. Clinton well over the years.
But there has been no counter-attack this time, in part because the disclosures come from within the Administration, which has held a largely secret internal battle for years over how much to help the Chinese Government in improving its satellite-launching ability.
Mr. Clinton overruled both the Justice and State Departments, not to reward campaign contributors from China or major American aerospace companies, he insists, but to assure the economical launching of American communications satellites and to foster economic growth and political openness in China.
In brief remarks to reporters on Sunday, Mr. Clinton answered with a curt "no" when asked if he or anyone in his Administration had made decisions because of the influence of Chinese money.
Prodded further, he said: "First of all, all the foreign policy decisions we made were made based on what we believed -- I and the rest of my Administration -- were in the interests of the American people. Now if someone tried to influence them, that's a different issue and there ought to be an investigation into whether that happened. And I would support that."

HEADLINE: Royal Ahold Set to Acquire Giant Food

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
Royal Ahold N.V. extended its reach into the American supermarket business yesterday with a $2.6 billion deal to acquire the Giant Food Inc. supermarket chain.
The acquisition would strengthen Ahold's position as the biggest foreign owner of an American grocery store business and make it the fourth-largest supermarket operator in this country. It also reflects the rapid consolidation in the industry, where companies are trying to create dominant regional chains. By broadening their geographic scope, Ahold and other companies hope to benefit from greater purchasing clout, more efficient distribution and economies of scale in areas such as marketing. 
 The deal announced yesterday added a 177-store chain with revenues of $4.2 billion to Ahold's growing domestic franchise and ranks it just behind No. 3, American Stores. Ahold, based in the Netherlands, operates 830 domestic supermarkets, including Stop and Shop of Quincy, Mass. The United States stores contribute $14.3 billion to Ahold's $26 billion in annual revenues.
"This represents a significant opportunity for Ahold to basically take a well-positioned U.S. food chain and bring it to a new level," said Edward Comeau, an analyst who follows supermarket companies for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
With the purchase of Giant, which is based in Landover, Md., Ahold added 164 stores in Virginia, the District of Columbia and Maryland as well as 13 Super G stores in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware. The 28,000-employee chain, founded in 1936 as a single store, will retain its name, headquarters and management team.
"Geographically, it is the perfect, natural fit to our existing operations along the Eastern Seaboard," said Robert Zwartendijk, Ahold's chief executive officer and president of United States operations. "Strategically, Giant adds critical mass and highly developed food retailing expertise."
Ahold will pay $43.50 a share for Giant, or about $2.6 billion, a 15 percent premium over its closing price Monday, the day before the acquisition was announced. The shares rose $5 yesterday to close at $42.68. Ahold's shares, traded on the New York Stock Exchange rose $2, to $34.1875.
Sainsbury, Britain's second-largest food retailer, is considered the loser in the transaction for having sold its stake in a chain it had also been eyeing for a takeover. Sainsbury, which operates the Shaw's chain, is also attempting to push further into the American grocery business through acquisitions.
Sainsbury officials minimized the significance of Ahold's deal, saying that "control of Giant was a desirable but not essential element of our U.S. growth strategy."
The loss for Sainsbury, however, reflected the rapid pace at which supermarket competitors were moving to fortify potential strongholds in regions where they are under-represented. In fact, analysts said yesterday that they expected both companies to keep looking for targets, with Ahold likely to concentrate in the West since it now has a solid base in the East.
"Companies find that the easiest way to grow is to consolidate," said George Thompson, an analyst who follows supermarket companies for Prudential Securities. "They don't run into the problem of adding square footage in a market, which makes the business all the more aggressive."
In addition, after having significantly cut costs in recent years, grocery chains are now having difficulty improving their results through belt-tightening. With a leaner cost structure, more are in a position to buy competitors they could not afford a few years ago.
The growth strategy is attractive for Ahold and Sainsbury in particular because there is little room to grow through acquisitions in their own countries, where the markets are already controlled by national chains.
"It is certainly not a national business in the U.S. at this point and time," Mr. Thompson said. He added that except for Kroger, Safeway Inc. and few others, "the list in terms of size greatly diminishes."
That is rapidly changing, though, led by the market leaders' race to increase their store count and revenues by snapping up each other's businesses. Other such deals include the merger last year of Fred Meyer Inc. and Smith's Food and Drug Centers Inc. and the acquisition a year earlier of Vons Companies by Safeway.
The latest deal is likely to be followed by other mergers this year, analysts said, with Ahold continuing to look for its next target. The company operates 3,200 supermarkets and specialty stores in 17 countries and employs 220,000 workers.

HEADLINE: Decline in Gun Violence Bypasses Philadelphia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
For all the years he spent as a criminal and a drug user, Jose Rojas never saw the kinds of things now taking place in working-class neighborhoods like his in north Philadelphia.
"And it's going from bad to worse," Mr. Rojas, 47, said recently, sitting in the New Creation Church in Kensington, a high-crime neighborhood where he works as a lay evangelist. "During the time I was out there as a teen-ager, then in my 20's, it was relatively difficult to get weapons. Now? Kids 11, 12, 13 years old -- they're packing .45-caliber semi-automatics, Uzis, magnums, you name it." 
 And they are not afraid to use them.
While the rates of homicide and violent crime are declining in many of the country's largest cities, they are holding firm in Philadelphia. Although a slight dip over the first four months of this year has given officials some hope, the number of homicides has hovered steadily at around 400 a year for nearly a decade. A majority of the deaths were caused by high-powered handguns, and a majority of the weapons were wielded by people under 23.
The problem has become so intolerable that Mayor Edward Rendell has appointed a deputy mayor -- dubbed the gun czar -- to coordinate local and Federal efforts to stem the flow of weapons in the city. And in a move modeled after the actions against tobacco companies, he has threatened to sue gun manufacturers to recoup some of the money spent by the city's hospitals to treat gunshot victims.
Officials say they think one of the biggest factors in the high homicide rate is a 1995 gun law that has removed some of the discretion the police department had to deny permits for carrying concealed weapons.
The new law, they say, has contributed to a boom in gun buying here that has given Pennsylvania the distinction of having more licensed carriers of concealed weapons than any other state.
The legal age for buying a gun in Pennsylvania is 18, and most permit holders are legitimate gun owners. But law-enforcement experts here say that the state measure opened the door to a vibrant black market in handgun sales, in which buyers for whom routine background checks pose no problem can act as straw-man buyers and resell the guns on the street for handsome profits.
Furthermore, officials say, the sheer number of guns on the street in Philadelphia means more weapons are finding their way into the hands of young people.
Before the Uniform Firearms Action of 1995 was passed, state lawmakers recognized Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's largest city, as a special case on gun issues because of its persistently high crime rates. The police department had the right to turn down a request for a concealed weapons permit if the applicant could not demonstrate "a reasonable need." In 1994, just 1,500 permits were issued.
Over all, the new law strengthened the application process by requiring deeper background checks. But after the exception for Philadelphia was eliminated, the number of permits issued soared, to about 11,500 in 1996, said Richard A. Zapille, the Deputy Mayor appointed to lead the gun control efforts.
"That was a real blow to our efforts here," Mr. Rendell said of the gun law. "We weren't doing great before, but after the law passed, the number of permits issued to carry a concealed weapon was unbelievable."
Mr. Rendell appointed a handgun violence task force four years ago when it became evident that his city was failing to keep pace with the rest of the nation in reducing violent crime. But efforts to slow the mayhem have not made any appreciable difference in some of the city's poorest neighborhoods, despite the slight dip in the homicide rate for the first four months of this year. Guns continue to flow in, and landscapes of abandoned factories, rotting houses and trash-strewn streets only make the life of a gun-toting drug dealer seem that much more glamorous to impressionable youngsters.
"Young children walking to school see these guys all in gold, wearing rings on their fingers and $150 sneakers," said Mr. Rojas, who spent 13 months in prison on drug charges. "They are influenced just by the way they look. They think, 'I want to be like him.' They have money. They have expensive sneakers and they have guns."
A study conducted by the task force found that of 273 people charged with murder in a 40-month period through March 1997, 171 of them -- more than 62 percent -- were 22 or younger.
That is far above the national average. In 1995, the last full year for which Federal data is available, the Department of Justice found that among the 16,701 people across the country arrested for murder or non-negligent manslaughter, just 6,556 of them -- 39.8 percent -- were 22 years old or younger.
In the same year, Philadelphia's homicide rate of 30.7 per 100,000 residents was nearly twice as high as New York City's 16.1 per 100,000.
Members of the Mayor's task force, as well as community leaders like Mr. Rojas who work with them, agree that much of the reason for the pervasiveness of handguns is the same as in other cities -- drugs.
"The drugs begot guns, and they're both so entrenched now that good people feel the need to carry guns," Mr. Zapille said in a recent drive through Kensington and other low-income neighborhoods.
But Philadelphia has labored under additional burdens: The city was slow to coordinate crime-fighting with community outreach programs. Deep losses in its manufacturing base made Philadelphia's economic recovery less rapid than that of other cities, and poverty is deeply entrenched in many neighborhoods. Tougher gun laws in surrounding states have made purchases here easier by comparison.
Among the six states that border Pennsylvania, four -- New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland -- give local law-enforcement officials the discretion Philadelphia once had to deny permits to carry a concealed weapon to anyone they think does not have a legitimate reason. In West Virginia, the police have no such discretion. Ohio does not permit carrying a concealed weapon.
To quantify the magnitude of the problem in Philadelphia, the police department and the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms conducted an intensive study of trafficking in all type of guns last year. The results included these findings:
*In almost half of the legitimate sales, involving 38,338 guns, two or more were bought at the same time. Almost 8 percent of the guns, 3,046, were bought in purchases of 10 or more.
*The police traced 2,865 guns recovered in arrests and found that 69 percent were bought in Pennsylvania, the highest percentage ever recorded, and a 10 percent increase over 1996. They also found that 53 percent were bought in Philadelphia, an 11 percent increase over 1996.
*Firepower on the street is rising among the youngest offenders. Of 342 guns recovered from juveniles at the time of arrest, 65 percent were semi-automatic weapons, a 13 percent increase over the relative number of comparable weapons recovered in 1996. Twenty-six percent were revolvers, a 12 percent decrease.
Defenders of the state law, which was strongly supported by State Senator Vincent J. Fumo, a Democrat from Philadelphia, argue that problems in Philadelphia stem not from the law itself but from lax enforcement of its provisions, some of which are unique among the states that allow residents to carry concealed weapons. In addition to denying a permit to anyone with a felony conviction or mental health problem, the norm for most states, Pennsylvania is now alone in banning the sale of guns to anyone who had a police record as a juvenile and to anyone classified as a "habitual drunken driver."
And starting in July, the law requires any private sale of a gun to be conducted before a licensed dealer or local law-enforcement officer.
"We chose to focus on the potential gun owner," said Christopher Craig, legal counsel to Senator Fumo. "When the law is aggressively enforced, it will have a dramatic impact in the state."
But Mr. Rendell and others scoff at the notion that those involved in illegal street sales will suddenly comply with the state gun law.
"All I know is what we're facing on the street," said Thomas L. Stankiewicz, an agent with the Federal firearms agency in Philadelphia. "We've had some success. But guns are always in demand, and the supply is readily accessible."
Philadelphia police officials said that more aggressive strategies in arresting people for illegal gun possession helped bring down the homicide rate for the first third of the year, to a projected year-end total of 321. And officials in other city agencies say new programs of community outreach and intervention are also disrupting cycles of violence.
But in Mr. Rojas's neighborhood, progress is slow. Children walking to school fear walking the blocks where gun sellers operate, he said, and on many nights, gunfire punctuates the silence.
"Sometimes it sounds like Vietnam around my house," Mr. Rojas said. "The other night I heard two different-caliber guns go off. I didn't know what was going on, but I turned to my wife and said, 'Maybe we'll read about it in the papers tomorrow.' "

HEADLINE: Fed Lets Rates Stand, Fearing Harm to Asia

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve declined once again today to increase short-term interest rates, apparently determining that the threat of inflation remained remote and that the latest phase of the worsening Asian economic crisis might be exacerbated by any rate rise now in the United States.
Several weeks ago, there were hints that the Federal Reserve might be leaning toward increasing interest rates sometime soon. But a number of recent indicators, including continued low inflation and the announcement this morning of a modest decline in the starts of new housing, have lessened immediate fears of an overheating of the economy, market analysts said. 
 The decision to leave rates unchanged, at least for now, was hardly a surprise on Wall Street, where many leading economists had predicted that the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which meets regularly to review interest-rate policy, would again sit on its hands. The markets yawned in response: The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up 3.74 points, at 9,054.65, after having risen 62 points earlier in the day.
While no one knows for sure what motivated the Federal Reserve's decision, its policy makers had reason to worry that an increase now would only worsen problems in Asia. In recent weeks, there have been signs of renewed economic trouble in Thailand and South Korea, and the images of Jakarta in flames last week rekindled fear of a contagion effect that would discourage further investment in Asia.
A rate rise in the United States would likely have accelerated such a development, as investors moved to take advantage of higher returns in this country on short-term notes and bills.
"There was every risk that the United States could have exacerbated the Asian turmoil" with a rate increase, said Sung Won Sohn, vice president and chief economist of the Norwest Corporation, a $90 billion financial services manager. "And it is clear that American exports are down and imports are up, which lessens the fear that there will be continued shortages in the labor market."
Following the usual practice at its eight-times-a-year meetings, the Federal Open Market Committee issued a terse statement this afternoon simply announcing what time the session had ended and disclosing no details of its discussions.
Two days from now, it will publish details of its March 31 session, where it decided to adopt what in the jargon of central bankers is called a "tightening bias," a tilt toward higher interest rates to slow the economy.
News of such leanings in monetary policy rarely leak out of the Federal Reserve. But one theory popular today among Fed-watchers was that officials at the central bank might have been frustrated that the markets were not getting the message that rates might have to rise, and were trying to get their message across.
Since then, the crosscurrents of economic data have grown a bit more confusing.
The logic in favor of an increase in the rates the central bank controls -- particularly the overnight Federal funds rate, which determines borrowing costs across the economy -- had focused on fears that a rise in inflation was inevitable and that the United States was headed into a dangerous "asset bubble" as the stock market continued to rise.
Those urging an increase pointed to the remarkably low national unemployment rate, which recently fell to 4.3 percent. At that level, they argued, it was only a matter of time before wages rise and set off inflation throughout the economy. Some were also unsettled by an increase in the money supply.
But on the other side of the argument are a range of indicators suggesting that the economy is slowing by itself, in which case a rate increase could result months from now in turning a gradual slowdown into a severe one.
"When you look at the economic data that points to weakening sectors of the U.S. expansion -- housing, industrial production, trade -- and the dollar's recent strength, you come to the conclusion that a decision by the Fed to leave rates unchanged seemed a foregone conclusion," said John Lipsky, chief economist of Chase Manhattan Bank.
"If the Fed had raised rates today, there would have been widespread uncertainty about exactly what factors they were paying attention to," Mr. Lipsky added. "The implication would have been that if rates were hiked with so little convincing evidence that such a move was necessary, investors would have wondered if more could be on the way."
"More than Asian markets would have been unsettled," he said.
And there are hints of economic softness in the United States. Today, the Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell 2.3 percent last month, to an annual rate of 1.538 million units. Many analysts had expected a small gain. Housing starts also fell in March.
As recently as last fall, there was talk of a need for the Fed to lower interest rates because of fears that the effects of the Asian crisis -- chiefly, deflation and a surge of low-cost exports to the American market -- could harm manufacturers here. Those fears proved overblown.
By early this year, the Fed was welcoming the effects of the Asian crisis. The low-cost imports, it turned out, helped to contain inflation and relieve pressure on American companies that were having a difficult time finding skilled workers.
Now the Asian calculus is beginning to change again. The Fed is evidently worried about fueling the flight of capital out of Asia by raising rates. If more money shifted across the Pacific, it could worsen the state of nearly insolvent banks in Asian countries.
At the same time, it is becoming apparent that Asian economies, which showed some signs of revival a few months ago, may now be enduring a second wave of trouble. China's economic growth is slowing, and Japan is caught in a deflationary spiral, with consumers refusing to spend. The effect on American exports is becoming more acute, and inventories in this country are rising. The yen has resumed falling against the dollar, making American goods more expensive and thus less competitive in Japan.
Weighing against those concerns is the fear that the Federal Reserve may be allowing the United States to develop an asset bubble similar to the one that burst in Japan at the beginning of the 90's. The best way to prick that bubble, some economists argue, is to raise rates now -- before it is too late. But so far at least, the Fed appears to consider that danger relatively remote.

HEADLINE: Shooting Spotlights Troubled Side of a Brooklyn Mall

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
In yesterday's summertime sun, the Fulton Mall buzzed to the tune of money: as the third busiest shopping district in the city, it trails only Herald Square and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Each day, more than 120,000 people visit the strip, spending more than $1 million at the 200 stores between Adams Street and Flatbush Avenue.
"This is where the money flows," said a teen-ager from Bedford-Stuyvesant who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
 But on Monday night, the mall's more troubled side became apparent, when eight people were shot on the pedestrian plaza. The shooting illustrated a side of the mall that obscures its financial success: in many ways, it is a tawdry, tattered commercial strip where a hint of menace can hang in the air, and it has failed to keep up with the resurgence of downtown Brooklyn all around it.
Recently, such large stores as Woolworth's and Nobody Beats the Wiz have closed, and the strip's movie theater has been shuttered for two years. Long gone are the days when such department stores as Martin's, Namm's, May's and Korvette's made the shopping strip a rival of Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.
"It's the one feature of downtown Brooklyn that hasn't kept up with the times," Kenneth Adams, president of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, said of the mall. "They're totally out of step with all the positive developments."
Since 1990, the areas around the mall have been brimming with new economic activity. The Metrotech office complex has added 16,000 jobs and 10 new buildings; the four downtown colleges have had substantial enrollment increases, and a dozen blocks to the south, Atlantic Center, a large retail complex, has opened, with other complexes being built nearby. This July, the first hotel in more than 60 years in downtown Brooklyn is scheduled to open blocks away from the mall.
Businessmen and their representatives suggest that simple economics keeps the mall, originally created as an urban redevelopment project by the Lindsay administration, from changing for the better. Thomas Onorato, general manager of the Gallery at Metrotech, just off the mall, said the national chains usually want to pay rent of $20 to $30 a square foot, compared with the $90 to $120 a square foot that property owners on the Fulton Mall are able to get from independent jewelry and electronics stores that are less concerned with the mall's overall image.
At large suburban malls, one developer usually owns the entire project. This means he can offer a department store cheap rent, and get much higher rent from smaller tenants. But with the Fulton Mall split among many landlords, a single owner has less incentive to sacrifice higher rents for a better image.
The Fulton Mall Improvement Association says it is working to change this. Lou Carbonetti, executive director since August, said he has bluntly told owners that the appearance of their buildings' facades are "disgusting," and some have made improvements as a result. He has also gently urged some landlords to seek tonier tenants. "That's where you're walking a very fine line," he said.
Though Monday night's shooting may raise concerns about safety at the mall, Mr. Carbonetti cited police statistics showing a 65 percent drop in crime over the last three years. He also cited other reasons for hope: The mall's cleanliness rating, as measured by the Sanitation Department, was 100 percent in the most recent three-month marking period, putting it in the top 4 among the city's 42 business improvement districts.
But others noted that the mall still has its problems. One shopper, a Kingsborough Community College accounting student, said the mall's patrons include gang members. "There's a lot of gangs, mainly Bloods," he said, adding that the gang members tend to cluster. "You'll see like 10 on one block, 10 more on another block."
But the student, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he rarely saw violence, and that he relished the energy of the mall. "This is the heart of Brooklyn, so a lot of people from Brooklyn come here," he said. "If it was in Manhattan, it would be a tourist-type thing."
To improve its image, the business improvement district has taken a number of steps: it has hired its first horticulturist; it has bought heavy new garbage baskets; it is painting all street fixtures with graffiti-resistant paint, and it is planning weekly summer jazz concerts.
Another sign of improvement is the appearance of more Metrotech employees at lunch time. For the first few years, many refused to venture into the teeming bazaar. "I've seen much more traffic back and forth," said Michael Weiss, executive director of the business district representing neighboring Metrotech.
Mr. Carbonetti says he is trying to balance the mall's competing interests in working to improve its image.
"I don't want this to look like Madison Avenue," he declared. "I want it to look like downtown Brooklyn, the way it should be."

HEADLINE: U.S. V. MICROSOFT: THE CASE;
Microsoft Fight Will Be Waged On Wide Front

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
The Government's antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation is shaping up as a high-decibel, often nasty battle to sway public opinion as well as the courts.
The Justice Department and the 20 states suing the company will use an array of tools: talk-show appearances, documents that cast Microsoft as an arrogant monopolist, testimonials from distinguished academics, and scarcely veiled threats of even further charges. 
 "We're in for a full-fledged firefight now," said Richard Blumenthal, the Attorney General of Connecticut.
No company can fight the Government with more resources or deeper pockets than Microsoft, yet it now finds itself facing an unusually cohesive alliance of Federal and state governments.
The debate over whether to try to block the shipment of the latest version of Microsoft's operating system, Windows 98, tested the ability of the Government and the states to cooperate -- and it also illustrated the mixture of economic, legal and public relations considerations in the landmark antitrust case.
Within the last week, the states finally reached a consensus and agreed with the Justice Department that trying to block the imminent release of a product that represented two years of development could well backfire in their campaign against Microsoft.
An attempt to block the shipment of Windows 98, which was released yesterday to computer manufacturers and should reach store shelves on June 25, would have certainly hurt Microsoft.
But the Justice Department determined -- and the states eventually agreed -- that trying to block Windows 98 would prove to be a misstep for both legal and public relations reasons.
After all, the case against Microsoft is being made in the name of consumer choice. How then to justify blocking a new product that undoubtedly millions of consumers will want to buy?
Legally, a request for a temporary restraining order to block the shipment of Windows 98 would have required a Federal judge to say that the uncertain harm to competition in the future from allowing Windows 98 to reach the marketplace outweighed the certain harm from stopping a ready-to-go product.
"Trying to block Windows 98 would have been the 'Hail Mary' approach to this case, a huge risk," said Robert Litan, a former senior Justice Department official who is an economist at the Brookings Institution, a research organization.
So the Government and the states agreed on a different strategy. In their suits filed here on Monday, they argue that the case against Microsoft is really about the nation's economic future.
The suits assert that Microsoft is using the monopoly power enjoyed by its Windows operating system to fend off competition unfairly and to extend its monopolistic reach into the new markets of Internet commerce and software.
Yet even if Microsoft is guilty of such misconduct, the present economic harm would seem to be slight, beyond the damage done to the company's rivals.
The Government and states, however, contend that unless steps are taken now to level the playing field, consumers will suffer in the future because Microsoft will gain a chokehold on the Internet economy as people increasingly do everything from buying cars and airplane tickets to watching movies and reading news on the Internet, whether through computers, digital television or some hybrid device.
Microsoft responds that the Government's attempt to tamper with the future will prove misguided and counterproductive.
William H. Gates, the company's chairman, on Monday called the action by the Justice Department and the states "a step backward for America, consumers and for the personal computer industry that is leading our nation's economy into the 21st century."
As part of its supporting cast, the Government today presented a respected economist, Franklin M. Fisher, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Mr. Fisher was on the other side of the last big antitrust case in the computer industry, the Justice Department's 13-year siege of I.B.M., a case dropped in 1982. In that case, Mr. Fisher was I.B.M.'s chief economic witness.
In a 23-page declaration filed today at the Federal District Court in Washington, Mr. Fisher said that he had studied the evidence in the case and had determined that Microsoft had engaged in competition-crimping behavior.
Looking to the future, he concluded that there was a "substantial probability that these anticompetitive actions will permit Microsoft to retain its power over price in operating systems and will inhibit development of Microsoft-independent innovations."
Mr. Fisher concluded, "Both would harm consumer welfare."
Trying to embarrass Microsoft in court filings is another weapon in the Government's arsenal. But again, these seemingly incriminating memos, E-mail and other documents from Microsoft executives are perhaps wielded as much for their public relations impact as for their legal value as evidence. They are intended, partly, to tarnish Microsoft's image, making companies and consumers think twice before giving the big software maker their dollars or their trust.
To be sure, the Government and states were selective in choosing which statements, depositions and memos to include in their suits and as accompanying documents. William H. Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for legal affairs, characterized the approach as "trial by excerpt." In context, and once the case goes to court, Microsoft says that what seem on the surface to be incriminating evidence will be shown to be otherwise.
Still, the court papers filed yesterday do make serious charges. For example, the Government has contended that in June 1995, Microsoft executives met with executives of the Netscape Communications Corporation, then a start-up with a program for browsing the Internet's World Wide Web.
One charge in the Government's case is that at that meeting Microsoft tried to strike a collusive deal with Netscape -- an offer that Netscape declined. The goal, the Government said, was to avoid competition in the Internet browser market.
A deposition from Marc Andreessen, Netscape's co-founder, described the June 1995 meeting and discussions about where to draw the "line" for splitting the market. "They were attempting to establish with us whether we were interested in a relationship whereby we would mutually agree to essentially not compete with each other across that line," Mr. Andreessen stated. "They would stay below that line. We would stay above the line."
The court filing also describes a deposition from Chris Jones, a Microsoft executive who attended the June 1995 meeting. The court paper states that Mr. Jones "admitted that Microsoft 'absolutely' intended to persuade Netscape not to compete."
Other court papers show both the powerful advantage enjoyed by an on-line service if given prime placement on the Windows main screen and the lengths to which Microsoft would go in pushing for more and more of the browser market.
The papers focus on strategy talks within Microsoft about whether to do a deal with America Online, the largest on-line service, in which America Online would get to place its icon on the Windows main screen, or desktop, even though Microsoft had a competing on-line service, MSN. In return, America Online would distribute Microsoft's browser exclusively to its millions of subscribers.
A deposition from a Microsoft executive stated, "Bill Gates initially strongly opposed giving America Online access to the Windows desktop, stating that doing so would be tantamount to 'putting a bullet through MSN's head.' "
Even so, Mr. Gates later changed his mind and made the deal with America Online for one simple reason -- to increase Microsoft's share of the browser market.

HEADLINE: Really Big Money Shouts in a California Contest

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 19

 BODY:
Shirley Nelson is wise to the ways of fund-raising in Northern California's Democratic politics, having rounded up campaign cash for Senator Dianne Feinstein and President Clinton, among others. But when she offered to put together a lunch for Al Checchi the other day, it was Mr. Checchi himself who opened his wallet.
"I was shocked," said Ms. Nelson, the chairman of Summit Bank in Oakland. 
 So about 350 people gathered over salad and chicken breasts in a rooftop ballroom of the Holiday Inn in Emeryville, just across the bay from San Francisco, courtesy of Mr. Checchi, to hear the multimillionaire businessman sketch out his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for governor, brandishing a newly printed booklet called the Checchi Plan. And at the end, there was no plea for money, only votes.
"I don't want the job unless I can create changes," said Mr. Checchi (pronounced CHECK-ee), who is making his first run for office. "I am not a professional politician. My idea of a good time is not going to be riding around Sacramento in a limousine."
The reality is that by spending more than $30 million of his money on the June 2 primary -- more than any other non-Presidential candidate in American history has ever spent on a primary and general election combined -- Mr. Checchi has already changed the face of politics in the nation's most populous state. Put another way, he has spent about half what Ross Perot spent on his 1992 Presidential race.
At the same time, Mr. Checchi, the former co-chairman of Northwest Airlines, has simply exploited changes long aborning in California, changes that veteran politicians here say made a candidacy like Mr. Checchi's all but inevitable.
Over more than a decade, various movements intended to democratize the state's politics -- including the explosion of ballot initiatives and term limits for state officeholders -- have instead increased the influence of big-money interests from business to labor, along with the cottage industry of pollsters and consultants who package and promote them.
Mr. Checchi's candidacy is not without antecedents. Four years ago, a Republican oil heir, Michael Huffington, spent about $29 million of his own money, the previous record, in a nearly successful effort to unseat Senator Feinstein. But experts here agree that Mr. Checchi has taken the effort to a new level.
"The ability to sell soap on an initiative has now moved to the candidate world itself," said Leon E. Panetta, the former White House chief of staff and nine-term Congressman from Northern California who decided against running for governor after concluding that he could not raise enough money fast enough to challenge Mr. Checchi. "I guess it's a real test of whether or not you can come out of nowhere and invest a lot of money and win a race."
So far, Mr. Checchi has had mixed success. A blizzard of attacks on one rival, Representative Jane Harman, displaced her from an early lead in the polls, but also helped triple Mr. Checchi's own negative ratings. He has yet to break 20 percent support in the polls. And with two weeks to go, the leading candidate is the most conventional politician in the race, Lieut. Gov. Gray Davis, a 25-year veteran of state politics.
Indeed, Mr. Checchi's candidacy has been something of a paradox. He promised to run a positive campaign but instead has run a barrage of television advertising attacking his rivals. Yet, freed from the need to raise money, he has also spent 18 months traveling around the state and talking to some 700 groups and individuals in the most old-fashioned sort of retail politicking.
Mr. Checchi is smooth and polished in speeches and forceful in one-on-one conversations, but he seemed nervous in the only joint debate of the campaign and has made his share of novice's gaffs, blurting out at one point when asked whether he would send his children to public school, "Of course not; why should I?"
He regularly recalls being inspired by the Kennedy brothers' call to civic service, and grows raspy-voiced when he recounts how Robert F. Kennedy died on the 49-year-old candidate's 20th birthday. But Mr. Checchi himself failed to vote in four of California's last six elections.
He has hired a staff of 30 policy experts and consultants and has issued a raft of simplistic, poll-tested proposals -- like a 10 percent cut in the state bureaucracy and automobile insurance rates and hiring 10,000 more police officers -- and he promises to carry them out without any mention of tax increases. But he is also the only candidate who promises bold strokes, like raising California's per-pupil spending on public education to the national average.
In an editorial endorsing him last weekend, The Sacramento Bee called Mr. Checchi "the most promising candidate by far" in the race. The editorial acknowledged that he was "confident to the point of being cocky," but it also praised his "rare combination of ability and independence."
Mr. Checchi's career in the private sector is a similar series of contrasting images. By his account, he is the grandson of Italian immigrant grocers who made his fortune by helping reshape three major American institutions: Marriott, the Walt Disney Company and Northwest. To his critics Mr. Checchi is a wheeler-dealer who was in league in the 1980's with the Bass brothers of Texas in their investment in Disney, and who parlayed his gains into a debt-heavy buyout of Northwest before seeking union concessions and a bailout from Minnesota taxpayers.
In one of the endless series of back-and-forth fax attacks that have marked the campaign, Mr. Davis's campaign manager, Garry South, said Mr. Checchi's "main success was to make himself rich while nearly crashing the airline." Indeed, Mr. Checchi's 11 million shares of Northwest stock, now valued at about $540 million, constitute the bulk of his worth.
In any event, Mr. Checchi has now invested more of his personal money in his campaign than he did in the Northwest buyout, and he is deadly serious about the quest.
"What have these folks ever changed?" Mr. Checchi asked of his rivals as he toured the venerable Italian cafes and markets of the North Beach section in San Francisco the other day, his jaw muscles clenching intently.
"They've never run anything," he continued. "You know, look at these people and ask ourselves, 'What have they run and what were the results?' And you're talking about being atop 350,000 employees, a trillion-dollar economy, managing the largest land portfolio in the United States other than the Federal Government's, and 18 million more people coming in in the next 25 years."
Mr. Checchi's stance is aggressively anti-politician, and much of the state political establishment has not known what to make of him. No less a student of California politics than Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican who is barred by law from seeking a third term, allowed at a breakfast meeting with reporters here today that there was clearly "some resentment" among Democrats over Mr. Checchi's efforts to crash their party.
The Governor predicted that Mr. Davis would be the Democratic nominee. But in making that prediction, Mr. Wilson also implicitly suggested that the Republican nominee, State Attorney Dan Lungren, had more to fear from Mr. Checchi's deep pockets than from Mr. Davis's familiar face.
For his part, Mr. Checchi has managed to win significant support from Democratic officials, including Representative Maxine Waters of Los Angeles and Antonio R. Villaraigosa, the Speaker of the State Assembly.
"Pure and simple, he won me over," said Assemblyman Ted Lempert, a Palo Alto Democrat who was among the first to endorse Mr. Checchi's candidacy last fall. "He's incredibly smart. Before I got to know him, my reaction was the same as a lot of other people's, which is I'm not going to support a guy who thinks he can come in here and buy the election. But after hearing him speak and answer a lot of questions, I'm really convinced he can be a great governor."
Mr. Lempert says it does not please him that Mr. Checchi is spending so much money, but each of Mr. Checchi's two Democratic rivals will come close to equaling the old spending record for a gubernatorial primary in the state, the $9 million spent four years ago by Kathleen Brown.
"Yeah, it bothers me," Mr. Lempert said. "But the way that Gray and Dan Lungren are raising money bothers me, too. I know there's a lot of concern about it, but to me it's a wash."

HEADLINE: Left and Right With Bill Gates

 BODY:
The legal impact of the lawsuits against Microsoft was accompanied by a more subtle upheaval in the ideological realm. The old certainties of conservative opposition to government intervention, fixed since the Reagan era, are shifting on this issue. New technologies, new business rules and, perhaps most important, the power of lobbying and campaign money are producing odd new alliances and redefining what is left and right and who is up or down.
Take, for example, the unexpected Republican support for Attorney General Janet Reno's antitrust activism. Her hand has been strengthened immeasurably because of the backing she commands from Orrin Hatch, one of the chief critics of her chronic passivity on campaign finance. Mr. Hatch, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, represents a state with at least one big software rival of Microsoft. Ms. Reno has also benefited by the fact that Trent Lott uttered not a peep of criticism about the Clinton Administration's handling of Microsoft, and Newt Gingrich sounded downright approving. The company's G.O.P. defenders are much less weighty figures such as its home-state Senator, Slade Gorton, and that ever-grumpy ideologue, Dick Armey. 
 For a long time, Microsoft was an amateur at influencing Washington. It has now stepped up its lobbying and campaign contributions. The irony is that a company long identified with a liberal point of view is trying to make up for lost time with money and hired operatives from the conservative wing of the Republican Party. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, it is the leading donor among computer companies to Federal candidates and parties. It has also hired such well-known Republican operatives as Haley Barbour, Michael Deaver, Grover Norquist and former Representative Vin Weber.
But arrayed against Microsoft is an impressive list of Republicans as well, including former Senator Bob Dole. By far the most startling antagonist of Microsoft is Robert Bork. This former judge and law professor was once known as an apostle of the Chicago School, which questioned whether there are any economic benefits to antitrust enforcement. Both Microsoft and its rivals wooed Mr. Bork, but the critics won him over. He has asserted that Microsoft violated the law by using its dominant position in computer operating systems to promote its own browser over that of its rival, Netscape, a view held by the Clinton Justice Department. No less interesting was the presence of six Republicans on the list of attorneys general filing suit this week, including Dennis Vacco in New York.
There is fracturing on the libertarian side as well. The most ringing defense of Microsoft now comes from the Cato Institute in Washington. On the other hand, some of Microsoft's critics are Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who once shared the anti-regulation position embraced by Microsoft. Now the buccaneers of high-tech want the Government to level the playing field.
Obviously a world of politics and policy driven by lobbying and campaign contributions is not a healthy place. But we may be seeing a welcome new consensus emerging that government has a role to play and that it should not be ridiculed on reflex for every intervention. This Democratic Administration is arguing that there is an intelligent place for government oversight in cyberspace, just as there is in the environment, the work place and the worlds of retirement and health care. Some surprisingly powerful Republicans seem to agree.

HEADLINE: New Broad Street Site Is Proposed To Keep Stock Exchange in Area

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Faced with the possibility that the New York Stock Exchange's quest for a new home would lead it to either Battery Park City or perhaps even New Jersey, officials of New York City and the state said yesterday that they would try to acquire five properties on Broad Street for the exchange, in a bid to insure that lower Manhattan remains the financial capital of the world.
The officials are about to open negotiations with the owners of the Broad Street parcels, which include an apartment house, a parking lot and three nearly vacant buildings, that real estate experts say could cost more than $200 million. The site is a block away from the exchange's historic home on Wall Street. 
 The buildings would be demolished to make way for a tower with two large trading floors. The Empire State Development Corporation could acquire the properties under the power of eminent domain, but that could involve a drawn out condemnation process that the state wants to avoid.
Under an informal agreement with the exchange chairman, Richard A. Grasso, if the state and city are unable to strike a deal to buy the properties within six months, the exchange would be free to move.
Although it is only a few blocks to the Battery Park City site, state and city officials and property owners fear that the loss of the exchange would be a crushing blow to the downtown real estate market, which recovered only recently from a recession in the early and mid-1990's.
"We're going to do everything we can to acquire the properties on Broad Street and keep the exchange downtown," Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine said yesterday. "If we can't do it in a quick way, then Battery Park City becomes a valid alternative."
The joint effort by the Giuliani and Pataki administrations comes 12 days after Mr. Grasso announced that the New York Stock Exchange had abandoned plans to expand in lower Manhattan and would explore a move to Battery Park City or New Jersey.
Mr. Grasso, like the heads of many of the city's investment banks, successfully grabbed the attention of city officials with his comments about talking to officials in New Jersey.
His remarks started a flurry of phone calls and meetings between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mr. Grasso, city and state officials said.
The stock exchange, however, was looking for much more than the millions of dollars in tax breaks that the investment banks wrung from the city. It was asking for cash grants and land for a new trading floor.
Privately, stock exchange officials remain skeptical that the properties on Broad Street could be acquired without a prohibitively long legal battle with at least some of the landowners. The five properties fill much of the block bound by Broad Street, William Street, Beaver Street and Exchange Place.
But the push to satisfy the exchange, which would include steep public subsidies, is colliding with another municipal policy that was intended to revive the downtown real estate market.
Three years ago, Crescent Heights Investments, the owner of an apartment house at 25 Broad Street, was one of the first companies to take advantage of the new city tax breaks and zoning changes encouraging investors to convert some of the many vacant downtown office buildings to apartments.
Crescent Heights subsequently invested about $100 million in building and renting 345 apartments at 25 Broad that it would now be asked to tear down. In what may be the opening shot in the acquisition effort or merely a negotiating ploy for more money, Crescent Heights filed an application yesterday to have 25 Broad Street declared a city landmark, which would, if successful, prohibit demolition of the building. Crescent Heights has not returned several calls requesting comment in the last few days.
The other four property owners may be more amenable to a sale.
"We'd be more than willing to cooperate with them," said Fred Manocherian, who owns a large parking lot at 15 William Street that is part of the proposed site. "We are very anxious to make sure that the exchange stays in downtown Manhattan. But I feel that 25 Broad will be the sticking point that has to be resolved."
Even as city and state officials struggle with the future home of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers are beginning a search for a new 500,000-square-foot headquarters, possibly in midtown Manhattan, said real estate executives who have talked to officials at the financial markets. The association, which owns the Nasdaq stock market and is acquiring the American Stock Exchange, has signed a tentative deal to open a marketing center at 4 Times Square that would include a gigantic $12 million to $18 million video sign wrapped around part of the cylindrical face of the new skyscraper being built at Broadway and 43d Street.
The departure of the American Stock Exchange from its headquarters at 86 Trinity Place would put a dent in the lower Manhattan real estate market, but not as serious as the departure of the New York Stock Exchange.
"The New York Stock Exchange, both symbolically and practically, is the center of the financial universe," said Thomas Falus, president of Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate broker.
The current discussion of sites for the exchanges recalls an effort by city officials and developers seven years ago to build new trading floors and a 50-story tower across the street from the New York Stock Exchange and next to the site now under consideration.
That proposal would have created a superexchange housing both stock markets as well as the city's five commodity exchanges. Property values were plummeting in 1991 and one out of every four floors of office space was empty in lower Manhattan, so land was cheap.
The project, which financial executives and city officials now regard as a "lost opportunity," presumably would have tethered the financial industry to lower Manhattan until well into the next century. But after months of discussions, William H. Donaldson, then the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, rejected the proposal.
Since then, the city struck a series of deals with investment banks that routinely threatened to leave New York for the suburbs. When he was Mayor, David N. Dinkins granted a $106.2 million tax break to Prudential Securities, a $100 million incentive package to Morgan Stanley and a $40 million subsidy to Bear Stearns.
Mayor Giuliani, who once criticized those deals, has granted tax breaks totaling $439.1 million to 18 financial institutions, including the New York Mercantile Exchange, the largest commodity market in New York.
The New York Stock Exchange has been intrigued by the idea of building a modern facility, rather than expanding near its current location, ever since it visited the new $280 million headquarters of the Mercantile Exchange at Battery Park City, which opened last year with the help of $183.9 million in tax breaks and cash from the city and the state.
The exchange would like a similar deal to build a complex at the northern end of Battery Park City on a valuable parcel known as Site 26.

Indonesia Leader's Words Spur Crackdown in Capital
Hard-line military leaders clamped down on the capital of Indonesia in an effort to choke off plans for a huge demonstration hours after President Suharto rejected calls to step down, saying instead that he would hold elections some time in the future. Soldiers blocked key squares and intersections. Barricades also isolated the Parliament building, where thousands of protesting students had camped overnight. A1 

The student protesters are treating the Suharto Government with undisguised contempt. Hundreds of students barged into the main chamber of the House of Representatives, filling up the seats and galleries and conducting a sort of spontaneous shadow government. A10
 
The Clinton Administration has been giving crucial financial support to some of the most important Indonesian opposition groups, hoping to promote a transition to a democratic society, while also trying to shore up President Suharto. A11
 
Irish Rock for Peace
Bono, star of the Irish rock group U2, took to the stage in Belfast beneath a giant "YES" banner, bringing together two longtime adversaries -- John Hume, a Catholic, and David Trimble, a Protestant -- in the campaign for approval of a Northern Ireland peace agreement. They urged support for the agreement in a referendum on Friday. A3
 
Demonstrations in Columbia
A spate of political killings during the current presidential campaign drove thousands of Colombians to take part in nationwide demonstrations to demand an end to the violence. No arrests have been made in the attacks, which have left more than 50 people dead and dozens missing in the last month. A5
 
Damage Control From Mexico
Mexican officials sought to minimize a huge United States undercover operation that exposed the laundering of drug money in 12 Mexican banks. American officials said that 20 traffickers have been arrested in the investigation, which has spread to six countries and is still growing. A6
 
Turner Grants to be Announced
The first round of grants from Ted Turner's $1 billion gift to the United Nations will be announced today, with nearly three-quarters of the initial $22 million going to help women, children and victims of war in poor countries. The grants, announced last year, are the largest gift the United Nations has ever received from a private source. A12
 
Iran Hails U.S. Policy Shift
Iran trumpeted a Clinton Administration decision to waive sanctions against three foreign companies that are doing business there as a moral victory for the European Union and one that should signal an end to American attempts to deter similar investments. A Government communique called on the United States to repeal altogether the legislation that requires sanctions on companies that deal with Iran. A13

Gingrich Calls for Inquiry
Into China Export Decision
Saying that "very stark questions of national security" are at stake, Speaker Newt Gingrich announced that he would create a select committee to investigate President Clinton's decision to waive export controls over advanced space technology to China. A1
 
Senior Chinese officials angrily dismissed as "groundless rumors" charges that Chinese citizens illegally contributed to the Democratic Party in an effort to influence United States policy on satellite exports, and suggested the accusations were intended to undermine President Clinton's visit to China in June. A16
 
The White House scandal control brigade was uncharacteristically quiet in the face of accusations that a Chinese military officer donated nearly $100,000 to the Democrats. A16

Tobacco Projections Attacked
Many experts warn against predictions that sweeping changes in the way cigarettes are marketed will spare a million youngsters from untimely deaths over the next decade. Such predictions, they said, are little more than wild estimates that are overheating expectations for change in youth smoking rates. A1
 
The Senate rejected a proposal to limit lawyers' fees in tobacco cases to $250 an hour, but Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican leader, promised that further amendments on the matter would be offered before work on the bill is complete. Some trial lawyers stand to become instant billionaires from the settlement of lawsuits against tobacco companies. A18
 
Three Police Officers Slain
Two Tampa police officers and a Florida Highway Patrol officer were shot and killed by a man who was later found dead, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The man, identified as Hank Carr, had held a clerk hostage at a gas station for four hours before releasing her. A14
 
Ruling on Immigration Forms
In a decision that affects several thousand immigrants, a Federal appeals court has ruled that some forms used by the immigration authorities are so hard to decipher that they deprive people of their right to a hearing before deportation. A15
 
Federal Computers Vulnerable
Crucial computers at the State Department and the Federal Aviation Administration are vulnerable to criminal or terrorist attack because the agencies do not properly control access to them, the General Accounting Office has found. A15
 
Abortion Law Survives Test
A Federal appeals court let stand a Wisconsin law that bans so-called partial-birth abortions and calls for life prison sentences for doctors who perform the procedure. A15

HEADLINE: Gingrich Plans Panel on China And Clinton Tie

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
Saying that "very stark questions of national security" are at stake, Speaker Newt Gingrich announced today that he would create a special committee to investigate President Clinton's decision to waive export controls over advanced space technology to China.
Mr. Gingrich said he would propose to House Democrats that the committee be led by Representative Christopher Cox, a California Republican who served in the White House counsel's office under President Ronald Reagan. 
 He said the committee would focus on issues including the recent reports that a Chinese military officer gave $100,000 in political contributions to a Democratic fund-raiser during the 1996 Presidential election and the question of whether an American satellite maker passed sensitive technological information to China.
"This has nothing to do with campaign finance," Mr. Gingrich said, seeking to elevate the issue above the recent House investigation into Mr. Clinton's 1996 campaign financing.
"This has to do with the national security of the United States," he said, "and the effort by a foreign military to penetrate our political system and the effort by some people to give the Chinese secrets in violation of American law. This is a profoundly deeper question than anything that has arisen in this Administration."
The House must vote to create a special committee, but Mr. Gingrich virtually dared the Democrats to object to such a panel, which he said would consist of five Republicans and three Democrats.
"I think the country would be very curious as to why the Democrats would not want to know that the Chinese were getting American military secrets," he said.
President Clinton said earlier this week that foreign policy had not been compromised and that he would cooperate with any investigation.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, has already signaled his opposition to a special investigative committee, and a spokesman said his position has not changed. But a senior Democratic official acknowledged last night that boycotting such a committee "is not an option. Some of our members are pretty spooked."
The Speaker's decision to create a special committee avoids the political problem of having Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, continue to head a much criticized investigation into Mr. Clinton's 1996 campaign financing and allows the Republicans to elevate the inquiry into more serious matters of national security.
Mr. Gingrich's announcement came at the end of a day in which several senior Republicans wielded foreign policy as a weapon against Mr. Clinton, accusing him of undermining the stature of the Presidency and assailing his handling of the Middle East, China and India. And Mr. Gingrich indirectly brought the former intern Monica S. Lewinsky into the argument, too, when he compared the Clinton White House to the salacious "Jerry Springer Show."
"Around the world today, the institution of the Presidency has been degraded to the point that it is viewed as the rough equivalent of 'The Jerry Springer Show' -- a level of disrespect and decadence that should appall every American," he wrote in the conservative weekly Human Events.
 Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House Republican leader, said that Mr. Clinton "seems to be incapable of getting cooperation on any of the things that he is trying to get from the international community. I think it's time for him to step forward and remove this shadow of doubt that seems to be hindering his ability to achieve the stature on the international scene that an American President ought to get."
The House Republican Conference gave talking points to House Republicans making some of the same points and saying that "this is not just another campaign finance law violation. This is the latest smudge on American international prestige. The President is losing his standing in the international community."
The talking points noted that Mr. Clinton could not convince the nation's allies at an international economic summit to join sanctions against India for conducting nuclear tests, and that he had trouble last year garnering international support for efforts to force weapons inspections in Iraq. And they pointed to Mr. Clinton's decision to waive sanctions against three foreign companies doing business with Iran.
Earlier in the day, at a celebration of Israel's 50th anniversary, Mr. Gingrich compared the Administration's failure to stop China and Russia from transferring weapons technology to Iran to Britain's early appeasement of Hitler.
And the Speaker criticized the Administration for trying to broker an agreement concerning the West Bank. "When I see an American diplomat suggest to Israeli generals that our understanding of their security needs on the West Bank is better than their understanding, I'm looking at someone who has been in fancy hotels too long and out of touch with reality," he said.
But most of the Republican focus today was on China. The New York Times reported last week that lawyers and officials have said that Johnny Chung, a Democratic fund-raiser, told Federal investigators that a Chinese military officer, Lieut. Col. Liu Chaoying, had funneled nearly $100,000 into Democratic campaigns.
In addition, there have been questions about whether an American aerospace company, Loral Space and Communications, received favorable treatment on high-technology exports to China. The company's chief executive officer, Bernard Schwartz, has been one of the Democratic Party's largest donors.
Loral and another company, Hughes Electronics, exported commercial satellites to China to be launched by Chinese missiles. After a Chinese rocket exploded in 1996, a Loral subsidiary helped provide a report to the Chinese without first consulting with United States officials. The company said it was cooperating with a Justice Department investigation, and has denied that any sensitive information was transferred.
Mr. Clinton has denied that campaign donations affected American policy and vowed in Europe to cooperate with Congressional investigators.
House Republicans tonight pushed through a nonbinding resolution calling for immunity from prosecution for four witnesses to testify in an investigation of illegal campaign contributions to Democrats.
Mr. Gingrich today suggested that Mr. Clinton postpone his China trip and said the special committee could be up and running by mid-June. He said he wanted a separate panel because the accusations regarding China crossed the jurisdiction of a number of standing committees.
"If the President wants to cooperate we could begin facilitating the transfer of information within the next week or so," Mr. Gingrich said. "I would just suggest to you that implications that American military secrets were being given without the knowledge of the American government are very, very serious."
In another development, a House National Security subcommittee announced that some Pentagon workers who review exports for national security risks have said that they were told by a superior not to voice their opposition to the President's approval of satellite technology transfers to China last February.
Investigators for the subcommittee said that some employees of the Pentagon's Defense Technology Security Administration told them that memos they wrote arguing against the satellite exports were suppressed by their boss in an attempt to reduce the Executive Branch's record of opposition.
Pentagon officials today flatly denied the accusation.

Queens Grocer Charged In Death of Couple

 BODY:
A Queens greengrocer was arrested and charged yesterday in the killing of a Korean-American financier and his wife Sunday during a disagreement about a business loan, law enforcement officials said.
The greengrocer, Lee Kyung Bok, 35, was charged with two counts of murder in the shooting deaths of Kyung Lee, 35, and his wife So Hee Lee, 31. Mr. and Mrs. Lee were well known as moneylenders in the Korean-American community, where entrepreneurs are often willing to pay high interest rates to start up or finance their businesses. 
 The police said Mr. Bok had borrowed at least $10,000 from the Lees to cover a cash shortfall at his business, Sunny Supermarket on 48th Avenue in Woodside, and was apparently discussing the loan with the Lees as they sat inside the couple's black Lexus on 75th Street in Elmhurst.
According to a complaint filed in Queens Criminal Court, Mr. Bok shot Mr. Lee once in the head in a dispute over the money. When Mrs. Lee fled, the complaint said, Mr. Bok chased her and shot her once in the cheek. The Lees later died.
Mr. Bok's lawyer, Frank Hancock, said his client was was visiting a friend in Forest Hills, Queens when the Lees were shot. He acknowledged that Mr. Bok had borrowed at least $10,000 from the Lees, and that he was being charged at least $125 per week in interest, but he denied that there had been a dispute with them.

HEADLINE: UNREST IN INDONESIA: THE SCENE;
Joyfully, Indonesian Students Thumb Noses at Authority

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, May 19

 BODY:
For a few surreal hours here today, Indonesia's political hierarchy seemed to be turned on its head.
Hundreds of student protesters barged into the main chamber of the House of Representatives, filling up the seats and galleries and conducting a sort of spontaneous shadow government. One young man took the podium to offer a dead-pan impersonation of Gen. Wiranto, the Defense Minister and armed forces commander, while another imitated the Speaker of the House, Mr. Harmoko. 
 Above them hung an eagle in gun-metal gray, Indonesia's national symbol, which had been plastered over with a banner demanding that President Suharto "stop unemployment and lower the price of food."
"I want to be just like the Government," said Azhari Somaad, a 27-year-old student at Mohammadiyah University in Jakarta, after he had finished an enthusiastic if disjointed speech to his hooting classmates. "If I were in the Government, I would resign and give the power back to the people."
It was the second day in a row that the Indonesian military allowed the students to bring their protest inside the gates of Parliament. And today a crowd of 15,000 giddy students had the run of the place -- occupying lobbies, hallways and offices, and even spilling out on to the domed roof, where they strung anti-Suharto banners between the flagpoles.
On a day when Mr. Suharto defied calls to step down immediately, the students are treating his Government with undisguised contempt. Loudspeakers resounded with calls for Mr. Suharto's head, while a group of students carried a freshly-painted sign that said in English: "We're sick of you."
"He grabbed the power and now we have to grab it back," said Dewi Satriani, a 26-year-old advertising student at the University of Indonesia. "He's been President for 32 years, so it is not easy for him to give it up."
Like most students, Ms. Satriani was disappointed but not surprised by Mr. Suharto's televised address. Watching the speech with friends in a common room at the University of Indonesia this morning, she shook her head in disgust as the President laid out the conditions for his departure.
Ms. Satriani dismissed Mr. Suharto's promise to hold new elections as a cynical maneuver by an autocrat unwilling to relax his grip on power, even in the face of overwhelming rejection. "I haven't got any idea of what he is planning to do," she said. "I just know I don't believe him anymore."
Rows of soldiers guarded the gates of Parliament, refusing entry to people other than students and journalists. But the soldiers did not venture into the sprawling complex, which gave the students free rein and turned Parliament into an Indonesian version of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. during spring break.
Hundreds of students mingled under a tropical sun outside the building. Inside, they camped out in lobbies and stairwells, banging plastic water bottles on the floor in thunderous chants against Mr. Suharto. Exhausted protesters slept peacefully under newspapers amid the din.
It was in the cavernous House chamber that the students most vividly demonstrated their contempt for the Government. Long the inner sanctum of a legislative body that meekly ratified Mr. Suharto's rule, the House chamber today became a playground.
Students in khaki uniforms from the Indonesian Maritime Academy sprinted around the room on the desktops. Others heckled the speakers by tossing wads of paper at them. And the unofficial leaders sitting on the rostrum elbowed each other out of the way as they tried to get a turn at the podium.
The students mocked General Wiranto, who disappointed them on Monday by announcing that the army would support Mr. Suharto. But they also taunted Mr. Harmoko, the House Speaker, who demanded that Mr. Suharto resign on Monday, only to back off somewhat today after the chilly response from General Wiranto and Mr. Suharto himself. Asked why they were mocking Parliament when Mr. Harmoko had supported to their cause, one student said: "The Parliament doesn't have the mandate of the people. We can't take it seriously."

HEADLINE: U.S. V. MICROSOFT: THE HOMETOWN;
In Seattle, Bill Gates Is Still a Hometown Hero

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: SEATTLE, May 19

 BODY:
The money-making machine at the Microsoft Corporationpurred along today, the soldiers of software touting their new operating system while assuring friends and colleagues that no, the ride was not over. Not by any stretch.
What the Government did this week -- filing a suit that called Microsoft a predatory monopolist, using its dominance of personal computer operating systems to control future innovations -- may be the antitrust action that defines commerce for much of the next century. 
 But, perhaps because there is just so much money floating around this region as a result of Microsoft, people here say they feel no immediate threat from the Justice Department. What you hear is defiance, denial, and even the celebrated hubris.
Microsoft will fight the Justice Department, according to a dominant view from its hometown, because fighting -- and winning -- is what Microsoft does best.
"If anything, this is going to fuel the already heightened competitiveness of the company," said Scott Oki, who was one of the first 100 Microsoft employees, and now devotes his time to giving away much of his fortune and developing golf courses. "They will just hunker down and be that much better at what they do."
As for his view of the antitrust suit, Mr. Oki said, "I think it's preposterous, wrongheaded, misdirected and just plain dumb."
Microsoft, based in the Seattle suburb of Redmond, has produced a half-dozen billionaires, more than 2,000 millionaires -- most of whom would not draw a stare at the mini-mart -- and is in large part responsible for Seattle being one of the costlier places to own a home in America. But this is not a company town.
Microsoft, with about 12,000 employees, is only the fourth-largest employer, behind Boeing, Group Health Cooperative and the University of Washington. When Boeing shed two-thirds of its work force during a sharp recession 30 years ago, a famous sign implored the last person leaving town to turn out the lights.
Now, the reaction to an outside threat is one of calculation as the holders of Microsoft stock study how the Justice Department suit affects their investment. "I have friends who worked at the phone company when they broke up, and they're watching their portfolios sail along," said Laura Ruderman, who left Microsoft two months ago after five years at the company.
Microsoft, according to the consensus view around Seattle, is no turn-of-the-century Standard Oil, a Goliath ripe for breakup. And even if it were, some people say, it is worth recalling what the aging John D. Rockefeller said upon hearing that his oil monopoly was over: He told people to buy Standard Oil stock, saying it would be worth more when divided into parts, as indeed it was.
"No one's cashing in their stock options," said Julie Bick, a former group product manager at the company and author of a recent book, "All I Really Need to Know in Business I Learned at Microsoft" (Pocket Books). She said that the company was being punished simply for being successful. "It's kind of like telling a slugger on the baseball team not to hit for the fences," Ms. Bick said.
Valerie Carbonaro of Redmond, who was shopping at a boutique in Redmond yesterday, said, "In some respects I agree with the smaller companies because Microsoft has got the market. But it's part of the American way. Bill Gates started it from scratch and got it to where it is today."
That view extends to the Governor of the state, Gary Locke, a Democrat. "I don't think people or companies should be targeted by the Government just because they're smart and innovative," Governor Locke said. "You have to wonder if Microsoft is being attacked because of its success and its brains."
Justice Department lawyers and Microsoft rivals say that the company has repeatedly broken antitrust laws. They say the company has used its dominance in software operating systems -- roughly 90 percent of all personal computers run on Microsoft systems -- to stifle competition in other areas, mainly in its moves to take over the market for Internet browsers, which allow computer users to connect to the millions of sites on the World Wide Web. If successful in doing this, the critics add, a small percentage of virtually every commercial transaction on the Internet will end up in the hands of the merchants at Microsoft.
For all its hometown rooters, there are also plenty of critics of the company here, and Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, is a regular target of vicious local satire. It seems obvious, people say with a shrug, why Mr. Gates -- whose Microsoft stock alone is worth around $47 billion -- keeps personal papers from Napoleon, the man who once had designs on much of the world, among the artifacts usually on display at his new $40 million home on Lake Washington.
The money from Microsoft has clearly transformed this region. Outside of the Silicon Valley in California, the Puget Sound area -- along with the Boston area -- has the highest concentration of software companies in the nation, many dependent on Microsoft. Paul Allen, Microsoft's co-founder, has been acting as a sports and arts Medici, buying a professional football team, nearly a third of all the office space in the southern end of downtown Seattle, and building a huge new music museum. He is also, with the help of taxpayers, constructing a professional football stadium for the Seattle Seahawks, the team he owns.
Other residents have also become more active in charitable giving.
"We set a record this year for the biggest increase in United Way donations of any city," said Bob Watt, a former Seattle deputy mayor who is the chief executive of the Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce. "The biggest increase in categories was those who gave over $10,000 apiece. And the incentive was, anyone who donated that got to have dinner with Bill and Melinda Gates. That's a small example of what this company means to this area."
But with Microsoft being only the fourth-largest employer, Mr. Watt said, few people are concerned about the Justice Department's action. "Most of the software executives I've spoken to have been saying this is not Armageddon," he said.
Still, being accused of unlawful behavior raises the question of whether Microsoft will be hurt by its cutthroat image. The answer, at least on Microsoft's home turf, was no.
"Lawsuits are not what they used to be," said Bruce Chapman, president of the Discovery Institute, a Seattle-based think tank. "People used to say where there's smoke, there's fire. Now they say, where there's smoke, there's a smoke machine."

HEADLINE: UNREST IN INDONESIA: THE OPPOSITION;
U.S. Has Spent $26 Million Since '95 on Suharto Opponents

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
While trying to shore up President Suharto, the Clinton Administration has also been giving support to some of the most important Indonesian opposition groups, hoping to promote a transition to a democratic society.
The money has come from the United States Agency for International Development, better known for building dams and roads than creating bridges to political opponents of authoritarian leaders. 
 The sum, $26 million since 1995, is relatively small among United States foreign-aid programs. But it has been important to the survival of groups that support human rights and free speech in Indonesia.
The money from A.I.D. is the largest source of support for groups like the Indonesia Legal Aid Society, headed by Adnan Buyung Nasution, a leading figure in the Indonesian democracy movement and the nation's best-known civil rights lawyer. The group is giving free legal counsel to political figures and students arrested by the Government in the current crisis, the type of role that the society has played for years.
The United States agency has helped Indonesian rights advocates "monitor human-rights issues, mobilize public opinion and monitor extralegal activities, corruption and abuse of the poor" by the Suharto Government, said Sharon Cromer, deputy director of the A.I.D. mission in Indonesia.
The support has helped insure the survival of private groups that are emerging as leaders of the opposition in Indonesia, "despite their being constrained by the authoritarian system," Ms. Cromer said.
A.I.D. has supported 30 nongovernmental organizations in Indonesia, agency officials said. The organizations include an environmental group that is fighting a large American mining company on behalf of people who live near the company's projects; a coalition of journalists whose work was banned by the Indonesian Government, a women's rights group and a consumers' rights foundation.
"A.I.D. is the largest financial supporter to and the most active donor in this controversial sector," the agency told Congress in a recent budget request.
Peter Galbraith, a former senior counsel to A.I.D., said: "The idea was to send a message that the United States was concerned about something other than the banks and the economic issues, that we thought about the ordinary people of Indonesia, and to prepare for a possible transition from Suharto to what we hope will be a more democratic and stable system."
William Little, a professor of Indonesia studies at Ohio University and a former A.I.D. consultant, said the program had been a success.
"A democracy requires a civil society," Professor Little said. "Indonesia has been like the Soviet Union. The Government controls most civil society organizations. It creates them or determines who their leaders are. The point of the program was to try to develop these groups. The groups are now leading figures in the opposition."
In the last five years, programs like the one in Indonesia have been created by the director of the agency, J. Brian Atwood, in more than 25 missions around the world in nations including Guatemala, Kenya, South Africa and the Philippines.
But the Indonesian program has come under fire from some supporters of the present Jakarta Government, including Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold of New Orleans, the largest single foreign investor in Indonesia.
Freeport-McMoran argues that the United States should not support Walhi, an Indonesian environmental and human-rights group that has attacked the company's projects as detrimental to Indonesians near Freeport mines.
"Walhi's trying to shut us down," said a spokesman for the company, Garland Robinette. "That's their avowed intention."
Despite intense pressure from the company, the United States Ambassador in Indonesia, Stapleton Roy, stood by the program.
The idea behind such programs, according to Charles E. Costello, director of the Center for Democracy and Governance, an A.I.D. office founded in 1993, is that economic development alone cannot create a civil society.
"Democratic political systems and market economies should go together," Mr. Costello said.
Human-rights organizations fiercely critical of the United States' foreign policy in Indonesia say the program has been invaluable for the Indonesian groups, which are known as nongovernmental organizations, or N.G.O.'s.
The Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Sidney Jones, said the program gave the United States Embassy in Jakarta insights it might otherwise lack.
"It keeps the embassy in touch with all the N.G.O.'s," Ms. Jones said. "And of course that's useful. It also gives the N.G.O.'s a kind of protection."

HEADLINE: Shelves of Snooping Aids Make Privacy Hard to Buy

BYLINE: By VIVIENNE WALT 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
A MAN stepped through the door of a spy store in West Hollywood and muttered that his company, a "major movie studio," was tapping his telephone. He needed a device to examine the phone, hunt down the tap and shut the thing off.
That might sound like a unreasonably worried customer. But telephone tapping is bigger than ever -- both the illegal kind and the legal kind. Court-authorized government wiretaps reached a record two million private conversations last year, according to Justice Department figures released this month. 
 Americans might express outrage that Linda Tripp taped phone calls from her friend, Monica Lewinsky, the White House intern. But Ms. Tripp, it seems, has plenty of company. More than ever, Americans seem to relish listening in on other people's conversations and taping their own, electronics analysts and people who sell electronic devices say.
For do-it-yourself spies, the easiest surveillance -- taping your own calls -- is now so simple and cheap that there hardly seems to be a reason not to own the technology. Many new telephone answering machines have a button that, when pushed, will begin taping conversations without informing the other party. That is illegal in only about a dozen states; New York is not among them, although Maryland, where Ms. Tripp taped Ms. Lewinsky, is.
Several recording jacks on the market plug into a tape recorder on one end and a telephone on the other, allowing the user to put the tape on pause during irrelevant parts and so save various literary agents and reporters from slogging through hours of worthless chitchat later on.
"I'm not sure what people are doing with these, but they're very popular," said a sales assistant at a Los Angeles branch of Radio Shack, whose catalogue offers three such jacks, ranging from $19.99 to $34.99.
At the West Hollywood spy store, Spy Tech Agency, on Sunset Boulevard, engineers have modified regular voice-activated recorders so they can tape four hours on each side, which allows someone to tap a phone without having to baby-sit the action continually. With one of these, the owner can splice a connecting line into one part of the telephone wire -- which is called tapping into the line -- and then hide the recorder in some other part of the house.
Last year, said the Spy Tech Agency's owner, John Dresden, the device may have saved the life of a Spy Tech client, a suspicious husband who taped his wife's calls only to discover that she and her lover were plotting his murder. His wife found the recorder and smashed it, Mr. Dresden said, but the husband returned to buy another one and then handed the tapes to the police.
More recently, Mr. Dresden installed one of these recorders for a woman who wanted to record the calls of her teen-age son, whom she suspected of using drugs. The tapes exceeded her worst fears, Mr. Dresden said. "She couldn't believe the stuff he was doing," he said.
With all this gadgetry, anybody might be tempted to try tapping a phone. But beware: all states ban unauthorized third-party wiretaps, even though some judges have ruled that parents can record their children's calls because they pay the phone bills.
Despite the laws, private investigators say they are being bombarded with clients' requests for illegal wiretaps. "When I had an ad in the yellow pages, I'd get a few requests every week," said Tom Grant, a longtime private detective in Los Angeles. By far the easiest method of telephone tapping, he said, is bribing a technician.
Telephone deregulation has increased the number of telephone companies, and it has also changed the design of telephone boxes outside buildings, which connect the inside lines to the street. Since telephone companies no longer have sole authority over the inside wires, new boxes are designed with simple, modular jacks so an electrician can add a line. That means that a snoop with minimal technical know-how can plug a recording jack into the box without ever entering the house.
Still, new digital telephone systems are far more difficult to tap than the older, analog lines -- so much so that the Federal Bureau of Investigation won an agreement from the telephone industry to institute some changes in the system to make surveillance easier. Under the deal, companies agreed to give government agents the ability to track cellular-phone users. But the F.B.I. is arguing for greater access to digital networks, including, among other things, the ability to monitor conference calls even after the agent's target has hung up.
Cordless and cellular phones can invite eavesdropping. Speaker Newt Gingrich was overheard in December 1996 by a Florida man and woman who were using a simple radio scanner in their car; they eavesdropped on a conference call with Republican leaders, hatching their response to ethics charges against him. At least one of the participants chose to talk on a cellular phone -- proving, perhaps, that many Americans are not aware of how leaky wireless telephones can be.
It is also true that the recorded phone call has become commonplace in some areas. Call a customer-service line, and a recording lets you know you are being taped. Answer a telemarketing call, and that call is probably being taped.
"There's an acceptance that there are fewer opportunities for candid conversation," said Robert Ellis Smith, editor of The Privacy Journal, a newsletter based in Providence, R.I.
Government wiretapping is on the rise, too. A total of 1,186 requests were approved by Federal and state judges in 1997, which was an increase of 3 percent from the number in 1996, according to the Justice Department wiretapping report issued this month. As in the past, most of the requests, nearly three-quarters, were for drug investigations; the largest number were issued in New York, which had 304; in New Jersey, with 70, and Florida, with 57.
But for those who care about keeping their conversations private, there are a few simple rules. First and foremost, stay off cordless and cellular telephones: they act as radio transmitters. If you need a cordless telephone, buy an expensive, digital version. VTech makes telephones that include a digital scrambling system. Use digital, rather than analog, cellular phones for more private conversations. Another rule to remember is that even if your phone is secure, your conversation partner's may not be.
For sensitive calls to a specific person, two voice-scrambling devices are available to attach to both handsets. They will scramble the transmission and unscramble it on the other end. Spy Tech sells them for $300 each (www.spytechagency.com).
While scrambling devices can render wiretaps useless, some tap detectors on the market will alert you if someone's listening. Most of them work on finding radio signals transmitted over the line, a signal that there is a wiretap at work. But in large offices, finding a bug or phone tap needs far more complicated methods than anything you can buy from a catalogue.
"It isn't that simple, like in the movies, unfortunately," Mr. Dresden, of the Spy Tech Agency, told the studio employee who came looking for a wiretap detector for his office telephone.
"We'd have to come in and sweep the whole place -- it'll cost you around 50 grand," said Mr. Dresden, leaning against a cabinet of tiny transmitters in his blue jeans and cowboy boots. In an era when people are seeing alluring little gadgets for James Bond and Dick Tracy-type wristwatch computers, it was disappointing news. The man left empty-handed.
In the final analysis, many people seem not to care a great deal about whether their calls are being tapped. The news this month that the government was listening in on a record number of calls barely made a flutter in the news.
"Technology's already diminished our privacy a lot," said David Wagner, a computer-science graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley who helped crack the GSM encryption technology used in 80 million cellular phones a few weeks ago. "Two hundred years ago, if you wanted a private conversation, you went out into the middle of the woods."
Mr. Dresden cannot provide the woods. But in recent years, he has helped several financial companies come close to that experience by designing safe rooms for them where deals can be made without fear of economic espionage. One room in a downtown Los Angeles building, Mr. Dresden said, has vibrating noise generators built into the walls -- about $30,000 worth of electronic equipment alone.
For the studio employee who wandered into his store, however, Mr. Dresden offered his best advice for anyone needing privacy: "Don't use the phone."

Little Man With a Past

BYLINE: By Phil Patton 

 BODY:
WHEN 11 European nations met earlier this month to formally agree upon a new common currency, the euro, the ceremony marked the culmination of a long process. For a decade now, as the European Union has moved toward greater economic integration, new rules have wiped away many local differences. For instance, when the bureaucrats drew up a list of fruits approved for shipment within the community, many prized local varieties were omitted.
European integration has inspired a countervailing nostalgia that attaches itself to the oddest of artifacts. None is stranger than the German ampelmann, or lamp man, the traffic-control icon that once presided over crosswalks in East Germany. 
 The little man with the old-fashioned hat has been reproduced on T-shirts, on key chains and on red or green light fixtures. Now, he has arrived in the United States, where the key chains are showing up at novelty stores and the light fixtures at design stores like Moss in SoHo. Few Americans are likely to know his origins.
The lamp man (green for "go," spread arms and red for "stop") was devised in East Germany by a traffic psychologist named Karl Peglau in 1961 -- just as the Berlin Wall was going up. After unification, the standard Euroman pedestrian signal replaced the lamp man.
That's when the reaction started. Germans, led by Markus Heckhausen, a West Berlin graphic designer, rallied around the little figures and organized a society to preserve them. Mr. Heckhausen edited a book celebrating the lamp man, and began selling lamp-man novelty items.
"It's really struck a chord in Germany," Gerd Klaus said. He runs a German mail-order catalogue that sells lamp-man products.
East Germans had the lamp man drilled into their heads from kindergarten on. Oddly, West Germans love the lamp man, too.
When the wall came down a decade ago, cynics predicted that West Germans would soon be eager to build it back. In one sense, they were right. Many West Germans resent the costs of unification and the crimp it has put in the economy. East Germans tend to resent feeling like second-class citizens and are nostalgic for the socialist days, grim as they might have seemed, which are now recalled as days of full employment, controlled prices and safe streets.
In Germany, stores now sell artifacts of the old regime. Even the wretched Trabant automobile is taking on the misty glow of a Woodstock-era Beetle. One entrepreneur has proposed an East German Iron Curtain theme park that would have watchtowers, shopping queues, surly clerks and secret informants. So, too, the lamp man's light is being suffused with the glimmer and gloss of nostalgia.
Why? To some, the lamp man is a symbol of a simpler, happier past. He is a relic from an inhumane regime that in retrospect seems in some ways more human than the capitalist regime East Germans have joined. To others, it is a symbol of capitalism's endlessly clever ability to make money, even from the artifacts of socialism.
But the lamp man symbolizes something beyond that: the desire to retain national differences in the face of the integration of Europe. The new Euroman pedestrian lights are resented by some as an abstract entity imposed by a European bureaucracy. And it is not just the lamp man who is being missed but distinctive signs in Belgium and elsewhere.
To defend the lamp man means to defend a wealth of variety against standardization. It is the same as defending local apples against the Euro fruit standard or regional dishes against McDonald's. The conflict between Euro and regional is part of the wider conflict between global and local. The lamp man alternately blinks "stop" and "go," and thus may be a modern symbol of our ambivalence about progress.
The common currencies, common markets and common products of the global economy promise to make us all richer but not necessarily happier. The more people are asked to reason globally, it seems, the more they are driven to feel locally.

Heavy Demand for Blue-Chip Issues Pushes Dow Up 116

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market snapped a weeklong slump late yesterday and sent most indexes sharply higher, creating another upward loop in Wall Street's roller coaster ascent this year.
Investors overlooked weakness in technology and small-cap stocks to funnel money into blue-chip issues, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up 116.83 points, or 1.3 percent, to 9,171.48. It was the average's biggest gain in nearly two months and left it about 40 points away from the May 13 record. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 9.54 points, or nearly 1 percent, to close at 1,119.06. But the Nasdaq composite index, heavily weighted with technology stocks, fell 14.12 points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent, to close at 1,831.75.
The technology decline partly reflected the impact of Dell Computer's Tuesday release of first-quarter earnings, which were less robust than some investors had expected. But there was no clear catalyst for the rally in other stocks.
Some analysts suggested it represented a delayed reaction to news Tuesday that the Federal Reserve had chosen not to raise short-term interest rates, signaling its belief that inflation remains subdued. That view was reinforced yesterday, when the Government said the nation's trade deficit hit a six-year high in March, partly because of weakness in Asia, another sign that interest rates will not rise anytime soon.
Other strategists said yesterday's rally was simply another example of the market's bullish appetite, one that has created a nation of stock market enthusiasts eager to ride the momentum of higher prices.
"We've had perfect conditions: low interest rates, positive earnings and no signs of inflation," said Mary Farrell, an investment strategist at Paine Webber. "And so the tone of the market has been very positive."
Even a slowdown in earnings growth has failed to significantly slow the stock market locomotive. Already this year, the Dow average is up 16 percent, and the S.& P. 500 is up 15.3 percent, well ahead of last year's pace, despite first-quarter earnings growth of just 1.5 percent.
"People believe that stocks are the best game in town," Ms. Farrell said. "There are few alternatives."
That kind of sentiment has been expressed again and again in 1998, a year few strategists expected to show double-digit stock returns.
Much of the rally's energy developed after 2:30 P.M., when the Dow began its ascent, rising more than 100 points on demand for shares in Walt Disney, McDonald's, General Electric and American Express. All are part of the widely mimicked portfolio of Warren E. Buffett, the multibillionaire investor.
Still, a wide array of stocks fell yesterday, including smaller issues that make up the Russell 2000 index, which was down a half percentage point, and the S.& P. 400 index of midsize companies, down four-tenths of a percent. Blue chips -- shares of the biggest and strongest corporations -- were in greatest demand.
Indeed, this year, nearly four out of five S.& P. 500 stocks have seen solid gains, and companies like Dell -- despite yesterday's weakness -- are the rage. Dell, a public company for just six years, is now worth $58 billion, eclipsing McDonald's, at $45 billion. Lucent Technology now valued at $93 billion, is worth nearly as much as AT&T, its former parent.
There are strategists, however, who insist that the market remains extremely overvalued, a bubble that will eventually burst. Their warnings appear largely unheeded.
"Over-valuations don't end bull markets," said Michael Metz, a strategist at CIBC Oppenheimer, who said that he would no longer offer commentary on the stock market. "I've always known that, but I fought it. Basically, I'm just out of sync with the market. It's not a value market, it's a momentum market."

Bonds Rally
By Bloomberg News
Bonds rallied yesterday after the Government reported the widest trade deficit in six years because of Asian economic weakness, a sign that inflation in the United States will remain benign.
The 30-year Treasury bond rose 19/32, to 103 9/32. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, eased to 5.89 percent from 5.93.
Asia is "just working out perfectly for the U.S. economy," said Eric Cheung, who manages $2.8 billion of bonds at the Wilmington Trust Corporation in Wilmington, Del.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Rose in March To New High

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
The nation's monthly trade deficit rose to a new high of $13 billion in March, the Government reported today, providing the clearest evidence yet of how Asia's mounting economic woes are restraining American growth for good and for ill.
The trade gap, the widest since the Commerce Department adopted its current measurement system in 1992, was considerably higher than economists had expected and represented the fourth consecutive monthly increase. The deficit in February was $12.2 billion. 
 The report showed the economy being buffeted, sometimes in contradictory ways, by the fallout from the financial crisis that sent Asia into a tailspin last year and has led to the current political upheaval in Indonesia.
The figures showed that exports from the United States remained weak, hurting many manufacturers and farmers but helping restrain the economy, which had been threatening to overheat.
At the same time imports surged, helping hold down prices of many goods even as American companies were being forced by low unemployment rates to increase pay.
Wall Street interpreted the report as modest good news. Bond prices rose, pushing down interest rates, as inflation fears subsided somewhat. Stock prices rose as well, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at 9171.48, up 116.83.
With the United States enjoying the eighth year of economic expansion at a time much of the rest of the world has been struggling, the trade deficit's growth is to some degree a mark of strength, reflecting robust demand for goods and services from both consumers and companies.
But today's figures showed a growing deterioration in trade with Asia, a development that if not eventually slowed or reversed could do more harm than good to the American economy.
The deficit in merchandise trade with Pacific Rim nations grew to $12.1 billion in March from $10.5 billion in February and from $6.8 billion in March 1997. For the first three months of the year, the deficit with the Pacific Rim was $34.3 billion, $10 billion higher than for the period a year earlier.
The merchandise trade deficit with Japan expanded to $5.8 billion in March from $5.3 billion a month earlier. It was not seasonally adjusted. The Clinton Administration has been pressing the Japanese to do more to revive their moribund economy and open their markets to imports, both to ease trade tension with the United States and help other Asian countries recover.
The deficit with Indonesia, a land likely to experience deeper economic trouble until its political turmoil is resolved, increased to $509 million in March from $494 million in February. Exports to Indonesia have been hit particularly hard. In March 1997, American manufacturers exported $365 million of goods there; by this March, the figure had dropped by more than half, to $168 million.
Trade deficits with China, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan also increased.
"The March trade data clearly indicated that the negative effects of Asia's problems on the U.S. were becoming increasingly pronounced in March versus the first two months of the year," said Maury N. Harris, an economist with Paine Webber in New York.
The figures also showed a sharp deterioration in the trade deficit with Western Europe, to $1.6 billion in March from $290 million in February. Economists said that surge appeared to reflect deliveries of Airbus Industrie planes to the United States as well as increased automobile imports, especially from Germany.
Just how much the growing trade deficit will do to dampen inflation and keep the economy on its course of modest but consistent growth remains a subject of considerable debate among economists and policy makers at the Federal Reserve.
Trade accounts for about 15 percent of the gross domestic product, enough to exert a considerable influence. Economists said that because of the weak March trade figures, they expected the Government to revise down by a quarter- to a half-point an initial estimate that the economy grew at a 4.2 percent rate in the first three months of the year.
"The trade deficit will slow G.D.P. growth in the United States by roughly one-half of a percentage point this year," said Howard Lewis, an economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. "With much of Asia still mired in recession, and with Japan stagnating after several failed attempts at recovery, the deficit with Asia will get worse before it gets any better."
But for every sign that the economy is slowing, there is another suggesting that growth will continue at sufficiently strong levels that inflation will remain a threat. Unemployment, at 4.3 percent, is considered extremely low. Consumer spending has remained healthy, and the surge in cheap imports is likely to help it remain so. And while many companies are being hurt by the reduced demand from Asia, a general optimism remains about the domestic economy. There are also signs that European economies are bouncing back.
The Federal Reserve voted on Tuesday to keep short-term interest rates steady in hopes that demand would sufficiently ease to avoid a resurgence in inflation. But Fed officials have been increasingly divided over whether they can count on the trade situation to slow the economy without a rate increase.
"The $64,000 question is whether the trade deficit will be enough to cool the economy and keep the Fed on hold," said Michael Fenollosa, an economist with John Hancock, the insurance company.
The Commerce Department said that exports in March totaled $79.4 billion, up from $76.9 billion in February, and that March imports came to $92.4 billion, up from $89.1 billion the previous month.
Much of the increase in exports resulted from a rebound in deliveries to foreign countries of Boeing airliners, suggesting that the underlying export picture was weaker than it appeared. The value of imports was also held down by a drop in oil prices.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
A paging company faces problems in the heavens and on earth.

BYLINE: By Carol Marie Cropper 

DATELINE: PLANO, Tex.

 BODY:
SUDDENLY, the beepers didn't work.
A space accident sent a satellite spinning out of control on Tuesday, disrupting service for many pagers, cellular phones and some television transmissions. As companies scrambled to get on-ground transmitters tuned to a backup satellite yesterday, investors in Paging Network Inc. must have wondered, "What else can go wrong?" 
 The company, the leader in paging services nationwide, has suffered continuing losses and management turmoil, and its future remains hazy in a business whose growth is questionable, at best.
John P. Frazee Jr., Paging Network's top executive, said yesterday that the company expected to restore service to more than half of its customers by today and that 90 percent of its customers would be back in action by Friday. But lost revenue from the disruption may be less a concern than a lost confidence in pagers' reliability from consumers who today have many communications choices.
Paging Network's strategy in recent years was to lower prices to win over customers and to borrow heavily for technology investment and business expansion. But deepening losses and mounting debt torpedoed the stock, which fell from a high of $28.75 in 1996 to brush $6 in April 1997.
So last August, the board replaced the founder and chairman, George M. Perrin, and the chief executive, Glenn W. Marschel, its second in two years. Mr. Frazee, a disgruntled board member who ran the Centel Corporation before it was sold to Sprint, took over as chairman and chief executive, and began cutting costs and raising prices.
"You can't keep telling your share owners that their economic value is improving when you're mired in a sea of red ink," he said in a recent interview at his company's offices in Plano, a suburb north of Dallas.
In February, he announced a major revamping that includes eliminating 30 percent of the company's 6,000 workers while adding 800 sales people and consolidating numerous support and administrative functions. Scaling back the former chairman's real estate budget, he has also scrapped plans for an impressive headquarters building.
As for the widespread service disruption, Mr. Frazee said yesterday that it was in part a result of the low prices in the industry. By raising prices, the industry could build a more robust network, he said.
His revamping plan has bolstered Paging Network's stock, which has flirted with $16 but fell 25 cents yesterday on news of the service disruption to close at $14.125. Many stock analysts continue to foresee a higher stock price, with optimists predicting levels of $20 or more next year.
But Paging Network is a risky investment -- a company in a slowing industry that will have to transform itself to compete in this hot stock market.
Fears that paging products will soon be obsolete are not new. Paging did not die with the introduction of cellular phones in the early 1980's despite such predictions. "Bottom line is, there's always going to be a market for the low end, and paging is the low end," said Perry Walter, who follows wireless communications companies for Robinson-Humphrey. A cell phone in the briefcase can cost more than $40 a month, while a pager on the belt can be had for as little as $6 a month.
Growth, though, has tapered off in the United States. The number of pagers grew 28 percent a year in the early 1990's but less than 13 percent last year. Early in the next century, annual growth will fall below 5 percent, Credit Suisse First Boston predicts. Paging Network now serves 10.3 million of the nation's 46 million pager subscribers. If it maintains that 22 percent share of the market, it could expect to have about 13.6 million of the total 62 million subscribers that Credit Suisse projects for 2004.
It dwarfs most of its competitors, which include the Arch Communications Group, Mobile Media Communications, Airtouch Communications, Metrocall Inc. and Pagemart Wireless Inc., though a couple of mergers could drastically alter the landscape.
Looking for more rapid growth, Paging Network has started to expand abroad, namely in Canada and Spain. This month, it announced an exclusive agreement with Iridium North America to offer pagers that can pick up satellite-relayed signals anywhere in the world.
On the technology front, it has had less success. Last year's big technology bet, Voicenow, proved to be a costly mistake. Voicenow, a large pager, conveys a spoken message, not just a phone number, effectively functioning as a mobile answering machine. Customers complained that the pagers were too big, too expensive and too limited in their geographic range. Pagenet trimmed its plans for the service after investing $600 million.
All is not lost, says Mr. Frazee, who adds that the added capacity from the radio spectrum that was purchased for Voicenow will now be used for alternative services. The company is already steering customers toward alphanumeric pagers that pass along written messages as well as phone numbers.
And in April, it added two-way paging. Customers use a device a bit fatter than a cosmetics compact, complete with tiny keyboard, to type and send replies to text messages they receive. The device costs $360, and monthly service begins at $25.
Mr. Frazee seems most enthusiastic about remaking his company into an information provider. Paging Network is scooping up exclusive contracts to transmit everything from CNN news reports to Forbes business columns over pagers. The information services will have bigger profit margins, Mr. Frazee says, helping what has been a dismal bottom line.
Since going public in 1991, the company has failed to report a profitable year. It lost $151.4 million in 1997, on top of a $128 million loss the previous year. Revenues, meanwhile, grew 19 percent last year to $839.5 million, and its long-term debt totaled $1.8 billion at the end of the year.
The revamping should cut $45 million to $55 million a year in costs, Mr. Frazee said. Meanwhile, the extra sales force, the new technology and the higher prices will add $75 million in annual revenue, he projects.
Mr. Frazee declined to predict when the company might celebrate its first year in the black. Cynthia M. Motz, a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst who likes the stock, said a profit might not appear until 2001.
But, ultimately, Paging Network's future depends on its ability to find new markets.

HEADLINE: Chinese Delegation Seems to Deny Pakistan a Nuclear Umbrella

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 20

 BODY:
As Pakistani leaders struggled to decide whether to conduct a nuclear test in response to India's recent tests, a high-level delegation from Pakistan slipped quietly into Beijing early Monday. Today, just as quietly, it left.
The Chinese officials played down the meeting, calling it a "routine consultation between our two foreign ministries." But diplomats in Islamabad had said the Pakistani Foreign Minister, Shamshad Ahmed, who led the group, was hoping to get a guarantee of nuclear protection should India attack. Such a declaration, some Western diplomats had hoped, would help persuade Pakistan not to carry out a nuclear test of its own. 
 What Foreign Minister Ahmed brought back to Pakistan was far less: On returning to Islamabad, he announced that China would not impose economic sanctions should Pakistan conduct a nuclear test. But China has made no public promises of nuclear protection.
Indeed, Chinese Government experts said that although China is sympathetic to its longtime ally, it is very unlikely to make Pakistan such an offer and will probably quietly oppose any Pakistani test.
Although Chinese officials have not joined Western nations in publicly urging Pakistan to refrain from testing, they have condemned India's tests and pointedly restated their opposition to nuclear testing.
"China will not encourage Pakistan to conduct its own nuclear test, and China is not a country that provides nuclear umbrellas to other countries," said a senior researcher at a Chinese Government research institute, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Pakistanis' pilgrimage to China underscores a new and delicate role for China, experts said. The Indian tests have tested its ability to juggle the needs of longtime friends like Pakistan alongside the demands of important nations like the United States and India, with which China has been trying to improve ties.
"China's challenge is to reassure Pakistan that they'll stand by it without inflaming relations with India or the U.S.," said Robert S. Ross, a China expert at Boston College.
China has been Pakistan's main supplier of military technology, particularly for missiles. This sharing has been a chronic irritant in Beijing's relations with the United States, as well as India. At the same time, however, the Chinese clearly place great value on their developing relationship with India.
"China has now readjusted its policies in south Asia so that it now places equal importance on relations with India and Pakistan," said Shang Hui Peng, a professor at Beijing University. "I think that's very important for regional security."
Some Chinese experts said that although the relationship between China and India had remained somewhat strained, they were surprised to hear India's leaders say a threat from China had necessitated nuclear testing and that India had instead used the pretext of a threat from China as an excuse to test.
"Since the world has come out for disarmament, it's no longer acceptable to say we're testing because we're a great power and want to be part of the nuclear club," said a former Chinese official. "Much better to say there's this big nuclear power on our border so we have to."
But he said China's "strong reaction" to the tests had also been "quite cautious" in the hope that ties with India could be preserved.

HEADLINE: Visiting Nuclear Site, Indian Leader Puts Pakistan on Notice

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 20

 BODY:
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today visited the site of India's nuclear tests and put Pakistan on notice that it should adopt a more conciliatory attitude that recognizes India's newly enhanced military power.
"We want peaceful co-existence but the frequent threats to security forced India to conduct the nuclear tests to silence its enemies and show its strength," Mr. Vajpayee told soldiers at a camp near Pokharan, the testing range in the northwestern desert where India conducted five underground nuclear tests last week. 
 The Indian leader's assertive posture followed similar warnings to Pakistan by the Home Minister, Lal Krishna Advani. Today, for the second time in 36 hours, Mr. Advani told Pakistan to ease pressures on India from Pakistani-backed insurgents in the disputed territory of Kashmir, or face what Mr. Advani called "a pro-active" response. He did not say what that might be.
The statements by India's two most powerful political leaders lent new significance to the nuclear tests. The tests were initially presented as a defensive measure intended to allow India to ward off nuclear threats from Pakistan, which has had a covert nuclear weapons program for 25 years, and from China.
But the warnings to Pakistan and the reminders today that India sees itself as a nuclear power seemed aimed at shifting the region's strategic balance in India's favor. The nuclear tests appear increasingly to have been motivated at least in part by the Hindu nationalism that guides the Vajpayee Government.
The Indian statements were bound to heighten tensions with Pakistan, which has been weighing pressures from the United States and other nations not to conduct its own nuclear test against domestic political demands to match India.
Prime Minister Vajpayee was only 70 miles from Pakistan's border today when he visited the nuclear testing range with a group that included the Defense Minister, George Fernandes, and the top two scientists involved in the tests, Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam and Dr. Rajagopal Chidambaram. The group included Indian reporters, but excluded non-Indian foreign correspondents.
Coverage of the visit on Indian television showed Mr. Vajpayee walking around what was identified as the largest of the craters made by the tests, a deep depression in the desert that India's state broadcasting network said was at least 40 feet deep and 1,000 feet across.
Mr. Vajpayee, 72, was shown in a baseball cap emblazoned with the code word used for the tests, shakti, a Hindu word meaning power. He addressed troops and officials, calling the tests "this marvelous achievement that has amazed the world."
The Prime Minister accused Western nations that have imposed economic sanctions on India, including the United States, of hypocrisy. "The West argued that while they could have nuclear weapons, we couldn't," he said. "Why? What crime have we committed?"
He added: "We had to conduct these tests to show our strength after these countries paid no heed to our pleadings that they stop manufacturing nuclear weapons that intimidate others. They continued to build their nuclear arsenal, and they never listened to us. The kind of arsenal they have can destroy this world many times over."

HEADLINE: Behind the Low Oil Prices

 BODY:
The United States is getting a bonanza from sliding oil prices, which have boosted economic growth and helped to mask the deteriorating trade deficit with the rest of the world. But if oil prices rebound later this year, as the oil industry generally expects, that economic benefit could vanish.
The trade figures are bad even with the benefit of lower oil prices. Yesterday the Commerce Department reported March figures, showing the largest monthly trade deficit in goods and services in at least a decade, of $13 billion. But it could have been worse, as a 5.2 percent increase in the cost of non-petroleum goods was offset by a 6 percent fall in the cost of imported oil. 
 In American markets, the price of crude oil fell below $13 a barrel this week, a decline of more than $8 since last fall. Taking inflation into account, the real price is the lowest in more than two decades.
The falling price reflects both the economic woes racking Asia, which had been a rapidly growing user of energy, and a relatively warm winter in many areas. But the price also reflects heavy production from oil producers. Frederick P. Leuffer, an analyst at Bear Stearns, suggests that Saudi Arabia has engineered a glut to raise its market share, discourage exploration and delay alternative energy sources.
The full benefit of the fall in oil prices has not been passed on to consumers. Instead, oil refiners have been able to raise their profit margins. But the decline has nonetheless served as a stimulus to the American economy.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to try to stem the price slide when it meets on June 24. If it succeeds, that could put a damper on American economic growth.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Climbs to New High

 BODY:
The nation's monthly trade deficit reached a new high of $13 billion in March, the Government reported, providing the clearest evidence yet how Asia's mounting economic woes are restraining American growth for good and for ill.
The trade gap, the widest since the Commerce Department adopted its current measurement system in 1992, was considerably higher than economists had expected and represented the fourth consecutive monthly increase. The deficit in February was $12.2 billion. 
 The report showed the economy being buffeted, sometimes in contradictory ways, by the fallout from the financial crisis that sent Asia into a tailspin last year and led to the current political upheaval in Indonesia.
With Asian consumers forced to cut back, American exports remained weak, hurting many manufacturers and farmers but helping cool the economy, which had been threatening to overheat.

HEADLINE: In New York, Emotional Fallout From India's Nuclear Tests

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
In the week since India's Hindu-nationalist Government staged five nuclear tests, the discussion among Indian and Pakistani immigrants in the New York area has sounded at times like debate over a high-stakes soccer match, with a mix of pride, excitement and rivalry.
Among some Pakistanis, there was a heady rush of competitiveness. After an Urdu-language newspaper reported that a nuclear test by Pakistan in response was imminent, a steady stream of immigrants filed into the whitewashed booths of a phone center in Jackson Heights, Queens, calling home to make sure they had not missed the news. (Pakistan so far has not conducted a test.) 
 "They're keeping in touch with their families, to find out if there's been a test," said Ali Hyder, as he presided over the stream of 59-cents-a-minute calls during the weekend from behind a glass booth. "There's no fear, no nervousness. Just excitement. Pakistan people, they have been waiting for this test from long ago."
Among some Indians, there was the giddy pride of expatriates -- delight not only at the news of their country's having joined the world's elite nuclear club, but also at having outsmarted American intelligence in the process. "That makes us feel very, very good," said Arish Sahani, an insurance salesman from Corona, Queens. "That's smart, you know?"
In many ways, the debates among Indian and Pakistani immigrants in the New York metropolitan area -- home to more than 200,000 immigrants from the two countries -- have mirrored the discussions on the subcontinent itself. Many Indians, echoing the sentiments of India's Government, the Bharatiya Janata Party, speak of the need to guard against potential aggression from China and Pakistan, while Pakistanis complain about Indian aggression in the border state of Kashmir.
On both sides, there are voices of dissent. Itty Abraham, a native of India and the author of a forthcoming book on the making of the Indian atomic bomb, said he hoped that Pakistan would conduct its own tests soon. "As much as I find that a mad way of looking at the world, that's the dominant logic of the current moment," he said. "The B.J.P. doing it really should cause a lot of concern to a lot of people."
A protest demonstration is planned in front of the Indian Consulate in New York on Friday.
In the New York area, Indian and Pakistani immigrants sometimes live and work side by side. They shop at the same markets with familiar awnings that boast of Indo-Pak specialties. Many of their American children now refer to themselves as South Asian, rather than being from one country or another.
Still, the divisions of the subcontinent remain a powerful force among the immigrants. Love or even close friendship across national lines is relatively rare. And the latest atomic enmities have not exactly brought the two immigrant groups closer together.
Mohammed Bashir, a Pakistani bodega clerk in Midwood, Brooklyn, said he simply avoids the topic in conversations with his Indian acquaintances. "We have good relations," Mr. Bashir, 52, said, sitting behind the counter of a deli called Kashmir. "I don't talk about this at all."
But for immigrants who, for years, have been far removed from the subcontinent, the nuclear question is more about symbols than about the tangible questions of peace, security and sanctions. For Indian immigrants who complain of being maligned as natives of a poor, illiterate nation and who feel marginalized in the public culture of the United States, the success of India's nuclear tests last week seemed to offer a sense of vindication.
"Many of the average Americans, they do not know what is India," complained Shanker Shetty, a commodities trader from Massapequa Park, N.Y. "All this time they thought India is of no consequence. Now, they know. India belongs to the nuclear club. They'll think differently about Indians. They'll think differently about Indian-Americans."
But what about economic sanctions from abroad? "Even though the people are starving, to some extent," said Mr. Shetty, 59, "national security is very, very important."
But there were also dissenters on both sides. At Butala Emporium, a Jackson Heights shop that specializes in books and religious items, the owner, Bhadra Butala, 54, shook his head at talk of bombs and bravado. He described himself as a follower of Mohandas K. Gandhi's principles of nonviolence and said he was opposed to nuclear weapons anywhere, including in his native India.
"People are proud of this?" he said of his compatriots. "They don't know what is the result of the bomb. They don't care."
His thoughts were echoed by a Pakistani immigrant waiting for a booth at Call Time, the international calling center down the street. Akhter Shamshair, 34, did not call himself a Gandhian. But he said he hoped that Pakistan would refrain from conducting its own blasts and use Indian tests instead as leverage to demand economic and political aid.
"India made a mistake, so why should Pakistan do the same?" asked Mr. Shamshair. "This is the best chance for us to make America a friend."

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Won't Reduce Service On Subway Lines in Summer

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
With the introduction of new fare incentives sending thousands of additional riders pouring onto city subways and buses, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will not reduce subway and some bus service schedules this summer for the first time in decades, a transit official said yesterday.
In the past, subway and bus service has been cut by 10 percent during July and August while students and workers vacationed. 
 The move, disclosed yesterday by a transit official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, comes a month after rider advocates and union officials criticized transit administrators for failing to effectively deal with overcrowding that resulted from new fare incentives.
Free transfers between subways and buses, a free ride with every $15 Metrocard purchase and a robust economy have increased bus ridership by roughly 20 percent compared with a year ago, transit officials said.
Gene Russianoff, a lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a riders advocacy group, said the summer move was a good first step, but he warned that the real crowding would come in the fall after the introduction of new daily, weekly and monthly fares in July.
"We expect the really big crunch to come in September when people come back after Labor Day," he said. "This doesn't have any effect on that."
But the transit official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the tristate agency was adequately planning for the fall. "This is part of the overall plan," the official said. "What we're doing is gearing up for the expected crush in the fall."
The transit official and union officials said they could not recall a time when bus and subway service was not decreased during July and August. Workers going on vacation and the lack of students commuting to school traditionally decreases ridership, they said.
But the transit official said that there would be no reduction in subway service this summer. And there will be no reduction on bus routes where service has been increased over the last year.
Exact totals were not available last night, but the transit authority increased service on 32 of its 220 bus routes in March and is set to increase service on an additional 46 routes next month. But bus routes that traditionally serve students will be reduced for the summer, the transit official said.
Last month, rider advocates and union officials said transit officials were responsible for an increase in subway crowding and "bus bunching" because of poor planning. The so-called bunching occurs when buses on the same route get caught in traffic and arrive at certain stops at the same time, creating long gaps in service and sometimes no room for passengers.

HEADLINE: THE FALL OF SUHARTO: THE POLICY;
Clinton Welcomes Suharto's Exit but Says Indonesia Still Needs 'a Real Democratic Change'

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
President Clinton tonight welcomed the resignation of President Suharto of Indonesia but said that the nation still needed to begin "a real democratic transition" that "enjoys broad public support."
"The United States stands ready to support Indonesia as it engages in democratic changes," the statement said. "We welcome President Suharto's decision, which provides an opportunity to begin a process leading to real democratic transition for Indonesia." 
 Despite the optimistic tone of the President Clinton's statement, Administration officials said that the United States was still alarmed about the political situation in Indonesia, and especially about initial suggestions that President Suharto's successor, B. J. Habibie, might attempt to serve out the remaining five years of Mr. Suharto's term.
They said the appointment of President Habibie did not satisfy the demands of the United States -- and of Indonesia's anti-Government protesters -- for a democratic transition of power involving new elections.
"In the end, this will probably satisfy nobody," said an Administration official involved in Indonesia policy, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "We have to look beyond Habibie because no one will accept him as President for more than a short time. It's a handful of army generals who will now determine what happens."
Administration officials described Mr. Habibie as clearly unsuited to the role of Indonesia's President, given his unorthodox economic views and close association with President Suharto, who was seen as almost a father to Mr. Habibie.
Daniel Lev, a professor of political science at the University of Washington and an expert on Indonesia, said that President Habibie "has almost no support anywhere in society" and that his appointment as President will strike fear into the hearts of Western economists and international investors. "Comparing Suharto and Habibie is like comparing two rotten apples," he said.
Jeffrey A. Winters, a political scientist at Northwestern University who is also a specialist on Indonesia, said that "President Habibie is a disaster for Indonesia."
"He has a staggering track record of nepotism and collusion and all of the other things that were the hallmarks of the Suharto era," he said. "Habibie is a protege of Suharto's and he represents continuity -- and continuity is not a resolution of the problem."
President Habibie, a 61-year-old German-trained aeronautical engineer, is viewed by many in Indonesia and abroad as Indonesia's loose cannon -- a technological whiz, and economic eccentric who had little power base in Indonesia beyond his association with President Suharto.
Mr. Habibie was formally elected Vice President in March. But when his name was first floated for Vice President two months earlier, investors panicked and the value of the Indonesian currency, the rupiah, fell 35 percent in one week.
The International Monetary Fund, which is responsible for Western-led bailout of the Indonesian economy, has described President Habibie as a man "whose devotion to new ways of doing things is limited."
Administration officials said the future of Indonesia might now come down to a battle -- played either on the streets of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, or preferably in the back rooms of the military headquarters -- between Defense Minister Wiranto and Gen. Prabowo, the head of an elite army corps who is Mr. Suharto's son-in-law.
Professor Lev said that Indonesia now faced "a very dangerous situation," with a President who has almost no standing within the Indonesian public and two rival generals at the head of the military.
He said that General Prabowo was especially unpredictable and might move quickly to try to assume power, forcing a clash that could split the military.
"Out of sheer narcissism, he might try to move too fast," Professor Lev said. The best hope for a peaceful resolution, he said, was that "because they are all army people and share some interests, they might sit down and try to divide up the spoils."
Although there was no suggestion tonight of a link between President Suharto's decision to resign and events in Washington, the Indonesian leader's announcement came only hours after the Clinton Administration gave broad hints that it wanted President Suharto to go.
While he did not issue an explicit call for his resignation, the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said that the Clinton Administration backed a "democratic political transition" in Indonesia and that it "should be undertaken swiftly because the needs are great."
"It appears that enormous and significant change is about to occur in Indonesia," he said. "It's quite clear that the people of Indonesia take that need for transition seriously."
In a speech to graduates of the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today that President Suharto faced "an opportunity for an historic act of statesmanship" and should "preserve his legacy" by providing for an orderly transition.
Other Administration officials said that the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon were considering contingency plans to offer exile to President Suharto -- or at least, safe transportation out of Indonesia aboard an American military plane -- if his hasty departure might avert more bloodshed in a nation that has never known a peaceful transfer of power.

HEADLINE: THE FALL OF SUHARTO: THE SUCCESSOR;
New President, With High-Tech Background, Brings Confidence: His Own

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Thursday, May 21

 BODY:
One of President Suharto's last worries before deciding to step down today as President was that his longtime friend and hand-picked Vice President, B. J. Habibie, would not be up to the job he inherits, an associate of Mr. Habibie's said today.
"They had a long meeting and Habibie assured him he could handle it," said the associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
 Not everyone shares his confidence.
Mr. Habibie, a 61-year-old former aeronautical engineer, is one of Mr. Suharto's longest-serving Cabinet members, but he has spent most of his public career as Minister of Research and Technology, taking little part in affairs of state.
He has a reputation as a brilliant eccentric, a man of grandiose ideas and expensive, often ill-conceived projects, fascinated by high technology in a nation of agriculture and primary industries.
He has never built a strong political base, secure in the patronage of the one man who counted, Mr. Suharto, who virtually adopted him as a boy of 13 and has enjoyed his company ever since.
Free to indulge his enthusiasms, he has made more enemies than friends. He has alienated many officers in the politically influential military by imposing expensive and unwanted procurement schemes. He is an odd man out among top Indonesian officials in that he has no military background.
Both at home and abroad, Mr. Habibie is also mistrusted among economists and foreign investors for what they say are his unorthodox and sometimes wild-eyed theories.
Mr. Habibie does have some influence among the country's Moslem majority as the director of an influential nationalist Moslem institute.
In the manner of a man who never intended to give up power, Mr. Suharto has never allowed a potential successor to emerge, changing his Vice Presidents with each of his seven six-year terms. Mr. Habibie has held the post for only two months, since the last election in mid-March. On the day Mr. Suharto made it clear in January that Mr. Habibie would be his choice for the job -- at the height of the country's economic difficulties and its negotiations with the International Monetary Fund over economic policy -- the Indonesian currency, the rupiah, crashed by 36 percent, to its lowest level since the crisis began last summer.
He had recently been in the news when the International Monetary Fund insisted, as one of the requirements for the country's receipt of a $40 billion economic rescue package, that the Government withdraw financing from an expensive and money-losing aircraft-building project that was his brainchild. His enthusiasms have included ship building and power.
Since assuming the Vice Presidential job, Mr. Habibie has acted as an emissary of the President to foreign capitals, though he did not succeed in his first mission, an attempt to win easier debt-repayment terms in Japan.
Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie -- who is commonly known by his initials but whose friends call him Rudy -- was born on June 25, 1936, in South Sulawesi, the third of four children, and began reading the Koran as a child.
His father died when he was 13 and his family moved to Bandung, where Mr. Suharto was posted as a military commander, and Mr. Habibie became part of the Suharto household.
The two men have remained close, and Mr. Habibie likes to refer to his mentor as S.G.S., or Super Genius Suharto.
Within the Government he has earned some resentment for his ability to ignore the President's busy schedule and burst into his office at any time, Government officials say. "He regards me as his own parent," Mr. Suharto wrote in his biography. "He always seeks out my advice on the principles of life."
Mr. Habibie graduated from a local technical institute and won a scholarship to study in Germany, where he earned a doctorate in aeronautical engineering.
He stayed on to work at a German aircraft plant until Mr. Suharto called him home in 1974 to be his technical consultant.
His influence has grown since he became technology minister in 1978, and he has put forward unusual economic ideas including what he calls a "zig-zag theory" in which he advocates sharp fluctuations in interest rates. He has blamed inflation on high interest rates.
He is a man of great energy, many ideas and many projects, most prominently the state-owned aircraft manufacturer, I.P.T.N., which has been struggling to develop a locally built passenger jet at a cost of $2 billion.
It was widely viewed as one of many ill-advised enterprises handed out by Mr. Suharto to his family and friends.
Although state support was cut off in last week's agreement with the I.M.F., Mr. Suharto later said the project would continue with private financing, though it was unclear where the money would come from given the country's economic problems.
A small man, he is described by associates as always being on the move, like a hummingbird.
He is sometimes called "the busiest man in Indonesia" because of his many projects.

Pressure on President Suharto to resign has been steadily rising. Here is a look at the rise and fall of Indonesia's longest serving ruler.
 
The early years
 
JUNE 8, 1921 -- Suharto born into a poor farming family on Java, Indonesia's main island.
1940 -- Starts military training under Dutch colonial administration.
1945 -- Joins revolutionaries under nationalist leader Sukarno who declares an independent Indonesian republic and becomes president.
1949 -- Dutch withdraw, ending four centuries of colonial rule.
 
Suharto comes to power
 
1965 -- General Suharto routs communist forces who killed six senior generals in an alleged coup attempt. Estimated 500,000 people killed in back-lash against Communists. Chaos spills across the country.
1966 -- Sukarno, politically crippled, essentially cedes power to Suharto, who has the military's backing.
1967 -- Sukarno placed under house arrest; Suharto becomes acting President.
1968 -- Suharto appointed President.
 
A strong hand during economic revival ...
 
1975 -- Suharto orders the invasion of former Portuguese colony of East Timor. Pro-independence rebels still fight Indonesian forces.
1980s -- Suharto modernizes Indonesia's economy, resulting in fast growth rates and industrialization.
 
... but unrest brings his 30 year reign to a swift end
 
1996 -- Riots erupt when police storm the Jakarta headquarters of a minority party headed by opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri, Sukarno's eldest daughter.
APRIL 28, 1996 -- Suharto's wife, Madame Tien, dies of a heart attack.
JULY 1997 -- Asian currencies begin tumbling in value after Thailand devalues the baht under speculative attack. Indonesia's rupiah crumbles.
OCT. 1997 -- Indonesia applies for assistance from the International Monetary Fund and receives $43 billion.
DEC. 1997 -- Doctors order Suharto to rest after lengthy overseas trip. Financial markets, already battered by Southeast Asia financial crisis, plummet amid rumors he is seriously ill or dead.
MARCH 1998 -- Suharto appointed to seventh five-year term.
Protests begin
 
APRIL -- University students whose job prospects are dashed by the economic crisis hold near-daily protests demanding Suharto's resignation.
MAY 4 -- Government rolls back fuel subsidies as I.M.F. requires, sending gasoline prices up 71 percent in one day. At least two killed in street riots in northern city of Medan targeting ethnic Chinese shop owners. At least two more die in student-related violence.
MAY 12 -- Security forces fire into a peaceful protest at Jakarta's Trisakti University, killing six students and wounding several.
MAY 13 -- Funerals are held for the dead, followed by rioting.
MAY 14 -- Riots intensify and spread through much of Jakarta. Hundreds of buildings are burned and ransacked. Worried foreigners jam Jakarta airport.
MAY 15 -- Hundreds of looters burned to death when rioters set fire to four shopping malls.
MAY 16 -- Military announces rioting death toll tops 500. Suharto announces plans to reshuffle Cabinet, make some reforms. U.S. Embassy begins eva-cuating Americans; other governments announce evacuation plans.
MAY 18 -- Suharto loses support of top Parliament allies, but keeps the all-important backing of Indonesia's powerful military.
MAY 20 -- Suharto announces he will hold new elections and not run for President.

HEADLINE: THE FALL OF SUHARTO: THE OVERVIEW;
SUHARTO, BESIEGED, STEPS DOWN AFTER 32-YEAR RULE IN INDONESIA

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Thursday, May 21

 BODY:
President Suharto apologized for his mistakes and resigned today after 32 years in power, handing over his office to his Vice President, B. J. Habibie, in a nationally televised ceremony.
After his brief statement of resignation, he turned the microphone toward Mr. Habibie, who immediately took the oath of office as a judge held the Koran above Mr. Habibie's head. 
 Mr. Suharto then stepped up, shook Mr. Habibie's hand, smiled and walked down a line of judges, smiling and shaking their hands. He gave a small salute to the onlookers and walked away.
Throughout the brief and painful ceremony this morning, Mr. Suharto never lost the gentle smile with which he had addressed his people for the past three decades. He concluded, "I'll say thank you very much for your support and I am sorry for my mistakes, and I hope the Indonesian country will live forever."
As he gave way to the mounting domestic and international pressure to resign, Mr. Suharto, 76, was careful, as always, to couch his action in constitutional terms, and said power would be transferred to the Vice President under legal procedures. He made no mention of any election, as he had proposed earlier this week, and said that Mr. Habibie would serve out the remainder of Mr. Suharto's term, which ends in 2003.
 In Washington late Wednesday, President Clinton welcomed the resignation of President Suharto but said the nation still needed to begin "a real democratic transition" that "enjoys broad public support." His statement came just hours after Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright publicly called for Mr. Suharto to step down. Page A8.
Although Mr. Suharto has suggested that he might act as an elder statesmen, he gave no indication today of his future role. Mr. Habibie, 61, Mr. Suharto's longtime adviser and Minister of Research and Technology, has little independent political base and has depended throughout his career of Mr. Suharto.
Student protesters, who reacted jubilantly to Mr. Suharto's announcement, had been demanding the President's resignation for three months with protests that culminated this week when they occupied Parliament.
They had also indicated that they would not be satisfied by the installation of Mr. Habibie, who has little support within the powerful military and has antagonized economists and foreign investors.
At the ceremony, Mr. Suharto said his decision was "based on my understanding that reforms must be carried out peacefully and constitutionally for the sake of the unity."
Then, looking down at his text, he said, "I read this statement today, Thursday, May 21, 1998, my resigation statement as the President of Indonesia."
The officials and reporters gathered in the reception room in his official residence appeared to hold their breath as he spoke, and there was not a rustle of reaction.
Mr. Suharto appeared relaxed and smiling, in a grey leisure suit with a gold-colored state employee pin on his shirt, adjusted the microphone to a comfortable level and pulled a pair of glasses from his pocket as an aide handed him his text.
When the address was over, the state-owned television channel returned to a program of pop music.
After Mr. Suharto spoke, the justices filed past Mr. Habibie and shook his hand. The new President, a small man, seemed almost lost in the crowd of officials.
To the apparent puzzlement of onlookers, Mr. Habibie followed Mr Suharto out of the hall without making a statement to the nationwide audience.
The entire procedure took less than 10 minutes.
Defense Minister Wiranto stepped to the microphone and said the military "supports and welcomes the resignation of President Suharto," and pledged his support to Mr. Habibie. He also said that the military would guarantee the safety of Mr. Suharto's family.
A Government spokesman, Alwi Dahlan, followed with a brief statement affirming that Indonesia would keep its international committments, including those to the International Monetary Fund.
The Parliament building remained occupied today by members of a nationwide student movement that galvanized this politically passive country of more than 200 million only two months after Mr. Suharto engineered his ritual re-election to a seventh five-year term. Their protests set off three days of widely destructive rioting in Jakarta last week that caused at least 500 deaths and shocked the nation into a consensus that Mr. Suharto must go.
The tasks facing the new President are daunting. The economy is in free fall, with months of rioting deepening a crisis that has brought inflation, food shortages, bankruptcies and paralysis to the banks. The currency is worth less than 20 percent of its value last summer. Little has been done to carry out a $43 billion rescue package organized in October by the International Monetary Fund.
"The country needs to take some very tough economic steps that even a popular President would have difficulty implementing," a Western diplomat said. "For an unpopular President, this will be almost impossible."
In 48 years of independence, Indonesia has never known a smooth transition of power. In 1965 Mr. Suharto, then a top general, took control after helping suppress what he said was a Communist coup attempt against Sukarno, the country's founder. An anti-Communist purge followed in which half a million died.
There are ambitious generals in the military today as well, and they will again have the last word in any power struggle. Apart from Mr. Suharto's own circle, there is virtually no center of power.
The opposition movement was remarkable in that it had no leader. Though in the end virtually the entire nation turned against him, Mr. Suharto was so successful in co-opting public figures and in neutralizing the opposition that the democracy movement remained ineffectual.
For a time the most prominent name among the opposition was Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Sukarno. But as public discontent grew, she remained passive. A popular Muslim leader, Amien Rais, emerged in recent weeks as a spokesman for the opposition, but public support did not coalesce.
Like the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos in the Philippines, Mr. Suharto was pushed toward giving up his office when he lost the support of one sector of society and politics after another.
It was when his obedient Parliament turned against him this week that it became clear that Mr. Suharto would not last long. Welcoming the students who occupied their building, the legislators shocked the nation this week by calling for him to quit.
Rather than "people power," it was this display of rubber-stamp-Parliament power that shook the foundations of his rule.
Initially, the military blocked the parliamentary leaders' move, saying it remained loyal to the President. But the legislators persisted. On Wednesday they announced that they would call a special session of the electoral commission on Monday to reverse its two-month-old presidential vote and impeach Mr. Suharto.
Asked whether he felt sorry for the man who had engaged his loyalty for so many years, one legislator, Muhamad Asad Umar, said, "I have felt sorry for him for years, but he didn't take the hint."

HEADLINE: Commencements;
On a Hot Day, Columbia Hails Annan and Bacall

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
It was a bathing suit kind of day, and Sinatra music was playing in the background -- "Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today" -- as some 20,000 people gathered on Columbia University's main lawn yesterday to see their friends and relatives graduate.
The audience also got a chance for some celebrity-gawking, as Lauren Bacall, Maurice Sendak, the artist and children's author, and Kofi A. Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, received honorary degrees. 
 Mr. Sendak, who was named an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters, said after the ceremony that he felt close to the graduates. "I grew up in their bedrooms, and now they are graduating college," he said. "I've been very intimate in their lives." And he offered them a word of blessing: "I wish them so well in a world that is now so strange."
Ms. Bacall, who also received an honorary doctorate in Humane Letters and sat ramrod-straight and beaming through the 90-minute ceremony, said later that it was a special day for her, too. She never went to college and had never received an honorary degree before, either.
"This is my first, my one and only," she said later, a pleased grin on her face. "It's been an incredible experience. Now everybody has to call me doctor."
Also receiving honorary degrees were Rita Frances Dove, a former Poet Laureate of the United States; Amartya Sen, a Harvard University economist; Fritz Stern, a historian and Columbia professor emeritus, and Bruce M. Alberts, a molecular biologist and president of the National Academy of Sciences.
George Rupp, Columbia's president, addressed the crises in the world and the need for better communications to solve them, and urged the 9,000 graduates to try to understand the other side of issues and other people's positions.
"The incapacity or unwillingness to grasp what is at stake from another vantage point is surely a salient feature of many of our conflicts," he said.
At a brief news conference later, Mr. Annan called that good advice. And he said that it was important for the graduates to "retain their idealism and the sense that they can play a role," as they head out into a difficult world.
And then there was the wisdom provided by the songs of Frank Sinatra, who died last week at the age of 82. "When I was 21, it was a very good year," he sang soulfully as the audience filed in. The musical selections covered some important values -- "Love and marriage" -- and offered a cheery send-off: "The best is yet to come."
 
Pace University
Christopher Reeve received an honorary doctorate from Pace University yesterday, but when he addressed the 1,112 graduates of the school's Westchester campuses, he spoke as if he were the one handing out honors.
"I think the Pace University School of Nursing turns out some of the best nurses," Mr. Reeve said to loud applause and the first of several standing ovations. "Three of the nurses who work with me, and I'm a very difficult case, are graduates of Pace."
Mr. Reeve, who has been paralyzed since an equestrian accident in 1995, was named a Doctor of Humane Letters for "bringing new meaning and purpose to a life precipitously altered by fate."
"One of the most difficult things about being here today is I stopped for a moment to realize that most of you were one year old when the first Superman movie came out," Mr. Reeve said.
The graduates at the Westchester County Center in White Plains came from a variety of fields of study and Mr. Reeve encouraged them all to follow "something you are personally and privately passionate about." But for most of his address, Mr. Reeve spoke directly to the 33 graduates of Pace's Lienhard School of Nursing.
"As somebody who unexpectedly became a member of a club I wouldn't have wanted to join, as somebody who spent a lot of time in hospitals and has round-the-clock nursing care, you are the ones who do the most," he said. "The doctors come and go. They're on a beeper someplace. I want to commend you all for choosing this noble profession."
Hugh B. Price, president and chief executive of the National Urban League, also received a doctorate in Humane Letters.
The commencement for the 1,741 students at the New York City Campus of Pace University will be held today at Radio City Music Hall. During that graduation, Pace will award a doctorate in Humane Letters to the singer Roberta Flack and to Linda Fairstein, chief of the sex crimes unit in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. On Sunday, 283 Pace law students will graduate at the campus in White Plains.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 28, 1998, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Thursday about commencement at Pace University's Westchester campuses misstated the number of nursing degree candidates at the ceremony. It was 279, not 33.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Riffs on America in an Abstract Direction

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"Colonial Cubism," one of Stuart Davis's great late paintings, is among the first signs of maturity in his lean, sparkling retrospective at the National Museum of American Art. The high-stepping interlocking forms of this 1954 painting, rendered in well-distributed chunks of slightly off-key red, yellow and blue plus black and white, beckon from the end wall of a long hallway gallery that contains some 20 examples of Davis's often accomplished early works. They date from 1912, when the artist turned 20, to 1928, when he made his only visit to Paris.
Typically syncopated and alliterative, the title "Colonial Cubism" reflects Davis's long love affair with jazz, which he acknowledged as a crucial influence. (He was especially devoted to the stride piano of Fats Waller and Earl Hines, naming his son after the latter.) But it also sums up his achievement as a whole. 
 More than any other American painter, Davis transformed and extended Cubism into an authentic and original style, turning it to his own purposes, as did other non-Frenchmen like Mondrian, Malevich, Klee and Chagall. It's not surprising that this transition from colonized to colonizer took inspiration from jazz, America's first indigenous art form of international stature.
The arduousness of Davis's effort was spelled out by the Metropolitan Museum of Art's enormous 1991 retrospective, to such an extent that the show sometimes bogged down a bit. The National Museum's effort, which was seen last summer at the Peggy Guggenheim Museum in Venice, suffers from the opposite problem. (It was orgainized by Philp Rylands, director of the Venice Guggenheim; Elizabeth Broun, director of the National Museum, and Earl Davis, the artist's son.)
With 52 canvases and no drawings, it skims so efficiently over the high points of a five-decade career that his progress is shorn of its twists, turns, backtracks and plateaus and is given the illusion of streamlined forward momentum. Some phases are skipped altogether -- Davis's sweetly artificial New Mexican landscapes from 1923, for example.
It's not always clear where a motif comes from: the white-on-black scaffolding that shadows the colored forms of "Memo" (1956), for example, emanates from a series of ink and gouache drawings based on harbor scenes and ships' rigging, executed in the early 30's, but they are not represented here. Nor is the 1922 abstraction whose composition was reiterated virtually piece by piece in "Colonial Cubism."
But the lack of distractions compresses the essential trajectory of Davis's artistic development -- what he himself called his "amazing continuity" -- and brings his formal genius to vivid life. It also makes the two main characteristics of his art, the constancy of his subject matter and his recycling of formal motifs, fabulously evident.
Davis's subject matter remained largely unchanged throughout his life. It was, as he himself said, "the American scene," an idiosyncratic combination of landscape and still life that he simply treated in an increasingly abstract, cohesive and symbolic manner as he matured.
He began with scenes of New York in the Ashcan manner. Next came his magnificent little views of Gloucester, Mass., energetic homages to van Gogh and Gauguin, whose work he saw in the 1913 Armory Show. (These works and other exercises in Post-Impressionism from that decade are the subject of a small, dense show on view at Salander O'Reilly in Manhattan.) The 20's were devoted mostly to Cubism, which he also encountered at the Armory but didn't master until his shallow-spaced "Egg Beater" series of 1927-28. The 20's also brought occasional forays into other styles, like the nearly trompe-l'oeil renderings of cigarette papers.
In June 1928 came the 14-month trip to Paris, where Davis produced a series of delightful stage-setlike images of Parisian facades, detailing slabs of bright color with fine black lines for windows, doors, loggias and balconies and introducing language by way of shop signs. They're elegant, perhaps "minor," yet their formal punch and economy comes startlingly close to Davis's late work.
During the 1930's and 40's, Davis built up his formal artillery, sometimes to unbearable density, in pieces that usually alternated between scenes of New York and Gloucester. He produced works like the crowded "New York by Gaslight" (each corner a little painting of its own), as well as the more relaxed "Cape Ann Landscape," whose semiabstracted forms seem to reiterate a number of different views: town, country, harbor and even the New Mexican mountains, a little row of red triangles in the upper right quadrant.
Davis had important breakthroughs in this period. In "Arboretum by Flashbulb" (1942), he achieved a new optical wholeness, partly from an evenly distributed and shallow composition, in which no shape or area dominated any other. But he also introduced the idea, which he would exploit to the fullest between 1950 and his death in 1964, of limiting his colors to four or five, as Mondrian did and Pollock would.
The late 40's are represented here by only two paintings, "The Mellow Pad" and "Pad No. 4." They show Davis's formal vocabulary of words, numbers, letters, arrows, animated squiggles, spirals and jaunty shapes reaching the boiling point, while his palette becomes equally feverish.
The paintings of the years after 1950 are in many ways like beautifully made proto-Pop billboards, full of sharp color contrasts, off-kilter shapes and sprinklings of snappy words and visual wisecracks. "Int'l Surface No. 1," from 1960, spells out "New," "Cat" and "100%," on different shards of green, white or black with red highlights.
The second characteristic made apparent by this exhibition is Davis's talent as a recycler of his own material. That he frequently reached back to the 1920's, using entire early paintings as templates for late ones, cannot be thoroughly examined in a show that moves as fast as this one, although it's fun to watch the development of certain individual motifs, like the ever larger and more prominent loops, squiggles and X's. But if the exhibition doesn't always illustrate the way many of Davis's late works were cropped, edited, enlarged and more intensely colored versions of his hard-won compositions of the 20's, it does show him exercising his recycling skill in contemporaneous works.
In the exhibition's final galleries, which feature nearly 20 of Davis's post-1950 paintings, several are shown alongside fraternal twins made at virtually the same time. Sometimes the palette remains remarkably the same, with Davis rearranging the colors' placement and ratios and fiddling with compositional details. This is the case, for example, with "Rapt at Rappaport's" and "Seme," both predominantly green, orange, magenta and blue, with black and white. Sometimes the compositions remain nearly identical, but the palette is radically altered: the red, blue, black and white composition of "Ready to Wear" is restated as an eye-popping red on black scaffolding in "Cliche."
In addition to the 1922 painting that preceded it, "Colonial Cubism" (1954), also reiterates the contemporaneous "Midi," enlarging and simplifying its composition and changing its hot pastels to those slightly deviant primaries.
As Davis put it: "You have to have a subject. I take what I can get -- even one of my own paintings." His carefully plotted images had many great moments along the way, and also made possible the sustained achievement of his final years. The idea that a well-built composition could generate any number of variations may have been the most important lesson he learned from the piano playing of Hines and Waller.
 "Stuart Davis" remains at the National Museum of American Art, Eighth and G Streets N.W., Washington, through Sept. 7.

HEADLINE: Washington Opera to Stay and Grow at the Kennedy

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
Effectively ending its plan to build a new opera house in an old department store downtown, the Washington Opera has reached a tentative agreement with the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to perform there more often.
The agreement, which was approved on Wednesday by the executive committee of the opera and is subject to ratification by the full boards of the opera and the center, benefits both institutions. 
 The Kennedy Center agreed to extend the company's season in the center's Opera House to 26 weeks a year from 17, a spokeswoman for the center said. The opera's repertory and reputation have been growing in recent years, and it has also been performing eight weeks a year in the center's Eisenhower Theater, which was designed for drama, not opera. Those performances will be phased out, said Suzanne Stephens, spokeswoman for the opera.
Since the Opera House seats 2,200 people and the Eisenhower half that, the opera's potential audience will grow substantially, she said. Patricia Mossel, the opera's executive director, said the company would be able to expand its season to 100 performances a season, from 74 a year.
Lawrence J. Wilker, president of the Kennedy Center, said that he was "very pleased" by the agreement.
"We have said from the beginning that they were a part of the Kennedy Center and that we would do whatever we could to make it possible for them to stay."
When asked what the center would have to drop to make dates available for the opera, he said it would reduce "ballet, musical theater and international presentations."
"In order for the opera to grow," Mr. Wilker said, "something else has to shrink."
At the same time, the company now has a choice parcel of downtown property that it can sell.
When the idea for a new opera house came up, a benefactor, Betty Brown Casey, gave the company $18 million, which it used to buy the old Woodward & Lothrop department store at a public auction in 1996. Since then, the downtown area has boomed, thanks partly to the robust economy and partly to the opening of the MCI sports arena four blocks from the abandoned department store. The store would probably sell for more than its cost.
Ms. Stephens said proceeds from a sale would go into the opera's endowment.
The executive committee's action seems to have ended a plan that had divided many leaders in Washington's arts world. Placido Domingo, the opera's artistic director, never seemed more than lukewarm in his support of a new house. And fund-raisers, especially those at the Kennedy Center and its related organizations, like the National Symphony Orchestra, were concerned that a drive to raise the $200 million that the new house was projected to cost would dry up many of their donation sources.
In announcing the executive committee's action, Ms. Mossel said, "Should the boards of the organizations approve the agreement, the opera will sign a lease with the Kennedy Center for 15 years."
She added that the opera was pleased to remain at the Kennedy Center because of the excellent acoustics in the Opera House.
The agreement will be phased in after the boards ratify it, becoming fully effective in the fall of 2002. For the season before that, the opera will perform in Constitution Hall while the Opera House is renovated.

HEADLINE: April U.S. Budget Had Record Surplus

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
The United States recorded its highest monthly budget surplus ever in April as the robust economy and booming stock market generated strong tax revenue, setting the stage for the first annual budget surplus since the late 1960's.
The Government had a surplus of $124.6 billion in April, up from a surplus of $93.9 billion in April 1997, the previous record, according to a Treasury statement today. Analysts had expected a surplus of $119.4 billion. 
 Tax payments have cascaded in, with a record 64.2 percent of the population holding jobs, corporations churning out profits and Wall Street setting records. April revenues rose 14.2 percent, to a record $261 billion.
"The Treasury finds itself with an embarrassment of riches," said Robert Dederick, an economic consultant at Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
The growth of Government spending has also slowed as the strong economy creates jobs and helps trim welfare rolls, Mr. Dederick said. In addition, military spending has also dropped, he said. April spending rose 1.3 percent, to $136.4 billion.
For the fiscal year to date, the budget surplus totals $54.7 billion, in contrast to a deficit of $17.2 billion in the corresponding period a year earlier, according to Treasury statistics. The White House and Congress remain at odds on how to spend the surplus.

HEADLINE: THE FALL OF SUHARTO: THE POLICY;
U.S. Welcomes Resignation But Is Cool to the Successor

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration stepped up its calls today for a transition to democracy in Indonesia and, while welcoming the resignation of President Suharto, attempted to distance itself from his successor, B. J. Habibie. Senior officials said the United States assumed -- and hoped -- that Mr. Habibie's tenure as President would be a short one.
President Clinton said he welcomed "the wise decision made less than 24 hours ago by President Suharto" and that "it now gives the Indonesian people a chance to come together to build a stable democracy for the 21st century." 
 "I hope the leaders will now move forward promptly with an open and peaceful transition that enjoys broad public support," the President said in remarks in the White House Rose Garden during a ceremony to mark the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Mr. Clinton did not mention the name of Mr. Habibie, a protege of Mr. Suharto who had been the Vice President for the last two months.
Indonesia's new President has given no indication that he intends to oversee a caretaker government. But senior Administration officials said President Habibie was clearly unsuited to lead Indonesia, given his longstanding ties to Mr. Suharto and what they called his eccentric views on economic policy.
He has been a champion of costly Government-sponsored high-technology projects, including development of an aerospace industry, that many economists think unsuitable for a developing nation like Indonesia. Like Mr. Suharto, Mr. Habibie is widely seen by Western officials as corrupt. His family is reported to control hundreds of millions of dollars in assets, with much of the wealth derived from Government contracts.
"I can't imagine that the Habibie era will be measured in years," said a senior Administration official involved in Indonesian policy who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "As best we can tell, he has no constituency anywhere. As soon as the military figures out where it wants to take the country, Habibie's out."
Administration officials said that the United States would try to forge a closer relationship with the two rival military leaders who are now seen as the true power in the Indonesian Government: Gen. Wiranto, the armed forces commander, and Gen. Prabowo, the head of an elite army unit and Mr. Suharto's son-in-law.
"We want to encourage the military commanders to move toward democracy, toward new elections as soon as feasible," the senior official said. "At this point we don't know these guys well and we don't know if they'll listen. But they are our best hope."
Officials acknowledge that the Clinton Administration has only limited leverage in promoting democracy in Indonesia, and what leverage it does have is mostly through the leadership role of the United States in the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other financial institutions that are overseeing a $43 billion rescue package for the battered Indonesian economy. The rescue plan was suspended earlier this week as a result of the political chaos in Indonesia.
"We look forward to progress toward the political and economic conditions that will permit an effective program of support for Indonesia's economic recovery," said James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman.
"The indications are that the President will announce his new Cabinet tomorrow," he said. "We look forward to seeking the composition of this Cabinet as a key measure of the direction they're going. And we hope the Cabinet will include a strong economic team as a signal of the Government's intention to undertake needed economic reforms."

HEADLINE: Zenith Approves Full-Scale Revamping

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: GLENVIEW, Ill., May 21

 BODY:
The Zenith Electronics Corporation, the struggling American television maker, approved a revamping plan today that would make its present shares worthless and its majority shareholder, LG Electronics Inc. of South Korea, the sole owner.
The proposal, which includes a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, calls for LG to convert about $200 million of debt owed to it by Zenith into all the common stock of the revamped company. 
 Zenith, based in Glenview, said all of its other creditors, as well as its vendors and employees, would continue to be paid. Present shareholders, however, would be left with nothing.
Zenith has lost money every year but one since 1985, compounding a financial squeeze faced by LG Electronics as South Korea grapples with a recession.
"This is why I came here," said Jeffrey Gannon, Zenith president and chief executive, who joined the company in January. "It was clear we had to find a way to restructure."
Zenith's shares plunged $1.375 yesterday, to close at 62.5 cents.

HEADLINE: Fed, at March Meeting, Saw Manageable Inflation Risk

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve saw an increased risk of resurgent inflation when it met on March 31, but decided to hold interest rates steady in the belief that Asian financial woes would help cool down the domestic economy and keep price increases in check, according to minutes of the meeting released today.
The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee also decided at the meeting that the risks of inflation were great enough for it to signal that it expected its next move on monetary policy would be to raise rates. That decision, which normally would have been kept secret until the release of the meeting's minutes today, was disclosed earlier this month by The Wall Street Journal. 
 The Fed had previously taken the stance that it was equally likely to raise or lower rates.
"On balance, though any upsurge in inflation seemed unlikely in the nearer term, the risk that inflation might move higher over the longer run seemed to have increased," the minutes said.
The central bank voted again on Tuesday not to raise interest rates, apparently in the belief that economic growth was now moderating and that any tightening would risk further destabilizing Asia at a time of political unrest in Indonesia. The minutes of Tuesday's meeting will be released in July.
The Fed last changed rates in March 1997, when it raised the short-term Federal funds target rate to 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent. Since then growth has surged and unemployment has fallen, but inflation has remained dormant.
Although the unemployment rate has declined to 4.3 percent since the March 31 meeting, increasing concern among those economists who believe that tight labor markets during robust growth inevitably lead to higher wages and prices, there have been other developments suggesting that growth is beginning to slow. Among them was a rise in the trade deficit for March to a new monthly high, indicating that demand for American products from abroad is waning.
Only one member of the 12-person committee, Jerry L. Jordan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, favored an immediate rate increase on March 31.
But the minutes suggested a livelier debate in the committee over how pressing the need for a rate increase might be. Some members were concerned that the low unemployment rate combined with continued strong demand would eventually set off a cycle of wage and price increases. They argued that the lack of price inflation resulted in part from temporary factors like a decline in oil prices. Others pointed to higher-than-expected growth in the money supply as a warning signal.
Another camp noted the absence of any broad-based price increases and said that a number of factors, including the effects of the Asian crisis and any decline in the stock market, could dampen demand and eliminate a need for any rate increase.
Over time, the Fed's rate-setting committee has been inclined toward compromise and consensus, and at the March 31 meeting it decided that the half-step of voting for a bias toward higher rates was sufficient. The vote was 11 to 1, with only Mr. Jordan dissenting.
The minutes said: "The members agreed that should the strength of the economic expansion and the firming of labor markets persist, policy tightening likely would be needed at some point to head off imbalances that over time would undermine the expansion in economic activity. Most saw little urgency to tighten at this meeting, however."
With inflation by some measures falling and the effects of the Asia crisis still uncertain, some members of the Fed committee thought they could be patient and wait for the situation to become clearer before seriously considering higher rates.
"In these circumstances," the minutes said, "a pre-emptive move to head off rising inflation could prove premature or perhaps even unwarranted; indeed, in the view of some, a tightening move was not inevitable."
Mr. Jordan has long been among the most hawkish of the Federal Reserve bank presidents on inflation, and analysts said they were not surprised that he wanted a rate increase.
Like a number of other members of the committee, he pays close attention to growth in the money supply, which has been discredited over the last decade as a predictor of inflation but now shows signs of again becoming a useful indicator.
Describing Mr. Jordan's position at the meeting, the minutes said: "While some reacceleration of reported rates of inflation was probably unavoidable, sustained rapid money growth would risk even higher inflation in future years. The durability of the economic expansion would be jeopardized by price and wage decisions reflecting expectations that the purchasing power of the dollar would decline at faster rates in the future."

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Remain at Low Level

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing for state unemployment benefits rose in line with expectations last week, with first-time jobless claims increasing 8,000, to a seasonally adjusted 313,000, the Labor Department said today.
"Jobless claims remain at low levels, which signals continued strength in the labor market," said Richard Yamarone, senior economist at the Argus Research Corporation in New York. 
 The four-week moving average for jobless claims, which smoothes out some of the volatility in the weekly report, fell to 311,500 last week from 313,000. Jobless claims fell a revised 5,000 in the previous week, to 305,000, instead of the initially reported decline of 2,000, to 307,000.
The Labor Department also said today that the number of people on the unemployment rolls increased 12,000, to 2.107 million, in the week ended May 9, close to the low of 2.035 million reached in May 1989. In the latest week, 27 states or territories had an increase in new jobless claims, while 25 said claims fell.
The insured unemployment rate -- the number of people receiving benefits divided by the number of workers covered by the program -- was unchanged for the eighth week, at 1.8 percent. The number of unemployed workers continuing to receive benefits and the state-by-state data are reported with a one-week lag.

HEADLINE: Plan to Let Employers Give Tax-Free Transit Benefits Is Included in Congressional Bill

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
Congressional negotiators said today that they had reached agreement on a measure that would substantially cut the cost of bus and subway travel in the New York metropolitan region and across the nation by allowing employers to give workers up to $65 a month in tax-free mass transit benefits instead of salary.
The provision will be part of a sweeping $200 billion transportation bill that Congress is hurrying to finish by Friday night, in time for its Memorial Day recess. Though the broad outlines of the bill have been agreed to, House and Senate negotiators were still struggling tonight with several thorny issues, including how to allocate $167 billion in highway spending among the states over the next six years. 
 Fights also broke out today over a raft of amendments to the highway bill intended to scale back or delay Federal environmental programs, from dredging toxic PCB's from the Housatonic River in Massachusetts to establishing tougher standards for the pollutants that cause smog and haze.
Several New York State Democrats denounced the PCB amendment, which was offered by Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, a Republican from Glens Falls, saying that it could lead to delays in removing PCB-contaminated soil from the Hudson River.
The General Electric Company is responsible for most of the PCB contamination in both the Housatonic and the Hudson, and will be required to pay for any cleanup ordered by the Federal Government.
Congressional aides also said tonight that they had reached broad agreement on funding for bus and subway programs, though details were not immediately available.
The aides said the agreement was expected to call for spending at least $36 billion on mass transit over the next six years, close to the amount sought by New York officials. If approved, the agreement will lead to a significant increase in Federal transit spending in New York and around the country.
Advocates of mass transit hailed today's deal on the tax-free transit benefits, saying it would encourage more employers to provide such benefits, and would sharply lower commuting costs for hundreds of thousands of people and cause a surge in transit ridership across the region.
"This is a big deal for the region," said Gene Russianoff, a lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a riders advocacy group. "This is a major fare cut for a very large number of people."
Though the tax-free benefit, known as Transitchek in the New York region, has been available for years, it has not caught on much because of quirks in the law, Congressional officials said. Currently, 7,000 companies and 150,000 workers participate -- numbers that transit advocates expect to double or triple with the new changes.
Under current tax law, companies can offer an employee up to $65 a month in Transitcheks, which are vouchers that can be redeemed for transit rides. But the law allows the benefit to be offered only on top of existing wages and benefits, forcing employees to negotiate higher salaries to receive it. That has discouraged not just individual workers, but also labor unions from asking for the benefit, the advocates say.
Under the new plan, employers will be able to remove $65 a month from a worker's existing pretax salary and give it to them as transit passes that are not subject to Federal, state or local taxes.
The arrangement not only cuts a worker's transit expenses but also benefits employers: their payroll costs will be reduced because they will not have to pay Social Security, unemployment or other taxes on the $65. The plan calls for increasing the benefit to $100 per month starting in 2002.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who championed the bill in Congress, said the plan would save the average commuter $600 a year by 2002. "It will make mass transit a more attractive mode of commuting and help reduce road congestion at the same time."
Mr. Russianoff said he thought the savings from the plan -- which he said could range from 25 cents to 60 cents per ride for a typical New Yorker -- would encourage more people to buy the monthly unlimited-ride passes that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority plans to begin offering in July. Those passes will cost $63; with Transitchek, the cost would fall to $45 or less, he said.
The battle over the environmental amendments was expected to last well into the night and threatened to hold up passage of the overall transportation bill. The tactic of attaching anti-environmental provisions to big-spending bills just before they are sent to the White House has been used repeatedly in recent years to avoid contentious debate, sometimes successfully.
Mr. Solomon's amendment would delay the dredging of toxic chemicals like PCB's, or polychlorinated biphenyls, which have been linked to cancer, from any river in the nation for 18 months, while the National Academy of Sciences completes a study on the benefits of such dredging.
Mr. Solomon has said he opposes dredging in the Hudson or Housatonic because he is concerned that the Environmental Protection Agency plans to dump the PCB-contaminated soil among the dairy farms of his district. "My entire farming community is at risk," he wrote in a letter to Representative Bud Shuster, a Pennsylvania Republican who is a lead negotiator on the transportation bill.
But word of Mr. Solomon's amendment has generated a storm of opposition from the Clinton Administration, several New York Congressmen and state legislators, raising doubts about whether it will survive in the final bill.
"This is the strongest attempt yet to get G.E. off the hook, in terms of the damage it has done to the Northeast," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat who represents Queens and Brooklyn.
Another amendment, offered by Representative Bob Wise, a Democrat of West Virginia, would block the E.P.A. from carrying out a policy intended to cut emissions of smog that drifts across state lines, causing air pollution problems in Northeastern states that are downwind from power plants and other pollution sources in the Midwest.
Yet another would stop the agency from issuing new regulations on pollution that is emitted from some outdoor paints as they dry. And a third would delay the E.P.A.'s efforts under the Clean Air Act to get some states where the air meets health standards to take further action to control pollution that cuts visibility in parks and wilderness areas.

HEADLINE: THE FALL OF SUHARTO: THE LOANS;
U.S. Wants Concrete Steps by New Leaders Before It Lends More

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund and the United States will watch for concrete signs that Indonesia's new President is committed to addressing his nation's deep-rooted economic problems before deciding on further financial aid, Administration officials and economists said today.
The new President, B. J. Habibie, pledged today to honor the existing agreement with the fund, under which Indonesia has so far received $3.9 billion in loans out of a $9.9 billion package it signed in January. 
 But the fund announced hours before the resignation of President Suharto today that it had suspended the next disbursement -- $1 billion, scheduled for June -- until the political situation is clearer.
And Government officials and private analysts said today that the fund is skeptical about the depth of Mr. Habibie's commitment to root out corruption and to reverse some of the poor economic judgments that undermined and ultimately brought down the Suharto Government. Mr. Habibie, a protege of Mr. Suharto, is not known for his economic acumen.
Officials at the fund declined to comment today, beyond repeating statements they made on Wednesday suggesting that any resumption of aid would have to await the formation of a stable Government.
Both the I.M.F. and the United States pulled most of their economists and analysts out of Jakarta last week as anti-Government demonstrations worsened. Officials said both teams are expected to return within a week and quickly establish contact with Mr. Habibie and his cabinet.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who plays a substantial role in shaping I.M.F. policy, said it was too soon to say how the fund should proceed, but added that the change in Government was a "great opportunity for Indonesia to get back on track."
The fund's loan package was part of a $43 billion program set up earlier this year; it includes aid from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and individual nations. About a quarter of that amount has been disbursed.
The United States pledged $3 billion as a backup to the money being provided by the international financial institutions but has not released any of it.
James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said Washington would wait for changes in Indonesia's political and economic policy before supporting further loans by international institutions.
"We look forward to the Government quickly creating conditions that will support Indonesia's economic recovery," the spokesman said. "That's why we hope that he will choose a cabinet that includes a strong economic team.
"And you know, the situation remains one where we need just to have a Government to work with, to make judgments about how to have progress toward the political and economic conditions that would permit an effective program."
The biggest uncertainty is whether Mr. Habibie will continue Mr. Suharto's practice of implementing the changes demanded by the I.M.F. grudgingly, haltingly and incompletely, or whether he will surprise the skeptics and, if only as a matter of political survival, lead the nation into major economic changes.
"They're going to have to get a fix on whether Habibie and the new team are serious about reform or whether this is just a game of musical chairs," said Morris Goldstein, a former top official at the fund who is now a fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Mr. Goldstein said the fund would have to take into account that Indonesia's economic situation has deteriorated since the original agreement was signed four months ago.
But he said the basic issues had not changed: Indonesian companies have about $80 billion in foreign debts that they are having difficulty paying. The banking system remains a mess, with many institutions insolvent. Economic decisions are still being made with an eye toward benefiting Government officials and their families and associates. The currency remains weak, reflecting skepticism that Indonesia is serious about swallowing its medicine.
"Everything is dependent on whether Habibie and company can convince the markets they are serious about reform," Mr. Goldstein said.
"If he's not really serious and he's not going to take ownership of the program, then there's an enormous problem. If he changes his spots and gives some indication of that by appointing people to the cabinet who are serious about reform, then he could get a turnaround and the markets will help him."

HEADLINE: THE FALL OF SUHARTO: THE LEGACY;
Suharto Fostered Rapid Economic Growth, and Staggering Graft

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
Like the Shah of Iran and Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines, President Suharto was a reforming autocrat who clung to power so long that he undermined his legacy and considerable accomplishments.
Asia's economic crisis was the catalyst that pushed Mr. Suharto, 76, from his throne after 32 years. But in his family's unrestrained corruption and his increasingly aloof efforts to manage the forces of education and modernization he had unleashed under his "new order," Mr. Suharto alienated large parts of the military and the business class. 
 Mr. Suharto has been unceremoniously pushed from the presidency he insisted on keeping barely two months ago, when he was sworn in for another five years in the midst of enormous economical and financial turbulence. But he will be remembered for deeds and events that have little to do with the turmoil of the last few months.
He brought stability and economic development, family planning and widespread literacy and made Indonesia self-sufficient in rice.
After he overthrew Sukarno, who was a strong member of the nonaligned movement and made an alliance with Communists, Mr. Suharto made Indonesia an anti-Communist bulwark, which brought him Washington's support and indulgence. Like the Shah and Marcos, Mr. Suharto played the anti-Communism card, throwing his lot in with the Americans in the revolutionary struggle that absorbed Southeast Asia in those years.
Later, when the Vietnam War ended, he was an important player in the foundation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which promoted capitalism in the region and helped prevent the Communist victory in Indochina from spreading. He helped keep China at bay and also was vital to a negotiated solution to the Cambodian war.
But at home Mr. Suharto suppressed freedom of speech and of the press, and his military cracked down ruthlessly on domestic dissent. He allowed his friends and his family, especially his six children, to become unimaginably rich in a country with large pockets of poverty, and as the years went by, he clearly stopped listening to criticism, even from his closest allies.
His regime was built on the pillars of anti-Communism and economic development, notes Daniel Lev, an Indonesian scholar at the University of Washington in Seattle. The end of the cold war made one pillar nearly irrelevant, and the economic contagion that swept Asia this year -- a function of "crony capitalism" and unregulated loans -- undermined the other pillar.
So an important part of Mr. Suharto's legacy, Mr. Lev says, will be the political reaction to it: the mistrust of a strong presidency and the strong popular desire for new controls against corruption, collusion and nepotism, the themes of the student uprisings against Mr. Suharto's regime.
While Mr. Suharto's recent record is mixed, his accomplishments were remarkable in the years after he took power after a failed coup attempt in 1965. In the months of anti-Communist blood bath that followed, hundreds of thousands of people died.
Even today, his role in the coup is a mystery. As the commander of the Strategic Army Reserve, Mr. Suharto met the night before the coup with the leader of the Communist Revolutionary Council, Abu Latief, who still sits in a Jakarta jail and has never disclosed what happened.
As the alleged coup unfolded in the night, Mr. Suharto and his troops stepped forward and took control of Jakarta. He quietly emerged to become President only in 1967, easing aside Sukarno, the nationalist who led Indonesia to independence from Dutch rule after World War II.
Sidney Jones, an scholar of Indonesia who is executive director of Human Rights Watch/Asia, notes that if a new Indonesian leadership wishes to make peace with the past, it would probably have to investigate Mr. Suharto's role in the coup and its aftermath, which remains Indonesia's "greatest national trauma."
"While his record is clearly mixed, he brought order, peace, stability and economic development to a fractured and desperately poor society," said Adam Schwarz, a journalism fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of "A Nation in Waiting" (1994), a study of Indonesia in the 1990's. "Suharto presided over one of the most durable developmental stories of this century, and he brought enormous numbers of people out from life underneath the poverty line."
Calling himself Bapak Pembangunan, or the Father of Development, Mr. Suharto succeeded in delivering at least 7 percent annual economic growth for three decades in a huge island country of 210 million, the fourth-most populous in the world. He initiated a family planning program that has been studied everywhere as a model of educated self-interest, and which did not use any significant measure of coercion, in contrast to India and China.
And he made the Indonesian economy one of the most open to foreign investment, winning friends at the World Bank and at the International Monetary Fund.
At the same time, Mr. Suharto and his children built up assets that the Central Intelligence Agency estimated at $30 billion in 1989.
"Despite the growth figures, which stick in the head," notes Mr. Lev, "it is also impressive that the family is worth $30 billion to $40 billion. And you have to ask what other uses there were for that money, and what the hidden costs were of that corruption."
Mr. Suharto also suppressed the growth of politics, believing the country too fractious and immature for democracy, Mr. Schwarz said. Mr. Suharto preached unity and quiet compromise, and kept political institutions neutered: there were no roll calls in Parliament, only decisions reached by "consensus" that was clearly engineered from above.
His "new order" was a collaborative system of co-optation, a prominent Jakarta editor said in 1990, when the corruption and nepotism were becoming visible for all to see. People lived and profited by the five D's: datang, duduk, dengar, diam, duit -- come, sit, listen, silence, money.
In what was a monopolistic state, there was quiet criticism of Mr. Suharto's wife, Siti Hartinah Suharto, known as Tien, and sometimes known as Mrs. Tien Percent. But after the rapid rise of world oil prices in the mid-1970's, Mr. Suharto's Western-educated economic advisers -- known as the Berkeley mafia, since many of them attended school there -- urged diversification and a further opening to Western investments.
The progressive deregulation of the economy and large public works projects -- praised in the West -- also led to more opportunities for graft and family privilege. And foreign companies quietly paid the necessary bribes and put the necessary Suharto children in charge of projects and monopolies.
The country moved from the "generation of 10 percent to the generation of 20 percent," said one Indonesian scholar who was careful to speak on the condition of anonymity. He estimated then that 80 percent of major contracts went to Mr. Suharto's children or friends, and even Suharto loyalists were becoming disgruntled.
But the long economic boom -- when all of Asia seemed a merrily ringing cash register and annual growth rates hit double digits -- created a lot of wealth and a growing middle class.
And with the pressure for political liberalization stemming naturally from economic development and generational change, there grew apace a vivid embarrassment and anger over Mr. Suharto's inability to distinguish between his family's interests and those of the state.
But as the society changed, politics did not, and the country was unable to engage in any public debate over key questions, Mr. Schwarz said. These included the role of the ethnic Chinese in Indonesian life; the relation of Islam and the state; the degree of Government intervention in the economy; the relationship of Java to the outer islands, and of course the role of the Suharto children.
In the 1990's, noted Ms. Jones, of Human Rights Watch, the corruption and the anger only worsened. Popular anger grew sufficiently that when Mrs. Suharto died in 1996 of a heart attack, many Indonesians preferred to believe rumors that she had been caught in a gunfight between her two younger sons over a national automobile project.
The 90's were also the period when Mr. Suharto began to make political mistakes, listening less to the Berkeley mafia and more to the trusted ally who became his heir, President B. J. Habibie. Mr. Habibie, a German-trained engineer, filled Mr. Suharto's head with a high-tech vision of a modern Indonesia, prompting hugely expensive boondoggles like Government support for Mr. Habibie's effort to build an Indonesian jet aircraft.
Mr. Suharto began to lose touch with his military, and he created a tame Association of Muslim Intellectuals, led by Mr. Habibie, to try to provide a different kind of support and legitimacy in the largest Muslim country in the world.
In November 1991, Indonesian troops opened fire in an East Timor cemetery on mourners for a young independence advocate shot by the army. At least 50 and probably 100 people died, Ms. Jones said. The massacre brought international condemnation of Indonesian policies in East Timor, which it had annexed by force in 1975 after Portugal retreated from its empire. In 1996 two proponents for democracy in East Timor won the Nobel Peace Prize. The killings also turned a small insurgency into widespread revolt throughout East Timor.
With no cold war and no Communist threat, the killings and oppression in East Timor, and the less visible repression in Irian Jaya, Indonesia's half of the island of New Guinea, turned the American Congress against Indonesia, leaving Mr. Suharto little protection when the Asian boom collapsed and the I.M.F. that once loved him demanded that he choose country over children.
Mr. Habibie, who has little popular backing, may last only a few months. As Mr. Suharto's heir, he is perceived as the man appointed to protect Mr. Suharto's children.
Ms. Jones hopes he will begin a new dialogue with the Indonesian people, release political prisoners, repeal repressive laws, set free elections and begin a serious discussion of the issue of East Timor. "But even if he does move out boldly," she asked, "will anyone trust him?"

HEADLINE: Auto Makers Seek to Make Light Trucks Safer in Crashes

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 21

 BODY:
Auto makers have quietly begun trying to design sport utility vehicles that will be less dangerous to other motorists.
Ford has secretly begun redesigning the suspensions for the Ford Explorer and Expedition, the Mercury Mountaineer, the Lincoln Navigator and future sport utility models so the vehicles will ride as much as several inches lower and be less likely to override cars' bumpers and other safety features during crashes, a Ford manager said. General Motors has designed a prototype for a new Chevrolet Suburban that also rides lower and is test-driving it. 
 Both auto makers are trying to make the bulk of the vehicle, including the bumper and steel underbody frame, ride closer to the wheels in future model years while making sure that the lowest parts of the vehicle, including the axles, ride as high as they do now to preserve the ground clearance prized by off-road drivers.
Chrysler and foreign auto makers also say they have begun looking for ways to reduce the hazards of sport utility vehicles, although their plans are not known.
"Clearly this subject has the attention of the industry," said Jerry Hirshberg, president of Nissan's North American design operations. "It's talked about in board meetings. It's talked about in engineering meetings. It's even talked about in sales and marketing meetings. I can't think of any engineers right now that are not interested in or conversant with this issue."
Sport utility vehicles are nearly three times as likely as midsized cars to kill the other driver in a collision because they are heavier, taller and have very stiff frames, Federal regulators say. Redesigning sport utility vehicles to make them less deadly to other motorists is not easy because of simple physics: heavier objects tend to inflict more damage in collisions. And loopholes in Federal fuel-economy rules allow sport utility vehicles to get considerably lower gas mileage than cars, so they weigh up to twice as much as a midsized car.
Some experts question whether sport utility vehicles with lower suspensions will be significantly safer as long as the weight difference remains. "You just lower the battering ram," said James Hall, a former G.M. executive who is now a consultant at Auto Pacific Inc., a market research firm.
But Judith L. Stone, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, a Washington group, said lowering the suspensions on sport utility vehicles would not only make them less dangerous to other motorists but would also make them less likely to roll over by lowering their centers of gravity. "It's certainly a major safety decision and likely to contribute to the saving of lives," Ms. Stone said when told of the plans by Ford and G.M.
Indeed, new research by the auto industry has found that the design of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, which are often built on the same chassis, has increased their deadliness.
An internal study by Ford has found that collisions between cars and light trucks kill 1,000 more car occupants each year than can be explained by the weight differences of the vehicles alone. That was apparently because the light trucks are higher and have stiffer frames, said Priya Prasad, Ford's top safety engineer on collisions between different types of vehicles. Light trucks include not only sport utility vehicles and pickups but also mini-vans, although Ford does not think mini-vans are a problem.
If light trucks were made less likely to override cars in accidents, the death rate in cars would be reduced without increasing the death rate in light trucks, Mr. Prasad said. Making the frames of light trucks less stiff would also reduce the number of deaths in cars but might slightly increase the number of deaths in light trucks, he said. Still, fewer Americans would die in traffic accidents over all if light trucks were less stiff, he said.
Mr. Prasad said he was still calculating the relative contributions of height and stiffness to the 1,000 deaths a year and hoped to have the answers in time for an international conference here on light truck safety on June 5.
Most of the extra deaths involve sport utility vehicles and pickups because mini-vans are based on car designs, Mr. Prasad said. Changing pickup truck designs could be more controversial because a far greater percentage of pickups are used for commercial purposes like farming and construction and need stiff, high-riding frames to carry heavy loads over rocky or muddy ground.
Mr. Prasad cautioned that for this and other reasons, some design-related deaths were inevitable. "My estimate is at the most, if all the design changes can be made -- and I don't think all the changes can be made -- then you're talking 1,000 people" saved each year, he said. Because light trucks commonly last 12 to 15 years, it could take that long to replace the tall, stiff vehicles already on the road, he added.
A thousand lives a year is a large number for an automotive design problem. By contrast, the furor two years ago over accidental deaths caused by air bags involved about two dozen deaths a year. On the other hand, persuading American drivers to change their behavior could result in even bigger safety gains. For example, Federal regulators estimate that if the rate of seat-belt use rose to 85 percent, from 68 percent now, 4,000 lives could be saved every year.
Traffic accidents kill 40,000 Americans each year, as many each day as died in the 1996 Valujet crash in the Everglades. About 5,000 of those deaths occur in collisions between cars and light trucks. An additional 2.3 million Americans are injured each year on the roads; the Government gathers less data on these injuries, so safety researchers pay less attention to them. But auto industry engineers say that mismatches in vehicles' height and stiffness can increase the severity of injuries.
Hans Joksch, a University of Michigan researcher who has been a leader in traffic safety since the early 1970's and has begun looking at the light truck issue, said that Mr. Prasad's estimate of 1,000 design-related deaths a year seemed "at the low end of the range" and that there might be considerably more deaths.
There are more pickups than sport utility vehicles on the road, and pickups are more likely to be driven by young men, who have the most accidents. But sport utility vehicles are a growing concern because they are getting bigger, because their sales are surging and approaching the level of pickup sales, and because safety experts say that with time, many used sport utility vehicles will be affordable for young men.
The auto industry has come under growing pressure from regulators to improve safety or face new regulations. Dr. Ricardo Martinez, the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said auto makers should follow the example of the new Mercedes-Benz ML320 sport utility vehicle, which was designed to inflict less damage on cars.
"I'm always amazed when people say, 'It's pure physics, we can't do anything about it,' because it's out there, it's on the street," he said.
In most sport utility vehicles, a frame of steel beams sits on top of the suspension springs. Mercedes has calculated that the typical four-wheel-drive sport utility vehicle has a front cross-beam, right behind the bumper, that is 21 to 28 inches off the ground. By contrast, Federal regulations require car bumpers to withstand impacts at a height of 16 to 20 inches off the ground. The front ends of cars are designed to crumple and absorb the energy of a crash when hit at bumper height but may not crumple properly when hit higher. The steel beams do most of the damage in a collision.
The Mercedes has a very different suspension that attaches the springs to the side of the frame. The steel beams ride lower inside the underbody of the Mercedes, with the front cross-beam just 19.5 inches high, even though the overall vehicle still has the same ground clearance as other sport utility vehicles.
Ronald Harbour, an auto industry manufacturing consultant, said that fitting similar suspensions on other sport utility vehicles would cost $100 to $250 for each vehicle, plus considerable engineering work.
Bernard Robertson, Chrysler's general manager of Jeep and pickup truck operations, said that after initially viewing sport utility vehicle collisions with cars as a problem of physics, auto makers had begun looking for ways to address the problem. "Everyone is very interested in the subject; there has been a fair amount of consciousness-raising over the last year," he said. Chrysler agreed earlier this month to be acquired by Daimler-Benz, which owns Mercedes.
Mr. Prasad and Ford spokesmen refused to discuss what Ford would do about the safety problem uncovered by the company's new research, saying they did not want to disclose their plans to rivals. But a senior Ford manager who insisted on anonymity said the company had just begun a two-stage plan to lower current and future sport utilities by several inches over the next few years.
The first stage involves resetting suspension springs on future vehicles for a slightly lower ride. That will be done as soon as feasible, the manager said. The second stage involves changing the dimensions of many suspension parts for an even lower ride and will be done over the coming years as models are redesigned, he said.
"The more we can get the alignment with the bumpers and where the crash energies are absorbed, the more it helps the problem with large vehicles and small vehicles," the manager added.
Other auto makers are taking similar steps. Joseph Spielman, G.M.'s vice president for metal parts fabrication, said that he had seen a working prototype for a new Suburban to be produced soon. The new model rides substantially lower, partly to reduce the risk to other motorists and partly to make it easier for Suburban drivers and passengers to climb in and out, he said.
Chrysler has already been working on different suspension designs for various reasons, Mr. Robertson said. Installing lower bumpers on sport utility vehicles does little good without lowering the steel beams behind the bumpers, he added.
Auto makers have also quietly begun work on lowering pickups, although the heavy payloads carried by these vehicles have made that task more difficult. The suspension design chosen by Mercedes, for example, is less suited to carrying extremely heavy weights.
In an interview last month, Mr. Prasad of Ford said that lowering light trucks would make them less dangerous in frontal collisions but might help less when they hit cars in the side. Lower-riding light trucks would do more damage to car occupants' pelvises during side impacts while still hitting them in the chest and head as well, he said. Ford plans to begin offering side air bags in all of its cars over the next three years and is studying ways to strengthen the sides of cars.
The design teams for Ford's light truck chassis have also been assigned engineers to look for ways to improve safety in crashes with other types of vehicles, and these engineers meet regularly with safety experts from Ford's headquarters.
Auto makers are also studying ways to make sport utility vehicles with less stiff bodies. Stiff vehicles tend to punch deeply into cars during collisions. Seat belts and air bags are less effective when another vehicle intrudes into a car's passenger compartment, Mr. Prasad said.
But he and auto industry executives said that it would be difficult to make sport utility vehicles less stiff without changing current Government crash tests.
Because of their relatively high rollover rate, sport utility vehicles have higher death rates for their occupants than cars of the same weight, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which is financed by auto insurers. The largest sport utility vehicles have slightly lower death rates than cars but weigh so much more that they drastically increase the risk for other motorists.

Chart: "Making Safer Sport Utility Vehicles"
Auto makers are trying to reduce the danger that sport utility vehicles pose to other motorists, mainly by designing them to ride lower so that they are less likely during collisions to override the bumpers and other safety features of cars.
 
BUMPERS - A lower ride will make the high bumpers of sport utility vehicles less likely to override car bumpers.
 
CHASSIS - Auto makers are trying to develop chassis that, through the use of crumple zones, would be less stiff while still passing Government crash tests.
 
SUSPENSIONS - Suspensions will be readjusted to allow for a lower ride, at first by resetting the springs and later by designing new suspension parts.
 
AIR BAGS - Ford plans to offer side air bags in all of its cars and mini-vans to protect the heads and chests of occupants from the high front ends of sport utility vehicles and pickups.

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER; A. M. Rosenthal is on vacation.

 BODY:
When someone says "Indians," most Americans probably think of gambling-casino operators. So isolationist have we become.
Even Washington's best minds were astonished to learn that the Indians were exploding atom bombs. 
 On first hearing the news, President Clinton is said to have cried out, "Thank God they didn't get the H-bomb while Crazy Horse was still on the warpath!"
That, at least, is what President Clinton should have cried out, if only to emphasize how completely he is in touch with the American people.
I am not saying we are so dumb we don't remember that a place called "India" can be found on a map by anybody who scored 1590 on the S.A.T.'s.
India is where "Gunga Din" was set.
Or was it Pakistan? Whatever.
So after remembering that yes, Virginia, there is an India, Washington biggies were very cross. India had been very rude. That was the considered and official opinion. Very rude.
If India had been a schoolboy, the teacher would have sent a testy note home to its mother.
Instead, President Clinton is going to cut off India's goodies. That's Washington's usual punishment for countries that irritate it. When you've got a country that needs to be taught a good lesson, cut off its goodies.
Cuba, Iraq, Libya, Iran -- no more goodies for them until they start behaving themselves. This goes double for Cuba, because it has chafed Washington almost beyond endurance by surviving for four decades in spite of having its goodies cut off.
India is not the only country that bores Americans except when it's irritating them. Who can name the President of France, the Prime Minister of Canada? Who cares what's happened lately in Cairo, Athens, Krasnoyarsk?
The people who run the world's big international corporations, that's who. As our most fervent capitalists are always explaining, the future lies in the global marketplace, kids, so don't let hometown sentimentality about American jobs and industry make you do something stupid.
We now have a commercial culture that is totally internationalist and a political culture so isolationist that O. J. Simpson, Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky -- Americans all -- dominate the media for weeks, months, years.
Two of them have dominated the White House so thoroughly that nobody there thought to wonder what India had been up to lately.
If there had been a fierce cola struggle between Pepsi and Coke for monopoly rights in Calcutta, American business would have known about it immediately. International trouble is the business of American business.
Big-time U.S. businesses with political muscle have forced the politicians to stay awake about matters Chinese, but without smart capitalists leaning on them, the Clinton people seemed to forget that India was around.
So did the press. The media are mostly just as isolationist as the rest of the political culture. Jim Wooten of ABC seems to be the last foreign correspondent left anywhere in the world for network news.
The story that doesn't entertain has a hard time getting coverage, electronic or print. The theme song of the American media these days should be "Let Me Entertain You."
Before isolationism became stifling, tube-watching America would probably have seen somebody in New Delhi pointing out that while the U.S. might adore nuclear China, India tended to view it as a potentially hostile power on its border.
Doesn't sound very entertaining, does it?
Most of what passes for foreign news is stuff of the Princess Di variety. Newsstands are infested with it. The networks may stint on coverage of everything east of New York and west of Washington, but give them a Princess Di funeral and they dispatch their anchors across oceans. Anchors, for Heaven's sake! Men who earn nearly as much as baseball players.
Give them a Pope going head-to-head with exasperating Castro, and off go the anchors to Cuba until Monica makes the scene in D.C., whereupon it's "So long, Holy Father, we hear America crying, 'Monica, you anchors! Give us total Monica!' "
The rain forest burns. Mexico falls into ruin. India tests an H-bomb. The old arms race begins again.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Hostess of Her Own Party, 6 Nights a Week

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
THIS is a pick-up-the-pieces-and-get-on-with-your-life story. If it were a television pilot, the first scene would flash back four years, when a smart and ambitious New Jersey girl picks up the telephone to learn that her live-in lover of two and a half years, the brilliant Le Bernardin chef Gilbert Le Coze, has had what his staff calls "an accident." The young woman rushes to the hospital, but is too late. Mr. Le Coze, 49, is already dead of a heart attack. The woman, unemployed and 26, thinks her world has come to an end.
Flash forward to May 1998. Our heroine, now barely 30, is the owner of Lot 61, an art-filled former truck garage in Chelsea -- a three-month-old bar and restaurant of the minute. She holds the party after the premiere of "Godzilla," and the dinner after Giorgio Armani's April fashion show. She stands 6 feet 4 inches tall (in her three-inch green lizard-skin heels) and wears a gauzy leopard-skin dress made by her busboy. She looks good, gets good reviews and has a new boyfriend. Most important, she is doing what she has always wanted: running her own business, and presiding as hostess of her own party, six nights a week. The spirit of Mr. Le Coze, she believes, will always be with her. 
 "I'm a sitcom," Amy Sacco said.
On Wednesday evening, Ms. Sacco took a few hours out over a selection of appetizers -- the "hacked duck" spring rolls were the most interesting -- to talk about the plot lines of her life. It was 8 P.M., and Lot 61 was dotted with twentyish types in black and taupe; Drew Carey of the television show was at a table by the bar. On a wall hung "Chachi" by the painter Sean Landers, which the artist swapped for a five-figure food and bar bill. Ms. Sacco sat in a corner keeping her eye on the staff, then frowned upward when a sudden hailstorm started to pound her new roof. "I'm waiting to feel it on top of my head," Ms. Sacco said. "That's my baby. The roof is my biggest baby."
Ms. Sacco is at heart a businesswoman who likes a really good party -- a woman thrilled that her busboy-designer calls her "his own personal Barbie doll," less thrilled when the salad is so salty she takes it off the menu. She works from 11 A.M. to 2 A.M., and never liked school. But she did like restaurants.
"She is extremely intelligent," said her best friend, Maguy Le Coze, the owner of Le Bernardin and the sister of Mr. Le Coze. "It's not something that everybody has. What can I tell you? She likes what she's doing so much, it's almost like she's breathing through what she has chosen to do. She cannot speak about something else right now."
THE crucial character in Ms. Sacco's life is her mother, Bette, known for her baked ziti dinners for the Chatham High School basketball team. (Ms. Sacco's father owned a moving company.) Ms. Sacco was the youngest of 8, and her mother never had fewer than 12 at her table. "There was always room for someone extra," Ms. Sacco said. "People loved coming to our house. Because my mother was just great. If someone had a problem, they would call my mother."
Naturally the pomme does not fall far from the tree. Mom was the neighborhood hostess in suburban Chatham; her daughter grows up to be the neighborhood hostess among the art galleries of Chelsea. "Being a manager is like being a mother anyway," Ms. Sacco said. Of course this is the late 1990's, and daughter gets investors who put in $1.2 million. But that is getting ahead of the story.
"She was an unusual child," Mrs. Sacco said. "Highly spirited, very precocious. She was always annoyed with small-town stuff. She always said she was going to go someplace, and be somebody."
Amy Sacco was very soon towering over the boys in her high school class, and heading across the Hudson, midweek, to the New York clubs. Area and Palladium were favorites. And her mother knew?
"As if," she said.
Ms. Sacco worked after school at New Jersey restaurants -- she sliced scallions at the Tarragon Tree -- then went to Johnson and Wales, a restaurant school in Providence, R.I. When she graduated in 1990, she got a job through a friend at Bouley, the epicenter at the time of the New York food world. After that she was manager of the Lipstick Cafe and the restaurant Vong. She met Mr. Le Coze through friends at Bouley.
After his death, she got a job managing the Monkey Bar, then running System, a discotheque. "It was very glamorous," she said dryly. "Go to work at 8 P.M., dress in plastic, come home at 6 in the morning." Ms. Sacco then went to work for a venture capital firm as a marketing consultant. One of her jobs was to get Swiss Army sunglasses and knives into the movie "Armageddon." It was partly through the venture capital firm, and restaurant friends, that she found her investors, whom she described as "your average business guys."
Ms. Sacco had a party for her investors in December -- "300 suits," she calls them -- and was horrified when she arrived that day to find three inches of water all over her 5,500 square feet of floor. "I got out three or four dry-vacs and took out my whip," she said.
A bittersweet moment was opening night, without Mr. Le Coze. "It was the achievement of my life, the fact that I got this place off the ground," she said. "And not to have my biggest mentor in the world there to share it with me was devastating." And yet, she said, "he would have been devastated if I'd shut down my life."

HEADLINE: Motorola Drops Plan for Its Own Data Satellites

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Motorola Inc. announced yesterday that it had agreed to scrap its $12.9 billion plan to build a satellite network capable of delivering high-speed data communications anywhere on earth and instead join a rival but equally ambitious project to build an "Internet in the sky."
Motorola said it would invest about $750 million in exchange for 26 percent of the project, Teledesic L.L.C., which was founded by Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, and Craig O. McCaw, the cellular phone pioneer who sold his company to AT&T in 1993 for $12.6 billion. 
 Motorola pushed aside the Boeing Company to become Teledesic's prime contractor. Teledesic said yesterday that Boeing would remain an important participant in the project but it was clear that Motorola had become its main partner.
Matra Marconi Space, the joint venture of the General Electric Company of Britain and Groupe Lagardere of France, also announced yesterday that it had agreed to take part in the project.
Joining Teledesic could allow Motorola to save billions of dollars at a time when the company is struggling and casting about for a model of growth for the future. As the world's appetite for data services continues to grow, many companies are looking to the skies as the next way to deliver high-speed access to the Internet, especially in places where fiber optic links are not common.
Teledesic intends to build a network of 288 advanced communications satellites that can begin to provide high-speed, or broadband, access to the Internet and other data services in 2003.
Teledesic is one of a handful of new ventures known as LEO companies, for low earth orbit. Many of today's most heavily used satellites, including the Galaxy 4 that failed on Tuesday night, eliminating pager service for millions of Americans, are known as geostationary satellites.
These satellites are placed in a high orbit of around 22,000 miles, in the hope that they will remain pointed at the same place on the earth's surface at all times. Geostationary satellites have proved valuable for a variety of tasks including broadcasting radio and television programs. But some analysts believe they are not well suited to providing quick two-way communications because signals that bounce off them must travel more than 40,000 miles on their round trip between earth and outer space.
Teledesic wants to put its satellites only about 850 miles above earth, allowing them to provide two-way communications with less delay. Some experts, though, are convinced that the complexity of managing a network of more than 250 satellites will eventually prove overwhelming, and yesterday's announcement did little to allay their concerns.
"There was a decision from both of them that there was probably no room for two guys in the market and maybe not for one," said Howard Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group, a high technology consulting firm in Boston. "It's the blind leading the visibly impaired."
Motorola said last year that it would spend almost $13 billion to develop a satellite network of its own for high-speed data communications, known as Celestri. The $750 million that Motorola intends to invest in Teledesic will be a combination of cash and the value of research it will share with Teledesic. Christopher Galvin, Motorola's chief executive, would not disclose the mix at a news conference yesterday.
Motorola is also developing a separate satellite network, known as Iridium, for providing mobile telephone and paging services anywhere on the globe. That project will not be affected by the company's Teledesic ties.
Just over a year ago, Teledesic announced that Boeing had become the project's prime contractor. Mr. McCaw said yesterday that Boeing should not feel slighted by the Motorola announcement.
"We're not jilting anyone," he said. "It's about deciding who's the quarterback and who's the fullback."
Harry Stonecipher, Boeing's president, said he was not disappointed by yesterday's developments. Boeing's contract with Teledesic would have been worth $9 billion, but much of that money would have gone to subcontractors hired by Boeing to complete specialized parts of the project. Analysts noted that losing the contract probably would not hurt Boeing's financial performance.
Indeed, Howard Rubel of Goldman, Sachs said Boeing might even have done well to limit its involvement in Teledesic by agreeing to launch the satellites while avoiding responsibility for the overall project.
Mr. Rubel said a system comparable to Teledesic's could perhaps be built using geostationary technology for less than a quarter of what Teledesic is spending. "And I'm not sure the speed or the costs to the customer are going to be that much different," he said.
"There are some interesting economics that still need to be proven out," Mr. Rubel said of Teledesic's business model. "Maybe that's why Boeing said, 'I'll launch these babies and I'll be a contract-for-hire here.' "

HEADLINE: The Mayor's Graciousness Gap

 BODY:
With crime down and the economy up, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has reigned over a revival of New York City. That said, it is time to note that seven months into his second term, the Mayor often exhibits an unnecessary imperiousness that ultimately cannot serve his city, his political aspirations or even his legacy.
What brings this tendency into focus this week is an attack on the Mayor by the Rev. Calvin Butts, a prominent Baptist minister from Harlem. Mr. Butts labeled Mr. Giuliani a "racist" and accused him of not liking black people and of instituting policies that have not only devastated minorities but are moving New York "toward a fascist state." 
 Mr. Butts's charges are opportunistic at best, reflecting his own political ambitions and perhaps even his efforts to push commercial development in his community. While Mr. Giuliani's relations with minority communities have been marked by clumsiness and needless tension, we do not think Mr. Butts can read the Mayor's mind or prove his highly personal charge from the public record.
But his overheated comments serve as a warning to City Hall that many New Yorkers feel bruised and excluded from Mayor Giuliani's tightly controlled vision of the city. They also offer a reminder, for the Mayor, that his job is no longer about winning an election but leading a city, an entire city, not just his natural supporters. Mr. Giuliani too automatically sees a critic as a foe. The ability to verbally whip an adversary does little to build consensus for changes in the way the city works that, however laudatory in the managerial sense, can be painful for those losing jobs or services.
Despite his ill-chosen words, Mr. Butts was explaining how minorities have fared under some of Mr. Giuliani's most recent policies. The dismissal of 600 hospital workers and 1,000 homeless workers, the push to end remedial classes at the City University of New York, the enduring questions about police brutality, the workfare-welfare rules -- these issues resonate in nonwhite neighborhoods around the city. The Mayor too often answers their questions, complaints or even anger with indignation when sympathetic diplomacy would be better.
The taxi protest scheduled for yesterday is a good example. Cab drivers canceled their demonstration when the Mayor threatened to have them arrested. They asked for a meeting instead -- undoubtedly a very good alternative. The Mayor refused. ". . . we broke their strike -- destroyed it," he exulted after many cabbies stayed home.
O.K., so he destroyed the strike. What do we do now about 44,000 fuming taxi drivers? Missing too often from the Mayor's political repertoire are the schmoozing skills -- the ability to smooth ruffled feelings after his victories, the defusing of incendiary language, the compromising around the edges that can make more people feel included in Mr. Giuliani's greater New York.

HEADLINE: Whitman Seeks Rise in Gas Tax for Transit and Conservation

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, May 21

 BODY:
Risking her reputation as a tax-cutter to promote conservation and transportation, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman called today for an increase of 7 cents per gallon in New Jersey's gasoline tax to help finance transportation improvements and a plan to preserve almost half the undeveloped land left in the state.
Flanked by supporters from a rare and new coalition of business and environmental leaders, Governor Whitman divided her proposed tax increase to win the support of each group. A nickel of the 7-cent increase would raise $210 million a year for new buses and trains, as well as bridge and highway repairs. The other two cents would generate $84 million a year for an annual fund of $170 million to help buy and preserve one million acres of farmland and open space over the next decade. 
New Jersey's gasoline tax now is 14.5 cents a gallon, one of the lowest in the country and far cheaper than Connecticut's 36 cents a gallon, the nation's highest, and New York's 30.4 cents. The proposed 7-cent increase would only go into effect if approved by both the State Legislature and the voters.
Mrs. Whitman said her goal of saving one million acres from developers would insure that her administration left a legacy of a "clean and green and livable" New Jersey.
"We want to give the gift of a bountiful and beautiful and economically viable state of New Jersey to our children and our grandchildren and their grandchildren," she said in Liberty State Park, with southern Manhattan serving as a backdrop across the harbor. "We want to save half the available land so future development happens where it should instead of gobbling up every inch of open land. We can and will win the race for open space."
National authorities on open space said that a trend for land preservation is spreading around the country and that they believed Mrs. Whitman's goal was one of the most ambitious yet proposed by a governor.
"It's a very impressive number for a state the size of New Jersey," said Phyllis Myers, head of State Resource Strategies, a Washington company specializing in state and local conservation campaigns.
Melanie Griffin, director of land protection for the Sierra Club, called Mrs. Whitman's proposal a "bold plan."
"We're seeing more and more that moderate Republicans are trying to improve their environmental record against sprawl," Ms. Griffin said, adding that she knew of only two larger conservation drives, both by private groups -- one to save six million acres of wilderness in Utah and another to preserve three million acres of forest in central Maine.
In addition to the $84 million from the gasoline tax, the Governor wants to use $50 million in existing proceeds from the state's tax on real estate sales and to raise $36 million from a new $3-a-day surcharge on car rentals.
Because the all these new revenues would be constitutionally dedicated for 10 years, or devoted exclusively to open-space purchases and transportation improvements, the entire package must be approved by a 60 percent vote of both houses of the New Jersey Legislature and by voters in a special referendum in November.
Legislators must agree to put the issue on the ballot, and the plan's fate in the Republican-controlled Legislature is uncertain. The President of the Senate, Donald T. DiFrancesco, said he favored the proposed 7-cent increase. Mr. DiFrancesco said he also favored using $50 million from the real estate tax for open-space purchases, but not as part of a dedicated 10-year fund. Instead, he said he wanted the Legislature to have the power to approve or withhold that money each year.
Democratic legislative leaders said they would withhold comment on the proposal until they had studied it more.
Governor Whitman's tax proposal is a significant reversal of policy for her. Her campaign promise of a 30 percent cut in state income taxes in 1993 is widely regarded as the single issue that won her election to her first term. During that term, she sought to control the rise in municipal property taxes by trying to impose state restrictions on local school spending.
Mrs. Whitman noted today that she had signed 17 different tax cuts during her tenure. Promising a new tax, she said, was not easy. But she called the proposed gasoline tax increase the fairest and most logical way to finance her open-space and transportation plans. And, she noted, out-of-state drivers would help pay it.
She also noted that her administration was not imposing a tax increase, but giving state residents the chance to vote on it.
Asked at a press conference whether she feared her proposal would tarnish her national reputation as a tax cutter, she replied, "I could care less." The remarks drew applause from the environmentalists and businessmen with her.
This coalition, a unique mix that normally shares little common ground politically, promised today to campaign for the plan both in the Legislature and, if successful there, with voters in the fall. The group is made up of 10 corporations, including Mobil Oil, DuPont, Bell Atlantic and three electrical companies, and 10 environmental groups. It is known as the Stockton Alliance, because it formed during a retreat four years ago at Stockton State College in southern New Jersey.
The group's co-chairman, Thomas J. Gilmore, president of the New Jersey Audubon Society, said winning approval of the dedicated open-space fund is the alliance's top priority. To help with the campaign, Mr. Gilmore said the alliance is recruiting dozens of other business and environmental leaders.
A Representative of each wing of the coalition stood beside Mrs. Whitman today on the podium: Michael Catania, executive director of the Nature Conservancy of New Jersey, and Philip K. Beachem, president of the New Jersey Alliance for Action, an umbrella organization representing corporations, building contractors, engineers, labor unions, and the academic community.
Mr. Beachem said his group's primary goal was getting more money for better highways, railroads and bridges. "But philosophically, linking it with open spaces makes a lot of sense," he said. Mr. Catania talked about a legacy of preserving broad expanses of open space. "This is not a partisan issue," he said.
Over the last three years of her term, Mrs. Whitman wants to save some 313,000 acres and leave office with a fund intact for the purchase and preservation of another 700,000 acres by 2008. Forty percent of the acreage would come from paying farmers not to sell their land to private developers.
An anti-tax group, New Jersey Tax Payers Task Force, said it opposed using the money to preserve private farm land, saying any land subsidized with tax dollars should be open to everyone. "The answer to open space is zoning, not spending billions of tax dollars to keep wealthy people's estates private and undeveloped," the group's president, John Budzash, said.
The other 60 percent of the land would be purchased in equal amounts by state, county, and town governments. Besides the $170 million raised each year from the higher gas tax, the car-rental surcharge, and the real estate taxes, other financing for the land would come from proceeds of local and county land-preservation taxes, repaid open-space loans the state has already made, and an extra $50 million the Governor wants added each year to the budget. She envisioned total spending of $762.2 million during the remainder of her term and some $2.2 billion by 2008.
She said her transportation plan, announced on Monday, would cost $30 billion over 12 years. The gas tax increase would provide more money for New Jersey's Transportation Trust Fund, and that would attract more matching funds from the Federal Government. About $15 billion would come from Federal funds, $13 billion from the transportation trust fund, and $2 billion from private investment.
The major elements she discussed on Monday include buying 1,400 new buses; replacing 424 rail cars and 17 locomotives in the state's mass transit system; repairing or widening 413 bridges; finishing construction of three new light rail lines and starting work on three other new commuter lines; easing congestion on 40 of the state's most crowded roadways; and making safety improvements at 100 of its most dangerous intersections.
James Benton, head of the New Jersey Petroleum Council, said the group favored the nickel increase for transportation projects but opposed the additional 2-cent increase proposed for open spaces. "We think the motor fuel tax should be dedicated to highways and other transportation improvements," Mr. Benton said.

HEADLINE: THE FALL OF SUHARTO: THE INVESTORS;
Companies Fear Costs Of Suharto Partnerships

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
For American and foreign companies seeking riches in Indonesia's fast-growing market over the last three decades, President Suharto, his family and coterie of cronies have been commercial gatekeepers, sometimes becoming partners in business ventures with a brashness that would have made other Asian dictators blush.
Now, with Mr. Suharto ousted by an outbreak of popular unrest, many American, Asian and European companies are left with expensive partnerships that seem unlikely to bear fruit. Indeed, some companies privately worry that their once-vaunted alliances may prove to be liabilities in the post-Suharto era, particularly if reformers take power and investigate the foreign contribution to the country's endemic corruption. 
 "I think the opposition is going to be very sophisticated," said Jeffrey Winters, a professor of political economy at Northwestern University. "They do not want to send out a signal of revenge across the board, but they are going to carefully select those foreign companies that have been most egregious. Those that have given the biggest perks to the Suharto family should be nervous."
Few businesses flourished in Indonesia without the support of the Suharto clan. The ex-President's three sons and three daughters are among Indonesia's most active business people, presiding over several big monopoly companies and holding hundreds of passive equity stakes in foreign multinational projects involved in everything from from petrochemicals telecommunications. Allying with the Suhartos did not guarantee success, analysts say, but alienating the family insured failure.
"Access to Indonesia has long depended on having close contacts and paying for them," says Daniel Lev, a political scientist at the University of Washington and an expert on Indonesia. "There were some foreign companies that were careful to play by the rules, but they were the exceptions."
The list of Suharto allies is long, and the types of partnerships varied. But a partial rendering of companies that have developed joint ventures or offered equity stakes to the Suharto children or the ex-President's closest business partners includes Hyatt hotels, Hughes, Lucent Technologies, General Electric, Edison Mission Energy, and Freeport McMoran of the United States, Sumitomo, NEC, and Marubeni of Japan, Kia Motors of South Korea, Hopewell Holdings of Hong Kong, and Deutsche Telekom and Siemens of Germany.
None of those companies has been accused of wrongdoing. Spokesmen for several defended the alliances as part of normal business practices. Moreover, Indonesian law requires investors in some areas, including basic infrastructure and mining, to offer shareholdings to local businesses, even if that partner contributes little capital or expertise.
Still, some corporate executives with long experience in Indonesia now worry not only about the country's collapsed economy, where per capita income has plunged from about $1,200 to about $300 in six months, but also that "strategic" relationships developed over many years may suddenly become liabilities.
"You wake up one morning and find the world turned upside down -- that's how I feel," said an Asia-based executive of a European energy company that has a longstanding alliance with one of Mr. Suharto's sons. "What do we do? We go on as before and hope that whoever takes power wants to keep moving forward."
Some other companies with much at stake in Indonesia declined to comment on their businesses there, or the potential backlash against their ties to the Suharto regime. One of the biggest American investors, the New Orleans-based mining concern Freeport, is currently partners with a top Suharto ally, Mohamad (Bob) Hasan, a plywood tycoon and ex-Cabinet minister, and has had dealings with members of the Suharto family since the late 1960's.
"It is too early to tell what the result of this leadership change will be," a company spokesman said.
Lucent Technologies, the former telecommunications equipment arm of AT&T, formed its business ties with one of Mr. Suharto's daughters in the mid-1980's. A Lucent spokeswoman, Lydia Whitefield, said the company did not expect any short-term adjustments in the ownership of its digital-switch making venture.
"There's not much looking back here in terms of philosophy," she said. "We are looking forward, trying to make sure our plant is serving our customers. That's what we are worried about."
Like companies that did business in the Philippines under the long rule of Ferdinand E. Marcos, companies forging agreements with Mr. Suharto's inner court often viewed that strategy as prudent, not risky. Mr. Suharto personally vetted investment projects and routinely overturned contracts issued by his bureaucracy that he found distasteful. In doing so, the President did not disguise his bias toward his children and his closest business allies -- or their partners.
Even through much of the Asian currency crisis that eventually led to his downfall, Mr. Suharto protected those who backed his family. He stoutly defended Indonesia's "national car" project spearheaded by Hutomo Mandala Putra, his 36-year-old son, against repeated attacks from his own bureaucracy and the World Trade Organization. Kia Motors was the joint venture partner for that deal, now considered scrapped.
Guests at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Jakarta said that army troops surrounded the five-star luxury hotel during recent riots, apparently to protect the property, but did not provide similar services to nearby rivals. The Grand Hyatt is owned by Bambang Trihatmodjo, a Suharto son. The American company Hyatt International manages the hotel on his behalf.
Some foreign investors were reluctant to link up with what was Indonesia's leading family. International Business Machines, for example, has shunned partnerships with the Suhartos, Mr. Winters said. The McDonald's Corporation has also steered clear of ties with the Suhartos or their close colleagues.

INTERNATIONAL A3-12
 
New Indonesian Chief Vows Democracy and Reforms
B. J. Habibie outlined a program of reforms, clean government and economic responsibility that addressed criticisms leveled against his predecessor, President Suharto, who resigned under pressure. Mr. Habibie pledged to dedicate himself to democratization, but many of the protesters who had demanded Mr. Suharto's resignation remain unsatisfied, calling Mr. Habibie a part of the old order who also should go. A1 

The Clinton Administration stepped up calls for a transition to democracy in Indonesia and, while welcoming the resignation of President Suharto, tried to distance itself from his successor, Mr. Habibie. Senior officials said the United States assumed -- and hoped -- that Mr. Habibie's tenure as President would be short. A9
 
The International Monetary Fund and the United States will watch for concrete signs that Indonesia's new President is committed to addressing his nation's deep-rooted economic problems before deciding on the terms of further financial aid. A10
 
Clinton May Ban Land Mines
In a shift in policy, the Clinton Administration has pledged to sign the international treaty that bans anti-personnel land mines. But the Administration's pledge, made in a letter from the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, has a caveat: the United States will agree to sign the treaty only if alternatives to the most powerful land mines can be found. A3
 
Saudi Speaks on Bomb Attack
A Saudi official has been quoted as saying that citizens of Saudi Arabia were behind the bombing that killed 19 United States airmen near the eastern city of Dhahran in June 1996 -- the first time that a Saudi official has so clearly ruled out any foreign participation in the attack. A11
 
Israeli Torture Cases Heard
After years of allowing Israel's secret service to use physical violence when questioning Palestinians, the country's Supreme Court has voiced frustration that the court has been saddled with responsibility for practices that human rights groups denounce as torture. The court's irritation emerged at the opening hearing by nine Supreme Court justices into six petitions filed by Palestinian detainees and human rights groups against the use of what the state calls "moderate physical pressure" in interrogations. A12
 
Chinese Dissident Detained
A leading democracy advocate who recently helped set up a human rights monitoring group said that he had been detained for 24 hours and that his fax machine, letters and other items had been confiscated by the police. He said two colleagues had also been held overnight. A4

Boy Accused in Shooting At Oregon High School
A 15-year-old boy shot at hundreds of students at a high school, killing one and wounding many, the police. Two adults were later found shot to death at the boy's home, and they were identified as his parents. A1
 
$195 Million Lottery for Couple
The sole winning ticket for the country's largest lottery jackpot, $195 million, is said to be in the hands of a retired couple from Illinois. A1
 
Tobacco Lobby Takes to TV
The tobacco lobby has pulled off a public relations coup, thanks in part to the televised image of a harried waitress who leans into the camera and sighs: "I'm no millionaire. I work hard. Why single me out?" A1
 
Barry Forgoes Re-election Bid
Marion S. Barry Jr. said he would not seek another term as Mayor of the District of Columbia. But Mr. Barry, 62, did not reveal what he would do instead after holding the job for 16 of the last 20 years. A14
 
Drug for Breast Cancer
A drug already used to treat advanced forms of breast cancer can cut the death rate from the disease when used in early treatment, doctors said. The drug, Taxol, is thus likely to be added relatively quickly to the standard chemotherapy used for women who have had breast cancer surgery, the doctors said. A14
 
China Executive Denies Charge
Liu Chaoying, the Chinese aerospace executive accused of contributing nearly $100,000 to the Democratic Party through a middleman in 1996, emphatically denied that she had ever done so. Ms. Liu asserted that she had never given any money, directly or indirectly, to any American political organization. A16
 
Germ-Warfare Defense
The Defense Department decided to spend $50 million to create "biological response units" in the National Guards of 10 of the largest states as President Clinton prepared to announce actions to bolster boost the nation's defenses against germ attacks, Government officials said. A18

Taxi Protest Is Greeted With Huge Show of Force
New York City responded with a heavy show of force to plans by some angry cabdrivers to disrupt a weekday's commerce and commute. It blocked cabs without passengers from coming into Manhattan, ringed City Hall with barricades, and sent dozens of police officers to follow a chanting crowd of drivers marching from midtown to downtown to protest tougher rules that the Mayor wants to impose on taxis. A1
 
New Jersey School Plan Backed
The New Jersey Supreme Court unanimously embraced Governor Whitman's plan to improve the state's urban schools without spending millions of dollars on new programs to help students overcome the disadvantages of poverty. The decision brings to a close a 28-year legal battle over the quality of public education for urban schoolchildren. A1
 
Accord on Commuter Aid
Congressional negotiators said they had reached agreement on a measure that would substantially cut the cost of bus and subway travel in the New York metropolitan region and across the nation by allowing employers to give workers up to $65 a month in tax-free mass transit benefits instead of salary. The provision will be part of a sweeping $200 billion transportation bill. B7

Stocks Resume Retreat, Nasdaq at Six-Week Low
A day after gains pushed blue-ship stocks sharply higher for no obvious reason, stock prices fell, and analysts saw various explanations: worries about corporate profit deceleration, worries about high prices, plus overall loss of stamina and momentum. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 39.11 points, to 9,132.37, and the S.& P. 500 index dropped 4.42, to 1,114.64. The Nasdaq index, heavily weighted with technology shares, fell 10.76 points to 1,820.99, its weakest level since early April. Page D6.
 
Treasury prices also fell, pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond up to 5.92 percent from 5.89 percent on Wednesday. D6.

Indonesia Leader Promises Change
B. J. Habibie, Indonesia's new President, outlined an agenda of economic overhaul and responsibility that addressed key criticisms of his predecessor, President Suharto. A1.
 
Suharto, his family and friends have been Indonesia's commercial gatekeepers for three decades, sometimes becoming partners in business ventures with a brashness that would have made other dictators blush. A10.

Tobacco Bill Action Delayed
Legislation designed to discourage teen-agers from smoking hit a potentially serious snag in the Senate, and further action was postponed until next month. The delay diminishes the prospects for final enactment of a tobacco bill this year. A22.
 
What the Fed Really Said in March
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's March 31 policy-making meeting show that as suspected, it held off raising interest rates in the belief that Asian financial problems would help repress inflation here.

HEADLINE: William Hewitt, 83, Responsible For Overseas Expansion of Deere

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
William A. Hewitt, who transformed Deere & Company from a midsized Midwestern tractor company to the world's largest producer of agricultural equipment, died on Saturday at his home in Rutherford, Calif. He was 83.
The cause was a heart attack, his family said. 
 As the longtime chief executive of Deere, Mr. Hewitt was responsible for the company's international expansion, which helped Deere's sales surge from less than $300 million when he became president in 1955 to more than $5 billion by the time of his retirement as chairman in 1982.
But Mr. Hewitt's boldest decision may have been to commission Eero Saarinen, the internationally known architect, to build a modern company headquarters in the middle of cornfields in Moline, Ill.
When the building was completed in 1964, it was greeted with almost universal praise, from both employees and architecture critics. And the building has stood the test of time; Paul Goldberger, the architecture critic for The New York Times, described the building in 1978 as "one of the most beautifully sited structures in contemporary American architecture," with an atmosphere of "utter dignity and serenity."
William Alexander Hewitt was born in San Francisco in 1914, and graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1937 with a degree in economics.
He served in the Navy in World War II, and retired as a lieutenant commander.
In 1948, Mr. Hewitt married Patricia Deere Wiman -- the daughter of Deere's chief executive and the great-great-grandaughter of the original John Deere, who invented a steel plow in 1837 -- and then joined the company.
After a stint in Deere's San Francisco sales office, Mr. Hewitt moved to Moline in 1954 to become executive vice president of the company. The next year, after his father-in-law died, he became president.
During his tenure, Deere became one of the first companies to recognize -- and profit from -- the shift in agriculture from small family farms to larger commercial operations.
Mr. Hewitt believed businessmen should have broad interests, and he did. He was active in civic affairs, collected art and owned a vineyard in Napa Valley. With his wife, who died in 1992, he raised horses.
In addition to serving as a director of several large public companies, Mr. Hewitt was on the board of many institutions involved in architecture, foreign aid and international affairs. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan appointed him Ambassador to Jamaica, where he served until 1985.
He is survived by two daughters, Anna Wolfe of Des Moines, N.M., and Adrienne Hewitt of Middleburg, Va.; a son, Alexander, of Denver; a sister, Adrienne Gordon, of San Francisco, and a brother, Edward T. Hewitt, of New York.

HEADLINE: SHOOTINGS IN A SCHOOL: THE TOWN;
Oasis With a Dark Side

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
There is no more idyllic spot in May than Springfield, Ore., and its sister city, Eugene, Ann Rule wrote in "Small Sacrifices,"a nonfiction work that was a paperback best seller in the late 1980's. "Sheltered by the Cascade Range to the east and the steel-blue and purple ridges of the coastal mountains on the western horizon," Ms. Rule wrote, "the valley was an oasis for pioneers a century ago."
People in Springfield spend their weekends fishing, hunting and rafting, residents said, glad to be away from the comparative hustle-bustle of Eugene, just across Interstate 5. 
 But the topic of Ms. Rule's book and yesterday's shooting in a high school cafeteria showed another side of Springfield, a mostly white, blue-collar, timber town turned bedroom community of 55,000 people that has long been overshadowed by Eugene, the home of the University of Oregon.
"Small Sacrifices" focuses onDiane Downs, a 27-year-old mother of three who was convicted in 1984 of shooting herself and her three children, and then falsely claiming that a "shaggy-haired stranger" shot them.
And just last week a 22-year-old Springfield man was convicted of kidnapping, raping and killing his 15-year-old former girlfriend and killing her new boyfriend, 15, and another 13-year-old boy in December 1995. A second defendant is awaiting trial.
Residents of Springfield say the crimes paint a skewed picture of a usually tranquil town that is economically rebounding after decades of decline.
Sony built a new microchip plant in the town. And the eastern part of Springfield, where the shooting occurred at Thurston High School, is sprouting suburban-style homes.
"This is very stunning for this community," said Norm Fox, 51, a local radio talk show host and 25-year resident of Springfield. Despite the town's star-crossed past, he said, "There's been nothing at all like this."

HEADLINE: With Attack on Giuliani, Pastor Returns to Fiery Past

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
Some years ago, the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d said, he decided to leave the marching in the streets and "banging on the mayor's door" to other black civil rights leaders. Instead, he decided he would knock softly on the doors of power, negotiate with city officials, cultivate relationships with the leaders of large corporations, all in an effort to attract investment, development and sorely needed jobs to his impoverished community in central Harlem.
A day after broadly condemning Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration, including branding the Mayor a racist, Mr. Butts said yesterday that he realized that his insider's approach to politics had failed, at least at City Hall. 
 "I had some hope that he was the kind of person you could deal with," Mr. Butts said, referring to the Mayor. "I've just about lost that hope."
Mr. Butts's critique of the Giuliani administration -- delivered at a news conference Wednesday at the Abyssinian Baptist Church, where he is pastor -- came as he warned that tensions between the police and Harlem residents were in danger of boiling over into an "explosion."
But even as Mr. Butts spoke Wednesday, pastors from several leading black churches, some of whom he had invited to join him at his news conference, were instead three blocks away, rallying at Harlem Hospital against the planned layoffs of several hundred workers. One of the few clergymen at Mr. Butts's side was the Rev. Benjamin F. Muhammad of the Nation of Islam's Mosque No. 7, in Harlem.
Mr. Butts's attempt at quiet diplomacy has long made him an outsider, and even a political nemesis, to the circle of more outspoken black leaders like the Rev. Al Sharpton. And far from prompting his welcome back into that fold, Mr. Butts's uncharacteristic outburst against Mr. Giuliani brought him more public criticism than praise.
In a front-page editorial yesterday, The Amsterdam News, the city's leading black newspaper, said Mr. Butts had "got the idea that he'd better get on this train of renewed black militancy before it runs over him. Black folks must not be lured by this conversion of Butts.
"It is not that we reject Butts; we simply reject his attempt at trying to lead us now, when he sees that we do not need him," Wilbert A. Tatum, the chairman of the newspaper's board and its former editor, said in the signed editorial.
Mr. Butts said that he had received dozens of telephone calls of support yesterday, although no one rose to his defense publicly.
"It hasn't hurt me in the black community," he said. "And for those people who know me and work with me in the so-called white community, I don't see it as having hurt. Why would people be upset because I'm speaking up for children, and for education, and for civil liberties?" He attributed the editorial in The Amsterdam News to Mr. Tatum's longstanding animosity toward him.
At the news conference, Mr. Butts recited a litany of instances in which he said the Giuliani administration and the police had victimized minorities, among them the layoffs at Harlem Hospital, failing to address public school construction adequately, and cutting funds for legal services for the poor. He also presented two young men, the sons of a deacon and deaconess in his church, who said they had been wrongly arrested last month by officers in a drug sweep.
Earlier in his career, Mr. Butts was a far more confrontational political presence. In 1983, he and other black ministers pressed the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch on police brutality, leading to reforms that included the hiring of the city's first black Police Commissioner, Benjamin Ward, and the addition of independent civilians to the panel that reviews allegations of police brutality.
But as he aged, Mr. Butts said, and after Republicans won control of City Hall and the Governor's mansion, he found himself wanting "to be able to negotiate rather than have to get out in the street all the time."
When Mr. Giuliani, as a candidate in 1993, showed up one day to discuss economic development, Mr. Butts said he was charmed.
"I said, 'Let's watch and see what happens,' " he recalled.
Mr. Butts said that he started to grow disillusioned with Mr. Giuliani soon after the Mayor took office in 1994. Mr. Butts said he met with the Mayor and several of his aides, and "talked about how to move things forward."
"Then I'd leave, and some of the stuff we'd talked about wouldn't happen," Mr. Butts said. "I'd call some of his commissioners, they'd slam the phone down. It just started deteriorating from that time on.
"Then, when you'd want to talk to him about hard issues -- health care, schools, brutality -- there'd be no response," Mr. Butts continued. He said he had held off confronting the Mayor publicly for so long because "it makes me look like a bad guy in the eyes of some New Yorkers."
"You know," he said, "you're fighting the police."

HEADLINE: SHOOTINGS IN A SCHOOL: THE OVERVIEW;
Oregon Student Held in 3 Killings; One Dead, 23 Hurt at His School

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Ore., May 21

 BODY:
Minutes before the 8 o'clock bell rang to start the day at Thurston High School today, a student carrying three guns opened fire on hundreds of other students gathered in the cafeteria, killing one, the police said. Twenty-three other students were injured, five critically, by gunfire and in the resulting melee.
As the student tried to reload a .22- caliber rifle, a member of the wrestling team, who had been critically injured, tackled him, and other students helped subdue him. An hour later, the police said, at the suggestion of the 15-year-old boy, identified as Kipland F. Kinkel, officers went to his home and found two adults shot to death there. The boy's grandmother confirmed they were his parents. 
 "Kip is my grandson; he murdered his mother and father," said Katie Kinkel, who lives in Eugene, a college town that borders Springfield. Asked in an interview if she was certain, Mrs. Kinkel, badly shaken, said, "For sure."
The police said the teen-ager had been suspended from school the day before, on Wednesday, for bringing a gun to school. They said he had been charged with possession of a stolen gun and then released to his parents, who were both teachers.
As students, teachers and others in this Willamette Valley town of 55,000 people reacted with shock to the shooting, the latest in a series of fatal school shootings by students across the country, state and school officials in Oregon defended the high school's disciplining of Mr. Kinkel the day before.
The state superintendent of schools, Norma Paulus, said the school had acted responsibly on Wednesday by suspending the student, pending an expulsion after an investigation. "This is not a school problem," she said. "This is a societal problem."
The Governor of Oregon, John Kitzhaber, said: "All of us should look at how we have failed as a society and how this could happen in the heart of Oregon. It has been a priority to build prison cells and prison beds -- after the fact. These actions in no way prevent juvenile violence."
Megan Conklin, a junior who took the same school bus with Mr. Kinkel, said after the shooting, "He said on the bus that he was mad and he was going to do something stupid. He's a mean kid. He'd said some horrible things to me before."
Ms. Conklin was in the cafeteria when the shooting began. "He kicked the door, and he was in this trench coat, and I thought it was part of the play that we were supposed to have today," she said. "Then people started falling and screaming and bleeding. People were pushing to get out."
Michelle Calhoun, 17, said, "He walked in, didn't look like he was bothered by anything, and just started shooting at random. I'm angry. This is a good, happy school."
Her boyfriend, 17-year-old Mikael Nickolauson, a junior who had recently enlisted in the Oregon National Guard, was sitting nearby and was shot and killed. Tonight, Teresa Clark, a family friend answering calls to the Nickolauson home, said: "This is just a really hard time. Everything is up in the air."
At an evening news conference, the police said Mr. Kinkel probably would have shot more students if he had not been wrestled to the ground. They said they believe no one else but Mr. Kinkel was involved in the shootings at the school or the house.
Mr. Kinkel was carrying a semiautomatic, .22-caliber rifle, a .22-caliber handgun and a Glock pistol, they said. Among the critically injured was the wrestler who tackled Mr. Kinkel, Jacob Ryker.
Several students said Mr. Kinkel had been upset over teasing from older students, and that he had a temper and a troubled past. The police said that the boy had once been questioned by officers in a neighboring county for throwing rocks at cars from a freeway overpass.
Mr. Kinkel is the son of two teachers, William Kinkel, 59, and Faith Kinkel, 57. Mr. Kinkel was retired. Mrs. Kinkel was still teaching in a school district of Springfield, a working-class town near Eugene, about 110 miles south of Portland.
The Kinkel family lived in a new, rural development about 12 miles from the edge of Springfield, in a two-story frame house above the McKenzie River. They had one other child, a daughter, who is much older and does not live in town.
The boy was active in sports but in the last few years had undergone a marked change in personality, friends said.
"I coached him in soccer, basketball, and baseball," said Dave Wing, a grocery store owner, who knew the family well. "It was an excellent family. Good people. Kip had a temper though. If he didn't get his way, he would kick and shout."
Some neighbor boys said in the last years that young Kinkel started dressing in black and taking on the pose of a "Gothic," a youth persona with music and style, gloomy and dark.
"He was a good kid in grade school, but then his freshman year, he started wearing black and not talking to people," said Jessica Rose, a neighbor who rode the bus with the boy.
Some friends indicated that the boy may have intended to shoot up the school on Wednesday. . Students said he was angry about insults from seniors. On Wednesday, the police said, they were called to the school on a report of a stolen gun, questioned the boy, found the gun, and took him to the police station for booking and fingerprinting.
He was released under Oregon law for arrests on this type of offense, being in possession of a stolen weapon. The authorities said today that they would try the boy as an adult. In Oregon, because of his age he could not be executed if convicted.
The police said they did not know if the shooting at the boy's home occurred on Wednesday night or today.
The authorities said the boy took a family car to school today.
Just before 8 A.M., senior boys were gathered in the library for senior awards day, preparing to give out awards for sports and other activities. In the cafeteria, students were eating breakfast and socializing.
"I thought it was fireworks, and then I thought it was a cap gun," said Stephani Quimby, a student at the school.
"He walked in and he was wearing this big, long trench coat and he pulled out a rifle," said James Kistner, another student. "He squeezed off, I say, about three or four rounds. Then there was like a short pause. And from there on he just kept his finger on the trigger and let ammo fly."
Witnesses gave conflicting accounts of how long the shooting went on. Some students said it lasted as long as 10 minutes. "It didn't look like he was bothered by anything," Miss Calhoun said. "Like the shooting was just something he was doing."
Miss Calhoun said the dead student, Mr. Nickolauson, had been her boyfriend for nine months. She said Mr. Nickolauson was a native of Springfield, who loved science fiction.
A Springfield police officer who interrogated Mr. Kinkel, Capt. Jerry Smith, said, "When I spoke to him he was very calm."
Springfield is known as a timber town, with a rural feel, though in recent years it has been on an economic upswing with the arrival of computer-chip factories. Residents here said many students are familiar with guns, because they hunt.
The school does not have metal detectors, but it has a strict no-gun policy, and the students and teachers had spoken often about violence.
"You can't even bring a squirt gun into this school," said Shayla Johnson, a senior. She and three other friends were holding hands outside the school, where a fence was bedecked with flowers.
The wounded students were taken to two hospitals. Nineteen students were injured by gunfire. Others were hurt in the scramble to get out of the line of fire, hospital officials said.
"I ducked down, and then ran for the door -- we were all just trying to get out," said Miss Calhoun. "I'm really proud of those boys who tried to hold the kid down."
Miss Calhoun was carrying a single red rose in honor of her slain friend. "This school is the last place you would expect something like this to happen," she said.
One parent, Angela Graybow, was preparing a paper on school violence for the community college she attends. She said she believed Springfield was not immune. Once Mr. Kinkel had been arrested for carrying a gun, she said, he should not have been released. "They should have had somebody watching him," she said.
Some students said Mr. Kinkel used to make odd statements about building a bomb or committing violence, but few people took him seriously. "He threatened, people knew what was going to happen," said Pam Kelly, a junior at the school.
The police, as of today, took the bomb-building stories seriously. Fearing that the Kinkel house might be wired with a bomb, officers cordoned off several blocks.
Thurston is one of two public high schools in Springfield, and has about 1,700 students. No one interviewed could recall episodes of student violence, except a knife fight two years ago.

City Jobless Rate Falls to 8.1 Percent

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
Unemployment in New York City fell to 8.1 percent in April from 8.6 percent in March, after adjustment for seasonal fluctuations, according to New York State Department of Labor figures released yesterday by the City Comptroller's office.
The jobless level last month was the lowest in three years, but it reflected a shrinking labor force as well as a strong economy, city officials said. 
 Nationally, the unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent in April from 4.7 percent the month before. For all of New York State, the rate fell to 5.8 percent from 6.1 percent.
In New York City, the private sector added a seasonally adjusted 15,100 jobs in April for a four-month total of 50,600.
"This is the best four-month job gain since 1967, as far back as we have numbers," Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi said.
The actual number of jobs added in April was reduced by 1,100 government positions, mostly a loss of 800 jobs from local agencies, including the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. NICK RAVO

'Brushed Voices'
'Calligraphy in Contemporary China'
Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery
Schermerhorn Hall
Columbia University
116th Street and Broadway
Morningside Heights
Through June 6
Contemporary Chinese art has had exceptional visibility in New York in the last year. And this exhibition, tracing fresh developments in the ancient art form most closely associated with China's cultural identity, is an important cap to the season. 
 Organized by Yiguo Zhang, a graduate student in Columbia's art history department, the show includes some 60 examples of work recently produced in China, where calligraphy is enjoying an efflorescence. Public competitions, publications and academic courses devoted to the form abound, and an art historically associated with a cadre of elite practitioners has gained an ardent following that crosses social and economic lines.
With popularity has come change. Traditional scripts are used, but with characters often made big, bold and instantly readable. Fleet-looking cursive styles, suggesting modern velocity and expressive freedom, are in vogue. Western-style Pop elements appear, as in a piece by Sun Xiaoyun that combines the character for "dancing" with a newspaper photograph of Martha Graham. And in some cases, characters are eliminated altogether to produce an abstract gestural painting, as seen in the polychrome works by Luo Qi, an artist associated with the post-modern style known as calligraphyism.
Are calligraphy and abstraction ultimately irreconcilable? If they are not, how is the new hybrid work to be approached and critically evaluated? And what of the moral dimensions traditionally attributed to this painstakingly mastered art? Do they still have currency in the modern world?
These are among the many questions raised in Mr. Zhang's fine exhibition catalogue, which includes an interview with the American painter Brice Marden. The book is a model of its kind -- clearly written, clean in design, full of scholarly information -- and an essential guide to a language-based art. But even without it, the dynamism of contemporary calligraphy comes across in a show that is unmistakably a gathering of utterly distinctive voices with things both old and new to say.

HEADLINE: Just Do It? Nah, Just Study It!;
Working Up a Sweat Over the Deep Meaning of Sport

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
On the first day of class in her course "Sport and Contemporary America," Professor Cheryl Cole of the University of Illinois distributes photographs of Michael Jordan and then asks the students a question: What do they see?
Hint: A great athlete heading to the hoop is the wrong answer. 
 "I ask them what are the political, social, economic, cultural and psychic dimensions of what's shown in the pictures," Professor Cole said. "They don't get it, but I certainly have their attention after that."
Deep thoughts about the realm of sweat socks and jocks might seem to some people to be a contradiction. Athletes themselves usually say that success in sports means learning to shut off the internal dialogue entirely, and that at the height of physical performance too much thought only gets in the way. There is only the doing: the scoring of the basket, the sinking of the putt, the pitch and the swing. No one, in the end, can really explain how to hit a home run.
But in the academic field of sports studies, which has emerged at colleges across the country over the last decade, deconstructing Michael Jordan is only the beginning. Sport is now regarded by social scientists as a lens on human behavior, by economists as a growth industry and by feminists as a vehicle for examining and challenging sexual roles. Perhaps most important, it is being embraced by growing numbers of students. In the process, many old ideas about physical education, even the term itself, are gasping their last breath.
"Sport is being disbursed through a number of different spaces in the popular culture -- you have links between sport, fashion and music; the hip-hop style borrows from sport; Disney has an interest in a hockey team and now a cartoon show, 'The Mighty Ducks,' " Professor Cole said. "We're trying to make the connections."
Experts in this new area generally prefer the term "sport," in the singular, cosmic sense, in describing what they study -- to distinguish it, perhaps, from "sports," of the sort that people read about over breakfast or on the subway. Kinesiology has supplanted P.E. on campuses as a way of looking at how bodies perform under physical strain and training. Students in "sport and gender" courses are studying how the starchy images of female athletes from the former Soviet Union were used during the cold war for propaganda purposes. Sports marketing majors scrutinize Nike's "swoosh" as a case study in sports branding.
There are sport sociologists studying Andre Agassi's effect on definitions of masculinity among white Generation X males, sport philosophers pondering the Olympics' relationship to post-modernism, and sport ethnographers researching the socioeconomic history of women's ice hockey.
"Sport is such a wonderful empirical site to take on a lot of ideas," said Michael Messner, former president of the American Society for the Sociology of Sport, and a professor of sociology at the University of Southern California. "It has become a place for a lot of our most sophisticated thinking." Professor Cole at the University of Illinois believes that sport in the late 20th century has become a universal mirror. Thinking hard about how the nation regards Michael Jordan or how Nike combines sports images and flag-draped American symbols to sell shoes around the world, she argues, is not a mere academic parlor exercise but a way of examining race, multinational capitalism, media and culture.
High-minded study of sports is not new. Some universities in Britain and Canada, in particular, have had established sports studies programs for many years. In the United States, however, tradition long held that sports occupied the merely physical realm and was not worthy of real scholarship. But many sports scholars now say that its exclusion was, in the end, a good thing: sports studies belonged to no department that could rise to defend it as turf, or attack it as heretical. No one cared.
The departments that emerged are like quilts of unrelated threads and fabrics. One intellectual strand came, for example, from feminism. As scholars began looking for patterns in society and culture that had reinforced sexual roles, sports was an obvious example. In the business schools, the huge impact of sports, both as a business and a marketing tool, got too big to ignore. Leisure studies, which focus on how people spend their time and money on things like tourism and sporting events, got folded in as well. At Bowling Green State University in Ohio, there are psychology professors, business management and marketing professors, sociologists and kinesiologists -- all in the division of Sport Management, Recreation and Tourism, with sports as their main -- perhaps only -- point in common.
"In a lot of ways it's an uncharted territory," said Leslie Heywood, a professor of English at the State University of New York at Binghamton and the author of a new book about female bodybuilders, "Body Makers: A Cultural Anatomy of Women's Bodybuilding" (Rutgers University Press). "From English literature, to all these other areas, there's a huge potential" for new research, she said.
Professor Heywood, who is also a power lifter, said her book explores the conflict between the healing and the confidence-building that bodybuilding provides many women. Many abused women seek it out as therapy. It also examines the demeaning imagery with which they often find themselves depicted in muscle magazines.
She also noted the persistence of stereotypes of professors or Ph.D's as fussy eggheads whose closest brush with physical competition is chess club meetings. But the reality is that many in academia have taken part in sports. This is especially true of women who came of age in the 1970's and after, when their opportunities in sports expanded. Professor Heywood ran track before discovering the joy of weights. Professor Cole played water polo.
Laurence De Garis, who received his Ph.D. from the University of Connecticut's department of Sport, Leisure and Exercise Sciences this year, is in many ways an exemplar of the field: he worked his way through school as a professional wrestler.
He also used wrestling for material. His dissertation was on the ethnic and socioeconomic life of a boxing gym, Gleason's in Brooklyn. In a boxing gym, he said, stockbrokers looking for a workout might find themselves sparring with tough kids from poor neighborhoods trying to fight their way to something better. Issues of race and ambition and exploitation are everywhere as fighters' careers are made or broken. And in wrestling, he added, one can see how much of what passes for reality is really manipulated imagery.
"One of the things you learn pretty quickly in wrestling is that seeing isn't always believing -- what you see isn't always what's going on," he said. "You have to look deeper."
But these departments do more than analyze the relationship of sports and society. Their rise is a part of the story itself, of how sports and fitness and capitalism and culture and fashion blur at the edges and how sports can be an agent of change. The involvement of more girls in sports, for example, is changing attitudes toward competition and aggression, some say.
Seven years ago, when Professor Vikki Krane, a psychologist at Bowling Green, began teaching in the school's sports division, her surveys of students in her classes showed stark divisions between men and women. A crucial question in the survey was about the moral and psychological cost of victory: Was deliberately hurting an opponent to win acceptable behavior?
In the early 1990's, male students were far more likely to say yes than female students, she said. But year by year, the gap has been closing, with more and more women saying that inflicting intentional injury is an acceptable price to pay for victory.
"Now women are more similar: they're encouraged to win at all costs, just like the males are," Professor Krane said.
Sports studies have also been, in some ways, an agent of change in academia itself. The significant role of feminist scholars in the field was partly by design, many professors say, since creating sports studies required crossing many departmental lines at traditional, male-dominated universities.
"There's been a lot of feminist influence as sports studies developed," said Professor Messner at the University of Southern California. "They have been at the forefront in breaking down the boundaries."
A bittersweet consequence is that the sweaty world of physical education departments, which produced generations of gym teachers and coaches, is fading fast. At the University of Connecticut, where that department has been eliminated, the last physical education major is moving through his studies and will graduate in 2000. By contrast, the school now has 150 undergraduates and 100 graduate students doing sports studies. Dr. De Garis, meanwhile, intends to keep wrestling. Six feet tall and weighing in at 230 fighting pounds, he says he knows how to throw his weight around. He also lets the other wrestlers know about his new status.
"I make them call me Doctor," he said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Buying Spree From U.S. Sets Record in Asia

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON 

 BODY:
United States takeovers of Asian companies have hit a record this year, reflecting the economic distress in parts of Asia and the opportunities that many American buyers see in picking up valuable businesses at bargain prices.
Through Wednesday, the dollar value of announced United States acquisitions of Asian companies totaled $4.85 billion, according to the Securities Data Company, which compiles data on cross-border corporate takeovers. That surpasses the previous yearly record of $4.25 billion in 1996. 
 While the total may seem small compared with the value of United States mergers announced in recent months, such as Travelers Group's $70 billion union with Citicorp, the activity shows no signs of slowing.
"Companies are pursuing opportunities that they've been interested in for a while," said Phyllis Korff, coordinator of the Asian Pacific practice at the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. "We've got a stable of Fortune 500 clients along with their investment bankers who are contacting us."
Japan leads the Securities Data list in announced deals, with $2.6 billion this year, followed by Thailand, with $817 million; Indonesia, $443 million; South Korea, $404 million, and Hong Kong, $280 million.
Prominent deals for Japanese companies included the GE Capital Corporation's purchase of Toho Mutual Life for $820 million and Goldman, Sachs & Company's acquisition of Yamato Mutual Life Insurance for $455 million.
"For the first time in decades, in selected special situations, you can go in and buy specific properties," said David McCreery, an investment banker at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company with experience in Japan. But, he said, "It is still not a market where businesses are for sale; you have to make it happen."
Interest in Asia has kept bankers like Gary Stead, head of Merrill Lynch's mergers and acquisitions team in the Asia Pacific region, on the move. On a weeklong visit to New York in late March, Mr. Stead visited an average of five companies a day interested in business abroad. That was after 20 scheduled meetings in London and Paris. At Lazard Freres & Company, inquiries from domestic and European companies about acquiring Asian businesses have increased fourfold so far this year.
Experts say that it is unlikely that investors in the short term will do more than buy smaller companies that complement existing businesses because buying a large Asian company is still considered too risky until economic and political instability subsides, particularly in Indonesia.
"It's difficult for United States companies to get their arms around it quickly," Ms. Korff said. "That's why the first investment is a little smaller."
Companies likely to make the smartest acquisitions are already familiar with an Asian company's operations, either because they are involved in a joint venture or have been doing business in Asia for some time.
"You can't go out there only to bottom-fish," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. "What you buy has to fit in with a strategic plan for the region or globally."

HEADLINE: Dealer in U.S. Debt Is Ending Operations

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Eastbridge Capital Inc., one of the 36 primary dealers that deal directly with the Federal Reserve's securities trading desk, said yesterday that it was closing down operations.
The New York-based securities firm is a unit of Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. of Japan, which announced last year that it was closing all overseas units and affiliates to cut costs and increase efficiency. 
 Eastbridge, which was formed in 1989 and employs about 50 people, is entering into a voluntary liquidation and plans to meet all obligations and pay all creditors.
Eastbridge will enter into trades only to offset and unwind outstanding positions, the company said.
Nippon Credit Bank estimated it had 1.69 trillion yen ($12.5 billion) in bad loans on its books as of March 31, when calculated under the extended definition of bad debt used in the United States. The estimate was included in a cost-cutting plan submitted to the Government earlier this year when the bank, along with 20 other major Japanese lenders, applied for public financing to increase capital.
As a primary dealer, Eastbridge is one of 36 firms that has a business relationship with the Federal Reserve's government securities trading desk. The Fed turns to these firms to buy and sell securities, as it adjusts the amount of money in the economy. Primary dealers are also required to bid on new government securities and provide market information to the Fed.

HEADLINE: John William Berry Sr., 75; Made Fortune on Yellow Pages

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
John William Berry Sr., a philanthropist who made a fortune taking the Yellow Pages global, died on Wednesday at Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio. He was 75 and lived in New Carlisle, Ohio.
The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said. 
 Mr. Berry, a native of Dayton, was one of its greatest boosters. Just this year, he pledged $7.5 million for scholarships at the University of Dayton, the largest private commitment to the school ever. Scores of other institutions of all descriptions in and around the city also benefited from his philanthropy.
The family's wealth sprang from an idea his father, Loren Murphy Berry, had in 1909 when he sold $700 of advertising to help an uncle in Marion, Ill., print a list of subscribers to his budding telephone company. The partnership took off and, under John Berry's tutelage, L. M. Berry & Company burgeoned into a $1-billion-a-year giant by the time Mr. Berry sold it to the BellSouth Corporation in 1986 for an undisclosed amount.
Loren Berry brought the Yellow Pages to mid-America; John Berry took them to the world. Yellow, incidentally, was chosen, according to company lore, because Loren Berry deemed it the best background for black type.
John Berry became the company's president in 1963 and three years later entered a joint venture with the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, ITT-World Directories. It quickly grew into the biggest Yellow Pages company outside the United States -- except that the Europeans call them Golden and Australians settled for Pink.
Mr. Berry earned a degree in business administration from Dartmouth College in 1944. He began his career as a salesman in his father's company in 1940, rose to managing director in 1960, president in 1963 and chairman in 1973.
After he sold the company, now a BellSouth subsidiary called the Berry Company, he founded Berry Investments Inc. with the proceeds. At his death, he was its chairman.
In 1992, he gave $25 million to Dartmouth, the largest individual gift in its 229-year history. He and a family foundation also paid for most of the college's $35 million Berry Library, for which ground was broken this month, next to the existing Baker Library.
Mr. Berry endowed the Loren Berry Professorship in Economics at Dartmouth in 1978 and the John W. Berry Sports Center in 1987.
He sat on the executive board committee of the Ohio Republican Finance Committee and served as a trustee of the University of Dayton and Ohio State University.
Mr. Berry is survived by his wife of 11 years, Marilynn St. John Berry; five sons, George W. of Boston, John Jr. of Dayton, David L. of San Francisco, Charles D. of Dayton, and Richard L. of Denver; a brother, Lee H. of New Albany, Ohio; two sisters, Martha Fraim of Palm Desert, Calif., and Elizabeth Gray of Oakwood, Ohio, and 18 grandchildren.
Two earlier marriages ended in divorces.

HEADLINE: S.& L. Expands Pledge on Loans

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, May 22

 BODY:
Washington Mutual Inc., whose $9.8 billion purchase of H. F. Ahmanson & Company is pending, said today that it was designating $120 billion for loans to lower-income consumers and communities over 10 years.
The commitment by the company, the largest United States savings institution, includes loans and investments for affordable housing, small businesses and economic development in the western United States, Florida and Texas. The plan, which expands a $75 billion program Washington Mutual announced last year, will start in 1999, if the acquisition of Ahmanson, based in Irwindale, Calif., is completed. 
 The Seattle-based Washington Mutual's program addresses obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks and savings institutions to make loans available to low-income communities.
Washington Mutual agreed in March to buy Ahmanson in a deal that would create an institution with about $150 billion in assets.
Big low-income lending pledges have become a standard feature of mergers involving banks and savings institutions as the companies seek to line up support for the deals.

HEADLINE: Text of Correspondence on Waiver to Permit Satellite Export

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
Following are the text of a letter from Thomas B. Ross, vice president of Government Relations at Loral Space and Communications, to Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, and the text of a memorandum for the President prepared by Mr. Berger; Larry Stein, the White House Congressional liaison, and Daniel K. Tarullo, then assistant to the President for international economic policy. The memorandum, which was declassified on Thursday, was dated Feb. 12 and dealt with a Presidential national-interest waiver for the Chinasat 8 communications satellite project by Loral. The letter from Mr. Ross was dated Feb. 13.
 
FROM THE MEMORANDUM
 
Purpose
To decide whether to waive Tiananmen sanctions to permit the licensing of communications satellites and related technology and equipment for export to China by Space Systems/Loral. 

Background
The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1990 and 1991, passed in the wake of the events of Tiananmen Square, suspended the licensing of exports of certain items to China, including defense articles on the U.S. Munitions List and U.S.-origin commercial satellites for launch on Chinese vehicles. These suspensions can be waived if the President reports to Congress that it is in the national interest to do so.
The Department of State, with the concurrence of the Department of Defense and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, recommends that you waive the legislative restriction on the export to China of the communications satellites and related equipment for the Space Systems/Loral (SS/L) Chinasat 8 project, worth approximately $60-65 million in U.S. content. Since 1993, you have issued 11 such waivers for U.S.-China commercial space projects, which have benefited several U.S. companies, including Loral, Iridium and Hughes, and supported our broader engagement strategy with China.
In this particular instance, however, the Criminal Division of the Justice Department has cautioned that a national-interest waiver in this case could have a significant adverse impact on any prosecution that might take place, based on a pending investigation of export violations by SS/L. Justice is investigating SS/L's unauthorized transfer of defense services to the Chinese during their joint inquiry into an explosion of a Chinese launch rocket carrying an SS/L satellite in 1996 -- a transfer that could have contributed to the Chinese ballistic missile program. SS/L acknowledges that an unauthorized transfer of technical information took place, but Justice has not decided whether it will take criminal action against SS/L. Justice believes that a jury would not convict once it learned that the President had found SS/L's Chinasat 8 project to be in the national interest. We will take the firm position that this waiver does not exonerate or in any way prejudge SS/L with respect to its prior unauthorized transfers to China. Nevertheless, if Justice's is correct on this matter, the proposed waiver might be criticized for letting SS/L off the hook on criminal charges for its unauthorized assistance to China's ballistic missile program.
In any case, we believe that the advantages of this project outweigh this risk and that we can effectively rebut criticism of the waiver. On fairness grounds, we believe it is inappropriate to penalize SS/L before they have even been charged with any crime, especially since we have had no problems with two subsequent launches of Loral satellites. In addition, the investigation deals with a transfer which took place in connection with a launch failure, an unusual occurrence, and we have since clarified for all U.S. satellite companies their obligation to obtain a separate U.S. Government license for any discussions related to a Chinese launch failure.
Moreover, the project is in the national interest because the development of China's civil communications infrastructure will promote access by Chinese citizens in remote areas to people and ideas in democratic societies. As noted below, we have routinely approved similar national-interest waivers for satellite projects using this justification and noting that the projects assist U.S. exporters. The current project also will help maintain the competitiveness of U.S. satellite exporters in a most important satellite market.
We could respond to criticisms of the proposed waiver on the following grounds:
*The Chinasat 8 project involves civilian comsat technology and will not contribute to Chinese military capabilities.
*There were no problems with unauthorized transfers of defense services in connection with two subsequent Chinese launches of Loral satellites, and State and Defense are satisfied that the technology assistance agreement proposed for Chinasat 8 will guard against unauthorized transfers in this project.
*The investigation of SS/L's unauthorized transfers is at an early stage (not yet before the grand jury, much less subject to an indictment); SS/L is entitled to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.
*If the investigation indicates that SS/L knowingly engaged in unauthorized transfers of defense services, State can impose administrative penalties (debarment and fines) even if Justice concludes that criminal prosecution would be futile.
*If the evidence leads to such a conclusion before the Chinasat 8 project is completed, the project could be blocked by withholding or withdrawing the necessary export licenses.
On balance, we believe that these factors support a national-interest waiver for this satellite project. As with earlier waivers, we may be criticized by some members of Congress who are concerned about China's human rights and proliferation record. In that event, we are prepared to provide briefings that explain our reasons for approving the project.
 
Recommendation
That you approve the waiver and sign the letters at Tab A reporting to Congress that it is in the national interest to permit the licensing of communications satellites and related equipment for export to China in connection with the Chinasat 8 project.
Approve Backward check mark was marked here
Disapprove Nothing marked
 
TEXT OF LETTER
I recognize that you are bearing more than the usual load of responsibilities at this time, and I would not be raising this issue if it were not time urgent for us.
We are told that the request for a waiver to permit Loral to use the China Long March rocket for a satellite launch is in the West Wing, perhaps on the President's desk. If a decision is not forthcoming in the next day or so, we stand to lose the contract. In fact, even if the decision is favorable, we will lose substantial amounts of money with each passing day.
Bernard Schwartz had intended to raise this issue with you at the Blair dinner, but missed you in the crowd. In any event, we would greatly appreciate your help in getting prompt decision for us.

HEADLINE: Wyoming Is Left Out Of the Rockies' Boom;
Population, Already Smallest, Is Falling

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: CASPER, Wyo., May 15

 BODY:
With the nation's smallest population, windswept Wyoming has been called a small town with a very long main street. Now that street has become a one-way highway leading out of state.
While neighboring Colorado, Utah and Idaho are experiencing some of the fastest population growth rates in the nation, Wyoming, which has only 481,000 people, actually lost population last year as 3,000 residents moved away. Its population of young families dropped by about 20 percent in the 1990's. 
 At the University of Wyoming in Laramie, about half of this year's graduates plan to move out of state, according to a recent survey. "Frankly, I don't know of any of them that are going to stay in state," said William Lindberg, chairman of the department of mechanical engineering, one of the areas hit hardest by the exodus of graduates. "We are educating them to go out of state. We are a marvelous exporter of talent."
While the rest of the Rocky Mountain region has become an envied example of job creation and income growth, Wyoming recently ranked 50th in the nation for creating jobs that add value to a product. In the last 15 years, wages in the state have slumped, to 21 percent below the national average from 11 percent above the national average.
"Everywhere else is blossoming -- but we are just blah," said Gus Fleischli, a mining supplier whose three children have moved out of state for jobs.
With a small population, unalluring scenery in much of the state and mixed feelings about growth, Wyoming has seen the Rocky Mountain boom largely pass it by. Battered by a barrage of statistics, more and more state residents have stopped straddling the fence about development and are climbing on the growth bandwagon.
"Wyoming is going to grow," Jim Geringer, the state's Governor, vowed at a recent business conference here. The Governor plans to inaugurate the Wyoming Business Council, a new development agency with a $23 million budget, next month in Cheyenne, the state capital.
There are signs that the regional economic boom is spilling into southeast Wyoming. With low taxes, low wages, low energy costs and little state government regulation, it often ranks as the nation's cheapest state in which to do business.
"You have given me a $24 million check to be here," said Bob Peck, vice president of a telephone service center, addressing the business conference here. Since moving his 550-employee operation from Florida to Cheyenne six years ago, he said, his company, Safecard Services, has saved $4 million a year.
In Casper, a city that has lived through 70 years of the ups and downs of the oil patch, Boise Cascade Office Products announced last month that it would open a national customer service center here, providing employment for 300 people.
And even though Wyoming still ranks 50th in terms of technology employment, Quark Inc., a Colorado software company, opened a processing and distribution plant last year in Cheyenne, just over the border from Colorado. Indeed, without a personal income tax or corporate income tax, Wyoming is emerging as a low-tax alternative to Colorado.
But planners seeking growth have to contend with several obstacles. As the mountain towns are booming, the plains towns are hemorrhaging population. Teton County's magnificent mountains draw floods of tourists annually. Jackson Hole has become a booming playground for the rich, with Wyoming's busiest airport and land values that have quadrupled in the 1990's. But much of the landscape seen by visitors on Wyoming's two interstate highways is flat, treeless and windswept.
Officials also have to deal with Wyoming's standoffishness about change. In a survey conducted last fall for the Wyoming Heritage Foundation, a leading business group, one-quarter of respondents did not want the state to spend more money on economic development, and 8 percent described the biggest threat to the state economy as "people moving here."
Wyoming's stubborn streak is captured by the image of a cowboy on a bucking bronco, which has been enameled on state license plates for decades. But central as the cowboy myth is to Wyoming, the reality is that only 4 percent of residents work on ranches or farms. Half of the state's employment is in government or tourism. Nationwide, Wyoming ranks second in term of Federal financing per capita, about $5,200 per person. Every year, the state gets eight tourists for every resident.
Some mainstays of the economy are leery of growth. Large landowners fear that population growth will lead to a proliferation of five-acre ranchettes, with ensuing increases in property values and taxes. But with Sotheby's auctioning off Wyoming ranch land this summer, the rest of the nation has already discovered Wyoming real estate. During the 1990's, ranch land values climbed by 9.5 percent a year, without any corresponding increase in ranch output.
Wyoming is also the state most dependent on the energy industry -- a Venezuela on the high plains. Oil, gas, coal and mineral taxes account for about 40 percent of the state budget -- one of the nation's highest ratios. In 1996, these taxes added up to $862 million, the equivalent of $1,800 for every state resident. These cash cows allowed the state to enshrine in its constitution a ban on any personal income tax.
Yet over the last 15 years, the total dollar value of Wyoming's oil and gas production dropped in half, hitting $2.2 billion last year. In the kind of calculus made in all oil exporting nations, for each $1 drop in oil prices, Wyoming loses $10 million in tax revenues. In the last year, oil prices dropped roughly in half. Energy companies are wary of population growth because they fear that they will pay the bills for new schools and roads.
The result of the energy industry roller coaster is a Wyoming landscape dotted with ghost towns from the 1960's and 1970's, too modern to be quaint.
But energy is still where the investment dollar is. With demand strong for Wyoming's low sulphur coal, the state tripled its coal production in the last 15 years, becoming the nation's largest producer. Believed to hold the nation's largest natural gas reserves, Wyoming is increasing gas production at a steady clip.
With energy companies largely headquartered out of state and half of the state's land owned by the Federal Government, Wyoming has often felt like an economic colony. People in Cody, Wyo., drive to Billings, Mont., to shop, people in Rock Springs, Wyo., drive to Salt Lake City for amusement parks, college students in Laramie, Wyo., drive to Denver for the bars and for major-league sporting events.
Last fall, some Wyomingites realized how fragmented their state had become when Wyoming politicians were spotted chatting up constituents at Denver Broncos' football games.
Now a small reverse migration may be starting, as businesses start crossing from northern Colorado into Cheyenne, already Wyoming's most populous city. Mr. Fleischli, who grew up in Cheyenne, a city of 55,000, said, "I went to the Chamber of Commerce meeting the other day, and I was amazed at how many people I didn't know."

HEADLINE: SHOOTINGS IN A SCHOOLHOUSE: THE TOWN;
Attack Hits Home for Many in a Middle-Class Neighborhood Both Modern and Rural

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Ore., May 22

 BODY:
First, a chain-link fence was erected outside the suburban high school here to keep out deer. Then gates were added to keep out drug dealers. Today the fence bore flowers, poems and prayers in memory of teen-agers shot by a fellow student.
"They try to protect us, then it comes from within," said Kelly Bachelder, a 16-year-old junior standing a few feet from the Thurston High School cafeteria where a 15-year-old, identified by the police as Kipland P. Kinkel, sprayed rifle fire on Thursday morning. 
 All day long today, students, graduates, neighbors and parents came to the fence around the school, leaving bouquets of lilies wrapped in florist cellophane, red roses in a household vase, a sprig of pink rhododendrum blooms from a backyard garden. Several mourners said they felt as if they were in a bad dream, acting out scenes they had watched on television from the comfort of their living rooms, images from distant places like Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky., and Jonesboro, Ark.
"All that didn't greatly affect me -- I didn't know anyone there," said Emily Payne, a sophomore, talking about the recent school shootings in those communities. "Now I know half the people in the hospital."
Little in the solidly middle-class Thurston district of Springfield lends itself to easy pop psychology. One of Oregon's fastest-growing neighborhoods, Thurston has a landscape of bicycle paths, flowering shrubs and neatly kept homes that quickly gives way to cow and horse pastures and the foothills of the Cascades. A 10-minute drive from the university city of Eugene, Thurston shares Oregon's tolerant "western New England" politics and its high-technology "Silicon Forest" economy.
But 45 minutes from the hunting and camping of Willamette National Forest, Thurston also embodies Oregon's cultural mix, where half the households have guns and half have home computers.
In a setting where many people grow up with guns, it is the use of them by children to shoot classmates that has alarmed people.
"Kids used to go into the school parking lot with rifles on racks in their trucks," said Greg Deedon, a 30-year-old Springfield Fire Department paramedic who attended high school here in the mid-1980's. "But it never ever crossed our minds to use our rifles against someone else."
Mr. Deedon and two other paramedics were tying blue ribbons around telephone poles on Main Street, part of a Fire Department campaign called "Let It Stop Here." He and his colleagues, all fathers of young children, attributed the generational difference to the desensitizing levels of casual violence now found on television and in video games and music.
They quickly cited a video game that urged players to "kill all the people," songs on the radio about "kill, kill, kill" and a Marilyn Manson concert T-shirt that says: "Just kill yourself, hang yourself."
At the high-school fence, Emily Payne, 15, agreed, saying the problem was not guns, but attitudes toward violence. "There are too many guns in movies. People see people pulling out guns and blowing each other away," said Miss Payne, who is growing up in a household where hunting rifles are kept unloaded and locked in an upstairs cabinet.
The Rev. Polly Moak, a Congregational minister, said that the only way to break the cycle of student killings was to tighten controls on guns.
"Access to guns has to be greatly restricted," she said, watching television camera crews hovering around a knot of weeping girls. "We could become another England. They see the same violent things we do, but they don't have the guns."

HEADLINE: Pocket Change, Not Social Change;
New Deals Give New Yorkers Small but Instant Benefits

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Sales tax cuts on clothing. Free rides on the Staten Island Ferry. Reduced express-bus fares. Suburban railroad ticket discounts. Bonus Metrocard rides on city transit and free transfers between buses and subways. E-Z Pass discounts for bridge, tunnel and New York Thruway tolls. And, thanks to the state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, planned for Thursday, customers will soon see their electricity bills cut by about 20 percent; just before Election Day, they'll be getting refund checks, too.
New York has long demanded more from its taxpayers than most other states demand from theirs. It still does, but New York voters might forget that when faced with the array of rebates, discounts and buy-one-get-one-free offers that Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani have been giving away lately. 
 When they ran for office, Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani both promised to change New York's status as a symbol of big government and high taxes. They have reduced the size of government and the overall tax burden. (And just last month, the Governor reminded voters of his affinity for a smaller government by cutting $760 million worth of programs from the Legislature's budget.)
But going beyond conventional, one-shot tax cuts, they appear to be leading the nation with a stream of small but steady benefits. Especially in an election year, tangible pocketbook savings, like free transfers between the subway and bus, are vivid daily reminders of what government has done for you lately.
"We've gone from the era of big public works to big discounts," said Dr. Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Taub Urban Research Center. "Government is looking more and more like a big retailer. They're targeting their customers -- their constituents -- with tax credits, abatements and price discounts. We've gone to a kind of coupon government. It's like the coffee shops where you get the 11th cup free."
This smorgasbord of government givebacks, each aimed at a particular constituency, means that millions of New Yorkers have already begun to reap annual savings of hundreds of dollars. Families qualifying for multiple programs may net thousands.
Still more savings are in the works. In coming months, the state is scheduled to cut auto registration fees, give tax credits to the elderly with incomes under $60,000, and grant rebates on personal income and homeowner property taxes in the city and on school taxes outside the city. Unlimited-use transit passes are to make their debut this summer.
All this sudden generosity -- a veritable era of New Deals -- is a departure from the New York traditions of ribbon cuttings for big public works projects and the announcements of bold new social programs.
The reversal reflects new political and economic realities. Long dominated by liberal Democrats, New York finally yielded to the national backlash against big government and took a conservative Republican turn with the elections of Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pataki.
And now, after being squeezed by the recession of the early 1990's, the Governor and Mayor are enjoying a surge of surplus revenues from the recovering economy, especially on Wall Street.
Although some critics dismiss the new approach as a vote-getting ploy, proponents like Mr. Pataki say it reflects a sea change in social and economic philosophy.
"Government takes too much," Mr. Pataki, a Republican, said in an interview. "And we're doing as much as we can on as many fronts as we can to bring down the costs that have taxed people out of their homes and driven out jobs from the community."
Givebacks are also starting to crop up elsewhere. "State governments are trying to be more customer-oriented, so maybe we are getting a little more sophisticated," said Brian J. Weberg, program director for the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Last year, Oregon sent each taxpayer a $280 refund check. New Jersey has sent property tax rebates to qualified homeowners for several years. In Connecticut, Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, wrangled an agreement from the General Assembly to send tax refunds of up to $200 per family in July.
A recent survey by the National Governors Conference of state-of-the-state messages found governors proposing property tax relief in Alabama, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Virginia and Wisconsin, as well as in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey.
Government handouts are routinely denounced when they take the form of welfare grants, corporate subsidies, tax breaks for the wealthy and payments to farmers for not growing food. But couched as rewards deserved by the hard-working middle class, they are irresistible.
"The cuts are great," said Vinnie Tranchina, who was riding the Staten Island Ferry one spring day after a night shift in Manhattan as a heating and air-conditioning mechanic. The free ferry and free bus transfers have lowered his annual commuting costs to about $750 from $1,625. A fellow rider, Sebastian Trovato, a videotape technician, added, "The fare cuts are the equivalent of a pay raise."
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Chairman, E. Virgil Conway, recalled the emotional "thank you" he got from an office secretary for abolishing two-fare transit zones in the city. "There were tears in her eyes," he said. "Between her and her husband, they figured it saved $1,500 a year -- enough extra for them to afford to adopt a child."
Granting benefits has proved especially tempting in a campaign season. "This is the political equivalent of Christmas, except this Santa Claus comes only once every four years," said Hank Morris, a Manhattan political consultant. "It's a modern version of giving out goodies to political leaders, but going over their heads and directly to the people. In a close election, it can and would be the difference."
Pollsters like John Zogby expect the benefits to garner votes for the generous politician. "One would have to be a fool to suggest it hasn't helped," he said. Noting that transit discounts aid city residents, most of whom are Democrats, he said, "New York City is not an area Pataki's going to win, but he's chipping away at the opposition's base and shoring up his statewide totals for his national aspirations."
And now, politicians vie to outdo each other. A Democratic contender for Governor, City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, has been pressing for 12 Metrocard rides for the price of 10, literally one-upping Mr. Pataki's formula. And Democrats in the State Senate have proposed a $100 tax refund and a $250 cut in State University tuition.
Political rivals are also jockeying for credit. Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Assembly Speaker, was an early proponent of cutting the sales tax on clothing as what he called "a gift to the people." The idea did not remain his for long. "Pataki was smart enough to get in front of the parade on that," said Frank J. Mauro, a former Democratic Assembly aide and now director of the nonprofit Fiscal Policy Institute, a research group based in Albany that is financed by foundations and unions.
The politicians rarely ignore a chance to publicize the benefits. Mr. Pataki recently sent a letter to hundreds of thousands of homeowners reminding them to apply for new property tax breaks. Mr. Giuliani capitalized on sales tax moratoriums by going on barnstorming-style shopping sprees.
And officials are spending millions of tax dollars on "public service" television, radio and print promotions that critics say are virtual re-election ads. "These are all thinly veiled campaign spending," said Gene Russianoff of the New York Public Interest Research Group. "They've elevated it to an art form. No good deed goes uncredited. I'm surprised they haven't put the Governor's picture on the Metrocard."
Critics say the taxpayer savings trade away the future for the present. "It trivializes government," said Dr. Moss of N.Y.U. "In an era of two-term limits, politicians want to do immediate things to catch attention. Nobody wants to invest in a Second Avenue subway because there's no direct payoff."
Another problem: The benefits ultimately cost billions of dollars in lost revenue and may not survive if the economy sours. "The Governor doesn't have much of a rainy-day fund," warned Fred Siegel, a fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute, the Washington-based think tank of the moderate Democratic Leadership Council.
Mr. Pataki's fans tout him as the state's first Governor to cut transit fares. Yet transit advocates say that while they love the discounts, the savings still do not make up for the fare increases and curtailed services that Mr. Pataki imposed in 1995.
Old-style general tax cuts are losing favor because they seem to make little impression on taxpayers. In 1995, the state cut personal income taxes by a fourth. Yet many taxpayers forgot about the cut. "I think they learned a lesson," Mr. Mauro said of policy makers. "That cut cost almost $4 billion, but their polling showed that people didn't feel anything."
"Broad-based tax cuts have no sex appeal," said Arthur J. Kremer, former chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. "Now it's targeted tax cuts, to do good things plus get votes. If you're going to give people a tax cut, at least let them know they got it. Eleven rides for the price of 10 -- people relate to that."

HEADLINE: In a Poor District, Success With New Curriculum

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: ASBURY PARK, N.J., May 22

 BODY:
At the heart of the final State Supreme Court ruling Thursday in the decades-long battle over funding for urban schools was a prescription for instituting a single teaching method to lift reading and math scores.
That prescription is the Success for All program, a comprehensive and highly structured curriculum that has been at work in this poor Monmouth County district for the last six years. Under the court's ruling, state education officials must extend the program to all of the state's 28 "special needs districts" -- primarily urban school districts with poorly performing students, little property wealth and a host of social problems, like poverty and unemployment. The program is to be introduced to the approximately 300 schools in these districts at a rate of 50 schools per year. 
In the time that it has been at work in Asbury Park, the program has been attacked by some as too rigid and structured. Others have embraced it, adopting a fervor usually reserved for 12-step programs as they intone its slogans. ("If you work the program, the program will work for you" is one.)
Objective measures indicate the program is working, although some of the improvements have been modest. Reading scores among elementary pupils over the last five years have risen like a series of stair steps. At the middle school level, state testing of eighth graders showed 76 percent of them writing at grade level in 1997 compared with 46 percent in 1996, and 80 percent reading at grade level compared with 75 percent in 1996.
But with its emphasis on family support for pupils, many of the program's benefits are less tangible, said Alberto Reinoso, the principal of the Thurgood Marshall Elementary School.
Mr. Reinoso described how pupils who are at risk of failure are identified and helped by the program's family support teams, made up of teachers, administrators, counselors and parent coordinators -- residents of the school district who act as liaisons between parents and the school. Mr. Reinoso described how support teams discovered one pupil who was not eating because his mother had died and his father could not cook, another who was sleeping in class because he had no bed at home, and a third who was missing school because he had no winter coat. In the first case, school staff members took turns preparing meals for the family for two months until the father learned to cook. In the second, the school bought the family a bed, and in the third case, school officials started an annual coat drive to make sure that problem would not arise again for any of their 720 pupils.
"What has happened as a result is that the community is no longer thinking of the schools as a place where a bunch of white teachers who don't really care are just collecting a paycheck," Mr. Reinoso said. "And all of this has happened because Success for All really believes in parental involvement."
Developed at Johns Hopkins University's Center for Research on the Education of Students Placed at Risk, the program is the brainchild of Robert Slavin, a psychologist who first tested it 13 years ago in a Baltimore public school. Since then, Success for All has spread to 750 schools in 40 states. At one time, professionals from the schools using the approach were so few that they could meet for retraining in a single annual convention in a Baltimore hotel, said Kathy Ahl, Thurgood Marshall's full-time Success For All "facilitator," a professional trained by John Hopkins to help teachers carry out the program. Now, Success for All teachers hold three regional meetings a year in large convention hotels.
Mr. Reinoso said the program had been well received by teachers, who in recent years have been confronted with several "often faddish" teaching approaches. At the heart of Success for All is a standardized approach to reading and writing instruction. Johns Hopkins provides the course materials and sets the schedule of exercises, which is strict. The center at Johns Hopkins also insists on "cooperative learning," in which pupils are encouraged to work together while teachers move among them to defuse potential conflicts, Ms. Ahl said.
"It's good because it takes the focus off the teacher and fosters the independent learning that we are aiming for," she said. "It makes us teachers the 'guide on the side' rather than the 'sage on the stage.' "
On a recent day, these approaches could be seen at work in three classrooms amid a low buzz of what the teachers like to call "positive noise."
Jessica Evans's first graders worked in groups of three to help one another construct three- or four-sentence paragraphs representing alternative outcomes to a story they had read aloud in class. Time spent: 20 minutes, then on to the next task.
In Tia Ramseur's third-grade classroom, pairs of pupils scattered across the room and arranged their chairs in love-seat configurations. They alternated reading pages of a story to each other, one pupil helping to decode the text when a partner stumbled. Time spent: 15 minutes, then on to vocabulary.
In Margaret George's fifth-grade class for pupils considered talented and gifted, teams of four children each constructed miniature replicas of archaeological sites using dirt and plaster fossils in a shoebox. Time spent: 20 minutes, then on to a related writing exercise.
Ms. George said she uses the Success for All materials and approach even though she is not required to, because the program provides continuity for pupils who may encounter the program in another class, and because "it adds a richer and fuller dimension" to the material she covers. "I was wary at first because I thought that it might impose too much structure and inhibit creativity for me and students," she said. "But that all changed when I saw how flexible it is. Sometimes we just have to use the set time limits as suggestions."
Mr. Reinoso said that in addition to the cost of about $70,000 per year per school for materials and training from Johns Hopkins, schools also must hire an attendance officer, a parent coordinator and a program facilitator. Schools also must be willing to use substitute teachers trained in the program when a regular teacher is absent or being retrained. Because of the commitment that is required, Johns Hopkins will not let a school introduce the program until 80 percent of its teachers vote to do so.
In the schools, there have been heated debates over whether Success for All is an administration-centered program, in that it gives principals clear criteria by which to measure a teacher's performance, or whether it is a teacher-centered program that provides strict guidelines, materials and lesson plans. Ms. Ahl eschews both labels.
"It's really a child-centered program," she said.
The emphasis on parental involvement was on display today as Geneva Johnson, the school's parent coordinator, conducted a session for two dozen parents -- some of whom work part time in the school as paid aides -- to learn about New Jersey's welfare reform program from a state social services worker. The program, Work First, tries to get mothers off welfare and into jobs in private industry. Ms. Johnson said the session provided important information in a district where 63 percent of the households were headed by single mothers and 28 percent of all families were on public assistance.
"I'm on welfare and I'm a part-time aide in the school, and this meeting today gives me a chance to know what's available for me," said Tina Dingman, the mother of three pupils at the school. "But just being in the school allows me to know what's going on with my children. Plus, my kids and all of the kids look up to the parent aides."

HEADLINE: An Arts Revival Grows in New York Schools

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
New York City schools, enjoying the biggest infusion of money for art and music in more than two decades, are bringing back orchestras and field trips and art classes that had been dropped as luxuries during budget crises.
But the effort has not reached schools evenly, and many get by with only the slimmest offerings. 
 Almost 500 art and music teachers have been hired this school year, 400 more are being recruited for next fall, art and music coordinators are back in each school district for the first time since the 1970's and the city has provided several hundred schools with grants for art and music instruction. In addition, 61 of the city's 1,100 schools have received sizable grants to develop arts programs.
The enhancements are the tangible benefit of twin multimillion-dollar arts programs, one financed by the philanthropist Walter Annenberg and other donors, the other by City Hall.
Still, despite the public support, there is no citywide curriculum for the arts, unlike the core subjects of math and science, or even a consensus on how the arts should be taught. Stark disparities have emerged, and like so many others in the huge, uneven system, the differences reflect varying levels of enthusiasm from principals and other school leaders, and the focus of each school's academic program.
Generally, poorer schools offer less exposure to the arts, though the Schools Chancellor has tried to add music and art in the handful under his direct control. In more affluent schools, the music never died; parents immediately stepped in with their own funds when the school system withdrew money.
Buoyed by a healthy economy and a growing realization by arts organizations that many urban schools have effectively lost any cultural sensibility, the drive to restore arts and music in New York parallels efforts nationwide. California's education commissioner has proposed a $200 million plan to restore arts education; a national consortium of arts educators, backed by the Department of Education, has developed voluntary national standards for arts education, and a survey of education budgets in cities large and small showed restorations of money for art and music classes.
Arts advocates in New York hope to erase what they consider an embarrassment: a city famous for the arts had all but excised them from its public schools during the fiscal crises of the mid-1970's and recession of the 1980's. Of the more than 14,000 teachers who lost their jobs, art and music teachers were often the first to go. Many bands and orchestras went silent.
How far art and music have come in New York City -- and how far they need to go -- is evident in schools across the five boroughs.
Every afternoon at William Maxwell High School in Brooklyn, a cacophony blares from the second floor as students with a lot of heart but little experience blow hard into their shiny new saxophones, clarinets and trumpets. To Barbara Elk, the school's principal, it is "a beautiful noise" for a school that until this year had not had a music teacher in three years or a band in about seven.
Or enter the gym at Public School 165 in Flushing, Queens, and a curious drama unfolds. Fifth graders, lead by a sixth grade mentor, shimmy and prance across the parquet floor, retelling the story of the Titanic through dance.
At the other end of the spectrum is P.S. 180 in Harlem, a school of stubbornly low test scores. The local district's arts education coordinator wants the new principal, Joseph Furey, to improve art and music, but he contends that the school's success will be measured in reading and math.
"What comes first?" Mr. Furey asks. "Music?"
Still, the progress in many schools has made some arts advocates hopeful of change for the better, but no one predicts instant, universal improvement.
Sharon Dunn, the school system's special assistant for the arts, estimates it will take a few years before all schools have either art or music programs for all their students. And while Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew vows never to preside over the decimation of art and music education, people in and outside of the system are skeptical about his ability to reach all schools. There is concern that when money dries up or a dedicated teacher or principal moves on, programs will suffer.
"A lot of people say they want to make it so the arts programs are not personality-dependent, so that if the leadership in a school changes or a wonderful teacher leaves the program it won't die," said Nancy Shankman, the director of arts for Bronx high schools who has been involved with arts education for 36 years.
"However, very honestly I don't know that that will ever happen," she said. "The bottom line is that many of the principals in the system now have come through the New York City school system in the last 20 years and have not had music and art in their lives, and therefore it is not part of their frame of reference."
 
The History
Fiscal Crises Leave Arts in the Lurch
Before the cuts began in the 1970's, most schools had at least one art or music teacher. By 1991, two-thirds of the elementary schools had none. Many principals made do with outsiders or assigned regular classroom teachers to art or music classes, though they often had little arts training.
Elementary schools were hit particularly hard, because their pupils are not required under state education standards to receive art or music instruction. The state requires junior high students to receive a year of music and a year of art, and high school students need a semester of each to graduate, though the requirements are routinely waived. And where they are not, classes can be deadly dull, administrators say.
"We're talking showing slides on the wall and calling it art appreciation," said Leonard Trerotola, who supervises art education for a group of Staten Island and Brooklyn high schools.
Over time, arts, cultural and philanthropic organizations, now numbering at least 129, entered the void. They began providing visiting artists or trips to museums or other assistance for schools, for nothing or a nominal charge.
In addition to their altruism, institutions from Lincoln Center to the Brooklyn Museum entered the schools out of concern that having a city of young people with little exposure to the arts ultimately would threaten the survival of concert halls or museum galleries.
"It helps develop the audience of the future, which is of special importance in a city like New York, where the arts are an integral part of the economic life," said Martin Segal, former director of Lincoln Center and an organizer of the just-concluded Arts Education Week, during which cultural institutions and schools showed off their art and music endeavors. "Nobody is born loving Mozart."
What started the current return to the arts was a grant from the Annenberg Foundation. The publishing magnate Walter H. Annenberg pledged $500 million in 1993 to education reform nationwide. Part of that money, $12 million, has gone to New York City's public schools for academic programs in the arts. The $12 million is seed money, to be matched two to one by private donations to finance a $36 million program. So far, $10.6 million has been raised.
In the program, which is competitive, only 61 schools out of about 500 that applied have received grants, most of them $75,000 a year, to develop arts programs in cooperation with nonprofit cultural institutions, like the Metropolitan Opera.
A committee of teachers, administrators and arts consultants recommend which schools should receive grants. The Center for Arts Education, the board of nonprofit organization created to administer the Annenberg grant, has the final say.
A vast majority of schools, like P.S. 165, already provided some arts programs. From now on, a greater effort will be made to reach schools with little arts programming, said the project administrator, Hollis Headrick of the Center for Arts Education.
P.S. 165 uses the money in part for its dance program, created with the help of Kathleen Isaac, a dancer. The program fosters creativity, helps schoolchildren appreciate dance and gives them some exercise. The grant was "manna from heaven," said the principal, Petronella Cellura.
Regular classroom teachers at P.S. 7 in the Bronx troop up to the College of Mount St. Vincent in the Bronx, where they receive basic art lessons themselves to carry back to their students. Toting a pad of his own modest scribblings of river scenes, Paul Tomizawa, a first-year teacher, wants to use the nearby Hudson River as a motif for science, math and art instruction in his third-grade classroom. "I'm dying for some arts ideas other than using crayons on construction paper," he said.
City Hall and the Board of Education realized that the Annenberg program would not reach most schools. Last year, his re-election year, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council agreed to provide $75 million during three years to promote arts and music instruction. The Mayor has proposed doubling next year's arts budget to $50 million from $25 million.
The program, called Project Arts, has restored art and music coordinators to each local school district for the first time in two decades, and has given grants of $40 to $60 a child to about 350 schools for art and music instruction. In large schools, that is enough to hire a teacher, and in smaller ones it has paid for desperately needed supplies like instruments and paints.
 
The Future
Getting Support From All Sides
Which schools have good arts programs is often determined by the zeal of parents, principals and superintendents, creating stark disparities that are not lost on the students. Even with the Annenberg program and more city money for arts education, some schools in more affluent areas rely on donations from parents.
At P.S. 234 in TriBeCa, for instance, fourth and fifth graders take music lessons twice a week, paid largely through the $50,000 the parents' association raises each year through such activities as silent auctions.
At the same school, city money pays for beginning music instruction -- vocal training and percussion lessons on wood blocks -- for kindergartners through third graders. The result is that all of the 650 students take art or music at least once a week, and usually more, because several classroom teachers incorporate them in reading and writing lessons, says the principal, Anna Switzer. Without the money raised by the parents' association, many fewer students would be exposed to art and music, despite the new infusion of city money.
"I realize we're very lucky," said Morgan Pratt, a fifth-grade violin student. "Some schools have classes in the bathroom."
Although it is hard to find a school completely devoid of art, P.S. 180 in Harlem comes close. Thanks to the district art coordinator, Shelly Alpert, it offers visual art instruction to fourth and fifth graders by a visiting artist from the organization Studio in a School.
But a majority of the more than 400 students make do without a full-time art or music teacher, relying mostly on occasional visits from professional singing groups. Some teachers make an effort, like Kathleen Forbes, a prekindergarten teacher who on a recent afternoon danced and sang with her pupils to "Skip to My Lou" warbling from a phonograph.
But Mr. Furey, the principal, contends that the need to address flagging reading, writing and math performances leaves little room for what he considers extras. "We may have greater needs," Mr. Furey said. "Reading and math absolutely take priority."
And he does not think that many of his students are ready for intensive art or music. "You put art out there and the students destroy it," he said, adding that he sees their musical tastes as limited. "What do they know about music? They know rap and gangsta rap."
In the so-called Chancellor's District, made up of 12 failing elementary and middle schools under Dr. Crew's control, each school has restored music, art or both to the curriculum. But reading, math and other core subjects take precedent, and the schools rarely allow field trips because they cut in on instructional time.
"My kids have to read," said Marjorie Elliot, who coordinates art for the special district.
 
The Quandary
Art for Art's Sake, Or Means to an End?
Even with the infusion of resources, the school system has not decided what constitutes good art education. Sharon Dunn, Dr. Crew's special assistant for arts education, prefers an approach combining music and art instruction with basics like reading and math..
This approach played out on a recent day at P.S. 43 in the Far Rockaway section of Queens. The art teacher, Joanne Ellis, read "The Mountain That Loved a Bird," written by Eric Carle, to 24 second graders. She then gave them paper, colored pens and other materials, and minutes later they chattered away about their own purple birds and yellow mountains.
But some warn against tying the arts too closely to other subjects, worried that doing so leaves little room for students to follow their imaginations. And they argue that the very notion that arts must be connected to other subjects suggests that the arts are not worthy in their own right.
Even as schools debate the best way to teach the arts, many educators say they worry that despite the current commitment, the future of arts education will depend largely on the economy.
"Well, the bull market will continue until the next millennium," jokingly said Terry Baker, a private art education consultant advising the Annenberg initiative. "My feeling is without a good economy it's going to be hard to sustain it. Maybe as people see things work well for the kids they will be likely to support it, though, even in a bad economy."
That hope is enough to gratify many a teacher. "It's incredible," said David Steinberg, the music teacher at William Maxwell High School, listening to the tentative strains of his students trying to play their music scales. "I try to keep myself from dancing."
 
Do Arts Aid Learning? A 2-Edged Sword
 Behind the re-emerging patchwork of painting and mime and music in New York City schools is an academic study of how instruction in the fine arts affects brain development and the ability to learn other subjects.
Some educators have argued that the study of art and music helps with the study of academic subjects. But others, particularly experts in brain development, are contending that the research is not conclusive and that the arts should be accepted as valuable on their own.
While at the University of California at Irvine, Frances Rauscher, a researcher now at the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh, conducted a pioneering study showing that preschoolers who took piano lessons improved their spatial temporal reasoning, the kind used to solve puzzles. A companion study showed similar, but more modest, gains for college students who listened to classical music.
But Dr. Rauscher said she is dismayed that her conclusions are often taken too far and are used to justify music education.
"We may learn the A B C's better by singing them, but that is not learning musical concepts," she said. "I think there is a real danger in developing a philosophy around infusion."
Likewise, Howard Gardner, the Harvard University professor of education whose theories of multiple intelligences have gained wide popularity among educators, worries about carrying the argument that music aids math education too far.
"Those who live by the sword must die by the sword," Dr. Gardner said. "That is, if you claim that the reason to teach music is to make kids into better mathematicians, and those claims turn out to be unsubstantiated, then you have lost the rationale for music classes."

HEADLINE: THE FALL OF SUHARTO: THE SUCCESSOR;
U.S. Companies Wary Of Their Prospects Now

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
Earlier this month, 40 American business executives on a trade mission to Indonesia met with a man who had recently been appointed Vice President. The man, B. J. Habibie, assured his skeptical visitors that unlike his predecessors, he had real power over domestic and foreign policy.
And, according to a businessman who was there, he also assured them that he was committed to economic reform. 
 Doubts about whether Mr. Habibie had real power were partly erased this week when he was named President, replacing Mr. Suharto. But whether Mr. Habibie, who is faced with rescuing Indonesia from economic collapse, is truly committed to reform is something some American executives still question.
"We have concerns here," one businessman said. "He doesn't have a track record that suggests conservative fiscal management. It's just the opposite."
Of all Indonesian officials, Mr. Habibie is perhaps the best known to American business executives, largely because of his role in spearheading Indonesia's efforts to develop an aircraft business, where he worked with companies like Boeing and General Electric.
An aeronautical engineer by training, he was also Minister for Science and Technology, which meant that virtually any American company wanting to sell computers or telecommunications equipment in what was a fast-growing Indonesia probably came in contact with him.
But American businesses have mixed views, on one hand describing Mr. Habibie as visionary, but also saying he is prone to reckless projects, like the decades-long effort to develop an airplane industry, something extremely difficult for a country at Indonesia's state of development.
A 70-seat commuter plane was produced, and Mr. Habibie announced plans to build a manufacturing plant in the United States, but the plane has not yet been certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, orders have been few and no American factory has been built.
The project is now being cut back as part of the multibillion-dollar aid agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
"He's certainly an extremely intelligent guy and he's also a guy who has demonstrated a commitment to the future," said David Rothkopf, a former Commerce Department official who is now president of the Newmarket Company, an international advisory firm based in Washington. "With the force of his personality, he can make improbable things happen -- at least to a certain degree."
Mr. Habibie, who speaks English and German, is often described as full of energy and enthusiasm, a person who talks a mile a minute, goes off on tangents and is almost impossible to shut up once he gets going.
"He always has ideas," said Ernest Bower, president of the U.S.-Asean Business Council, a group of 400 American companies with business interests in Southeast Asia. "It seems like they are hitting him like electric shocks."
Many questions remain about what will happen during Dr. Habibie's tenure, even how long it will last, and whether the military will support him. What matters most is not Mr. Habibie's personality but whether he can bring stability to the market.
Still, some business executives say he could be good for American business.
"I think it will be a big boost for American business," said George Benson, a Washington-based consultant to American oil companies who spent much of his career working for Pertamina, the Indonesian state oil company.
"He's tight with Boeing, he's tight with G.E. He's been here and comes every year. He's on a first-name basis with a whole flock of c.e.o.'s of big corporations."
Mr. Habibie's interest in technology could open opportunities for American companies.
Scott McNealy, chief executive of Sun Microsystems, once described Mr. Habibie as "an energetic Renaissance man who knows and understands technology from aerospace to computers." His office, Mr. McNealy wrote afer his 1993 visit to Jakarta, was "more like a museum for model planes, hundreds of them."
But some Americans worry that Mr. Habibie's ties are stronger to Germany, where he went to college and spent many years working at an aircraft company, and to Japan, a big investor in Indonesia.
Although the new President has championed technology in Indonesia, he is not a big believer in free markets. He has been extremely close to Mr. Suharto, which makes people question whether he will really dismantle the network of crony capitalism that Mr. Suharto erected.
Some also question his sincerity about human rights reforms. When he met with the American business delegation this month, he brushed off questions about rights issues, noting that the United States also has problems, and adding that any abuses in Indonesia were the result of rogue police officers or soldiers.

Indonesian Troops Retake The Parliament Building
Indonesia's Army retook Parliament in a midnight raid by hundreds of soldiers, who pushed, prodded, and cajoled more than 2,000 students to leave the complex they had occupied for five days. There were no casualties reported in the operation, which lasted barely two hours, but witnesses said some students initially resisted the soldiers. A1
 
The leader of Indonesia's military consolidated his power under the country's new President, B. J. Habibie, left, removing another general who was his chief rival. Diplomats said they expected the removal of two other prominent commanders loyal to the ousted general. A7 

Irish Vote on Referendum
Citizens in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic voted together for the first time in nearly 80 years in a referendum that would completely transform the island's political institutions and social traditions. Officials will begin counting the hand-marked ballots today, and they said the results would not be announced until the afternoon there. A6
 
Senate Votes for Sanctions
The Senate voted to punish foreign enterprises or institutions -- especially in Russia -- that provide sensitive missile technology or expertise to Iran. The House passed the same measure by voice vote in November, so the bill now goes to the White House, where the President is being advised to veto the bill. A3

HEADLINE: Papers Show White House Staff Favored a China Satellite Permit

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH and JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
The White House released a trove of internal documents today showing that President Clinton approved the Chinese launching of an American satellite last February after his top staff advised him that the economic and diplomatic advantages outweighed the opposition of Federal prosecutors.
The prosecutors had warned that the approval would jeopardize their investigation into the satellite maker's earlier, unauthorized help to China's rocket program, the President was told in the memorandums. 
 The documents, demanded by Congress, were made available to the news media today by the White House, which argued that they showed that the President, while aware of the risks, approved the launching on the basis of policy debate and not because the chairman of the satellite company, the Democratic Party's largest personal contributor, was pressing hard for a decision.
"I think the decision was the correct one," Mr. Clinton said in remarks in the White House Rose Garden, where he came to talk about the highway bill that passed Congress today, but was clearly prepared for questions on China. It "was based on what I thought was in the national interest and supportive of our national security," he said.
The President said the Justice Department's concerns were evaluated and balanced against the views of all the other participating departments, who "concluded that, on balance, we should go forward."
But Republicans questioned the President's decision and promised further inquiries. They said a preliminary review of the 394 documents the White House released raised troubling questions about Mr. Clinton's decision to overrule Justice Department objections to a Presidential waiver to allow the launching.
"There's no question there were plenty of red flags at the time," said Representative Christopher Cox, the California Republican who will head a House select committee examining the China issues.
The documents paint a fascinating portrait of the intense struggles surrounding Mr. Clinton last February as he weighed whether to allow the satellite launching and ignore the pleas of prosecutors and the probable outrage from some in Congress.
A top State Department official had warned White House staff members that the satellite company, Loral Space and Communications, engaged in "unlawful" and "criminal" activity by providing valuable help to the Chinese rocket program.
And the chairman of the company, Bernard L. Schwartz, combed a White House dinner on Feb. 5, looking for Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, to plead for a decision on the satellite launching, a decision worth tens of millions of dollars to the company.
As it all played out, with the company arguing it needed an immediate decision, the senior White House staff were concluding that the President's broader strategy of engaging China should not be endangered by blocking the launching.
"We believe that the advantages of this project outweigh this risk, and that we can effectively rebut criticism of the waiver," said the memorandum to Mr. Clinton, dated Feb. 12, 1998, and signed by Mr. Berger, Larry Stein, the Congressional liaison, and Daniel K. Tarullo, assistant to the President for international economic policy.
"The project is in the national interest," the memorandum said, "because the development of China's civil communications infrastructure will promote access by Chinese citizens in remote areas to people and ideas in democratic societies." In addition, it said, "the current project also will help maintain the competitiveness of U.S. satellite exporters in a most important satellite market."
The President's top advisers warned him in the memorandum that his approval might be seen as letting Loral's space subsidiary "off the hook on criminal charges for its unauthorized assistance to China's ballistic missile program."
But they also said it would be unfair to "penalize" Loral by denying a license "before they have even been charged with any crime."
On Feb. 13, Loral's lobbyist, Tom Ross, pleaded with Mr. Berger for a "prompt decision" and mentioned how Mr. Schwartz "had intended to raise this issue with you" a week earlier at the dinner for Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain "but missed you in the crowd."
White House spokesmen noted that Mr. Ross's letter was dated the day after the staff memorandum to the President recommending approval of the launching.
On Feb. 18, the President approved the deal.
Mr. Schwartz was the largest personal contributor to the Democrats last year and has donated almost $1 million since 1995. His name is not in the memorandums sent to the President for his approval.
Mr. Ross, Loral's vice president of government relations, said today that he "considered it perfectly proper for me to make an inquiry on the timing of the issue."
He said it would also have been proper for Mr. Schwartz to have asked for a prompt decision because "there is a distinction between that and demanding a favorable decision."
The documents were made available to the House International Relations Committee on the eve of a long holiday weekend. The committee requested them on May 7 after a story in The New York Times disclosed the President's decision despite the objections of Justice Department officials. A week later, it was also disclosed that a China aerospace executive funnelled almost $100,000 from the Chinese military to the Democratic Party in 1996, according to an account by a Democrat fund-raiser, Johnny Chung, who is cooperating with investigators after pleading guilty to campaign-related bank and tax fraud charges.
The chairman of the House committee, Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of New York, said today that the documents raised "some troubling questions that will have to be pursued," and that the committee was awaiting further documents from the White House and other agencies.
The Justice Department is also weighing whether to investigate the President's approval for Loral, and if so, whether it should be done by its own campaign finance task force or an independent counsel, law-enforcement officials said.
The new documents complicate that decision because two senior Justice officials have played dual roles: advising the White House against Mr. Clinton's approval for Loral and deciding now whether to investigate that approval.
Today's release of documents comes as Mr. Clinton's policy on Chinese satellite launches is caught up in a cross current of diplomatic, legal and political issues.
In a month, the President is going to China, where he hopes to improve space cooperation with Beijing. But the House of Representatives this week may have upset his summit plans by overwhelmingly adopting amendments that ban future exports of American satellites to China.
Republicans said such exports may jeopardize national security by giving China the ability to learn space technology that can improve its ballistic missile capabilities.
The Clinton Administration argues that stringent safeguards insure that national security is protected and that American satellite companies need to maintain their competitiveness in an important global market, points made in the memorandum to Mr. Clinton. China, which offered low-cost services, launches about 10 percent of American satellites.
At the center of the debate is the criminal case that prompted prosecutors to express their concerns to the White House. In the spring of 1996, Loral officials helped the Chinese investigate why a rocket carrying a Loral satellite exploded. The company acknowledged that it turned information over to the Chinese without telling the Government.
The President was told by his advisers that Loral "acknowledges that an unauthorized transfer of technical information took place but Justice has not decided whether it will take criminal action against" the company.
"Justice believes that a jury would not convict once it learned that the President had found" the latest Loral satellite launching "to be in the national interest," the memorandum stated.
As a result of sanctions imposed after the killings at Tiananmen Square in 1989, satellites can be exported to China only through a Presidential waiver demonstrating that the launch is in the national interest.
Loral maintains its officials did nothing wrong. A Loral fact sheet released this week said that all its scientists did was an analysis that confirmed the findings of Chinese scientists.
But the State Department's top defense trade regulator, Will Lowell, told a White House lawyer that Loral "went beyond analysis to telling cause of failure and how to prevent," according to the lawyer's notes of the conversation.
Mr. Lowell also told the lawyer that he thought Loral's behavior was "criminal" and "unlawful," but he added that even though the company was "likely to be indicted," it was "hard to pull the plug" on a license without an indictment.
The cost of delaying approval for Loral -- which might have cleared up the question of whether the company would be indicted -- was estimated by White House aides at $4-6 million, the documents show.
In the end, the concerns of regulators like Mr. Lowell and Justice Department prosecutors from the criminal division were given less weight than the views of top-ranking political appointees and the diplomatic and commercial imperatives.
On Feb. 13, White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff wrote a memorandum to Mr. Berger, the National Security Adviser, noting the failure of the highest officials at the Justice Department to weigh in on the satellite decision. And curiously, the documents released today contained no written communications from anyone at the Justice Department.
"The department had every opportunity to weigh in against the waiver at the highest levels and elected not to do so," Mr. Ruff wrote, adding that Mr. Berger could himself balance "the national security and criminal justice interests."
Mr. Berger already had. A day earlier he and other top advisers recommended that the President go forward with his approval.
Meanwhile, the Justice Department, despite its earlier concerns, is proceeding with the investigation, officials said.

HEADLINE: $200 Billion Bill For Public Works Passed by Congress

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
Congress overwhelmingly approved today the largest public works program in the nation's history, voting to spend more than $200 billion over the next six years for roads, bridges, buses, subways, ferries and even parking garages in virtually every Congressional district.
The size of the bill, which increases Federal transportation spending by 44 percent from the $145 billion in the previous six-year plan, underscores the shifting political ground in Washington, where spending of this magnitude was almost unthinkable a year ago. 
 But with the Federal budget now in balance, the national economy still vigorous and Congress facing fall elections, the appetite for new and bigger highway and mass transit projects was both voracious and bipartisan. The House passed the bill by a vote of 297 to 86, and the Senate by a vote of 88 to 5. President Clinton said he would sign the bill.
The bill significantly increases transportation spending in every state except Massachusetts and is laden with $9.3 billion for more than 1,400 projects selected by members of Congress for their districts.
New York will receive $353 million to build a tunnel under the East River that will allow Long Island Rail Road trains to stop at Grand Central Terminal, reducing commuting times and costs for about 100,000 people who work on the East Side. The state will also get money to purchase two new boats and rebuild terminals for the Staten Island ferry, refurbish Battery Park and convert part of the General Post Office at Eighth Avenue and 33d Street, also known as the Farley building, into the new Pennsylvania Station.
New York will also see its Federal mass transit funding rise by more than 50 percent, to about $1 billion a year -- a significant turnabout from earlier versions of the bill, which called for substantially less spending on bus and subway programs.
The bill includes a provision that would substantially cut the cost of bus and subway travel for some commuters in the New York metropolitan region and across the nation by allowing employers to give workers up to $65 a month in tax-free mass transit benefits instead of salary.
New Jersey will receive $26 million to help finance a network of roads connecting the New Jersey Turnpike with the Hudson County waterfront.
The plan, which will also require a large investment of state funds, is expected to reduce the chronic traffic jams outside the Holland Tunnel and increase development opportunities on the waterfront.
Connecticut's projects include $19 million to construct an interchange on Interstate 95 in New Haven as well as funds for a bicycle and pedestrian walkway in East Hartford, improvements on the commuter rail lines linking New Haven and Stamford and a widening of Route 4 in Stonington.
"This measure may not be perfect, but it's the right economic medicine for Connecticut," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat.
Some dissenters said the legislation would force Congress to scale back other initiatives not just this year but well into the future. To help pay for the bill, Congress approved reductions of $1.8 billion for services to low-income families and $15 billion for payments to veterans who suffer disabilities resulting from smoking while in the military.
"The power of the highway lobby and the pressure to sprinkle road and bridge projects in Congressional districts all over the country created an overwhelming political force that succeeded in securing spending increases that few would have envisioned just a year ago," said Robert Greenstein, director of the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit policy analysis group.
Until a week ago, President Clinton threatened to veto the bill if it called for lavish spending that would require deep cuts to other domestic initiatives. But today, Mr. Clinton said Congressional negotiators had pared the bill to acceptable levels, calling it a "historic bill to strengthen our transportation system" and "a principled compromise."
"It strengthens our commitments to encouraging mass transit, to protecting the environment, to expanding opportunities to disadvantaged businesses, to moving more Americans from welfare to work with transportation assistance," the President said in a news conference.
Once signed, the legislation, known as the Transportation Efficiency Act for the 21st Century, will replace the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act.
That legislation, when it was enacted in 1991, was intended to move Federal transportation policy beyond the era of interstate highway construction and toward financing other types of programs, from subways to bike paths to high-speed ferries.
The bill passed today calls for spending $165 billion on highway and bridge projects, $36 billion on mass transit and $2 billion on safety programs over the coming six years. In an unusual arrangement, the measure will guarantee that revenues collected from an 18.3-cent-per-gallon Federal tax on gasoline will be spent only on transportation.
The provision will prevent Congressional appropriators from using money designated for highway and transit projects for budget balancing or other programs, a typical practice of the past.
Throughout the recent days and right up until final passage, there were intense behind-the-scenes battles over how the funds should be divided among states. In the end, states from the South and West, which have traditionally received smaller shares of Federal transportation spending, saw their portion of total spending increase significantly, at the expense of Northeastern states.
"Most everyone felt they were treated pretty darn fair," said Senator John H. Chafee, a Republican from Rhode Island who was the lead Senate negotiator on the bill.
The bill insures that at least 90.5 percent of the gas tax revenues each state sends to the Federal Government are returned in transportation spending. To achieve that, states like Texas will see their Federal transportation spending increase by 60 percent or more, while states like Connecticut will receive an increase of just 13 percent, to $408 million a year.
New York's Federal highway spending will increase by 35 percent, to $1.3 billion a year, while New Jersey's will grow by 30 percent, to $676 million a year.
Still, Congressmen from the Northeast said they came out of the fight in better shape than they had expected, largely because the size of the total pot was expanded so much. "We made the best of a bad situation," said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey.
Under a provision of the bill, employers will be able to remove $65 a month from a worker's existing pretax salary and give it to them as transit passes that are not subject to Federal, state or local taxes.
The arrangement not only will cut a worker's transit expenses by as much as 60 cents per ride but also will benefit employers whose payroll costs will be reduced because they will not have to pay Social Security or other taxes on the $65. The bill calls for increasing the benefit to $100 per month starting in 2002.
The program, known as Transitchek in the New York area, will also reduce the cost of the monthly unlimited-ride passes that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority plans to begin offering for subways and buses in July. Those passes will cost $63; with Transitchek, the cost would fall to $45 or less. Mass transit advocates predict that as a result, bus and subway usage will increase substantially.
"I am pleased to report that the demise of mass transit as reported by some is premature," said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a New York Republican who was the chief Senate negotiator on mass transit issues.
The tunnel under the East River, known as the East Side Connector, is projected to be a nine-year project that will allow Long Island Rail Road trains to stop at Grand Central Terminal; now, they complete their journeys at Pennsylvania Station on Manhattan's West Side. State officials say about 100,000 commuters must then take taxis, buses or subways back to the East Side for work at an average cost of $900 per commuter a year.
The bill includes a provision that will make State Highway 17, which runs from New York City's northern suburbs along the Pennsylvania border to the state's western reaches, into a Federal highway. The designation means that the state will receive more than $10 million in additional Federal funds each year for maintaining the road.
New York will also receive $20 million to construct a new interchange at the junction of Interstate Highways 84 and 87 in Newburgh and $15 million to paint the Hell Gate Bridge connecting Queens and Manhattan.
The bill also includes $6 million to study moving the elevated portion of the West Side Highway that extends from West 59th to West 72d Streets. Donald J. Trump has called for moving the highway because it could obscure views of the Hudson River from his proposed Riverside South high-rise development.
Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, a Democrat whose district includes that section of the highway sharply objected to the study, saying that the highway was just renovated at the cost of $80 million. "These taxpayer funds would be used to benefit one person: Donald Trump," Mr. Nadler said.
Mr. Nadler's aides said Representative Sue Kelly, a Republican from Westchester, had asked for the funds; Ms. Kelly could not be reached for comment this evening.
During final negotiations, several House members tried to insert amendments designed to delay or weaken Federal environmental programs, ranging from removing toxic sediments in the Housatonic River in Massachusetts to setting tougher standards for the pollutants that cause smog and haze. But most of those amendments were blocked during negotiations with the Senate.

HEADLINE: Bill to Punish Giving Missile Help to Iran Passes in Senate

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
The Senate voted nearly unanimously today to punish foreign enterprises or institutions -- especially those in Russia -- that provide sensitive missile technology or expertise to Iran.
The overwhelming vote, 90 to 4, reflects the Senate's growing alarm at Iran's drive to build long-range rockets that could threaten American troops and allies in the Mideast, and frustration with Moscow for failing to curb missile know-how to Iran. 
 "Iran is a terrorist state under U.S. law," said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader. "This bill addresses a clear and present danger."
The House passed the same measure by voice vote last November, so the bill now goes to the White House. But President Clinton's national security advisers are urging him to veto it on the grounds that it would poison relations with Russia and other countries. Both chambers, however, approved the bill by veto-proof margins.
When asked today if the legislation hampered the President's hands-on foreign policy, the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said, "There is that concern, and it is a real one."
Capitol Hill has been jolted in recent days by momentous developments in proliferation issues. In May, India exploded five nuclear devices and raised fears that Pakistan would follow suit. And Congress is weighing accusations that Mr. Clinton's decision in 1996 to relax export controls on satellites to China may have allowed Beijing to improve the accuracy of its nuclear-tipped missiles.
The bill approved today, the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act, would require the Administration to identify foreign companies or other entities that send to Iran equipment or expertise that helps it to develop its own ballistic missiles. The legislation does not call for sanctions against countries.
Companies or other entities that violate the law would face economic sanctions and a cutoff of United States Government grants and loans. The President could waive the penalties for national security reasons or if new information exonerated a suspected violator.
Economic sanctions are a favorite tool of Congress to influence foreign policy. But the Administration has argued that sanctions are becoming counterproductive and undermine its ability to conduct the affairs of state.
Just this week, the Administration tried to resolve a sticky dispute with its European allies by waiving sanctions against foreign companies doing business in Iran. Those sanctions stemmed from laws that require the President to impose penalties on any company investing more that $20 million a year in the oil or gas industry in Iran.
The legislation approved today does not specifically mention Russia. But lawmakers clearly had Moscow in mind when they wrote the bill. Russia has repeatedly promised to clamp down on the sale of missile technology to Iran, but Russian authorities have been unable or unwilling to stop the leakage.
For example, Iran has started a program to build a missile called the Shahab 3, which has a range of 800 miles, long enough to reach Israel, Turkey and Saudi Arabia.
The missile is based on a North Korean design, but Iran has also relied on Russian expertise to develop the technology.
In March, customs officials in Azerbaijan stopped a Russian shipment of 22 tons of stainless steel, which could be used to make Scud missiles, before it crossed the border into Iran.
The Administration fought desperately to delay the Senate vote today. Five times in the last six months, the Senate agreed to postpone a vote while American officials coaxed and cajoled Russia to toughen its enforcement.
Mr. Clinton dispatched his national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, and invited a group of Senators to the White House on Wednesday night to try to buy more time. But the Senate's patience finally ran out.
"We have a measured response to a real problem," Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, said on the Senate floor today. "The real problem is the development of Iran's long-range ballistic missile capacity. We're dealing with a serious threat to American national security."
Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, said: "Iran has become the most serious threat to the stability in the Middle East. This sends a signal that selling missile technology to Iran is unacceptable."
Only a handful of Senators came to the Administration's defense today, arguing that the bill would hurt United States leverage over Russia to curb its arms sales to Iran.
"The Administration had made significant progress over the six months with the threat of this bill in place," said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat, who opposed the bill. "I'm trying to approach this from a practical point of view: How do we insure this doesn't continue?"
Senator Biden said it was unrealistic for the Senate to expect the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, to have "his finger on" every one of his Government's disparate agencies.
Two Republicans, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, and one other Democrat, John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, also opposed the bill.
In an otherwise decisive drubbing, the Administration won one small concession today. The Senate approved an amendment by Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, to change the bill's retroactive effective date to January 1998 from August 1995.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 27, 1998, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about Senate approval of a bill to penalize foreign enterprises that provide restricted missile technology or expertise to Iran misstated the next step. The bill now goes to a House-Senate conference committee to work out minor differences, not directly to the White House.

The Oldest Bias

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
The media, like societies through history, have been dominated by the young. It's time to look again.
In my field of vision, there is only one correspondent truly covering the terror-filled front of old age. He is Donald M. Murray, The Boston Globe's 73-year-old weekly columnist, a poet in prose: 
 "I am not elderly, I am old and proud of it. I am aged, like a good cheese; I am a walking history book, an elder of the tribe, tested, tempered, wise.. . .I can leave parties early.. . .I can enjoy melancholy, even revel in it. I don't have to smile so hard it hurts my face.. . .I can nap during the sermon.. . .Best of all, I can say no in a society that expects everyone else to say yes, to volunteer, to contribute, to participate."
Like it or not, affirmative action works. Just as MTV proves that it takes youth to know youth, Murray proves that it takes age to truly know age. Yet with the conspicuous exception of the septuagenarian geniuses at "60 Minutes," old-timers have been virtually banished from the media business. And that causes serious neglect of the needs and attributes of the elderly. Reporting on old age has been left almost entirely to the prejudices of the young, who favor growth, not decline, and who avert their eyes from the darkness that old folks confront.
As one of the neglected, I probably understate the case. Many of us in the last decades of life have been brainwashed into a state of denial. Misled by nips, tucks, dyes and Viagra, we are lured into betraying our class. A less self-conscious observer would say that Americans are drunk on youth and have warped the media's view of the old.
Television scoffs at viewers over the age of 49 and disregards their tastes in programming. Even when it addresses disease, the evening news avoids the pains of the present and rushes to embrace the miracle cures promised to the young. This bias toward youth is blamed on advertisers, who themselves have been misled into believing that the under-50 crowd is less sclerotic in its spending habits and more susceptible to 30-second propaganda pitches.
Newspapers, too, are alarmed by survey research that shows their readers are getting older. They think that news, like tobacco, is addictive and pine for the days when the comics and sports that hook the kids were available only in print. They are buying pathetic commercials (on television!) that beg parents to read a paper to their children.
The news media's "ageism" reflects newsroom realities. Most reporters lose their legs by age 40 and most editors are retired before 65. But the population as a whole is aging. In 1900, only 4 percent of Americans were over 65; the percentage now is 13. In 25 years, it will be at least 20 percent and a quarter of them will be over 85.
Even the few media analysts who grasp the trend underestimate the wealth and health of the old and see them mainly as a burden to the young. They think of the elderly as dependent if not helpless, unproductive if not idle, demanding rather than deserving. Yet the majority of the old are self-sufficient, middle-class consumers with more assets than young couples and with both time and talent to offer society. Poverty is now more a condition of the young than the old and sociologists discern the emergence of a potent cohort of woopies -- well-off older people.
Still, in the shrewd observation of Thomas R. Cole, the director of the Institute for Medical Humanities at the University of Texas, the elderly have been "marginalized by an economy and culture committed to the scientific management of growth without limit" and by "relentless hostility to physical decline." And as Dr. Robert N. Butler, the founder of the International Longevity Center, recently warned Congress, the rapidly growing elderly population will truly become a burden if society continues to neglect research into frailty and dementia and fails to help the old remain productive.
The obvious way to meet this challenge is to arouse the media with some urgent affirmative action. We need more seasoned -- and elderly -- correspondents to cover the travails of "retirement" and the march toward death. We need more Donald Murrays, and to inspire other writers by reprinting his work.
Murray insists on talking about death because he has discovered that most doctors won't:
"Minnie Mae and I touch more often than is usual this week. We seize the day . . .doing what has to be done, enjoying what is, not what may or may not be.. . .We each fight our lonely battles with fear and despair, but Minnie Mae and I remind each other to stop and pay attention to what is important: family, friends, neighbors, the sunlight in our woods that we notice only because of the shadow's edge."
Murray counters the smugness of athletic youth by recording the great effort he expends daily searching for the remote control, rocking himself out of an easy chair, climbing the stairs, turning in bed, straining through bifocals and racing through the supermarket to reach the men's room in time. "This sedentary life isn't easy," he reports. "Salute when you jog past me, youngster."
The most radical of all of Murray's columns, I think, was addressed to a young reader -- obviously an offspring "scrunched in the sandwich generation between a child and aging parents" -- who asked for advice about how to deal with the parents for whom she has increasing responsibility:
"I certainly cannot resist an open invitation to give advice. And that is my first suggestion. Ask for advice. You don't have to take it.. . .I was impressed one late evening, during our courtship, when Minnie Mae said that love is easy, respect is more important -- and often more difficult. As we get older we treasure respect."
My unasked advice to the media: there's a market growing out there, and a job to be done.

HEADLINE: Humankind Battles for Scrabble Supremacy

BYLINE: By John Tierney; John Tierney is a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
The day before they defended the honor of their species in Scrabble, Matt Graham and Joel Sherman convened for a final training session. Matt, who lives in a studio apartment in Manhattan crammed with dictionaries and word lists and Scrabble newsletters, went out to Joel's small house in the Bronx, which was crammed with the same stuff. The living room's decorative highlight was a Scrabble board showing the final game of last year's world championship, in which Joel defeated Matt.
The two sat down in Joel's kitchen at a computer much like the one they were about to play the next day. Deep Blue had already dethroned the human chess champion, occasioning great angst over the species' mental powers, but so far there had no been serious challenge in Scrabble. The match was being sponsored by The New York Times Magazine as part of the 50th anniversary of Scrabble's birth, in which The Times played a small role. Alfred Butts, the unemployed architect from Poughkeepsie, N.Y., who developed the game, determined how many tiles of each letter to include (12 E's, 6 T's, 1 Q) by laboriously counting how often each letter appeared on the front page of The Times and other New York dailies. 
 Joel turned on a program called Video Flashcards, and the letters AEEGINRTS appeared on the screen. Joel immediately began typing GRATINEES (meaning to cook food with a crust). "There's also AGENTRIES and RESEATING," he said. "What else?"
"STINGAREE," Matt said, referring to an alternate name for the stingray fish. They moved on, coming up with most possibilities in seconds. When ADEEIRRST appeared, Matt broke it down instantly: "ARTERIES, with a D left over. STEADIER, with an R. DREARIEST." They were briefly stumped by ACCEHOPUS, but within 20 seconds Joel saw CAPOUCHES.
"Is that some kind of handbag?" he asked idly.
"Some kind of hood or cowl," Matt replied, which was correct but also, of course, besides the point. At this level, you cannot get bogged down in definitions. Success requires the discipline to spend hours a day memorizing lists of playable words. It also helps if, like Matt and Joel, you are free from distractions like day jobs and marriage.
Joel, who is 36 and has been playing Scrabble since he was 6, graduated from the Bronx High School of Science, dropped out of college, worked as a bank teller and then quit, partly because of health problems. (On the Scrabble circuit he's known as G.I. Joel due to his gastrointestinal ailments.) Full-time Scrabble is not a lucrative career -- last year Joel made $35,000 -- but he survives on a small inheritance and by living at home with his father and brother. "I realize it seems crazy to spend so much time on the game," he says, "but it happens to be the one thing I've found that I can do better than most other people."
Matt, 32, who grew up in Indianapolis, dropped out of high school and came to New York to be a stand-up comic. He took up Scrabble only seven years ago, and plays on the circuit in between his appearances at comedy clubs and "Late Night With Conan O'Brien." He does not do Scrabble jokes. There's not much overlap between his worlds. "Comedy can be frustrating because it's so subjective," he says. "The nice thing about Scrabble is that it's so clear-cut. It doesn't matter how the audience is feeling. It doesn't matter if you're not a brainiac with a degree from the right school. If you score higher, you win."
Like most top players on the Scrabble tournament circuit, both Matt and Joel know perhaps 80,000 playable words, at least twice as many as the average person. But the guys' silicon opponent, a computer program named Maven, knows the entire dictionary -- 100,000 words of eight letters or less -- and can unscramble 5,000 anagrams in a second. Maven did not have to train the day before the match. The words were all securely imbedded in its memory, in a CD-ROM available in stores for $29.95.
Maven was created by Brian Sheppard, who started dabbling with the program in 1983 during an internship at I.B.M.'s research center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., home of the Deep Blue chess program. He began by programming Maven to quickly find every word that could be played each turn, grunt work that's easy for a computer. Then came the hard part: strategy.
The computer had to learn how to "bingo," the key to championship play. Bingo is Scrabble slang for using all seven tiles in your rack on one turn, good for a 50-point bonus. Experts often get two or three bingos in a game by thinking ahead instead of just going for the highest score every turn. They unload clunky letters like U or Q or W and try to maintain a balanced mix of consonants and vowels that easily combine into seven-letter words. They also try to set up spots on the board for their bingos while not leaving too many openings for the opponent.
Humans use intuition and experience to make these decisions. Maven relies instead on formulas that Sheppard developed by letting the computer play millions of games. These formulas can leave Maven blind to obvious dangers ahead -- it sometimes makes needlessly "volatile" plays, as they are called, that leave high-scoring openings for the opponent. But although Maven had lost a previous confrontation with humanity -- a brief two-game contest at a scientific conference last year -- Sheppard was confident that it would win the full best-of-11 match at The Times.
"I can almost guarantee you that Maven will play better than Matt and Joel," said Sheppard, who now works for Hasbro, the toy company that sells the Scrabble CD-ROM with the Maven program. "There are some situations in which they'll see something that Maven misses. But it will never get fatigued or miss a bingo."
Matt, the brash, impetuous member of the odd couple, refused to believe he was an underdog. "We have a slight edge," he said. "This omnipotent, all-seeing machine still makes the stupidest blunders."
Joel was more restrained, in keeping with his mild-mannered approach to Scrabble and life. "We're no better than evenly matched with Maven," he said. "The computer will make mistakes, but it has perfect word knowledge. There's just so much the human mind is capable of processing."
Man met machine on the top floor of the Times building during a seven-hour match. Playing jointly with one rack of tiles, Matt and Joel sat across a table from a Toshiba laptop loaded with Maven. John D. Williams Jr., the executive director of the National Scrabble Association, acted as referee, and before long he was hearing complaints that the computer was cheating. These were not unexpected, given one of Maven's idiosyncrasies: it picks the tiles for both players. Sheppard says most players prefer to have Maven handle tile-drawing chores, but some of the top players don't like it, and it was easy to understand Matt and Joel's suspicion as the first game started. Cursed with bad tiles, they were reduced to playing paltry words like BAN, while Maven demolished them with GROSZY (Polish coins) and DICKIEST (British slang for faultiest).
"Look, we know to play GROSZY and DICKIEST, too," Matt said after the game. "But we're working with bad racks, and it always seems to be that way with Maven. How can you not be suspicious of a machine that won't let you pick the tiles?"
Humanity's tiles improved the next game, which Matt and Joel won with help from three bingos (UPHEAVE, STEWPAN and MISEATEN). They lost the third game, and then got another bad break at the start of the fourth. Matt and Joel drew EEIJTVW and knew immediately what the best play was: JEW, which is legal in tournament play as a lower-case verb. (The noun JEW is illegal because it's capitalized.)
Maven, however, would not allow JEW. More precisely, the corporate marketers of Maven would not allow it. Five years ago, a woman who was playing Scrabble with a Holocaust survivor came across the word in the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary and complained, and before long Hasbro was confronted with protests from the Anti-Defamation League. The leading Scrabble players, many of whom are Jewish, united in defense of free speech (and higher scores), but the controversy escalated. Besides protests about various slurs, there were letters from sensitive censors like the one who wrote, "I personally find the most offensive words in the English language to be WAR and GUN." Hasbro responded by expurgating JEW and dozens of other objectionable words.
So Matt and Joel settled for playing VIEW, which left them stuck with the J for another turn. They fell behind and never caught up. "Maybe we would have lost anyway," Joel said afterward. "But JEW might have made a big difference."
Maven had its bad moments, too, blowing the next game by leaving an opening for Matt and Joel -- a gaffe no human expert would have committed. (See Diagram 2.) Then, having cut Maven's lead in games to 3-2, Matt and Joel blundered (and eventually lost the game) by trying to play ZYMIC. Joel assured Matt it was a word -- a derivation of ZYME, a fermenting agent -- but the computer knew better, and they lost the turn.
"You said you were definitely sure it was a word," Matt said testily.
"I was definite," Joel replied. "I can be definite and still be wrong. That's a human quality."
The strain on the humans was starting to show. During the next game, they had a long argument over whether to play PIQUE or PIQUET (a card game), and then slumped in disgust when Maven pulled out a victory with a dramatic bingo. (See Diagram 3.) They were now behind 5-2, a game away from defeat. Near the end of the eighth game they were narrowly ahead and about to play a rack containing a blank and DIMTUU. The computer, which was being asked on each turn how it would play the humans' rack, instantly saw a bingo -- TRIDUUMS, three-day periods of Catholic prayers -- and flashed its recommendation on a screen visible to a small audience of fans but not to Matt and Joel. It took them more than a minute to find the word, and even then they weren't sure it was legitimate.
"TRIDUUM is definitely a word," said Joel. "But is TRIDUUMS the right plural?"
It has to be right, Matt said. If the plural were TRIDUA, we'd know that word, and we don't. Let's do it. I want to bingo in style. I want to show this inanimate object a thing or two. Matt started to put out the tiles for TRIDUUMS, and the audience relaxed: humanity had not been bested by the computer on this turn.
But then came an even more splendid moment for the species. Joel suddenly spotted an intricate danger beyond Maven's comprehension. At this point, there were only six tiles left to be drawn from the pool, and if the humans played TRIDUUMS they would draw all six. With no tiles left in the pool, Maven could end the game during its next turn by playing a bingo, and the humans would be penalized for the tiles left in their rack, which would cost them the game. So Matt and Joel instead played MU (the Greek letter). Sure enough, Maven bingoed on the next turn with ORNITHES (bird varieties) and had to draw the final tiles from the pool. Then Matt and Joel played a bingo, SITUATED, to win the game. If they had thought like Maven and played TRIDUUMS, they would have lost.
Unfortunately for humanity, that was the high point. Maven got better tiles the next game, and the frustrated humans made one elementary mistake. (See Diagram 4.) They also got into a screaming argument over the relative merits of ENTASIA (muscle spasms) versus TAENIAS (Greek headbands). The dispute was so intense that Joel, who normally expresses displeasure by saying, "Oh, crud!" uttered one of the obscenities banned from the new Scrabble dictionary. At the end, when the guys' only chance to win was to play a bingo, Maven sealed its victory by dealing them a rack consisting of BGJNRVY.
The final score was 6 games to 3, which was not a fair representation of humanity's relative skill. The humans made a few minor mistakes, but on most turns they chose the same play recommended by Maven -- and sometimes a better one. "All this proved was that Maven could give itself better tiles," Matt said. "With even tiles, I think we'd have an edge." Joel still thought they were at best equal to Maven.
Sheppard was impressed at how well the humans had played, and he conceded that the computer's lopsided win had been due to better tiles. Both sides agreed that humans and Maven are closely matched -- but only for now. Sheppard has a powerful new version of Maven, which he hopes to release next year, that analyzes the possible responses by the opponent to each move under consideration. With this extra oomph, Maven is expected to become the undisputed champion.
"Maven will never have our intuitive feel for a board position," Joel said, "but the new Maven will be able to do so many computations that it will probably be unbeatable."
It may seem sad that the most popular human word game is being conquered by a machine, but no matter how good Maven gets at analyzing permutations of letters, it will remain incapable of the verbal skills that Matt and Joel displayed during the dinner after the match. For dessert they ordered TIRAMISU, a bingo word that Maven had played for its come-from-behind victory in the seventh game. "That was the last straw, Maven giving itself that bingo," Matt said. "You know what I felt ready for at that moment? TIRAMISU plus NA."
Joel understood instantly. "SANITARIUM," he said.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Man vs. Machine : Matt Graham and Joel Sherman mixing it up with Maven. (Photograph by Fred R. Conrad) (p. 21); 1. Man and machine both have their strong points on the Scrabble field, as illustrated by these examples. On this turn, early in the fourth game, Matt and Joel were burdened with unwieldy consonants: A D H O T T Y. They found an elegant way to unload one of the T's, the H and the Y, scoring 39 points. Can you find it? Answer: Using the E in REWAX, the men played THEY, also forming TI (the musical note), HE and JOEY (a young kangaroo). By leaving their rack balanced evenly between vowels and commonly used consonants (A, D, O, T), Matt and Joel improved their chances of scoring a "bingo" on a subsequent play -- which they did two moves later; 2. Maven was ahead 314-278 when it blew the fifth game on this turn. Working with E E G L S U and a blank, the computer considered several plays near the bottom of the board. One possibility was to put LUGES underneath SUBAH, forming SUBAHS (which are provinces in India). Another was to use the H in SUBAH to make HUGE. Which was smarter? Answer: Maven chose HUGE, which Matt and Joel promptly turned into HUGER by running AVOIDER down the far-right column, collecting bonuses for all seven tiles and for covering a red triple-word-score square -- 93 points in all, enough for the win. A human expert would have dismissed HUGE as too "volatile (p. 22); 3. Near the end of the seventh game, Matt and Joel were comfortably ahead, 351-291, and Maven's rack did not look promising: A I I M R S U. Even so, the computer managed to use all seven tiles to take the lead and eventually prevail. What was its sweet concoction? Answer: In the bottom-right quadrant, off the T in LAITY, Maven played TIRAMISU for 74 points; 4. In the ninth game, Matt and Joel were experiencing something that computers don't: fatigue. Two moves earlier, they had a screaming argument over ENTASIA, the term for the spasmodic contraction of a muscle. (Joel wanted to play TAENIAS, a headband worn in ancient Greece.) Now, trailing 186-133, they were stuck with a miserable-looking rack: C D D D L T U. Tired and grumpy, they played hurriedly and overlooked a common word that would have been a better choice. What was the best play? Answer: Matt and Joel played a dud in the lower-right corner (running DOWN from SIZED) for 30 points, which left them with an unbalanced rack of four consonants. They overlooked Maven's first choice in this position, to spell CUDDLE by using the E in SIZE. Besides scoring more points, 32, this move would have unloaded mediocre tiles and given them a chance to draw a better rack (Scrabble Board Photograped by Bill Steele for The New York Times) (p. 23)

HEADLINE: Q&A/Nicholas S. Perna;
How Asia's Crisis Helped State's Economy

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
IT is Nicholas S. Perna's job to peer into the future and forecast economic trends. "Reading computer printouts and chicken entrails," he said, quoting a friend's characterization of his work. He focuses on Connecticut and the surrounding region -- New England, New York and New Jersey.
Dr. Perna, who received his doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has worked as an economist for several banks and government institutions, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the President's Council of Economic Advisers. He is chief economist for the Fleet Financial Group in Hartford. 
 Recently Dr. Perna discussed Connecticut's economy, its strengths and weaknesses and some predictions. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. How do you forecast the economic climate?
A. The process is eclectic. I am an avid computer user but I have learned over the years that good solid judgment is also important. This is especially true when we have no precedents -- like the collapse of the currency in East Asia. A good auto mechanic today is comfortable using advanced diagnostic technology but can tell by the sound and the feel of the engine what's going on. What that means is we're not blindly driven by black box models of the economy. We try to take into account as many things as we possibly can.
Q. Connecticut is generally thriving. Will it continue indefinitely?
A. Here we are nationally in the midst of the best economy in more than a generation. The key question is: Is it going to last? That's very important whether you're in California or Connecticut. We're very much an open economy. What happens in Connecticut this year, next year or five years from now, is far more in the hands of the national economy than it is in our own hands in a sense. We can do a lot here that will affect the outcome but if the national economy goes into recession, then inevitably there will be a recession here.
The last time the national economy went into recession, the early 1990's, we went down as a state three times as long and got hit five times as hard. The period during which jobs declined, 1989 to 1992, lasted three years. The national recession was only one year in length. Nationally the economy lost about 2 percent of its jobs. Connecticut lost 10 percent of its jobs.
Q. What's different today?
A. There's a recession out there someplace. It doesn't seem to be around the corner. When you have an economy, that is in some respects nationally running flat out, the odds of something tipping it over are fairly high. Are recessions inevitable? Not in the sense that some people believe in long term cycles. I call them the bio-rhythmic school of economics. I think like bio-rhythms there's not a lot of information in it. There are no truly long term inevitable cycles. Cycles have causes to them. Nationally we've had as little as one year between recessions and as long as 10 years.
We have an incredibly low inflation rate. It's probably as low as it's going to go. It will probably pick up in the next 12 to 18 months. But the pickup will be within ranges that are quite mild by historic standards. By that I mean we are running at 1.5 percent inflation now and in a year from now it might be up a percentage point to 2.5.
In 1980 the prime rate was 21.5 percent. Today it's 8.5. In 1980 someone looking for a fixed rate, 20-year mortgage would have paid about 18 percent. Today it's 7 percent. Much of that difference between then and now reflects a far better inflation environment. Some of it reflects the budget surplus.
Q. Does the crisis in Asia affect Connecticut's economy?
A. The initial effects have been positive for the nation and Connecticut. It's pretty much agreed upon by economists that the Federal Reserve would have raised interest rates last fall because the economy was growing too fast to be sustained.
The Asian crisis affected us for two reasons. It slowed the U.S. economy because there were fewer exports and more imports. It helped to keep a lid on prices, which led to interest rates being significantly lower than they would otherwise be. Connecticut people who wanted to refinance their homes in the last couple of months to take advantage of getting out from their 8 or 9 percent mortgages, are benefiting from some of the fallout from the Asian problem. It has had a positive spillover effect on the stock market. As a generalization, lower interest rates mean higher stock prices.
We're getting some evidence that exports are being retarded in Connecticut. Imports are being accelerated. One reason is that the dollar buys far more in Asian currency than it did before. The other side of the coin is that it's now more expensive to buy U.S. goods. Companies like Pratt and Whitney and G.E. could eventually feel some fallout. Because they have such huge backlogs it might be awhile. Exports have been a significant source of growth in Connecticut.
Q. Connecticut has a budget surplus. What in your opinion is the best use of that money?
A. It seems to me that we are doing very well as a state. What we're not sure of is to what extent the largesse we are seeing in our national and local treasuries is permanent. I think that at this point the best policy to follow is one of prudence. That means either measured modest tax cuts, if that's what you want, or refurbish the rainy day fund. I think this is a perfect opportunity to put even more aside for a rainy day. Given my druthers I'd prefer to see much more put into rainy day funds over tax cuts. Maybe a recession would be the time to use some of the rainy day fund to tackle deferred maintenance projects at UConn and other things that are worth doing. When a recession occurs, costs are lower and the economy benefits from the stimulation.
Q. How healthy is the Connecticut real estate market?
A. We had rampant real estate speculation in the 80's. That meant that we were overbuilding like there was no tomorrow in Hartford, Fairfield County, residential real estate, condos. It then took years to work that off. Unfortunately there were other causalities. It dragged down a number of banks and real estate firms. We don't have that today. I think you could make the case that we could be underbuilt in certain types of real estate. What comes to mind immediately is apartments in much of the state.
Q. Why don't Connecticut cities thrive in good times?
A. Connecticut cities almost defy gravity. When things are bad, cities are bad. When things are really good, cities still don't participate. The boom of the 80's bypassed them.
I travel around the Northeast and see a remarkable similarity among cities, state to state. Americans like the suburbs. We've got our cars. We like to park closest to the mall. The old days of driving into downtown Hartford, or taking the bus or train, are gone. The suburbanization of America has hollowed out the center of cities.
We need to address the problem of transportation. One of Hartford's biggest assets is nice office space at reasonable prices in what I think is a fairly pleasant downtown. One of the things that stands in the way is easy access. We need transportation policies that better link the cities to the suburbs making it easier for people to get into the cities. Historically what we've done is make it easier for people to live outside the cities.
Q. You see economic trends regionally. How does that comport with local control?
A. I don't think we leverage our economic clout or leverage our political clout the way we should as a region. One of the assets that people are discovering is having a regional airports. Manchester, N.H., Airport and T. F.Green Airport in Rhode Island are booming. Bradley is showing signs of life. Think of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey getting together to fully optimize on these airports instead of competing with each other.
Is it possible to do some regionalization at the margin that gives you the benefits of small towns? Do we really need seven dozen highway departments? Can we do more sharing of educational facilities?
Think of Connecticut as a little place with big borders. Can we do more partnering with our outside neighbors? Can we send high school kids across the border? Can they come here?
We've got good higher education systems in New England. We're all sharing the same challenge, which is not exactly booming enrollments. Part of it is the feedstock in Connecticut of young people. Can we think more regionally in terms of educational systems? Maybe we can only afford to have one state institution that offers Egyptology? Do we need to have eight departments in New England? Why don't we treat this more like a regional educational system? I think we're probably not getting the economies of scale that we could otherwise get. The private sector has maybe gone overboard in trying to get economies of scale. Yet I think we have hardly even thought of that at the public sector level.

Tax to Preserve Open Space Gets Growing Support

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
WITH development pressures on the rise so are concerns about the loss of open space, prompting a growing number of municipalities and counties across New Jersey to establish trust funds supported by special taxes to maintain open space.
A 1992 state law gives communities and counties the option to hold referendums to set up such funds, which are supported by a special property tax imposed on residents and are used to help buy land for preservation. The enabling act was amended last year to broaden the permitted uses of the tax revenue to include park development, maintenance and historic and farmland preservation. Typically, the tax is 2 cents per $100 of assessed property value, although in some cases it is has been raised to 5 cents. 
 "Municipalities and counties are taking it upon themselves to plot out their own destiny, and with the tax they have a source of revenue to help them do that," said John L. Klevins, project manager in the Morristown field office of the Trust for Public Land, the national nonprofit land conservation organization.
Setting up local trust funds appears to run counter to a general resistance to higher taxes. But Maureen Ogden, a former Assemblywoman who is now chairwoman of the Governor's Council on New Jersey Outdoors, said towns and counties were "coming to the realization that saving open space is a pocketbook and quality-of-life issue."
She and other advocates of the trust fund said preservation had the potential to enhance property values and reduce spending since it is less expensive to buy land than to provide the services, like schools, needed to accommodate growth.
Critics say trust funds are just another way for towns and counties to try to stop development.
Some 53 of the 566 municipalities in the state have approved an open-space tax, 31 of them in the last two years, as have 13 of the state's 21 counties. Among them are Clinton Township in Hunterdon County and Washington Township in Morris County. Morris County has a trust fund, but Hunterdon County does not.
As of last spring localities, through their open-space trust funds, together had collected more than $106 million and protected nearly 17,500 acres, according to data from the Trust for Public Land and the state's Green Acres Program. The latter program, administered by the state's Department of Environmental Protection, provides state funds to acquire land for preservation as open space.
The dwindling supply of and fierce competition for such public financing is another factor stoking the push to establish open-space trust funds.
Towns and counties can use the revenue raised from the tax to leverage other funds, said James Wyse, a partner at the law firm of Schenck, Price, Smith & King in Morristown, who specializes in conservation-related real estate transactions.
"You need a hodgepodge of financing to do large land deals," said Mr. Wyse, adding that having a fund for open space enables towns and counties to move quickly to buy sites they think are important to save.
Since 1961 nearly 400,000 acres of open space have been or are in the process of being acquired under the state's Green Acres Program. The money for the acquisitions came from $1.39 billion allocated over the last 37 years under nine voter-approved bond issues.
But that money has been virtually exhausted. And estimates are that some 300,000 more acres are needed for the state -- which still has 1.7 million of its 4.8 million acres undeveloped -- to meet its open-space needs.
Last January Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said she wants to preserve 1 million acres over the next decade. She also said that rather than relying on periodic bond issues she wanted to establish a stable financing source, which she is expected to announce at the end of this month. Some of the sources discussed have been a gasoline tax and a mortgage fee of $1 for every $1,000 of assessed value on new or refinanced loans.
TOWNS and counties are becoming cognizant that the state just can't do it alone and that the time to preserve open space is now or never," said Kevin S. Richardson, principal planner for the Green Acres Program's Bureau of Green Trust Management, which assists municipalities and counties.
To that end the state added the Planning Incentive Program to Green Acres in 1996. That program provides state funds -- in the form of a grant for 25 percent of the amount and a low-interest loan for the balance -- to localities and counties with an open-space tax.
"The purpose is to economize and combine funds so that not only the state, but towns and counties can stretch their dollars further," Mr. Richardson said.
The first community to take advantage of the new program was the 38-square mile township of Clinton, which has had an open-space fund in place since 1996 after its 12,000 residents approved a tax of 2 cents per $100 of assessed property, raising $240,000 a year. Last year the tax was increased to 5 cents, which will generate $640,000 annually.
"Clinton is agricultural in character, but it is losing that status quickly to development," said Lee Voorhees, its director of financing, referring to the reason residents voted for the tax.
Catherine Sipe, chairwoman of the township's open space committee, added: "You can't stop development on a site unless you buy it."
That is what Clinton did. It paid slightly more than $1 million to acquire 95 acres of woodlands, hills and pastures known as Bray's Hill Farm, named for Daniel Bray, who hid the boats George Washington used to cross the Delaware River on Christmas 1776 for his raid on Trenton. The residentially zoned site, atop Sound Hill Road, was a priority for the township when the owner -- the Exxon Corporation, which has a massive research center nearby -- put it up for sale early in 1997.
The township, working with the Trust for Public Land, obtained $1 million from the Green Acres Planning Incentive program to purchase the site last November and is using the money collected through its trust fund to pay off the loan. The site is now a nature preserve.
The township was allocated an additional $2 million from the program, which it will use to help buy 500 to 700 more acres, said Mrs. Sipe. More needs to be done, including implementation of stricter zoning, to protect the township's remaining open space, she said, while noting that the fund "is a big first step in trying to guide where development will go."
Washington Township, a 45-square mile community of 17,000 people in Morris County, has purchased, alone or with preservation partners, some 3,000 acres of open space. "We have an awful lot of land, about 10,000 acres, available to save and to have a fund that creates a pool of money made sense," said Margaret E. Nordstrom, the Mayor of the township. Its open-space fund, established in 1993, raises about $60,000 annually.
Last year, for instance, the township worked with conservation groups to preserve 120 acres within a watershed area. Mr. Wyse, the Morristown lawyer who helped structure the deal, said it involved the purchase of the land for $1.5 million by the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, a private nonprofit land trust in Morristown.
The development rights for the 120 acres were sold to the Upper Raritan Watershed Association, a private preservation group, which used a Morris County grant to buy the rights.
The restricted land was traded for a 278-acre tract in Warren County, which conservation groups are also working to preserve. The smaller Morris County property will now be a horse farm and its owner will reap a tax benefit because he is getting less land in the swap.
For its part, Washington Township provided $100,000 from its open-space trust fund to purchase an easement around the 120 acres for a public pathway.
Mayor Nordstrom said the township was considering going to voters in November to double the tax to 4 cents per $100 of assessed value "because buying open space gives the township the best return on its investment."
That sentiment is echoed by Walter Krich, director of Planning and Economic Development for Morris County, which has had an open-space trust fund in place since 1993. Since then the half-cent tax, increased over the years to 2 cents, has helped the county underwrite the purchase of about 3,200 acres for $19 million.
Mr. Krich said there was talk of increasing the tax to 3 cents this year. "They are not making any new land," he said, "so we are buying what we can today to have open space 50 to 100 years from now."

HEADLINE: Help Wanted: School Superintendent

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW 

 BODY:
When Bert Nelson, Superintendent of the Hewlett-Woodmere School District, announced he would be retiring at the end of this school year, there were about 50 applications submitted for his position -- far fewer, he said, than had been expected.
In East Williston, when Superintendent David Helme informed the Board of Education that he would be retiring, the Board began a search for a new Superintendent. After two rounds of interviews, the members of the Board narrowed the choice to two finalists, but ultimately decided not to hire either. They asked Mr. Helme to stay on next year until they could find a qualified candidate. 
 Following a search for a Superintendent for Western Suffolk Boces, the Boces Board recently rejected all the candidates who had applied and decided to start the hiring process again.
These examples reflect a growing problem in recruiting School Superintendents, both for individual public school districts and for the Boces districts, which serve a number of school districts in a particular region.
Whereas a decade ago, between 100 and 150 qualified people would have applied for each vacant Superintendent's position, the pool of candidates has now diminished to an average of 30 to 40, said Charles Fowler, Superintendent of Nassau County Boces, who is leaving his position at the end of the school year.
The decline in the candidate pool has been particularly steep over the last five years, said Robert Loretan, executive director of the New York State Council of School Superintendents. While it has become a problem statewide, the high cost of living, expensive housing and high taxes on Long Island make the recruitment of School Superintendents there even more difficult.
"Cost of living is an important factor in job recruitment," Dr. Loretan said. "Today there are many more dual-career couples, and the uplifting of families means having to find a new home and often means displacing a working spouse. Even if the new job offers a salary increase of $20,000, if housing is more expensive and a spouse is out of a job and has to start over, it may not be worth it."
The average annual salary in New York State for School Superintendents is slightly less than $100,000, Dr. Loretan said. In small rural districts upstate, the figure is substantially lower than in more populated suburban areas.
In Nassau County, the average salary for Superintendents of public school districts is about $132,000, Dr. Fowler said. In Suffolk, the salaries are slightly lower and vary more from one district to another, said Edward Milliken, Superintendent of Eastern Suffolk Boces, who is retiring this year. The smaller districts offer significantly lower salaries, he said, while larger districts ofmore than 1,000 students from kindergarten through 12th grade usually pay about $120,000 a year.
In Suffolk County, two districts now looking to hire new Superintendents, Port Jefferson and Connetquot, both recently advertised the positions for salaries of more than $130,000, Dr. Milliken said.
But though salaries in some areas are rising, the job is attracting fewer candidates. Meanwhile, vacancies are increasing as more Superintendents are retiring as soon as they are eligible.
There have been significantly fewer applicants this year for the seven Superintendent vacancies in Suffolk County, said Joseph Donovan, president of the Suffolk County Council of Superintendents. The salary gap has narrowed between a Superintendent and a teacher at the highest level of the pay scale, he pointed out.
"When teachers look at the fact that Superintendents work 12 months a year, seven days a week," he added, "while they work for only 10 months, many question making a move."
In East Williston, for example, an experienced teacher with advanced degrees can make more than $90,000, Mr. Helme said.
"If you add coaching or club supervision," he said, "you can easily push the salary up by another $5,000 to $6,000. Although a teacher's job is demanding, it does not have nearly the same pressures as a Superintendent."
Indeed, several Superintendents cited job stress as a reason for the decline in applications. "It's not only an economic issue," Dr. Fowler said, "but what's involved in the position today. There are tremendous pressures from legislative actions, from having to work with locally elected officials and unions, as well as additional accountability pressures."
The State Education Department's new higher standards, which will be phased in over the next few years, will intensify these pressures, he said.
The responsibilities of School Superintendents have also changed in recent years, added Sidney Freund, Superintendent of the Herricks School District in New Hyde Park. Superintendents no longer have the decision-making authority they once did, he said.
"Fiscal, legislative and labor-related issues have taken too much time away from classroom instruction," Dr. Freund explained. "In addition, the Superintendent's job is the only nontenured position in a school district, so there is no job security. When you consider this factor, along with a smaller salary gap between lower positions and that of Superintendent, fewer people are willing to move into such a high-risk position."
In fact, job strains often contribute to a Superintendent's decision to resign. Maria Petraglia, Superintendent of schools in Manhasset, is leaving at the end of this school year to do private educational consulting.
"The job has become so demanding that it leaves little time for a personal life," she said. "It is often a job that is not understood or appreciated. As a change agent, we often upset the apple cart. Today I know many Assistant Superintendents who are just not interested in applying for the position of Superintendent."
In Nassau County, an Assistant Superintendent can make up to $120,000, Dr. Fowler said. "Even if there's a $15,000 to $20,000 salary raise when moving from Assistant Superintendent to Superintendent," he said, "after taxes and considering the additional time and pressures, it's often not worth it."
More Superintendents are choosing to work at colleges or as consultants, said Gerard Dempsey, president of the Nassau County Council of School Superintendents. Although these jobs often mean a big cut in salary, they are less demanding of time and impose fewer political pressures.
In Nassau County, there are 10 Superintendent vacancies, Mr. Dempsey said, and a diminished pool of candidates.
"Any time the pool shrinks," he said, "it becomes that much more difficult, because there's less choice in which to find a good candidate and one who will fit in with the specific community."
The experience in East Williston, where no candidate proved suitable, is a prime example of the problem.
"The district is a small, high-achieving district with a powerful faculty and strong community support," Mr. Helme said. "We should have had our pick of the best-qualified candidates. Our situation points to the difficulty today in finding top-quality Superintendents."
In terms of educational leadership, the most critical issue on the Island has become the positions of the Boces superintendents, who traditionally have been regarded as the most prestigious administrators in the state. At the end of the school year, two of the Island's three Boces districts will face uncertain leadership, with one Superintendent already departed and the other two leaving. Only Eastern Suffolk Boces has hired a new Superintendent for next year.
"Historically, when a vacancy occurred for a Boces District Superintendent, the top Superintendents from the region applied for the job," Dr. Milliken said. "It was a distinguished, well-paying job with a better compensation package than a Superintendent for a local district."
But today, because of legislative actions that froze salaries and restricted benefits, local Superintendents are receiving higher salaries and better benefits packages than Boces Superintendents, Dr. Milliken said. "When there is a Boces opening," he added, "it does not attract as strong a field of candidates as it used to. Unfortunately, because of a past situation, the Legislature classically closed the barn door after the horse got out."
For Boces Superintendents, salaries have been frozen for the last six years at $128,625. Legislation on salaries was imposed following public outrage over the near million-dollar retirement pay given in 1992 to Ed Murphy, District Superintendent of the former Suffolk Boces III, which is now Western Suffolk Boces. Dr. Murphy received the large retirement package because of accumulated sick days.
Last year, the Legislature imposed further restrictions on Boces Superintendents by including the personal use of a car and the cash value of life insurance as part of their compensation.
In essence, this move reduced their salary even further and virtually forced the Superintendents to leave their positions, said Bruce Brodsky, president of Eastern Suffolk Boces.
Following the legislation, the three Long Island Boces Superintendents all decided to leave their jobs. Daniel A. Domenech, then the Superintendent of Western Suffolk Boces, who would have lost $10,000 to $12,000 in salary, decided to go into the private sector, but has since re-entered public education as Superintendent of Schools in Fairfax, Va.
Dr. Milliken, at Eastern Suffolk Boces, had intended to stay in his position until his 60's, he said, but chose instead to retire this year at age 56.
"Although I had been grandfathered, and my salary frozen above the cap, it became illogical to stay on," he said, "when I can collect a pension, and my earning power will be identical to what I'm making now, without working."
Dr. Fowler at Nassau Boces decided to move to a local school district and will replace Dr. Nelson as Superintendent of the Hewlett-Woodmere schools. He is frustrated by the restrictions from the Legislature, which added job responsibilities while reducing his salary by $6,000. "It was not a fair thing to do," he said, "to attract someone to a position, then to increase his responsibilities while decreasing his compensation."
Recruitment efforts for Boces Superintendents have been difficult, Dr. Milliken said. Neither Western Suffolk Boces nor Nassau Boces is close to finding a new leader.
"In Eastern Suffolk, we were very fortunate to hire Eric Eversley, from a high school district in a suburb of Chicago," he said. "But there was a smaller number of candidates for the position, and the Board was concerned over the quality of the applicants. At a time when educational leadership is critical, the top positions are no longer coveted. And that's going to be a serious problem."

HEADLINE: Panel to Hear Public on Millstone Reactor

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
IN 1986, as the battle over the 800-megawatt Shoreham nuclear power plant raged across Long Island, the opening of an even larger commercial reactor less than 15 miles from East End beaches all but escaped notice.
Now, for the first time since the 1,153-megawatt Millstone Unit Three reactor gained a Federal license to operate on a 500-acre site on Long Island Sound near Waterford, Conn., Federal regulators from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will travel to Long Island to hear local opinion on the Connecticut plant's future. 
 The commission said it agreed to take part in the one-day hearing, scheduled for 11 A.M. Tuesday at a community center in Jamesport, at the request of Representative Michael P. Forbes, Republican of Quogue.
"Congressman Forbes asked us to come to a hearing that he is holding to discuss the restart process for Millstone Three," said Diane Screnci, a commission spokeswoman. "We will certainly listen to any new information."
The regulators are likely to hear much from groups and officials in the part of Long Island where challenges to nuclear power technology are strongest, and where exposure to radionuclides from the Millstone station and from Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton is greatest.
They will say that the Connecticut facility is a major threat to Long Island, holds the potential for calamity, has a long history of safety problems and may be causing higher cancer rates in Suffolk County.
Mr. Forbes said he had arranged the meeting because "the proximity of Long Island to the Millstone facility warrants that Long Islanders have an opportunity to weigh in with any concerns they have."
One town, East Hampton, has approved a resolution opposing reopening of any of the three reactors at the Millstone station, all of which are closed.
"The close proximity of active nuclear reactors poses a health and safety threat to the Town of East Hampton from both the risk of increased cancer rate due to radioactive pollution and the potential for catastrophic nuclear meltdown," said the resolution the town board enacted last month.
Local groups are also demanding that the Millstone Three reactor, one of three at the site owned and operated by Northeast Utilities, remain closed until there is an approved evacuation plan for eastern Long Island.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has said that none of the reactors will be permitted to reopen until safety and management problems have been corrected. The reactors, with a combined capacity of 2,700 megawatts, have been shut for two years.
Northeast Utilities has said it faces bankruptcy if the Millstone Three unit, the newest and largest of the three reactors, is not opened soon. The commission is expected to rule next month.
The commission ordered the plants closed after finding that management was ignoring safety issues raised by employees. The commission ordered a change incorporate culture that would encourage employees to raise safety issues without fear of invoking management displeasure.
For years, the Millstone station has been notable for the large number of former and current employees who have spoken publicly about safety problems at the plant. Some of the employees point to problems in emergency systems they said increased the risks of serious accidents.
"Our biggest concerns are the implications of an accident at the Millstone plant and the lack of any evacuation plan for Long Island," said Scott Cullen, the legal consultant for Standing For Truth About Radiation, an East Hampton antinuclear group.
"The problem is that Millstone happens to be closest to eastern Long Island, and if at the time of an accident the wind is blowing this way the chance of people getting out is non-existent," he said.
Current Federal regulations require approved evacuation plans for a 10-mile radius of a commercial reactor. About 185,000 people live within 10 miles of the Millstone station, according to Nuclear Regulatory Commission figures. Nearly all are Connecticut residents.
The 10-mile evacuation zone includes a portion of Fishers Island, a resort community with a year-round population of about 750 that is part of the Town of Southold. Fishers Island is the only area of New York State within the evacuation zone.
David Fischler, the commissioner of Fire Rescue and Emergency Services for Suffolk County, said the current Federal emergency plan for the Millstone power station called for moving residents in the area of Fishers Island within the 10-mile zone to areas of the island outside the zone.
Mr. Fischler said there were also plans for evacuation by boat if it were necessary. No other part of the county was covered by the plan, he said.
In November, 1982, the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations released calculations of deaths, injuries and property damage that would be caused in worst-case reactor accidents involving core meltdowns resulting in massive release of radiation.
The calculations, based on studies performed by Sandia National Laboratory for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, estimated that most fatalities would occur within 20 miles of a reactor, while injuries resulting from exposure to radioactivity would extend up to 65 miles form the plant.
For Millstone Unit Three, which was under construction in 1982 but still four years from operating, the subcommittee calculated that 23,000 people would die from radiation exposure within a year. Injuries within one year that required treatment, including temporary sterility, cataracts, vomiting or thyroid nodules, would reach 30,000, and 38,000 cancers deaths would occur over the lifetime of the exposed population.
According to the calculations, the economic impact, in 1980 dollars, would be $174 billion.
Calculations if a similar accident occurred at Millstone Unit Two, an 895-megawatt reactor opened in 1975, estimated 18,000 deaths within a year, 18,000 injuries, 23,000 eventual cancer deaths and $135 billion in economic damage. The figures for Millstone Unit One, a 652-megawatt reactor opened in 1971, were calculated as 13,000 deaths within a year, 12,000 injuries, 28,000 eventual cancer deaths and an economic impact of $91.5 billion.
Some nuclear power plant critics have said that deaths, injuries and property damage caused by a catastrophic reactor accident would actually be far greater.
Mr. Forbes said he "leaned toward insisting that there be an emergency plan that is sensitive to Long Island." One option for Mr. Forbes would be to request a delay in the commission decision on reopening the Millstone Three plant pending such a plan.
The government calculations are based on prevailing wind patterns and assume a total collapse of reactor emergency systems designed to prevent a core meltdown. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has said the likelihood of such accidents is extremely remote.
"In their entire operating life," said Jacque Durr, chief of the inspection branch of a special projects office for the commission reviewing the Millstone station, "the three plants have experienced no accident or incident that would have impacted Long Island or had any known effect there.There have been releases, but they did not threaten the health and safety of the public."
But Dr. Jay M. Gould, an East Hampton resident who is a critic of nuclear power, said commission figures showed that a 1975 release from the Millstone station "was as great as the release reported in 1979 from Three Mile Island."
"It was enormous," Dr. Gould said. "It just wasn't publicized."
Dr. Gould, who plans to speak at the hearing, said his analysis of National Cancer Institute statistics showed that breast cancer mortality rates, adjusted for age, had increased by 40 percent in Suffolk County since 1950, the largest increase for any large county. He said rates were also abnormally high in areas of Connecticut near the Millstone station.
"This is simply evidence that has to be explored," Dr. Gould said. "It can't be due to chance."
Long Island breast cancer groups have also raised questions about whether years of low level releases from the Millstone station could be a risk.
"There are clearly emissions and there is a lot of research that shows low level ionizing radiation affects breast cancer rates," said Dr. Minna Barrett, a science adviser for the Long Island Breast Cancer Action Coalition and an associate professor of psychology at the State University of New York at Old Westbury.
Gerald Reardon, a nuclear safety engineer at the Millstone station who has spoken publicly about safety problems, said resident of Long Island had reason to be concerned.
"It is certainly possible to have a severe accident, and Long Island is kind of a trapped audience," said Mr. Reardon. "If the wind is blowing toward them, they can come down to the shore and watch the cloud come. Radionuclides are not going to stop at the 10-mile limit.
"For the government to imply that a serious accident can't happen is ridiculous. I've been in the nuclear power business for 26 years, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is public enemy no. 1. Its sole purpose is to promote nuclear power and anything they tell you to the contrary is a bunch of baloney."
Donald W. Del Core Sr. a former instrumentation and control specialists at the Millstone station and now a member of a group opposed to the reactors. said: "People on Long Island have a reasonable reason to be concerned about the restart of Millstone and they should do what they have to do to get the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's attention.
"I am not going to be the guy to say there is going to be an accident. But Millstone Three is not ready to restart."
There was limited opposition in Connecticut to the opening of the three Millstone reactors.
On Long Island, opposition to the now defunct Shoreham nuclear plant reflected a widely-held view by Long Island residents and elected officials led by Governor Mario M. Cuomo that no safe evacuation would be possible for residents living within 10 miles of the plant in the event of a serious accident.
During the mid 1980's, as the Millstone Three reactor glided toward licensing with none of the controversy aroused on Long Island by the Shoreham reactor, the refusal of Suffolk County and New York State to participate in a required drill of emergency evacuation plans was a major stumbling block to plant licensing.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission eventually ruled that state and local authorities would cooperate in a real emergency, despite their refusal to take part in drills. The commission then approved an emergency plan prepared by the Long Island Lighting Company after a drill in which state and local cooperation was simulated.
But by 1989, when the commission licensed the Shoreham plant, its owner, the Long Island Lighting Company, had agreed never to operate it in exchange for guarantees it could recover all prudently incurred costs and interest for the $5.5 billion plant project.

HEADLINE: Just Why Do We Buy?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The assumption that aluminum siding is a "practical" purchase that adds value to a residence is highly questionable. Covering a house with synthetic siding alters the proportions and changes its character. Many buyers reject the cold, artificial look and find loss of historic design, materials and workmanship unacceptable. 
 When siding is laid over traditional clapboards and shingles, other problems can emerge. Homeowners may have trouble finding leaks or rot, and aluminum can dent and get dirty; it is not really maintenance-free. In short, buyers have plenty of reasons for not re-siding their houses other than identifying with the rich.

HEADLINE: The View From/Hartford;
Where Produce From Afar Gets Serious Attention

BYLINE: By STACEY STOWE 

 BODY:
THE sky is still flecked with stars as Eleanore Rhodes and her dog comb the farmers' stalls at the state's Regional Market in Hartford in search of day lily and mock orange plants.
It is just past 5 A.M., but the violet light rising behind the capital city's skyline promises sunshine. Ms. Rhodes, who lives in Vernon, is one of hundreds of gardeners and cooks who hunt and gather at the vast expanse of asphalt that sits on Reserve Road between Interstate 91 and an industrial park. "I'm very fond of day lilies," said Ms. Rhodes, who, buttoned into a long raincoat with a kerchief tied under her chin, and dog at her heels, would not be out of place in the English countryside. She continued: "The prices are good. You get to know the dealers." 
 For Peter Smith, who also lives in Vernon, fresh eggs, creamy white and pale brown, stacked in paper crates by Calvo Farms, draw him. "I'm from Jamaica," Mr. Smith said. "This is more like home."
Although the Regional Market is open seven days a week year-round, Saturday is always the busiest. In the fall, it's chrysanthemums and pumpkins and in winter, fir trees and chestnuts that lure people out of warm beds in search of bargains and varieties not found elsewhere. But it is in spring that the market swells with people pushing carts laden with plants and shrubs.
The Connecticut Marketing Authority owns and manages the market, which has been in operation since 1952. The largest food distribution terminal between New York and Boston, the market's estimated revenue in 1998 is about $822,000, said Dawn Cassada, the interim executive director for the Connecticut Marketing Authority. The 32-acre site can house up to 144 open-air stalls and 16 wholesale businesses.
Several years ago, most of the big supermarket chains that used to buy from some of the wholesalers began shipping produce directly to the stores from their own warehouses, said George Gotay, a wholesaler.
"Business is not good," he said, despite the crowd of people shopping in his warehouse store. Gotay Tropical Fruit, a Hispanic and West Indian food importer and distributor, is a hub of activity in the warehouse. A transistor radio blaring Spanish music competes with the razor saw of a meat slicer and the voices of customers.
The Gotay store symbolizes the two worlds at the Regional Market. In the parking lot below the warehouse, where Jeeps and station wagons are packed with shrubs and flowers, the shoppers are largely white and English-speaking. But in the cavernous warehouses that border two sides of the open air stalls, nearly the only English spoken is by workers calling out "$2 a box, $2 a box."
In this part of the market, a steady stream of people whisk through the narrow channels between the boxes of produce. A watermelon is hacked open to display its pink flesh. Oranges sliced in two wobble atop a cardboard carte. In addition to the shoppers, the workers -- a few appearing to be well past normal retirement age -- sling net bags of vegetables over their shoulders or push hand trucks of food through the warehouse. A few well-worn vans are loaded with produce for small, local markets.
Two women, in traditional Muslim chador inspected cardboard boxes of vegetables. Men and women from Poland lugged 20-pound sacks of potatoes. A man who was born and raised in the Calabria region of Italy scooped handfuls of mixed greens from a box in a dark corner of the warehouse; earlier, at the open market stalls, he had been in search of rabbits and chickens.
Cecelia Leois of Hartford waited with her two daughters for a bag of beef oxtails that she was planning to braise with lima beans. Jesus Aaeulo and his 6-year-old son shop at the market every Saturday, especially for Spanish cheese.
Marisa Guererra, who moved to the United States three years ago from Italy, compared citrus fruit with the two friends shopping with her. Every Saturday at 6 A.M. finds her in the warehouses. "During Christmas, I come for the chestnuts," she said, before closing her eyes in delighted remembrance of a favorite food. "Now it's anise, fresh fruit."
In addition to retail space, the wholesalers may lease backrooms to store fruit and vegetables in temperate settings. There is the "wet room," an aptly named cold and clammy space for an assortment of green vegetables. In other rooms, crates of tomatoes and bananas are stacked, their respective red and yellow colors coaxed by a pungent gas.
In the parking lot below, the farmers' spaces ranged from a makeshift table of wooden sawhorses and plywood that displayed a few flats of pansies to a forest of flowering and evergreen shrubs and potted plants. The spaces' prices range from $316 for a full year to $9 a weekday to display the trunk contents of a sedan. The farmers tend to arrive around 4 A.M. to set up their displays.
The farmers roll burlap-wrapped, seven-foot evergreens down ramps, their breath visible in the dawn air. The smell of fried eggs and bacon wafts over the trucks as it emanates from John Anthony's Market Restaurant, the diner next door where the breakfast special is $1.99.
Most of the market's farmers can remember when business was better, when as Jim Kenney, who owns the Tree Smith in Montville, said, "You'd come out here and sell everything you had in a few hours."
The selling spree diminished when the economy turned down and Home Depot moved in. The super-sized hardware store was repeatedly invoked by may of the farmers who cite it as their main competition.
Bill Discenza, who with his brother owns Meadow Springs, a farm in Wethersfield, said he hoped business would pick up as the weather grew warmer. His 14-year-old son Nicholas, who said he "likes to sell stuff" at the market, stood with him amid a crowd of tall shrubs. "Anyway, if you lay in bed, you don't make any money," the senior Discenza said.
There were dozens of pots of perennials in Hendrik Clark's stall. They sold for $5 each, or five for $20, and business was steady. Mr. Clark, who owns Clark's Greenhouses in Salem, ticked off the names of the plants, many of which were not yet in flower. His customers approached, lists in hand, seeking specific varieties and detailed answers about plant care.
"You've got to keep talking," he said. "They want to hear about the plants." His first sale was at 4:30 that morning.
For Carol McGeehan, the trip to the Regional Market with her daughter Lisa Turgenon and 5-year-old granddaughter Allie, is a treasured, thrice yearly event.
"I'm going to look around some more," Mrs. McGeehan told her daughter. "You wouldn't want to buy right away and then see the plant of your dreams." The Newport, R.I. resident said she shops at the market because the prices and selections are better than at greenhouses near her home. "We make it a treat, a rite of spring," she said. "Allie likes to garden."
The child, perched in a red wagon and wrapped in a blanket, smiled before she clambered out to look at the plants, in perfect imitation of her mother and grandmother.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: A Second Excelsior for Hackensack;
267 Rentals on a Ridge With Manhattan Views

 BODY:
A 267-unit rental apartment building, almost a twin to one completed next door in 1990, is rising at 170 Prospect Avenue in Hackensack, N.J., set on a ridge facing Manhattan.
The new 18-story brick tower, called Excelsior II -- the adjacent building is Excelsior I -- will have studio to three-bedroom apartments, plus penthouses. Most have balconies with views of the Manhattan skyline. 
 The buildings, set on a 5.7-acre site, are being linked by a 10,000-square-foot structure that will house a health club with swimming pool, community room and a 163-seat restaurant that will offer take-out as well as room service to tenants. There will also be boutiques and shops, including a hair salon, professional office, a concierge, a 567-car underground garage and valet parking in a building with high-tech wiring.
"Excelsior II is being designed as an apartment complex with the amenities of a hotel ," said Anthony R. Palmeri, president of Sebring Associates of Hackensack, the developer. The project, estimated to cost more than $30 million, is scheduled for completion in the fall.
The rental towers are a bit of an anomaly. They sit along a four-block stretch of Prospect Avenue where many of Hackensack's high-rise condominiums and co-ops stand.
But Mr. Palmeri said the need and demand for rental housing that led his company to build the first tower, which is fully occupied, still exists today. He said the housing recession and savings-and-loan debacle of the 80's caused the delay in construction of the second building.
Monthly rents in Excelsior II, which rise in relation to views, will range from $1,025 to $2,950 for the 640- to 1,761-square-foot apartments, with 9-foot ceilings and marble baths. The penthouses, with 1,270 to 2,555 square feet of space, will rent for $2,450 to $5,300 a month. The cost of membership in the health club, which will be open to the public, has not yet been determined. Initial occupancy is expected in October, said Mr. Palmeri.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
Suddenly, for Legislators, The Living Is a Little Easier

BYLINE: By Jennifer Preston; Jennifer Preston is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
When the New Jersey Legislature gave final approval last week to a bill that promises to lower auto insurance rates, it seemed as if lawmakers heaved a collective sigh of relief.
Ever since voters expressed their unhappiness last fall over paying the nation's highest rates, fixing the state's automobile insurance system has dominated the legislative debate and Governor Whitman's agenda. 
 So what will lawmakers and Governor talk about now?
The budget. Education. Gasoline taxes. Transportation. Solid waste. Energy deregulation.
"The priority right now has to be the budget," said Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, a Republican from Salem County.
Don't expect much controversy here. With the Wall Street boom and the economy pouring extra tax dollars into the state's coffers, there are no big budget cuts planned. The biggest challenge for lawmakers will be trying to figure out how not to spend it all.
What will make the budget process even smoother is the long-awaited decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court on school financing. The Whitman administration and legislators had been braced for a decision that would have forced them to find more than $312 million more a year for programs for the state's poorest school districts, including full-day preschool programs for children aged 3 and 4.
That is what a court-appointed judge had recommended. But on Thursday the state's highest court rejected most of the judge's recommendations, finding that the Whitman administration was on the right track with its approach. The state Department of Education promises to implement a new program called Success for All, in urban elementary schools, along with full-day kindergarten, and half-day preschool for 4-year-olds. The money for this has already been budgeted.
Then there is the Governor's proposal to raise the gasoline tax by seven cents a gallon, which is likely to cost the average motorist about $35 a year. Mrs. Whitman said last week that she wanted the tax increase to help preserve a million acres of open space, as well as pay for transportation projects.
The Governor's plan, however, is expected to run into opposition from some powerful lawmakers. Mrs. Whitman wants a gas tax to help provide a steady stream of revenue to purchase open space rather than continue relying on bond referendums, like the Green Acres program.
In the first sign of an impending battle, State Senator Robert Littell, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, introduced a bill calling for a voter referendum this fall on whether to continue the Green Acres program. And 30 members have signed on to the bill, indicating that Mrs. Whitman might have trouble getting the gas tax for open space preservation approved.
Another potentially contentious issue facing the Legislature and the Governor is how to help bail out county governments, which are $1.6 billion in debt because of a United States Supreme Court decision last year about where trash haulers can take their garbage.
Until the court ruling, trash haulers were required to dump the refuse into county-designated facilities, prompting several county governments to borrow a lot of money to expand landfills and build incinerators. Now, since the court ruled that haulers can take their trash anywhere they want, many county governments do not have enough trash coming into these facilities to pay off the debt service.
This is not an issue that is likely to rivet the public's attention, but it could end up adding to the tax burden. The question is, whose tax bill?
Two legislators have proposed creating a new statewide tax on the gross revenues of garbage haulers to repay the debt. The Whitman administration has proposed allowing each county to impose a garbage tax on municipalities to reduce the debt -- a plan that critics say will do nothing more than drive up property taxes.
Also on the agenda is energy deregulation. Whatever action the Legislature and the Whitman administration take to restructure the utility industry in New Jersey will determine how much consumers pay for gas and electric service.
What about property taxes? After auto insurance, voters cited the state's high property taxes as their biggest concern in poll after poll during last fall's gubernatorial campaign.
So far, Mrs. Whitman has not proposed any sweeping changes, although she has created a commission that is supposed to be searching for possible solutions.
But don't expect any dramatic reductions in property tax rates anytime soon. Why? The biggest portion of a homeowner's property tax bill is the cost of education. One way to wring savings out of the public school system is to merge school districts. But giving up local control in the state's more than 500 districts has not proved to be a politically popular option in the past.
Another approach would be to replace property tax revenue with a statewide tax increase, such as the personal income tax. But it is unlikely that Mrs. Whitman, whose national reputation was made cutting state income taxes in her first term, would consider raising them in her second.

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
The Old College Try

BYLINE: By MARCIA BIEDERMAN 

 BODY:
A FEW years ago, some of the city's university clubs tried to shake their stuffy images and rebuild their membership rolls by changing their menus, adding sleek new gym equipment and organizing trips to SoHo. Now some clubs for graduates of elite universities, like Yale, Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania and Williams College, are doing something else to increase membership. Opening their doors wider, they have been bringing in alumni of other colleges, including some less prestigious ones.
The Penn Club, which opened in 1994 in a Beaux-Arts building on West 44th Street that was renovated at a cost of $25 million, initially restricted membership to people who attended the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League member. More than 10,000 enrolled soon after the opening, but since then, the rolls have declined to 6,507. 
 So the club is now offering membership to alumni of eight non-Ivy institutions, including Gettysburg and Bucknell Colleges and the University of Richmond, as well as ones with more cachet, like the University of Chicago and Haverford, Swarthmore and Bryn Mawr Colleges.
"We had room on our membership roster," said Peter M. Homberg, the club's general manager. "We're looking to support our food and beverage operations and the programs that go on."
Last year, the Williams Club on East 39th Street began accepting alumni of the University of Connecticut, the latest in a list of its more than three dozen affiliates, including Seton Hall, Rutgers and the State University of New York at Albany.
"It's the old story," said J. Roger Friedman, an honorary board member and past president of the Williams Club. "Your money is as good as my money." He added, "I think there was always that feeling that these schools weren't as good as Williams in academic standards." But, he said, "economics was the big driver."
Michael Smith, the manager, said Williams alumni account for 68 percent of membership, which is now 5,000, compared with 3,500 in 1993. "Williams is not a huge school," he said. "Given that we're in the city and it's a large building, we would like to have more traffic."
Like most older university clubs, the Yale Club, on Vanderbilt Avenue, has for years let some people who went elsewhere become members. It gave the Dartmouth Club a home after it closed in the early 70's, and since the 40's has accepted Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity members. But a couple of years ago, the Yale Club began taking University of Virginia graduates. So far, 550 have joined.
The Princeton Club, on West 43d Street, has also extended its reach. The club, which took in fellow Ivy alumni from Columbia for a time after the Columbia Club was sold in 1973, now accepts people who attended Fordham University, Washington University in St. Louis and the College of William and Mary. Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni are also permitted to join.
Though the clubs are awash in emblems and color schemes suggesting exclusive ties to the alma mater, only the Harvard Club restricts membership to those with Harvard links. "I'm sure there are many people from other schools who would be desirable club members," the president of the Harvard Club, Peter S. Heller, said. But he added, "We are a Harvard Club."
Mr. Friedman of the Williams Club said, "Harvard just has more money than the rest of us poor cousins."
For most clubs, accepting alumni of other universities as members has become "an economic reality," said Thomas Inglis, general manager of the Cornell Club. That club also admits other alumni, including those from Colgate College and Tulane University.
University clubs saw revenues drop several years ago as membership dropped during the recession. Since then, the improved economy has helped the clubs' bar, restaurant and banquet businesses. "Club food is no longer a joke, which it once was," said Ara Daglian, executive secretary of the Club Managers of the City of New York. The Harvard Club even has a sushi bar.
But the clubs have had to spend money to become more cutting edge, as Mr. Homberg of the Penn Club put it. And because dues are typically pegged to where members live, with city residents paying the most, it is New Yorkers who are prized as members, even if they went to another school. "We have many, many nonresident members, and they're infrequent users at best," Mr. Homberg said. "We seek to build our local base. That's where the affiliates come in."
Affiliation typically begins with an overture from an alumni association, though sometimes club board members suggest another school to which they have ties. But while affiliations are a way to expand membership, some clubs have their limits. The Yale Club will accept no more than 1,000 members from Dartmouth and 1,000 from the University of Virginia.
Meanwhile, the Columbia Alumni Federation, which has been at the Williams Club since 1990, is planning to go Ivy again. It has been negotiating a contract with the Princeton Club. "It's a better location with better facilities, and we're very excited about the possibility of sharing a club with another Ivy League institution," Virgil Renzulli, a spokesman for Columbia University, said.
But Mr. Smith, the manager of the Williams Club, where Columbia graduates comprise 15 to 20 percent of the membership, said many Columbia people have told him they plan to stay put.

Dues at university clubs vary, with recent graduates and people who live outside the city generally paying less. Here are typical annual dues for members who live in New York, and the number of members each club says it has:
 
Cornell Club
$800
6,100 members
 
Harvard Club
$985
10,093 members
 
Penn Club

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Lotus Esprit V8;
Nimble, Exotic and Out of Date

BYLINE: By DAN NEIL 

DATELINE: HETHEL, England

 BODY:
THE test track behind Lotus Group's headquarters once was an airstrip used by the Allies in World War II. Jimmy Stewart flew bombing missions over Germany in B-24's based here.
On a crumbling patch of asphalt where Colonel Stewart's Liberator might have set down, the green Lotus Esprit V8 arcs onto the main straightaway at 120 miles an hour, there to be slapped by a 40-mile-an-hour cross wind. A dab of countersteering wiggles the car back into line. At about 3,000 pounds, the midengine, fiberglass Esprit is light and nimble for its size. It's rakish and exotic, shaped like an ax head.
The Lotus Esprit was developed on this track 25 years ago and remains among the world's best-handling grand touring cars. It is one of the fastest cars on the American market, too, with a top speed of 178 m.p.h., and one of the most exclusive, with about 125 sold annually.
Despite the recent addition of the 350-horsepower V8 -- a bid to appeal to American tastes -- and a major interior makeover, the Esprit is dated. Sales are stagnant. The single model cannot support Lotus Cars USA much longer, the chief executive of Lotus's American arm, Arnie Johnson, said in an telephone interview. "We need a replacement for the Esprit," he added. "But it will probably be 2002 before we see it."
Can Lotus stay in the United States until then? "Not easily," Mr. Johnson responded. "We need the Elise -- soon."
The Elise is Lotus's newest car: a midengine, radically styled roadster stripped to a minimalist sheen. "It's the hottest-selling product in the last 20 years, and we don't have it," Mr. Johnson said ruefully.
But Lotus was caught flat-footed with the Elise. Between emission and safety requirements, it would cost as much to certify the car for the American market as it did to develop it -- about $7.5 million.
Meanwhile, after a succession of financially plagued owners, including General Motors -- which owned the company from 1985 to 1992 -- Lotus finds itself in the hands of the Malaysian multinational DRB Hicom, just as Asia's economy has hit the shoals.
And so, 50 years after Colin Chapman, the legendary racing engineer and Lotus founder, rolled his first car out of a garage in Hornsey near London, Lotus finds itself whipsawed by exceptionally good and bad fortune. It's full of clever ideas (the engineering side of the company conducts a $75 million consulting business) and truly guileless product planning, yet there is a cloud of financial calamity. For Lotus, it is business as usual.
"Finances were always dodgy at Lotus," said Clive Chapman, Colin's son. "It was never entirely clear that we would stay in business." The son stood in a garage surrounded by spare parts and detritus from his father's racing career, including a broken trophy from the French Grand Prix.
Colin Chapman quickly went from piecing together race cars from old parts to winning Formula One races, leaving behind a series of technical innovations that virtually defined the modern race car. Lotus won seven Formula One world championships, the last coming 20 years ago.
Colin Chapman died in 1982, and the family left racing altogether in the early 1990's. Clive Chapman's business, Classic Team Lotus, makes money restoring the old race cars and selling off memorabilia and spare parts, which might strike some as a rather bleak end to a glorious racing tradition. What would his father think? "He would like the fact that we are breaking even," Clive Chapman said.
Lotus developed a car-building creed wherein weight and complication were the enemy. Simple, light and cheap were commutative terms in the Chapman equation.
"Chapman believed it was all about power-to-weight ratio," said Peter C. Brand, who has worked for Lotus nearly 40 years. "His ideal racing car was the one that fell apart just as it crossed the finish line."
Much the same could be said of Lotus's production cars of the 1950's and 60's, including the Elite and the classic Elan. These were anorexic cars, thin and delicate. But because of their lightness, they offered stupendous performance. They were beautiful almost as an afterthought.
In the early 70's, anxious to lift profits, Colin Chapman steered Lotus to build big, wedge-shaped grand touring cars like the Eclat and Excel. Though these cars were a real eyeful, they were maintenance nightmares, prone to failures such as weeping windshields or rear suspensions that crashed through the fiberglass body work.
The Esprit, which had its debut in 1975, was the last road car that Colin Chapman had a hand in. Even today, in the Esprit's graces and faults, you can tell a lot about both the founder and his company. For example, how tall he was; the cockpit is pitifully short on leg room and foot room because car interiors were designed to fit Colin Chapman -- a man of below-average height.
As with all the razor-edged, midengine exotic cars of that era, the Esprit suffers from packaging problems. The visibility is very poor to the sides and rear. Engine noise swamps cockpit conversation. And the fiberglass tub chassis hums and vibrates against its steel spine.
The legacy of G.M.'s ownership can still be seen through the Esprit. The air bag-equipped steering wheel is the same as a Pontiac Firebird's, the steering rack is Saab's and the door handles are Opel's.
Despite a base price of $84,920, the Persian-bazaar style of buying parts -- also a Lotus tradition -- always made the Esprit feel as if it had been cobbled from cheap components. The new dashboard assembly, an integrated cluster of vital necessities under a tidy binnacle, goes a long way toward banishing the low-rent feel. "It's not just an old car we keep tarting up," said Simon Wood, Lotus's director of operations.
The 3.5-liter, all-aluminum V8 makes the Esprit a formidable street fighter once again. Zero to 100 m.p.h. goes by in a jaw-dropping 10.5 seconds, as quick as a Ferrari 550. When the dual turbo-chargers spool up, the engine sends the car spurting into three-digit range with a snarl.
Getting the most from this engine, though, requires mastery of the Esprit's double-plate clutch, with its quick and unprogressive bite, and the ornery five gears in the manual transmission, bought from Renault.
But you can't judge the Esprit -- or any Lotus -- on things like comfort and convenience, of which it has little, or vibration and noise, which it has in abundance. Its true measure comes when you make for a sweeping corner. It is pure driving pleasure.
Lotus is now majority-owned by DRB Hicom. These days, every decision is submitted to the unsmiling rigor of the "business case" scenario, a far cry from the days when Colin Chapman imperiously ordered new products without consulting anyone, least of all his accountant.
But the management of the company is, in truth, in better hands now. And history has vindicated the Chapman ideals: Lighter is better, more fuel efficient, more recyclable and more fun to drive. After 50 years, said John Miles, a former Lotus Formula One driver, "all of Colin Chapman's traditions are being maintained."
 
INSIDE TRACK: A gutsy V8 engine and lots of Esprit de corps.

HEADLINE: How the Glitz Stole Greenwich

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
DAVID OGILVY, son of the founder of Ogilvy & Mather, the global advertising giant, sat in his real estate company's white clapboard headquarters in Greenwich, Conn., on a scorching afternoon last week.
"How has Greenwich changed in two decades?" he was asked. Mr. Ogilvy, who has lived in this bucolic suburb of New York since he was 5 (almost 50 years), adjusted his tie (Hermes, patterned with gold chains), stared wearily out at the traffic clogging Arch Street and drew a hand across his brow. "In the 1970's, the status car to have in your driveway was a wood-paneled station wagon," he mused. "In the 1980's, it was a Porsche. And now, the status car to have in your driveway is a green Dumpster." 
 A visitor could easily conclude that there is a green Dumpster in the driveway of almost every other house in Greenwich these days, from the relatively tiny one-acre plots of Belle Haven to the four-acre parcels in what's called "back country," the exclusive area north of the Merritt Parkway. The Greenwich construction market is thriving, with half a dozen local companies vying to remodel or erect their share of the scores of multimillion-dollar houses going up each year. Even in a town where last year's average price of a single-family house was $1.1 million, many people are buying once-acceptable houses as teardowns, erecting custom-built mansions in their place.
The mom-and-pop emporiums that once lined Greenwich Avenue are yielding to aggressively marketed national stores like Banana Republic, Baccarat and Tiffany; there's even a Saks Fifth Avenue.
Some longtime residents like to observe that you can stand in the same spot in Saks where you used to buy a $1.25 hamburger -- when it was still Woolworth's, that is -- and see only one item for sale of hamburger size: a four-figure jeweled evening purse by Judith Leiber.
An exclusive enclave of the well-to-do, Greenwich has long been known for its reserved, almost chilly Yankee politesse and enormous wealth. George Bush grew up there. The Social Register is often as useful as the local phone directory for frequently called numbers. But as the generations shift and young couples move from the canyons of Park Avenue to spend their Wall Street bonuses on $3 million houses, Greenwich has picked up some big-city ways.
Tim Dumas, a Greenwich-born- and-bred author, sees conflict between the old-money community -- the families who have lived in Greenwich for generations (some since the town was founded, in 1624) with names like Finch, Mead and Auchincloss -- the young wealthy families with their newer, ostentatious style.
"There's a huge difference in style," Mr. Dumas said. "The old WASP's tend to be down-to-earth and not showy at all. They're the kind of people who will repair their button-down sweater when they get a hole in the elbow. The new money is much more aggressive, much flashier. The old WASP guard didn't seem to care as much about having a manicured lawn, either, or a triple-mint house. Today, you see these lawns that are almost carpet-neat. There's almost a fear of wildflowers, of anything messy -- of anything, in fact, straying beyond its borders."
In March, the tension between old and new erupted when Peter K. Joyce, the chairman of Greenwich's planning and zoning commission, long a champion of construction restraint, was not reappointed to his position by the town's leaders. Hundreds of slow-growth residents reacted loudly and negatively with letters to the local papers, a petition and a telephone campaign.
"It was the pro-development people versus the keep-Greenwich-Greenwich people," said Stephanie Sanchez, a town selectwoman. "You know, there's this trend for people to build huge houses, and huge walls. It's disturbing. It's as if they don't want to do any landscaping but devote all their energy to these enormous interior spaces."
Evan L. Goldenberg, an architect and interior designer who has built a prosperous business out of installing wine cellars in those grand Greenwich interiors, said he had never seen a housing market like this one.
"They're dropping million-dollar houses out of the sky," he said.
Mr. Goldenberg has built almost 100 wine cellars in town in the last five years, at $50,000 to $150,000 apiece. He said his clients are mostly in their 30's and their houses are about $2.2 million. His latest client, age 34, paid for his $3 million house in cash with his Wall Street bonus.
Greenwich Avenue is fairly crackling with Rodeo Drive-like excitement. Ron Howard lives in town, and so does Mel Gibson. It's not rare to see them shopping the avenue with the other celebrities who live there. Montel Williams just moved into the gated community of Conyers Farm, a 1,474-acre farm that Peter Brant, the art collector and a co-owner of Interview magazine (and a Greenwich resident), bought in 1981 for $18 million, then subdivided. Now, a four-acre lot, zoned for a single family, can go for $10 million. Ivana Trump just sold her house in gated Indian Harbor for $15 million, in an all-cash deal. Bobby Bonilla just bought a house in Greenwich and will probably stay, Mr. Ogilvy said, although he was just traded to the Dodgers.
Why? "Because Greenwich is that good," Mr. Ogilvy said.
"There have always been young families in Greenwich," he continued, adding that in the 60's, they were the parents of the baby boomers, and their chief extravagance was cars. Now, the symbols of affluence are room-size humidors for 5,000 cigars, custom home gyms and computer rooms rigged for high-speed modems.
Jeanne B. Daniel, Saks Fifth Avenue's executive vice president for merchandising, said the change in the Greenwich consumer over the last 10 years was the reason the company decided to make the Greenwich branch its first "Main Street" store, a boutique-like Saks that caters to local markets. The Greenwich customer is "in her late 20's to early 30's," Ms. Daniel said. "She may have just moved out of Manhattan to start a family with her husband, who is probably an investment banker, and she is very, very concerned with fashion."
You can walk into Saks and pick up a Prada coat in cotton with plastic beading for $6,000, or a ranch-mink fur coat off the rack for $85,000. Kimberley Ryan -- a Vogue editor who owns a house in Greenwich with her husband, Nigel Ekern, a lawyer -- has noted the shifting tastes of Greenwich women. "You still see women in Lacoste shirts and khakis, that very preppy look," Ms. Ryan said. "But more often now, you see women who dress. They look really chic. A lot of that has to do with the new stores. You walk down Greenwich Avenue, and you're not sure if you're in SoHo or you're in Greenwich."
Schools in Greenwich, as in most well-to-do New York suburbs, are overflowing. And not just the town's highly regarded public schools. Brunswick Academy, a private boys' school, turned away 97 percent of its applicants for kindergarten through fifth grade last year, said Duncan Edwards, the headmaster.
"You can look at the mansions and the flashy cars and the new houses going up and the transformation of Greenwich Avenue, and those are all things we lament a little," Mr. Edwards added. "But there are good things that come with the bad. Parents do care about the schools. They will work hard for us."
The annual May auctions at Brunswick and its sister school, Greenwich Academy, are a signal example of that hard work. Greenwich Academy's auction last year for its scholarship fund raised more than $500,000. Parents donated items like a week at their vacation homes in St. Bart's or Aspen, Patsy Howard, the headmistress, said, adding that last year a parent bid $20,000 so that his child could have a walk-on role in a television show.
"I guess he really wanted to get his kid on the show," she said. She also pointed out that part of the applications glut is not that there are necessarily more families, but that families are having more children.
With all the wealth pouring into the community, however, many say that Greenwich has driven out the middle class. Mr. Dumas, the author of "Greentown: Murder and Mystery in Greenwich, America's Wealthiest Community," about the unsolved 1975 murder of a Greenwich High School student, spent his first 32 years in town. But he can no longer afford to live there and has moved to nearby Stamford.
"There are BMW's in front of the houses where you used to see Chevettes," he said. "These are the houses of junior executives now, and they used to be the houses of manual laborers. People care that much about a Greenwich address. It's ridiculous."
Joyce McKenzie, a bookkeeper who lives in one of Greenwich's three Government-subsidized, low-income housing developments, agreed. "The town has alienated the middle class," she said. "They've closed themselves up."
Old-guard Greenwich may be a little baffled by all the new construction, the glut of Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicles and the high-gloss opulence of Greenwich Avenue. One woman in her 60's, whose family has lived in Greenwich since the 19th century, watched the afternoon sun angling through the trees at the Round Hill golf club, a bastion of the old guard, and reflected on the town's changes.
"Some of these new houses are really in poor taste," she said, "and some of them aren't so bad. But things do feel a little out of control. People are buying and building on swampland. It's amazing to think that this is a place where the children of millionaires can grow up feeling poor."
She added: "But I do love it here. It is beautiful. It can be serene."
On a recent scorching, decidedly un-serene Tuesday afternoon, scenes from Greenwich life played on. Police officers redirected traffic past the gaping hole at the bottom of Greenwich Avenue, where one of the main sewage pipes had burst a week earlier. Grocery clerks who live in the Bronx and commute to Greenwich every day unloaded vegetables from the back of a truck outside Greenwich Produce. Laura Buckley, 33, a mother of two, whose husband works at Lazard Freres, was walking her daughter (who was wearing a pink tutu and wire butterfly wings) on a blue child's leash and marveling at the hundreds of people lined up along Greenwich Avenue to buy Powerball tickets.
Mr. Dumas surveyed the scene. "What's happening now is very much what happened in the 20's and 30's" he said. "There's this profusion of mansion-building by New York City moneymakers and this almost hysterical prosperity. But it's a cycle. It will turn around again. Because by the 1950's and 60's, those mansions were crumbling."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SOHO/TRIBECA;
A Six-Screen Plan Goes Dark

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
It has been a bone of contention for nearly two years, ever since it was proposed. But a plan to erect a six-screen movie theater in TriBeCa has now been abandoned by its developers, who think they can make more money with apartments than with films.
"It was a good project," said Martin Shaw, one of the developers and a local resident himself. He said that he and his partner, George Olsen, had originally thought of the complex because many neighbors complained about a lack of nearby theaters. The complex was to be at the base of the 15-story former Atalanta storage warehouse on the northwest corner of Varick and North Moore Streets, with condominium apartments to be built above. 
 But many residents opposed the plan, fearing an influx of noise, dirt and crime. Many hearings were held at the Landmarks Preservation Commission, where neighbors, including John F. Kennedy Jr., voiced their concerns. Last fall, after the city's Planning Commission finally approved the theater, the TriBeCa Community Association, a group of local residents, took the city and the developers to court, claiming that an environmental review should have been conducted before the go-ahead was issued.
The case was argued before Acting Justice Louis B. York of State Supreme Court in Manhattan and submitted for decision this spring. According to Jack Lester, the lawyer for the community group, Justice York refused to stop construction pending his decision, but the parties agreed that the theaters would not open until he decided the case. But on other fronts, negotiations between the developers and the group stalled.
Meanwhile, the market for residential conversions in TriBeCa has gone through the roof, with lofts now routinely commanding $400 a square foot or more.
A group of investors looking to build more apartments approached the developers and, Mr. Shaw said, made an irresistible offer. They proposed constructing an Atalanta Building with 12 apartments, of between 1,800 and 2,600 square feet apiece, where the theater would have been. These would be in addition to the 32 planned for higher floors.
Given the economics, it made sense to alter the plan and remove the theater, said Deirdre Carson, the developers' lawyer.
Besides, "It's not bad to have peace with your neighbors," said Mr. Shaw, who added that he was sure that some people in the community would be disappointed.
Maybe so. But many echo the sentiments of Laura Leston, a longtime resident who has "mixed emotions" about the change.
"I would have liked to have had a movie nearby," she said. "But I lived next door to a theater in Greenwich Village years ago, and sometimes I couldn't even get in my own front door." BERNARD STAMLER

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Yes, Risk-Taking At the World Bank

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
MANY people view the World Bank as a plodding, grand-scale embodiment of bureaucracy's worst features, the last place where a fleet-footed money manager might thrive. But Afsaneh Mashayekhi Beschloss seems bent on shattering stereotypes.
She innovates. She disparages hierarchy. And she is committed to the market, where she ranges widely to bolster returns on the $50 billion or so she manages as the World Bank's chief investment officer. Her particular flair involves the bank's liquid portfolio -- the shorter-term money market investments of its fixed-income holdings -- which might otherwise be a stagnant backwater. 
 "The job is to make money, and do your best at it," said Mrs. Beschloss, dismissing suggestions that the bank, which has many impoverished countries as members, might lean on her to invest with the heart as well as the head. "There is absolutely no pressure on us to buy anything."
Mrs. Beschloss, who was born in Iran, maneuvers much of her portfolio through what she calls a "cutting edge" investment world of credit derivatives, currency swaps, private stock deals, repurchase agreements and mortgage-backed securities. The exotic financial tools make it possible for the bank's $20 billion in short-term investments to beat the benchmark six-month London interbank rate by more than 10 basis points, or one-tenth of a percentage point, a signal achievement when so much money is involved.
But an institution like the World Bank cannot plunge willy-nilly into risky investments. So Mrs. Beschloss depends as much on the bank's highly refined regimen for controlling risk as she does on investing creativity. "We take lots of small risks," said Mrs. Beschloss, who took charge of the bank's investments a little more than a year ago and has already burnished her reputation as one of the brightest stars in the field.
James M. Allwin, who is in charge of institutional money management at Morgan Stanley, sees intellectual and personal firepower that could someday vault Mrs. Beschloss, 42, to the pinnacle now occupied by James D. Wolfensohn, the former Wall Street investment banker who runs the bank, which finances infrastructure and other economic development projects, mainly in poor countries. "She has become recognized as an expert in risk management," Mr. Allwin said, citing several academic studies she has published on the subject. "She's brought to that unit a real intellectual quality."
HER success has been noticed beyond the Street. Recently, she said, other international organizations, which she would not name, and a few foreign central banks have approached the bank, seeking her 48-member department's help in managing liquid investments. She travels widely to advise central banks and other entities.
Upon taking command of the department -- she was senior manager for derivatives and the bank's liabilities before her promotion last year -- Mrs. Beschloss promptly shrank the staff by 15 to 20 percent and reorganized it along functional lines.
"You want open, unhierarchical structures to make sure that the best ideas come through," Mrs. Beschloss said in an interview in the bank's glittering new headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue, two blocks from the White House.
The vast sums for which she is responsible fall into two pools. One, about $40 billion, belongs to the World Bank and sister agencies, and is invested directly in money-market and other fixed-income securities, half of it in short-term investments.
The other is about $10 billion of World Bank pension fund money invested mostly in stocks by several dozen Wall Street houses under her supervision. Some of this must be placed overseas, where many World Bank pensioners live.
Teasing extra tenths of a percentage-point return from money markets -- that is, producing a significantly higher return than on bank deposits or Treasury bills -- is difficult. "We're always on the curve of using new tools, whether it's using asset-backed securities or the asset-swap market," said Mrs. Beschloss, who posted a 5.75 percent annualized return in the first nine months of the bank's fiscal year, 13 basis points more than her benchmark.
"We we might buy J.G.B's," she said, referring to Japanese Government bonds, "and then swap them" into an American instrument tied to the London interbank rate.
ONE profitable maneuver sprang from her conviction in early April that the American economy was stronger than suggested by its relatively low interest rates, and that financial turmoil in Asia, widely viewed as a depressant, might prove at least a temporary stimulant.
"With lower interest rates and weakening import prices, that could have a positive impact on household incomes" and thus on spending, Mrs. Beschloss figured.
So she sold short two-year Treasury notes yielding 5.5 percent, a bet on higher interest rates, and turned a trading profit of nearly $1 million in about three weeks, unwinding her position by buying back notes at a lower price when their yield had risen to 5.7 percent.
The bank also did well with what she called "euro-convergence trades," profiting from policies that European countries are following to qualify for the European Monetary Union.
Late last year, Mrs. Beschloss bet that the Bank of England would raise interest rates. "We made $22 million out of that one" over a couple of days, she said.
Making these tactics work, however, requires substantial expertise. "A typical person here will have worked across a number of currencies" and with many financial devices, said Mrs. Beschloss, who earns $147,000 a year. "They can take deals apart and put them back together."
Mrs. Beschloss, who grew up wanting to work for the World Bank, was educated in Iran, the United States and Britain, including Oxford. Then came corporate work with the international strategic planning group of Royal Dutch/Shell in London and with J.P. Morgan in London and New York. She and her husband, Michael R. Beschloss, the American historian, have two young sons and are prominent in Washington and diplomatic social circles.
"What is unique about Afsaneh," said Peter Yu, a managing director of AIG Capital Partners in New York, "is she has an uncanny ability to create a private-sector climate in a multinational institution."

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
It's Spring, and Bushwick Blossoms

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
A BOY on a bicycle wove around a man sucking on a mango outside his home on Bleecker Street. Up and down the block, families relaxed beside brick houses radiating newness. The soundtrack was salsa, pumped from a window at pane-shaking decibels.
The scene was idyllic, so idyllic it was hard to believe that the neighborhood was Bushwick, a place associated more often with crime reports than with working-class domesticity. But this block, once full of vacant lots, and now flush with new housing, has turned a corner. If the trend continues, a neighborhood may turn with it. 
 Fifteen years ago, there were more than 1,000 vacant lots in Bushwick, the legacy of an era of arson and riots. Today, there are perhaps 50, and even the last section to be rebuilt, west Bushwick, is seeing something of a building boom.
The New York City Housing Partnership, which leverages state and city money to build affordable housing, has built 500 units, mostly two-family homes, in Bushwick since 1990. Construction is under way on 250 more.
"It's like Long Island," said Lena Rivera, of her block on George Street, where the first Partnership homes were built. The houses have front porches and plum trees, and neighbors watch one another's children.
Private builders are coming into the area as well. A new nursing home and a youth center, the neighborhood's first, are in the pipeline. The city is building a new park and softball field on a vast tract once used for a brewery, and there are plans afoot to rezone the land to allow for more housing, stores and a day care center.
Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture and Planning has established a studio in Bushwick -- its first outside Manhattan -- to help analyze the mostly Latino area's needs.
An abandoned precinct building has been renovated to house the Brooklyn North Task Force. There are new senior centers, too, and plans for more low-income housing to complement Hope Gardens, a low-rise, low-density public housing project, which was completed 13 years ago.
The renaissance, as boosters call it, is largely a result of the efforts of Vito Lopez, Bushwick's powerful State Assemblyman, and a not-for-profit agency, the Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council, with which he is tightly entwined. Mr. Lopez estimates that $200 million in investment has come into the area over the past decade. His friendships with Mayor Giuliani, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, and Gov. George E. Pataki, who toured the area in February, have helped bring money Bushwick's way.
"Bushwick is always ignored," Mr. Lopez said, in explaining his determination to revitalize the area. "Williamsburg and East New York get all the attention."
Another midwife to the rebirth has been the drop in crime. Murders have dropped by 67 percent in the past five years and robbery by 53 percent. The drug trade is still large, but it is much more clandestine, said Richard Curtis, an associate professor of anthropology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. As recently as six years ago, he recalled, dozens of dealers brazenly barked their offerings on Troutman Street.
Today, he said, "You need to know someone to buy," and the trade is conducted in houses and bodegas and on carefully selected corners. Neighbors said that there were still plenty of dealers in Maria Hernandez Park but that now plenty of families and children also used the park.
"There is the beginning of a psychological transformation," Mr. Lopez said of the combination of reduced crime and increased home ownership. "Now people want to stay."
The depths of the renaissance are open to question, of course. Abandoned buildings abound. And for old-timers, the neighborhood is a far cry from what it was before white flight and fire wreaked havoc. "The kids in the neighborhood destroyed it," said Miriam Mergal, a Bushwick resident for 24 years, pointing to graffiti that mar her block like a rash.
Poverty remains entrenched and unemployment high. Young people cannot get jobs, said the Rev. John Powis of St. Barbara's Roman Catholic Church, so "they go out and get corners." And the schools, he said, "are the biggest crime of all."
Sister Kathy Maire, who has worked for 10 years as an organizer for East Brooklyn Congregations, a church consortium, said she thought the schools were worse than when she arrived. The student population of Bushwick High School is double its capacity. In Community School District 32, only 38.5 percent of elementary students read at grade level, compared with 49.6 citywide.
Hope Gardens, praised for its design, has turned out to have leaking roofs and poor insulation in parts. The first Partnership homes built, on George Street, also had problems with leaking roofs.
"If you're going to build in Bushwick, build something worthy of these people," Father Powis said.
He also criticized, as he has in the past, the edifice of politics and patronage that Mr. Lopez has built, through his Bushwick United Democratic Club; Brooklyn Unidos, a Latino coalition, and the Senior Citizens Council, which is perhaps Bushwick's largest employer. "This is Vito's territory," Father Powis said. "He wants to control everything."
But Mr. Lopez was unabashed about his political empire. Without it, he reasoned, he would not have been able to bring as much development and investment to the area.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Activist Government, Anxious Markets

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Sometimes in the stock market, the past really is prologue. That's why the search for historical parallels between markets is a favored pastime of many strategists.
As the stock market raced to a new high this year, most observers made comparisons to either the months preceding the 1987 break or those before the crash of 1929. 
 But the events of the week point to a more intriguing parallel. With the Justice Department's suit against Microsoft, 1998 is beginning to look a lot like 1962.
It will be bad news for equities if the parallel holds. In 1962, a vicious bear move took almost 30 percent off the market's value.
The Dow Jones industrial average began that year at 726. By June 26, the Dow had fallen to 535, a 26 percent decline. By the time of the Cuban missile crisis in October, stocks had rallied a bit. The market ended the year down 10 percent.
The midyear fall was all the more shocking because the economy was thriving. Interest rates were low; inflation was 1 percent; all was well.
Or so investors thought. The trouble began on April 5, not on Wall Street but in Washington. Addressing Congress, President John F. Kennedy expressed concern about increased consolidation among railroad and airline companies. He asked a new task force to examine the mergers and help the Justice Department develop a position on each one. Merger-mad executives were put on notice.
The second watershed event came not a week later. On April 11, U.S. Steel, the Microsoft of the day, raised steel prices $6 a ton. Worried that the increase would be inflationary, the irate President called it an "irresponsible defiance of public interest."
U.S. Steel rescinded the increase two days later. But investors got the message -- the Government would take a bigger role in regulating business. And the market started to slump.
Fast-forward 36 years. Responding to merger mania in almost all sectors of corporate America, the Clinton Administration announced on May 14 a broad review of merger trends by the President's top economic advisers. Four days later, the Justice Department sued Microsoft.
Why would Government scrutiny of mergers cause a market collapse? Investors hate uncertainty; possible Government interference ups the uncertainty quotient. Charles Peabody, market strategist at the institutional research firm Mitchell Securities, has studied both periods in stock market lore. He said, "If the Clinton Administration is worried about financial asset inflation, it could dampen it by putting a crimp in merger mania."
Similarities between 1962 and now are not limited to merger action. On May 11, 1962, the Securities and Exchange Commission held hearings on sales abuses in the securities business. Of particular concern: high-pressure tactics in the sale of mutual funds.
Almost 36 years later to the day, Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the S.E.C., chastised the mutual fund industry for "building unrealistic expectations through performance hype." Earlier, Nationsbank paid $6.75 million to settle commission charges that it deceived mutual fund buyers.
One last bit of deja vu. In a May 9, 1962, speech to bankers, H. Dewayne Kreager, economist and former director of economic development for Washington State, made this pronouncement: "Business cycles as we used to know them now no longer exist." Sound familiar?

Rating the Bigshots: Gates vs. Rockefeller

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
LET the competition begin to write the first rough drafts of the Bill Gates chapter in American history.
By the time the Justice Department filed its broad antitrust suits last week, the argument in some quarters had already come down to how much Bill Gates is like John D. Rockefeller, whose Standard Oil made him the most famed monopolist of a century ago. 
 Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, was a law professor who taught about the Supreme Court's decision to break up Standard Oil. "Market power that John D. Rockefeller would envy," Mr. Pitofsky says of Mr. Gates.
So in comparing them, why simply speculate, when the evidence is already there?
 
A Lousy Billion
For starters, who's really richer? Looks like it's Mr. Gates. Rockefeller barely reached a lousy billion. But that was in 1913, at the beginning of an inflationary century, and doesn't account for his habit of giving money away almost as fast as he made it. Adjust for inflation, add back the money Rockefeller donated, and Mr. Gates is still ahead. Ronald Chernow, author of "Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller" (Random House, 1998), estimates that in today's currency, Rockefeller was worth at most $25.6 billion.
Mr. Gates owns nearly 542 million shares of Microsoft, more than 20 percent of the company. Antitrust actions have dented his net worth, but as of the market close on Friday, he was still good for $46 billion.
But who, then, has lived better? Judging from their homes, it's Rockefeller, though Mr. Gates has only begun to compete. Mr. Rockefeller had estates in Cleveland and South Florida, but his prime residence was a 3,600-acre estate in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., more than four times the size of Central Park. He rerouted roads and even a railroad in the area lest soot and smoke ruin his golf game.
Mr. Gates is still building his $35 million waterfront home near Seattle. With a 20-car garage tunneled into the hillside, a combination indoor waterfall/spa/60-foot pool and video walls that can be programmed to display a guest's favorite art, Mr. Gates is still trying to reconcile the demands of infotech flashiness, environmental correctness and domestic tranquillity.
Like the many versions of his software, the home is now in, say, Release 4.0. Each wave of modifications, however, raises doubts about whether they only aggravate a bad case of feature shock.
In other ways, however, Rockefeller and Mr. Gates earnestly compete across the decades in cheapness. Mr. Rockefeller's estates in Pocantico Hills and Cleveland had their own golf courses, but around water hazards he cut his risks by switching to old balls. He wore suits until they were shiny, and sometimes billed his guests for board. Mr. Gates flew coach until he bought his own plane a few months ago. He still feasts on fast-food hamburgers.
But, given the importance of image, who then sounds more like a rapacious monopolist? Here, too, it looks like an even match, as both borrowed the language of organized crime to describe what they were doing, even for deeds that were entirely legal. The Standard Oil men, using code words to preserve secrecy, spoke of making competitors "feel sick," or of giving them "a good sweating."
The Gates crowd speaks instead of collecting a "vigorish," or "vig." For organized crime, that means a regular, extortionate loan payment, unavoidable for borrowers who value their health. For Microsoft, it means a regular software licensing payment, unavoidable for almost anyone who wants to use a personal computer. It is figured into the cost of every machine. Now Microsoft wants to collect a vig on Internet access too.
Which brings us to public relations. Here, Rockefeller got off to a terrible start, then made a comeback, while Mr. Gates has done the reverse. Image-polishing was an art Mr. Rockefeller ignored until the Supreme Court broke up his company in 1911. Thus the muckraking press, led by Ida Tarbell, got to define him as a rapacious monopolist. Only then did he hire Ivy Lee, one of the first professional publicists. He followed Lee's advice to hand out shiny dimes to children. Living to age 98, he came to be viewed as eccentric and, for his charities small and large, even benevolent.
Mr. Gates, attuned to the business celebrity culture from the start, took the leading role in a saga that has been called the "Revenge of the Nerds." He and his handlers, however, have been so heavy-handed in responding to competitors and public officials that they inadvertently confirmed many fears. Thus the need for another image transplant reminiscent of Michael Milken's sudden desire to take hordes of kids to ballgames. Discovering, like Mr. Rockefeller, that children remain useful props, Mr. Gates visited a sixth-grade classroom in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan last March, after his handlers had strung five banks of movie lights and sent in a company video crew. That was the day after an appearance before a Senate panel where he was portrayed much as Ida Tarbell described Rockefeller.
What, then, about true philanthropy? Who was genuinely the more generous? Hand it to Rockefeller, even though Mr. Gates has promised to catch up. In "The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power" (Simon & Schuster, 1991), Daniel Yergin says Rockefeller gave away $550 million, equivalent to billions today. He established the Rockefeller Foundation and Rockefeller University, financed the University of Chicago and sponsored Spelman College in Atlanta to educate the families of freed black slaves.
 
Giving It Away
Mr. Gates promises to eventually give away more than 90 percent of his wealth. He has provided about $555 million for the William H. Gates Foundation, pledged to spend about $200 million through the Gates Library Foundation and has spread around at least another $22 million.
Like Rockefeller, he favors universities, having donated libraries, biotechnology labs and computer centers to schools, including the University of Washington, Harvard and Stanford. He has given smaller amounts to Washington state campaigns to oppose a tax rollback, fearing damage to school systems, and to improve handgun control. Through his foundation, he has given several million dollars to promote international family planning and women's and children's health.
Mr. Gates and his defenders, however, would rather not compare him with Rockefeller in any respect, preferring to liken him to the greatest inventors. Time magazine, at its 75th anniversary celebration recently, made the comparison manifest by inviting him to speak about the Wright Brothers.
He eagerly drew parallels between their enterprise and his. Noting that he had visited Kitty Hawk for inspiration, he said, "The Wright brothers created the single greatest cultural force since the invention of writing, for their invention became the first World Wide Web."

How To Break Up Microsoft

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
STACKED against the landmark antitrust cases of the past, the actions taken by Department of Justice against Microsoft last week are pint-sized. The behemoth Standard Oil Company was broken up more than 80 years ago into 34 refining companies, pipelines and other pieces. AT&T was broken up into one long-distance and seven regional phone companies. The Government spent 13 years trying to dismantle I.B.M. before dropping the effort in 1982 out of exhaustion. All the Government wanted from Microsoft last week was less heavy-handed behavior.
According to the Justice Department, Microsoft exploits its monopoly of Windows, the operating system that runs about 90 percent of the nation's personal computers, to dominate sales of many other products and services. As proof, the Government points to contracts Microsoft has with computer manufacturers and companies selling services over the Internet that prevent them from steering customers to Microsoft's competitors. These and other exclusionary practices, all based on the dependence of Microsoft's partners on Windows, make it likely that Microsoft will dominate the market for browsers -- the software that connects personal computers to the Internet -- and maybe even the markets for real estate, travel and other commercial services available on line. 
 Nobody at the Justice Department is openly talking about breaking up Microsoft -- yet. But many analysts predict that Microsoft's chokehold on cyberspace will tighten, and that the Government will respond by trying to restructure Microsoft to weaken its ability to block competition, rather than by subjecting every move by Bill Gates to judicial challenge. Economists are already thinking hard about feasible ways for the Government to take bold action.
The Government's suit seeks to prohibit Microsoft's exclusionary practices. But many analysts are skeptical that a monopoly backed by the power of Windows can be sidetracked by behavioral pinpricks. If the skeptics are right, Microsoft's commercial tentacles could grow to gargantuan length -- grasping new technologies for transmitting movies and other video data over the Internet, for example. At that point, Microsoft's economic muscle could make that of the old AT&T look puny by comparison, and Justice will be compelled to revisit the trust-busting tactics of yesteryear.
But trust-busters would get little guidance from the breakups of Standard Oil, AT&T and, more recently, electrical utilities. Standard Oil controlled oil wells, refineries and pipelines. AT&T controlled the only phone wires running into Americans' homes. Electrical utilities owned the only transmission lines. Those monopolies flowed from easily identified physical assets that could be split off from the rest of a company and regulated separately. But Microsoft owns nothing much more than the 0's and 1's of its computer code.
Worse still for would-be trust-busters, those 0's and 1's are constantly changing. The phone and transmission lines running into Americans' homes don't change very much from one year to the next. But Microsoft transforms Windows frequently, which raises the question: what exactly is Windows? A central tenet of the Government's complaint is that Microsoft demolishes competition for application programs, like programs that reorganize data on disk drives, by incorporating them into Windows, while rivals must sell them as stand-alone applications. A few years back, Windows did not include a browser. Now it does, and the sales of browsers by Microsoft's major competitor are shriveling.
If the Government cannot define Windows, it cannot easily split Microsoft's operating system from its applications software -- the antitrust equivalent of separating local phone lines from AT&T. A few economists have given the Microsoft problem serious thought, however, and come up with intriguing suggestions.
 
Pieces of the Action
Frederic M. Scherer of Harvard proposes a tactic the Government once used against Xerox: compulsory licensing. Xerox was required in the 1970's to license patents for paper-feeding and other technical knowhow to would-be competitors in order to break its monopoly in copy machines. Mr. Scherer would require Microsoft to sell to any willing buyer, for a fee determined by the Government, the right to modify and market the Windows operating system.
The idea is to clone Microsoft. Each licensee could choose its own browser, develop its own Web sites or advertise the Web sites of any other company. This would inject competition where virtually none now exists.
But Mr. Scherer's plan does pose a danger. If the licensees modified Windows too much, they would destroy the compatibility and efficiency of the existing system that exists thanks to the standard set by Microsoft that every computer program follows. To address this danger, Mr. Scherer proposes an industry committee to limit modifications of Windows.
Garth Saloner of Stanford University offers a less regulated version of Mr. Scherer's plan, in which the Government would neither set standards nor set fees. He would split Microsoft into a company that sells Windows and a company that sells word-processing and other applications. Microsoft would have to auction off to the two or three highest bidders the source code behind Windows. The winning bidders would be free to modify their version of Windows in any way they think their customers would want. The clones could also develop word processing and other applications in competition with Microsoft.
Mr. Saloner stops short of proposing a czar to oversee industry standards because, he predicts, his Microsoft clones would not risk driving away customers by peddling an operating system that is incompatible with their large inventories of Windows-based software. Mr. Saloner could imagine, for example, that Sun Microsystems would bid for the right to sell a version of Windows that would offer customers a non-Microsoft browser and also preserve compatibility with the operating system that Sun provides its corporate clients. Competition among three or four Windows-wielding firms, he argues, is enough to insure that no one company dominates cyberspace technology and commerce.
So far, the threat that Microsoft will thwart competition is just that -- a threat. The American computer industry is by most accounts remarkably dynamic and creatively entrepreneurial. That in part explains why the Justice Department decided on behavioral remedies for now. But there may come a time when Microsoft's business tactics prove intolerable, threatening to concentrate economic power over Internet commerce. Yet the lawyers and economists at the Justice Department's antitrust division will no doubt hesitate to take bold action. The 13-year I.B.M. quagmire looms over trust-busting adventures just as the Vietnam quagmire looms over military adventures. The importance of the Scherer and Saloner plans lies less in their details, which are incomplete, than in the fact that they provide a blueprint should Justice decide that trust-busting cannot remain a relic of the past.

Diplomacy's Erratic Hit Man: The Dollar

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE last time an Indonesian strongman tested Washington's patience, the Central Intelligence Agency dipped into the movie business. In the late 1950's, it put together a mildly pornographic film starring a lookalike for President Sukarno, caught in bed with a blonde playing a Soviet agent. The humiliation was supposed to drive Indonesia's first president from office.
Predictably, the crazy scheme collapsed. It took a general named Suharto to oust President Sukarno. But by the time Mr. Suharto's time finally ran out last week, after 32 years marked by occasional brilliance, iron-fisted rule and shameless corruption, the world had changed. 
 Long gone was the cold war intrigue. In retrospect, Washington's scenarios of what might trigger the end of the Suharto era -- a military coup, an assassin's bullet, a midnight heart attack -- seem almost quaint. Until a few months ago no one had even considered the possibility that an economic crisis would throw the 76-year old leader into a series of losing battles, first against the world's currency traders, then against fleeing foreign investors, and finally against an outraged populace.
And who would have bet that the triggermen in this Javanese shadow play would include a bunch of Ph.D. economists at the International Monetary Fund?
After all, they didn't look so threatening. They talked in banker-speak about "structural adjustments" and "conditionality" on a $43 billion bailout package. They never talked politics. Yet their demands that Mr. Suharto break up his family's vast empire of hotels, toll roads and cartels forced him to make a stark political choice, and the I.M.F. knew it. That, says Stanley Fischer, the Fund's No. 2 official, "gave us a lot of credibility" with ordinary Indonesians.
Mr. Suharto chose to protect his family even if it impeded national recovery. But then he also hiked the price of fuel so he could keep his budget deficit within I.M.F. guidelines. The result was an anti-Suharto rebellion that left 500 dead.
There may be no more vivid example of the power of what has come to be known as "economic diplomacy." Yet as the Clinton Administration has learned many times in the past three weeks -- not only in Asia, but also in Europe and the Middle East -- economic weapons are imprecise at best. Often they are not in Washington's exclusive control: Global markets can knock even the best-aimed economic missile off course. Many are ill-designed, and blow up on the launch pad.
 
Weak Threats
The threat of economic sanctions did nothing to dissuade India from conducting five nuclear tests, or European firms from striking deals with Iran and Cuba. Even in Indonesia, American officials had no desire to speed Suharto's fall. Fearing more economic instability and bloodshed, they resisted urging him to resign until it was clear he was about to go anyway. And the new President, B. J. Habibie, hardly inspires investor confidence. He is an unpredictable crony capitalist, distrusted by the military, who is best described as Suharto lite.
Nothing looked quite this complicated when President Clinton began declaring, six years ago, that foreign policy and economic policy are one. Economic engagement was supposed to spread America's influence. A world moving toward American-style capitalism, Mr. Clinton often says, will inevitably turn toward democracy, peaceful co-existence and friendship with its new business partner, America Inc. Congress stepped in with the other side of the policy, passing laws that threaten unilateral economic sanctions against global miscreants -- those who proliferate nukes, violate human rights, prop up Cuba or keep out American car parts.
It sounds like a clean business deal. Out there where investors, politicians and nationalistic emotion mix, however, the results are a little messy. And for those who think American foreign policy is at a particularly low ebb, an overreliance on the power of economic incentives and disincentives is viewed as a reason America seems to enjoy less influence around the world than a sole superpower should.
"There are a few situations, like Indonesia, where it all comes together, where economic action can create political consequences," said Richard N. Haass, a national security expert in the Bush Administration. "But the big lesson of the past decade is that economic incentives and particularly economic sanctions rarely work if their goals are too ambitious."
Look at India, once the focus of power games with the Soviets and more recently the destination of an endless parade of Clinton Administration trade missions. The Administration bet that by bringing in American capital, building power stations and promoting the rise of the software industry, it would create a new market for American goods and bring India into "the web of engagement."
Presumably India's leaders knew the economic cost of conducting five nuclear tests. But they decided that no amount of money outweighed the benefit of demonstrating the country's nuclear muscle to China and Pakistan. The United States immediately slapped huge sanctions on the country, under a law that had left President Clinton virtually no maneuvering room. But when Mr. Clinton looked over his shoulder during the summit meeting of the big industrialized nations last weekend, he saw his allies publicly condemning the nuclear tests while some quietly dusted off their order books, hoping to snap up the deals Washington had left on the table.
 
The Leverage Gap
Almost simultaneously, the White House backed down from threats of sanctions against European firms for doing business with Iran and Libya. Those threats sounded tough: Any global company doing deals there was put on notice that it would suffer sanctions in America. The strategy backfired. Rather than create an alliance against terrorist states, it created an alliance against the American assumption that Washington can set foreign policy for the world.
"The problem is that sanctions imply a leverage we don't have anymore," said David Rothkopf, a former top Commerce Department official. "In 1946, when half of all world trade went through the U.S., we could impose those kinds of control. Today, when 14 percent goes through the United States, we can't control it." Mr. Clinton was lucky to save face with a deal in which allies swore to fight proliferation -- if America waived the sanctions and urged Congress to rewrite the law.
And sometimes the backlash is felt at home. Mr. Clinton's six-year effort to dangle the ultimate economic carrots -- access to American technology -- before China has enmeshed him in a new campaign finance nightmare. To bring China along on everything from non-proliferation to human rights, Mr. Clinton changed rules that had classified satellites as munitions. That shifted the decision about exporting them from the Pentagon to the Commerce Department -- which is more inclined toward exports. It made China happy, and American satellite makers very, very happy.
Unfortunately for Mr. Clinton, those satellite makers numbered among his most generous political donors. And an executive of China Aerospace, which launches the satellites, now appears to have been the conduit for an inept Chinese effort to funnel foreign money into the 1996 campaign. The White House says it didn't know about the Chinese contributions, and wasn't influenced by the American donors.
On Wednesday the House of Representatives responded with fury, voting overwhelmingly to bar all satellite exports to China. The vote was cast as an issue of national security; if it becomes law, though, it will simply assure that European satellite makers get China's business. (Curiously, more than 20 House members who voted to bar the exports had urged Mr. Clinton to allow similar exports several years ago -- precisely so the Europeans wouldn't get that business.)
So what are the lessons from this confusing morass of economic tactics and global strategy?
First is the Ideology Rule: Passionate national causes -- particularly the urge for self-sufficiency -- almost always trump economic rationality. That's why the Indians pressed the button, and it's why the North Koreans and Iraqis and Serbs have been so adamant.
Second is the Sanctions Rule: Unilateral sanctions almost never work -- precisely because they are unilateral (unlike those against South Africa in the age of apartheid). In a global economy, there are too many producers of almost everything.
Finally, the Suharto Rule: When you open up your economy, you'd better make sure you have your act together -- with an economy not dominated by corruption, with banks that can absorb shocks, and with a way to assure investors that things won't go to pieces if the Government falls. Otherwise, you risk the 1990's equivalent of a military coup: a market coup, which is a lot more dangerous than C.I.A. moviemakers.

 BODY:

TRADE
Deficit at a Record
The nation's monthly trade deficit surged to $13 billion in March, the deepest since the Commerce Department adopted its current measurement system in 1992 and considerably more than economists had expected. The deficit in February was $12.2 billion. The new figures provided clear evidence of the impact on the United States -- both good and bad -- of Asia's mounting economic woes. Growth in the American economy, which had been threatening to overheat, was restrained. But at the same time, United States exports remained weak, hurting many manufacturers and farmers, and imports surged, a trend that does not bode well for the long term.
 
INTEREST RATES
No Increase, for Now
The Federal Reserve's policy-setting Open Market Committee declined once again to increase short-term interest rates, apparently viewing the threat of inflation as remote and believing that any American rate increase could worsen the economic situation in Asia. Underlying the benign view of inflation are a number of recent indicators, including a 2.3 percent decline in new housing starts last month, to an annual rate of 1.538 million units. Many analysts had expected a small gain. Minutes of the Fed's March 31 meeting show that it saw a risk of inflation but decided to hold rates steady because of Asia's malaise.
 
MARKETS
Commodity Index Skids
The Commodity Research Bureau/Bridge index of 17 commodities skidded to its lowest level in more than four years, dropping to 219.27 on Tuesday and ending the week at 219.18. Futures prices for copper, silver, oil, nickel, wheat and other commodities have been in a long-term decline that has been aggravated in recent days by Indonesia's political turmoil and -- see a pattern here? -- the Asian economic collapse. Stock and bond markets were little changed for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at 9,144.44, up 48.44. But technology stocks were battered, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 41.77, to close at 1,805, its weakest level in more than six weeks.
 
TOBACCO
A Pipe Dream?
Anti-smoking legislation hit a potentially serious snag in the Senate, and further action was postponed until next month, sending President Clinton; Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and other Senate leaders who want to deter teen-agers' smoking back to the drafting table. Just as it appeared a consensus was forming to increase the Federal tax on cigarettes by $1.10 a pack while giving tobacco companies some protection against lawsuits, an unusual coalition of senators formed. Some want to kill the legislation, while others advocate the toughest possible anti-smoking measure. "We are making a deal with the Devil," said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who opposes any limit on the companies' legal liability.
 
SOCIAL SECURITY
A Market-Based Proposal
The National Commission on Retirement Policy, which includes members of Congress from both parties, proposed a sweeping overhaul of the Social Security system, calling for the establishment of personal investment accounts and a gradual increase in the retirement age, to 70, to make up for a cash shortfall expected when 77 million baby boomers become eligible for Social Security benefits. "The goal of this is to have people more involved in their own savings," said Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, a leader of the group, which includes lawmakers, economists, pension-system experts and business executives. The report says the changes would keep Social Security solvent for at least 75 years without raising taxes. Some liberals, however, oppose any plan that does not offer guaranteed benefits.
 
DEALS
A Merger Epidemic
What would once have been a big deal seems today to be business as usual. Seagram, accelerating its shift from beverages and spirits into an entertainment powerhouse, agreed to buy Polygram, one of the world's largest music companies, for $10.6 billion in cash and stock; to raise money for the acquisition, Seagram is shedding its Tropicana juice business. . . . Pearson, Britain's largest publisher, and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, a Dallas investment firm, agreed to buy most of Simon & Schuster's operations from Viacom for $4.6 billion in cash. . . . Office Depot said it would acquire Viking Office Products in a $3 billion stock swap. . . . Dillard's said it would acquire Mercantile Stores, a Midwest retailer, for $2.9 billion in cash. . . . Fortis, a Belgian-Dutch banking and insurance group, agreed to acquire Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest, for $11.1 billion. . . . Francois Pinault, the French investor who bought 29.1 percent of Christie's earlier this month, said he would buy the rest in a deal that values the international auction house at $1.2 billion. . . . Royal Ahold extended its reach into the American supermarket business with a $2.6 billion deal for Giant Food Inc.
 
VIAGRA
Worldwide Demand
Viagra, intended to help impotent men, has yet to pass clinical tests in Taiwan, but it is already selling for $59 on the black market there. In Taipei, a nurse displayed a bag of the medication. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration reported on Friday that Pfizer Inc. had said that six patients taking the drug had died, although it was unknown if Viagra played any role in the deaths. A spokeswoman for the F.D.A. said the agency was investigating but continued to believe the drug was safe and effective and had asked Pfizer to provide more information to patients on the proper use of the drug. Pfizer's stock fell $3.69, to $105.44.

HEADLINE: Just Why Do We Buy?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Keeping Up With the Gateses?" (Spending It, May 3), which discussed Juliet B. Schor's theories about overspending by the middle class: 
 Despite Ms. Schor's important contributions to our understanding of consumerism, she has a narrow interpretation of how consumers estimate the value of any particular purchase. A purchase decision comprises more dimensions of value than functional and social imperatives. Good design, aesthetics, purchase convenience and variety are among the factors in consumers' cost-benefit analysis. But these factors are not easily quantifiable, and so they are sometimes belittled.
Each consumer has his or her own priorities in buying. While some may be most concerned with a wardrobe as a means to impress people, others more in tune with fine fabrics and tailoring would highlight the pleasure of wearing a fine garment.
Such pleasure has value even if the product is something outsiders rarely see. It's the same principle as having nice underwear.
Economists should also realize that many products once considered luxuries have been made more affordable to broader audiences. With airline travel relatively less expensive these days, is it any wonder that consumers seek more exotic destinations, and not merely for status?
While one can criticize some people for overspending, it is important to recognize that many can now afford purchases that their parents could only dream of.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT: DE KALB, ILL.;
Prosperity Makes Generosity Grow

BYLINE: By ANDREW BLUTH 

 BODY:
Maybe it's the fat economy, or Midwestern generosity. Whatever the reason, graduates and newlyweds in De Kalb, Ill., are taking in larger financial gifts these days.
Set in corn country about 60 miles west of Chicago, De Kalb has about 40,000 people. Though home to Northern Illinois University, it is better known as the home of DeKalb Genetics, the corn-seed producer. 
 Beata Matz, 22, a recent Northern Illinois graduate, estimated the average gift she received at about $50.
"Those are from friends, though," she added; cash gifts from relatives were closer to $150 or $200.
A dozen or so other residents cited $50 as an average for graduations -- making an important exception for grandparents, who spend much more.
For high school graduations, several people again listed $50 as an average, but noted that the number of gifts could be greater.
Wedding gifts are dictated somewhat more by etiquette, several people said, suggesting that an appropriate gift is $50 from each person attending. In other words, bring a date, double the amount.
Most people said the average for a confirmation was $25 to $35. And the tooth market was holding steady at around $1. "You don't want to get them too used to getting big gifts too early," Sharon Cook, the owner of a gift store, said of children. ANDREW BLUTH

HEADLINE: Restraint By Pakistan Is Eroding, Leader Says

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, May 23

 BODY:
With the world awaiting his decision on whether to lead his country into the nuclear weapons club, Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, said today that he was trying to act with restraint but that India's recent nuclear tests pose a "threat that may materialize at any moment."
"This fills us with apprehension even now," Mr. Sharif said at a news conference. "The balance of power in the region has been violently tilted." 
 Mr. Sharif carefully avoided hinting at what decision he might make or when he might make it. He seemed to suggest, however, that no nuclear tests were imminent.
"We are being asked to show restraint," he said. "Have we not shown utmost restraint in all those years since we had the nuclear capacity?
"The whole nation has demonstrated a sober and mature approach to this situation. We have not taken any action in haste. We have not acted in a tit-for-tat manner. We have not let any madness engulf us."
Western leaders fear that if Pakistan answers India's tests with tests of its own, South Asia will be caught up in a highly dangerous nuclear arms race.
President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain telephoned Mr. Sharif on Friday to press this case. Mr. Sharif made no commitments, but he is expected to send a high-level delegation to Washington within a few days for talks with senior Administration officials and members of Congress.
Efforts to dissuade Mr. Sharif from ordering nuclear tests were set back this week when Home Minister Lal Kishan Advani of India warned that Pakistan should make concessions in disputes between the two countries because India's nuclear testing "has brought about a qualitatively new state in Indo-Pakistani relations."
He said specifically that Pakistan should soften its position on the divided Kashmir region.
In Washington the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, responded that with such statements, "India is foolishly and dangerously increasing tensions with its neighbors." Today Mr. Sharif said such a statements constituted "a nuclear declaration of hostility toward Pakistan."
"Any misadventure will meet a resolute response," he said
Mr. Sharif expressed gratitude to President Clinton, whose telephone call on Friday was his third since India's five nuclear tests on May 11 and 13, and to leaders of Islamic countries and "our friend China, which is a peaceful country." China, which like Pakistan has a longstanding rivalry with India, is believed to have supplied technology and materiel for the Pakistani nuclear program. The Chinese Foreign Minister received a Pakistani delegation in Beijing this week.
Several Western countries and Japan have imposed economic sanctions on India because of its nuclear explosions, and threaten to do the same to Pakistan if it proceeds. Today Mr. Sharif said the threat of sanctions "is not only not new to us, but it does not rattle us."
"No amount of sanctions or condemnations has changed the extent of the nuclear threat to Pakistan," he said.
Dancing diplomatically around the central question of whether Pakistan will begin nuclear testing, the Prime Minister said only that there is "complete national consensus to respond to the challenges and the threat." He promised to act "in our supreme national interest."

HEADLINE: U.N. Told A Tribunal Needs Help

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 22

 BODY:
The chief administrative officer of the Rwanda war-crimes tribunal was here this week to ask for help, not for the first time.
Battling accusations of mismanagement and under surveillance by the United Nations' inspector general, the tribunal, based in the Arusha, Tanzania, is struggling to operate with far fewer resources than its Balkans counterpart in The Hague, the official, Agwu Ukiwe Okali, said in an interview. 
"We need investigators, administrators, bilingual lawyers, interpreters and court stenographers," said Mr. Okali, a Nigerian-born graduate of the London School of Economics and Harvard Law School. Mr. Okali took over as registrar of the Rwanda tribunal a year ago after the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, dismissed its senior officials.
This week Mr. Okali gave Mr. Annan and Joseph E. Connor, Under Secretary General for Administration and Management, a list of what he needs to make the Rwanda tribunal function effectively in Arusha -- a distant outpost, he said, "where you can't just run down the street and buy computer parts."
He wants a liaison officer here in New York to see that someone pays attention. Requests can take a year to be filled, he said, because papers move from desk to desk in New York for months.
But the problem is more fundamental than that, he said.
"The United Nations has no experience in criminal work," said Mr. Okali, who once served as assistant counsel for the Connecticut General Insurance Corporation. "Court stenographers, for example, are unknown in the U.N. We faced a big backlog of cases for lack of stenographers. We embarked on a crash program and had to contract this work out."
Mr. Okali said that he has also had to create a training program for interpreters who can work in French, English and Kinyarwanda, the language spoken by most of the tribunal's defendants and witnesses.
Ad-hoc solutions to shortcomings like these have raised alarms in human rights organizations, which have questioned whether trials can be fair and whether there is a danger of convictions being overturned on legal technicalities. Despite its problems, the tribunal has a big agenda, having indicted and taken into custody more people than the Balkans tribunal.
The Rwanda tribunal, created by the Security Council in the fall of 1994, is charged with bringing to justice those who carried out acts of genocide and other major crimes against Tutsi and moderate Hutu in Rwanda earlier that year.
Mr. Okali and his legal adviser, Kingsley Moghalu, said in interviews that it is difficult to lure people to work in Arusha, the Tanzanian gateway to the Mount Kilimanjaro region and four hours by road from Nairobi, Kenya, the nearest large international center.
"It's a big difference from pushing paper in the Secretariat," Mr. Moghalu said of working in Arusha.
The tribunal still suffers from the decision to locate it in Arusha, where it must share space with Tanzanian Government offices and private businesses. Electricity is unreliable and after-hours entertainment is all but nonexistent. United Nations bureaucrats do not view service in Arusha as a good career move.
Mr. Okali described, with an envy bordering on sadness, the Balkans tribunal headquarters in The Hague -- "a separate building with its United Nations flag flying." In Arusha, there is not even a cafeteria, he said.
Mr. Okali, a United Nations official since 1975, said a successful Rwanda tribunal could make a deep impression in Africa. He noted the recent guilty plea by a former Rwanda Prime Minister, Jean Kambanda.
"For the African continent, seeing a former minister sitting in a cell, that itself is sending a very powerful message," he said. "It means this is real. Now we are answerable."

HEADLINE: Mysterious Virus at Source Drives Up the Price of Pearls

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
In simpler times, only nature could make a pearl. Then mankind came up with the cultured variety, and pearls were transformed from nuggets of magic to predictable commodities.
In recent years, though, nature has struck back: a mysterious virus has teamed up with disruptive weather patterns to kill more than half the oysters in the world's busiest undersea factory. 
 At first, shoppers at jewelry counters were blissfully unaware of all this because dealers, alerted to the blight, kept plenty of pearls on hand. But those supplies are running short, and suddenly -- just in time for prom and wedding season -- pearl prices are shooting up.
Luxury chains like Tiffany & Company as well as small, family-owned jewelers like Wilson & Son in Scarsdale, N.Y., have been forced to raise prices, in some cases by as much as 25 percent, for top-quality strands. And prices are still rising.
A necklace that cost $800 to $1,200 a year ago might bring $1,500 today. A set of single-stud earrings now costs $200, up from $170 this time last year, according to the Cultured Pearl Information Center.
"This could not have come at a worse time, because pearl demand is way up," said Devin Macnow, executive director of the center, a trade group that is financed by the Japan Pearl Exporters Association.
But the surge in consumer demand for luxury items, born of the powerful economy, pales next to the death of millions of Akoya oysters in Japan's coastal waters in the last several years.
In 1996, the last year for which full figures are available, 150 million Akoya mollusks died, according to the exporters' group. Cultured pearls dominate the American market, and half of them come from Japanese Akoya oysters.
The problem has been building for a decade but became acute in 1996 and 1997, said Ichiro Nomura, a director of resources and environmental research at the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in Tokyo. "The cause of increased death is yet to be known fully, and scientists of our agency are making their best efforts to identify it," he said.
So, to meet demand in the United States, the largest pearl market after Japan, exporters have been reducing shipments to other countries, like Switzerland and Singapore, and also reserving more of the finest-quality pearls for sale here. In addition, exporters have been shipping more pearls to the United States from China, but their ability to shift distribution is too limited to offset the shortfall.
So American jewelers must simply wait for nature and science to strike a balance.
When they first received word of the dying oysters, retailers increased their pearl orders and, for a time, had a surplus. But as the death rate accelerated, and inventories fell, retailers say they had no choice but to pass higher costs on to customers. The biggest price increase is for top-quality pearls, which even in a good year account for less than 5 percent of a total harvest.
"It has become more difficult to procure fine-quality pearls," said Linda Hanson, senior vice president for merchandising at Tiffany. "We have adjusted some pearl pricing over the past several months and probably will be adjusting some others prices in the next few months as well."
The supply problem will last until at least 2001, the minimum amount of time needed for young, healthy oysters to mature and produce pearls. But it could drag on even longer because it is too soon to tell whether the young oysters will remain healthy.
"All we can do is stay away from these areas considered the problem," said Koichi Takahashi, senior vice president of the Mikimoto (America) Company, the largest distributor of cultured pearls in the United States, which operates its own oyster farm in Japan.
So jewelers like Matthew Wilson are left to wonder just how long they can keep from, once again, raising prices. Because he doubled his wholesale pearl order this year, Mr. Wilson, an owner of Wilson & Son in Scarsdale, said his supply should hold up for a while. But he cannot afford to buy nearly as many pearls as he would like and says he will have an even tougher time buying enough next year.
Gold dealers and the costume jewelry trade may be counting on finding a competitive edge. But with consumer confidence so high, jewelry experts predicted, shoppers will still plunk down gold cards for pearls.
"Price is not an object in this market," said Lynn Ramsey, president of the Jewelry Information Center in New York. In fact, she added, the shortage may make pearls even more appealing. "People are willing to go to great lengths to get something of rarity and value," she said.
Still, even in this market, not everyone can afford to pay top dollar. So bargain-hunters may opt for a single-pearl pendant instead of a strand or may choose lower-quality cultured pearls, whose prices are also rising but not as rapidly.
A necklace of low-quality Akoya pearls now costs 15 percent to 20 percent more than it did last year. But at roughly $500, that is about a third what a high-quality string costs. Cheaper ones are also in short supply but not as severely as the finest pearls.
Once, natural pearls -- formed when a tiny foreign object like a grain of sand enters an oyster -- were the only ones available. But a century ago it was discovered that a foreign object could be inserted into an oyster to stimulate the formation of a pearl, giving rise to cultured pearls, which now make up about 70 percent of the American market. The rest is split between Tahitian and South Sea pearls, the most expensive variety, and freshwater pearls, the cheapest. These pearls are not affected by the Akoya problem.
That is of little comfort to the Akoya oyster farmers, particularly small suppliers who have less wherewithal to withstand a crisis. "They will suffer loss of income," Mr. Nomura said. "They are all affected."
There is one bright spot for some oyster farmers -- edible oysters have not been as hard hit. Those oysters, which are different from Akoyas, are grown in separate farms that the virus has not ravaged.
As for the Akoyas, farmers were first alerted to the problem when scientists noticed that an increasing number of oyster muscles were turning red or brown, which signaled that they were likely to die. Farmers then began to isolate healthy oysters, but even that did not make a difference.
Three factors are generally accepted as the most serious causes: climate changes, red tide -- a severe rise in plankton, microscopic organisms found naturally in the water that cause the color to turn red and kill the oysters -- and an unrelated mystery virus. Speculation about possible causes focuses on the use of chemicals in fish farming and on poor oxygen levels in water because of overcrowding of oysters in cages.
Red tide and unpredictable weather have sent the pearl industry into turmoil before, but the virus that has scientists perplexed is relatively new. Scientists are not sure of its origin, but they think that once it took hold, unseasonably warm weather increased water temperatures and enabled it to thrive.
"Everybody is blaming everything, and it is really hard to determine what is the main cause," Mr. Takahashi of Mikimoto said. What is not in dispute is that if the industry is unable to find a solution, brides may soon have as hard a time affording high-quality cultured pearls as that perfect wedding gown.

HEADLINE: Gandhi's Voice Summoned to Condemn India's A-Tests

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 23

 BODY:
For years now, it has been hard for the followers of Mohandas K. Gandhi and his creed of nonviolence to make themselves heard above the clamor and indifference of modern India.
But as S. K. Bandopadhaya has discovered in the two weeks since India erupted in jubilation over its five nuclear tests beneath the desert of Rajasthan, making the Gandhian case against Indian membership in the club of nuclear-armed nations has been like shouting into a cyclone in the Bay of Bengal. 
 So Mr. Bandopadhaya makes his case quietly, reaching for the bookshelf in his office as secretary of the Gandhi Memorial Trust, across the road from the riverbank where grieving crowds flocked to Gandhi's funeral pyre after his assassination on Jan. 30, 1948. Quiet is a watchword at the trust, which like most Gandhian institutions operates these days in the backwaters of Indian life.
Thumbing painstakingly through a Gandhi biography this week, Mr. Bandopadhaya, who at 73 is old enough to have joined the ranks of Gandhi's followers while the Mahatma was still alive, finally found the passage he wanted and began to read. It was from a commentary Gandhi wrote in his newspaper, Harijan, on June 30, 1947, referring to the American atomic bombing of Japan 22 months earlier.
"So far as I can see, the atomic bomb has decimated the finest feelings that have sustained mankind for ages," Gandhi wrote. "There used to be the so-called laws of war which made war tolerable, but now we know the naked truth, that war knows no law, except that of might. The atom bomb brought an empty victory to the allied armies, but it resulted for the time being in destroying the soul of Japan."
Picking up another book, Mr. Bandopadhaya reached into the early days of Gandhi's battle to keep the Indian freedom struggle nonviolent.
"If India takes up the doctrine of the sword, she may gain momentary victory," Gandhi wrote in Young India, as his newspaper was then called, on Aug. 11, 1920. "Then India will cease to be the pride of my heart." He added, still speaking of India, "I believe absolutely that she has a mission for all the world."
On the face of things, Gandhi's teachings have had little impact during the surge of nationalism over the nuclear tests, which surveys after the first tests on May 11 indicate won the support of more than 90 percent of Indians. The support emboldened the Hindu nationalists who lead India's Government. They quickly shifted from quiet justifications of the tests as necessary for India's national security to more strident statements about India's wishing to "silence its enemies" and give a warning to its archrival, Pakistan.
But Mr. Bandopadhaya, whose organization stands at the apex of scores of Gandhian institutions in India, says the United States and other countries that reacted with dismay to the tests should be patient. Other Indians agree, and say Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his associates in the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu nationalist group that leads the Government, may yet find that they have misjudged the nation's mood, and its needs.
"This is a passing phase, and the pendulum will swing back," Mr. Bandopadhaya said, closing his books. "So I humbly submit that the world should not feel so disappointed; the soul of India is not dead. Out of this debris, the real India will emerge. Gandhi or no Gandhi, his values of truth and nonviolence are rooted in our national consciousness. Gandhi has held up his lamp to light our path, and his values remain."
Opposition to the tests within India was slow in developing, but it has already shown signs of building. At first, even some veteran Gandhians endorsed the blasts, hunting through their own recollections for examples where Gandhi approved the use of force, as when "freedom fighters" from Pakistan rushed into Kashmir in the fall of 1947 in a vain attempt to seize the disputed territory, only to be halted by Indian troops.
But criticism has not been limited to the Mahatma's followers. A group of 100 Indian scientists signed a protest from institutes and universities here and abroad. The signers included at least one scientist in the United States, Dr. A. P. Balachandran of Syracuse University.
"We wish to recall here, emphatically, the horror that is nuclear war," the scientists wrote. "We stand firmly with the long tradition of eminent scientists who have consistently argued against the induction of nuclear weapons. The horrors of nuclear war can never be forgotten, whatever pride we feel in India's scientific and technological achievements."
Other scientists were harassed by Hindu nationalist extremists as they gathered for a protest meeting in Bangalore this week. Nationalists jostled them, shouting: "You are all anti-national. There is no difference between you, the Pakistanis and the Chinese" -- a reference to Prime Minister Vajpayee's justification of the tests as a counter to threats from Pakistan and China.
The scientists invited the nationalists to join their discussions; they refused, but eventually dispersed when the police were called.
In the first days after the tests, most major opposition political leaders lined up behind the Government's move. But later, several revised their position, perhaps sensing that public euphoria was receding.
One possible sign of the shifting mood came, awkwardly for Mr. Vajpayee, when he visited the craters at the Pokharan testing range on Wednesday. Among the villagers who had lined up to see the Prime Minister was one group lofting a banner in English reading, "We want a permanent hospital in Khetolai," the village nearest to the test site.
One leader who criticized the tests this week, after first endorsing them, was Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born leader of the Congress Party and daughter-in-law of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. (The late Mrs. Gandhi, who was not related to Mohandas K. Gandhi, approved India's only previous nuclear test, in May 1974). Sonia Gandhi, who at first said the tests were a "national matter," said Thursday that the tests were not a show of strength, as Mr. Vajpayee contended.
"Real strength lies in restraint and not in the use of it," she said. "Science should be used for removing poverty and backwardness in the country."
Her remarks touched on the issue that many opponents of the tests hope will be the nationalists' undoing -- the ephemeral increase in national pride from the tests, measured against the lasting indignities Indians suffer from poverty, disease, unemployment and other social scourges. Indian newspaper commentaries since the tests have noted that the popularity of Indira Gandhi surged after the 1974 tests, only to plummet so severely within 13 months that she declared an emergency, suspended civil liberties and lost the ensuing election in 1977.
It is a hope that inspires Gandhians like Mr. Bandopadhaya.
"While our leaders are talking about nuclear bombs as a deliverance," he said, "350 million of our people remain below the poverty line, nearly 50 percent of our population is illiterate, and 100,000 of our villages don't even have safe drinking water. In the villages of Rajasthan, where they detonated these bombs, many women still walk 10 to 12 miles a day just to fetch water."
He added: "This is the real India, the India that Indians actually live in. And when all the fuss and shouting dies down, they will realize that nuclear bombs do nothing, absolutely nothing, to help them."

HEADLINE: THE FALL OF SUHARTO: THE OVERVIEW;
Indonesia Struggles to Find New Reasons to Stay Intact

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SURABAYA, Indonesia, May 23

 BODY:
To travel around Indonesia is to be overwhelmed by its diversity, from the tribespeople at the eastern end of the country who wear loin cloths (or even less) to the strict Muslims at the western tip, where some women could scarcely wear more.
About all those two areas have in common, in fact, is a history of secessionist movements. 
 So the collapse of the strongman rule of President Suharto, toppled Thursday after 32 years in power, raises basic questions about the future of an illogical chain of 17,000 islands that today are clumped together as Indonesia.
Mr. Suharto was a ruthless leader, but he forged modern Indonesia, suppressing militant Islam in a country where 90 percent of the people are Muslims and preaching harmony with the Christian, Hindu and animist minorities. Partly because of his sermons about moderation, and partly because of his readiness to use brute force, he not only held together this improbable archipelago but even expanded it by invading East Timor in 1975 and adding it to his island collection.
So when the students ousted Mr. Suharto this week, they also created profound uncertainties about what kind of a country Indonesia will be. Above all, a more democratic Indonesia will have to confront wrenching questions about religious coexistence and about whether there is anything but force that can serve as the national adhesive.
"Indonesia is not a kingdom but an empire," said an American businessman with broad experience in this country.
"Suharto was like Tito, in that he has been a very strong leader who has been able to hold a diverse country together the way Tito did in Yugoslavia.
"But now, can Indonesia stay together?"
Many experts say that Indonesia is so unpredictable in the post-Suharto era that no one knows quite how to analyze it, but the most common view appears to be that an Indonesian identity is well enough established that the country will muddle along for some time the way it is.
"I think that the possibility of Indonesia disintegrating is not so strong," said Muthiah Alagappa, a specialist on Southeast Asia at the East-West Center in Honolulu. But Mr. Alagappa emphasized the difficulties that a more open Indonesia will face in maintaining harmony among its people.
"The possibility of religious conflict is there," he said. "How the Muslim majority will treat the Christian minority and the Hindu minority and the Chinese -- that is very important."
Under Mr. Suharto, no one was allowed to preach hatred, and yet the bitterness toward the ethnic Chinese -- who are less than 3 percent of the population but control half the economy -- runs deep. The antagonisms might become still more dangerous if a more democratic Indonesia permits the news media to inflame hatreds by openly reporting the things that now are only whispered: that the ethnic Chinese are to blame for the financial crisis, that they are ruining Indonesia, that they are taking over the country.
If Indonesia adopts a system of direct presidential elections, then -- judging from comments by ordinary Indonesian workers and peasants -- a candidate might some day win votes by running on a platform of expelling the Chinese and creating an Islamic state.
"We should expel all the Chinese," said Suprapto, a 36-year-old worker doing odd jobs here in Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city. "If a politician said that, everybody would vote for him."
That is an exaggeration, and in many ways Indonesia is an extraordinarily mellow and harmonious mix of cultures and religions. But this harmony was fostered by Mr. Suharto's dictatorship, and some diplomats and other analysts fear that democracy may be more combustible.
"Frankly, I worry about the rise of Muslim fundamentalism in this chaos," a senior Western diplomat said.
Developments here will be watched with tremendous interest throughout Asia. Countries like Malaysia are also grappling with the appropriate role of Islam and Chinese minorities, while empires like China are facing the problem of how to deal with groups like the Tibetans or the Uighurs, who might prefer to strike out on their own.
The uncertainties arise in part because Indonesia as a country does not make much sense. Like some African countries, Indonesia is a geographic absurdity, arising in its present form simply because colonial powers were in such a rush to grab territory that they did not pay attention to the peoples who lived there.
The island of Java is the densely populated hub of Indonesia, home to 60 percent of the nation's 210 million people, and it has been civilized longer than Britain. But neighboring Bali is Hindu, and the islands to the east are mostly Christian. At the eastern tip is Irian Jaya, an undeveloped region where some women in the hills wear only grass skirts and some men wear only penis sheaths.
Irian Jaya, accounting for one-fifth of the area of Indonesia, is part of an island whose other half is the independent country of Papua New Guinea. The island is divided today because the Dutch grabbed what is now Irian Jaya while the Germans and British colonized the Papua half.
At the other end of the country, the Dutch seized part of the island of Borneo, and that part is now Indonesian, while the British took another part, now Malaysian. And parts of the island of Sumatra had historically been economically and culturally integrated with the Malay peninsula, but because the Dutch moved in they are now Indonesia.
Centuries of Dutch colonization -- and, more important, the independence struggle against the Dutch -- did create a sense of unity and common destiny in much of the country. Indonesians from many islands fought the Dutch and became the first Asian people to win independence by armed struggle.
Mr. Suharto and his predecessor, Sukarno, also worked hard to forge a sense of unity and to some extent succeeded, so that today much of Indonesia does have a shared sense of nationhood. One dialect was proclaimed the national language, Indonesian, and is now widely spoken throughout the country, helping to integrate a country where people speak hundreds of languages -- up to 700 in Irian Jaya alone.
But even now, people in remote areas often cannot speak Indonesian, and the linguistic barriers are immense. The tiny island of Alor is a rugged speck with 140,000 people divided among 50 tribes and almost as many languages, falling within 7 distinct language groups.
Secessionist sentiments have been a problem in places like Irian Jaya, East Timor, Sulawesi, and the conservative Muslim stronghold of Aceh at the western tip of the country, and no one knows if the problems will flare up again.
"One concern that people may have is that the new Government will be weak, and if Jakarta is weak then secessionist movements may gain strength," said Bruce Gale, an Indonesia expert at the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy in Singapore. Mr. Gale noted that many parts of the country believe that their resources are being exploited by the central Government or by distant conglomerates and added, "A new government will have to address this and will have to deal with criticisms from other provinces that they are being milked by Java."
The issue of how to deal with the regions is rarely discussed because it is still largely a taboo to admit that not all people in the country are happy being Indonesian.
A rare hint of the risks came from Mr. Suharto himself, when he warned shortly before his resignation that unless Indonesia sticks with its present Constitution and ideology of moderation, "then there will be a great danger to our national cohesion." He said that a result could be "great conflict that would threaten our development and even give rise to civil war."
The uncertainties have to do with political will rather than military abilities. The army is made up overwhelmingly of Muslim troops from the main parts of Indonesia and is a professional force that seems certain to stay together and to be able to fight, if so ordered, to preserve the national borders.
Yet democracies often have difficulty mustering the will to suppress secessionists. Issues of secession are among the most painful that democracies ever face, as they were in America in the 19th century and as they are in Russia today. In Indonesia, university students in the pro-democracy movement so far have not quite confronted the issue of whether democratic rights should be extended to secessionists.
When students protesting for democracy at the Parliament building in the last few days were asked how a more democratic Indonesia should deal with separatist movements, they grew extremely agitated. On several occasions, groups of students began yelling at an Indonesian interpreter, berating him for asking treacherous questions about secessionist sentiment.
"It is impossible for this country to come apart," said Yusman, 19, a management student in the Parliament building, as his friends cheered him on.
Yet when pressed hard enough, almost all students concluded -- although they were not entirely happy with their conclusion -- that Timorese or Acehnese or others should continue to be imprisoned if they advocate independence.
Still, among Indonesia's educated elite, some people do emphasize that force will no longer be an adequate glue to hold the country together. They are ambivalent, determined to preserve the country but reluctant to rely on coercion, and they emphasize that Indonesia must try new approaches.

HEADLINE: Democrats Hope to Trim Their Pool of Candidates

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
In a nod to an era of politics that has almost passed in New York State, Democratic leaders and candidates will assemble in Westchester County this week for a convention that is shaping up as a freewheeling if inconclusive gathering, with just a hint of the suspense that was once a staple of such meetings.
For all the ceremony that will accompany the Democrats as they convene on Wednesday morning in Rye Brook, the role of the state committee in this year's elections is circumscribed. The selection of Democratic candidates for governor, United States senator, attorney general and perhaps lieutenant governor will almost certainly be made by Democratic voters in the primary on Sept. 15. 
 Accordingly, Democratic leaders have set themselves two main goals for their quadrennial convention: to try to limit the number of candidates who appear on the primary ballot, and thus minimize intraparty strife, and to use what they hope will be a well-covered two-day forum to begin making the Democratic case against Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and Gov. George E. Pataki.
"I don't want our message to be obscured by the process," said Judith Hope, the party chairwoman. "I'm determined to make this convention about George Pataki's failure to jump-start the economy in upstate New York, and about D'Amato's propensity to reinvent himself every six years. I want a convention that is positive and forward-looking and that gets across the Democratic message."
The convention -- 353 delegates elected from the 62 counties, gathered in a hotel in wooded central Westchester -- will stand as a testimonial to a party that is in much transition and some trouble. The Democratic Party lost its bid to unseat a Republican Mayor in New York City last November, and faces tough going again this year in its challenges to both Mr. Pataki and, to a lesser extent, Mr. D'Amato.
Mario M. Cuomo, the former Governor who dominated the Democratic Party for 12 years, is not even planning to attend; his absence will no doubt underscore the vacuum in the party as it awaits the emergence of a new generation of high-profile leaders. At the same time, the decision by Vice President Al Gore to deliver the keynote speech on Wednesday is a reminder of the influence the state party will exert in the 2000 Democratic presidential selection.
Even with these expectations, the candidates and their supporters approached the gathering in a frenzy of politicking and preconvention maneuvering. It is far from clear what the play of the field will be at the end of the week, and whether party leaders' attempts at exerting some control over the proceedings will succeed.
The main task for the delegates is to sift through the candidates seeking to run for statewide office. A candidate who wins at least 51 percent of the convention vote is the official designee of the party. It is a dubious distinction, since the designee can still be challenged in a primary, and as a rule, Democratic designees tend to lose to challengers in primaries.
Candidates need 25 percent of the delegate votes to win a spot on the primary ballot. Failing that, they have to circulate petitions to gather signatures from 15,000 registered Democrats, an expensive and, by design, prohibitive process.
Among the races, the selection of the gubernatorial candidates, scheduled for Wednesday, is shaping up as one of the more intriguing portions of the convention.
Supporters of Peter F. Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker and one of five Democrats seeking the gubernatorial nomination, believe he can win 51 percent of the vote to become the party designee. Some of Mr. Vallone's advisers believe he will be able to keep any of the other four from winning 25 percent of the vote -- and that could produce one of the more interesting confrontations of the week.
Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, the other major contender for governor, had comparatively little support among delegates as of yesterday. But she has the financial resources to circulate petitions and get on the ballot, which her advisers said she would certainly do.
Mr. Vallone believes his best chance against Ms. McCaughey Ross is one-on-one, which is why he is trying at the convention to keep other candidates off the ballot.
But advisers to Ms. McCaughey Ross, trying to counter Mr. Vallone's move and crowd the ballot with other men, said they were likely to instruct her delegates to support any of the male candidates who comes close to 25 percent, in the hope of putting them over the top. "This is going to be a very pragmatic race," said Stephen Sabbeth, the Nassau County leader and Ms. McCaughey Ross's most prominent supporter.
Right now, the beneficiary of that strategy would likely be James L. Larocca, the former State Transportation Commissioner, or Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney, who said he would not go the petition route if he did not win 25 percent. The fifth candidate, Richard A. Kahan, the former chairman of the state's Urban Development Corporation, does not as of now appear to have significant support.
Mr. Vallone's supporters are trying to check Ms. McCaughey Ross's effort by suggesting that Mr. Larocca drop out and become Mr. Vallone's lieutenant governor. That would insure Mr. Vallone a commanding majority at the convention, and would present what many Democrats believe would be a reasonably strong ticket in the fall. Governor and lieutenant governor are chosen separately in the primary process but run as one ticket in the general election.
Mr. Larocca is presumably susceptible to such overtures because Mr. Sabbeth, who had been his most important patron, abandoned him for Ms. McCaughey Ross before the convention. But in an interview, Mr. Larocca heatedly said he had no interest in running as Mr. Vallone's running mate. "I am a candidate for governor," he said. "I am not a candidate for any other office."
If a Vallone-Larocca deal does not work out, Mr. Vallone is said to be leaning toward Clyde Rabideau, the Mayor of Plattsburgh, as a running mate.
A similar, if less suspenseful, struggle is going on in the Senate race. Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn and Geraldine A. Ferraro, the former vice presidential candidate, are assured spots on the ballot. The third candidate, Mark Green, the New York City Public Advocate, is not as of now.
There is some disagreement among Ms. Ferraro's supporters whether she should send some of her delegates to Mr. Green to force a three-way race, or try to come out of the convention with as much strength as possible. Democratic officials said yesterday that Ms. Ferraro might be spared that decision because the convention might decide to hold two ballots. Delegates could vote for Mr. Green on the second ballot, assuring him his 25 percent.
In the race for attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, a former prosecutor, and G. Oliver Koppell, a former Attorney General, are both said to have more than enough support to get on the ballot. A third candidate, State Senator Catherine M. Abate, is said to be just below 25 percent, but party leaders said that she, too, might be placed on the primary ballot on a second vote of the convention.
A fourth candidate, Evan A. Davis, a former counsel to Mr. Cuomo, is said to be short of the 25 percent.

HEADLINE: Mayor May Trade a Term Limits Deal for Support on Stadium Issue

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani will consider leading a campaign to abolish term limits for City Council members if the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, drops his drive for a referendum on a new Yankee Stadium, the Mayor said yesterday.
The city's voters have twice endorsed term limits, so several city officials assert that only a high-profile campaign by someone like the Mayor could bring about a change in the law that will force the retirement of most of the current Council after the elections in 2001. 
 This is a second effort by the Mayor to head off the Speaker's plan to let voters decide whether the city can use tax money to help the Yankees build a new baseball stadium in Manhattan instead of the Bronx.
The Mayor, who has often pointed to the economic benefits of a stadium in Manhattan, retaliated by creating a panel to propose changes for the City Charter for consideration by voters in November. By law, a charter question would knock any other measure off the ballot.
As a compromise, the Mayor could propose charter changes to rescind term limits for Council members, officials said. Randy M. Mastro, the Deputy Mayor for Operations, said Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Vallone had talked about the idea of the Mayor campaigning to end term limits for Council members but not the Mayor.
"It is ironic, now, that Peter Vallone would be jeopardizing this potential initiative that would be so vital to helping his members run for re-election, by insisting on pushing a stadium referendum that can't possibly get on the ballot," Mr. Mastro said.
The possible trade was first reported yesterday by The New York Post. At a news conference yesterday, the Mayor did not dispute the possibility. "As far as term limits are concerned, that's something that the Charter Revision Commission has to look at," he said. "What I've said is that I would not seek to change the term limits with regard to the Mayor. I think two terms is a sensible rule."
Mr. Giuliani repeated his assertion that a stadium referendum could drive the Yankees out of New York City. "Referenda on baseball stadiums lead to baseball teams leaving," he said. That view was echoed on Friday by former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is acting as an unpaid adviser to the principal owner of the Yankees, George M. Steinbrenner 3d.
Mr. Mastro said the Mayor and the Speaker had not discussed a deal. "Obviously, the Mayor would be helping City Council members if he were ever to support a referendum to end term limits for City Council members," Mr. Mastro said. "So in making that determination, it is certainly appropriate to consider circumstances in which he has asked the Speaker to take certain actions or forbear from certain actions."
Mr. Vallone's spokesman, Michael S. Clendenin, discounted the trial balloon. "Who's the Mayor kidding?" he said. "The voters have spoken on term limits twice already."

HEADLINE: Taxi Owners Deftly Dodge Claims of Accident Victims

SERIES: HAILING DANGER: The Liability Question

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW and ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
The taxi came barreling up Third Avenue late on a damp October night. As the driver tried to bear left, the cab skidded onto a traffic island, slamming into Edward Shalala, who was waiting to cross the street. He was hurled onto the pavement, his face a bloody mess and his right leg shattered, as his surgeon put it, "like cornflakes."
In five operations since the 1992 accident, doctors put Mr. Shalala, a 48-year-old artist, back together well enough that he can hobble around on crutches. And last year a jury tried to make him whole financially with a $3.2 million award for damages. But it was mostly an empty promise. 
 Already undone by an erratic cabby, Mr. Shalala then fell victim to the dodging and weaving the taxi industry uses to avoid paying large claims, even in devastating accidents. Unable to collect the jury's award, Mr. Shalala settled this year with the taxi company for $132,000.
The sharp rise in taxi and livery accidents since 1990 and the recent spate of high-profile collisions have fed an image of rogue cabbies run amok. But the drivers are only the most visible players in a lucrative industry that has deftly used laws and regulations to keep its earnings safe, even as its cabs hurt more and more people.
Interviews and an examination of dozens of lawsuits show that cab companies are among the most recalcitrant businesses in paying claims to accident victims. And while the city has long ignored these practices, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is now roiling the industry with a proposal to clamp down on dangerous drivers and make it easier for injured people to collect.
Most of the city's 12,000 cabs and 30,000 car-service vehicles carry minimal liability insurance, far less than most trucking and bus companies. Many taxi owners, including those with large fleets, organize their operations into subsets of much smaller companies, protecting the bulk of their assets from lawsuits.
And the biggest asset in the yellow cab industry, the taxi medallion, is the hardest to seize. As the taxi industry has boomed and the limited pool of medallions -- the valuable permits to operate a cab -- has soared in value to an average of $275,000 each, owners have routinely used them as security for loans. So even when the rare victim tries to seize a medallion in court, it is common to find that the owner has attached so much debt to it that there is little money left to recover.
In Mr. Shalala's case, the owners of the taxi company -- two former city cabbies -- borrowed $100,000 against their medallions just as a state court judge was entering the $3.2 million judgment, complicating Mr. Shalala's efforts to collect.
In another instance, a taxi owner named Natan More, who was facing two suits from accident victims, defied a judge's order by borrowing $1.6 million using his medallions as collateral. He also took off on a sailing trip in the Mediterranean, according to court papers, saying he had "no clue" when he would return.
Through such tactics, the industry has transformed the medallion -- the 4-by-5-inch rectangle of aluminum bolted to the hood of every yellow taxi -- into both a source of wealth and a financial shield.
"The way the game is set up with the taxi companies," said Vito A. Cannavo, a lawyer who has pursued many injury claims, "you're chasing phantoms all over the place."
Until recently, these concerns always hovered just below the political radar screen, mainly because few of the millions of taxi patrons realize the high stakes involved in one of the most ordinary acts of city life -- hopping into a cab.
With cab and livery accidents up 41 percent since 1990, to 12,557 in 1996, the latest year for which figures were available, Mr. Giuliani has vowed to lower the stakes. He has called for more stringent safety regulations to pull reckless cabbies from the road. In 1996, police figures show, taxi accidents injured 20,000 people, about 850 seriously, and killed 29, mostly pedestrians.
Mr. Giuliani would require taxi and livery operators to increase their insurance to cover medical bills and to compensate victims for pain and physical damage. The liability coverage would rise to $100,000 for each victim, from a current minimum of $25,000. Owners of yellow cabs also would have to post a $100,000 bond to guarantee that victims who win court judgments could collect up to that much more.
The proposals, due to be considered by the Taxi and Limousine Commission this week, have been denounced as punitive in protests by drivers. Owners say they could price some companies and many independent cabbies out of the business.
"The industry has a bad reputation because it is easy to focus on the bad things," said David L. Beier, a lawyer for Transit Systems Ltd., a company owned by one of the wealthiest families in the industry. "The only thing you hear about are the terrible accidents." Mr. Beier acknowledged that the industry fights to hold down accident claims but, he said, "there are serious claims that we feel bad about, and we do everything we can to settle."
Industry analysts say that New York City has traditionally been one of the toughest places for victims of taxi accidents to collect damages. A few cities -- most notably Washington -- also have tortuous systems, with low insurance levels and high legal hurdles. But the Mayor's changes would go a long way toward bringing New York in line with cities like Chicago and San Francisco, where most cabs carry several hundred thousand dollars' worth of insurance coverage.
Alan L. Fuchsberg, a Manhattan lawyer who has represented dozens of people injured in taxi accidents, said the Mayor's plan "certainly would be an improvement, but I don't think it's enough." Noting that other business concerns, like trucking companies and commercial buildings, typically have $500,000 to $1 million in liability insurance, he said: "The concern is that a seriously injured person would still in no way be compensated for the full extent of their injuries."
 
The Owners
Medallions Produce And Shield Wealth
 The glittering promise of the medallion is embodied in a trio of Russian immigrants known in the industry as "The Three Wise Men."
Like generations of immigrants before them, two brothers, Fred and Victor Weingarten, and a relative, Jacob Popovic, the owners of Transit Systems, started out as cabdrivers. They made their first deals to buy medallions in the late 1970's, from a booth in a Queens coffee shop. Now they and their families own 240 yellow taxi medallions, worth more than $66 million.
Their wealth has given them much to protect. And like other medallion owners -- large and small -- the Wise Men have managed to insulate themselves from normal business risks and place most of their assets out of reach of accident victims. In fact, their holdings are arranged so precisely that, to someone suing them, they never seem any bigger than the small company they were when they first started out.
The industry has established this finely honed system over many years. During the Depression, the city limited the number of medallions to curb an oversupply of cabs. Since then, these limits have protected owners from open competition while propelling the cost of the permits from $10 each in the 1930's to an average of $275,000 today -- or $3.4 billion for the entire supply.
Medallions are tickets to a cash-rich business. Each cab brings in up to $100,000 a year in fares. There are even medallion brokers, who help owners -- particularly retired cabbies -- sell or lease their pieces of tin. These absentee owners are paid up to $1,700 a month simply to let other drivers use their licenses.
While the city has helped medallion owners thrive, its regulators have rarely challenged their system for limiting liability for accidents. For decades, big operators have divided their holdings into a series of small companies, each owning just two or three medallions. The practice was condemned by a State Supreme Court judge 40 years ago as "a legalized racket to avoid liability for payment of the negligent maiming and killing by taxicabs." But the appeals court later sanctioned the arrangement as long as taxi executives do not commingle the corporations' funds or treat them as personal treasuries.
Through these arrangements, even large-scale medallion owners keep the bulk of their assets safe if one of their cabs injures someone in an accident. For example, the 240 medallions belonging to the three Transit Systems partners are split into 119 corporations. Cab owners have also been allowed to use their medallions to secure loans since the taxi and banking industries pushed through a state law sanctioning the practice in 1969. Loading medallions with debt makes them less attractive to litigants.
"When one owner can own 100 cars in different corporations, and then mortgage them to protect his assets from accident victims, that's wrong," said Pam Liapakis, a former president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association. "The purpose of the corporate law is being subverted."
But Mr. Beier, the lawyer for Transit Systems, said this practice "is not a subterfuge." He added: "Every person who owns a business puts it in a form to protect him from liability."
Yet one major difference is that with their assets hidden under debt, taxi companies do not have to carry as much insurance as other businesses. A decade ago, many cabs carried $100,000 in liability coverage, but nearly all fell to minimal levels after the largest taxi insurer, American Transit Insurance Company, dropped the higher coverage.
Edward T. McGettigan Jr., the underwriting manager at American Transit, said the company's losses were too great with the higher coverage because nearly every claim cost more to settle and people tended to exaggerate their injuries. "Most people, when they get into a car accident, they think they hit the Lotto," he said.
 
The Typical Cases
Stalling Tactics Wear Out Victims
Lucille Williams hardly hit the jackpot. It has been five years since one cab collided with another, then smashed into Mrs. Williams as she walked near the Queensboro Bridge. Her injuries, including a fractured pelvis, forced her to quit her job as an aide at a day care center because she could no longer lift the toddlers.
Mrs. Williams's case bogged down amid routine stalling tactics by the cab companies. Court hearings were delayed, Mrs. Williams's lawyer, Lamont Bailey, said, because the companies sent lawyers who were not familiar with the case, and the drivers missed scheduled depositions. Mrs. Williams, worn down, finally agreed to settle two months ago. Her share: $20,000. And even that, Mr. Bailey said, "was like getting blood from a stone."
Taxi companies are known for battling over liability, using all of the tactics of the hardball world of personal-injury claims, plus their particular brand of asset protection. Plaintiffs' lawyers, who are paid a share of what their clients collect, are well aware of these frustrations, and some say they cringe when a taxi victim walks in the door.
Cases with disfiguring injuries are particularly contentious. One increasing cause of those injuries is the bullet-resistant partition now required in yellow taxis.
Robert A. Levy, a lawyer who handled a case in which the side of a woman's nose was ripped off when she hit a partition, said that if she had been hurt in a building or a bus, her injuries would have been worth $75,000. But he said she had to settle for $28,500 -- $25,000 of insurance and $3,500 from the driver himself, paid in 12 monthly installments.
When suing a large taxi operator, the best hope for a sizable settlement is to try to "pierce the corporate veil" and show that the fleet operates as a single company, not a bunch of disconnected little ones.
A rare success came in a case of a Roman Catholic nun who suffered a serious leg injury in 1993 when a taxi pulled away while she was getting into it. The fleet, with 72 medallions split among 33 companies, fought her until mid-1996, when her lawyers found that it had tied together most of the small companies to secure $3.5 million in loans. The fleet owner paid a $100,000 settlement.
But that is often difficult, if not impossible. When Rita Sklar was struck and killed by a cab on East 64th Street, her family's lawyer, Guy I. Smiley, said that the cab company's lawyer told him to expect to recover nothing more than the minimum $50,000 death benefit. "He said, 'We got a minimum policy. That's it -- no excess, no assets, nothing' " Mr. Smiley recalled.
In fact, the two-cab company was run by Fred Weingarten of Transit Systems, and it was part of the $66 million empire built by the trio of Russian immigrants. Mr. Smiley found an easier target: a construction site at the corner where the accident occurred. Both the building owner and the contractor carried $1 million in liability insurance, and the cabdriver contended that plywood sheeting around the site had blocked his view.
Employing what he calls "legal creativity," Mr. Smiley is now suing the contractor and building owner.
 
The Extreme Case
A Shattered Life And a Refusal to Pay
For Mr. Shalala, the accident altered almost every aspect of his life.
His ankle, reconstructed with metal plates and bone from his hip and covered with flesh grafted from his back, is a bulgy patchwork of skin and scar. When he walks now, using crutches, he can feel the screws in his ankle rubbing against his bones.
His recovery, incomplete as it is, took two years in a wheelchair and thousands of physical therapy sessions. After walking eight blocks to his home on Delancey Street on a recent night, he arrived nearly in tears from the throbbing pain in his right leg.
Damaged and demoralized, Mr. Shalala, a cousin of Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, depends on a nurse's aide to bring him groceries and to do his laundry. Even his artwork is different. His paintings, once five-foot-high abstracts with images burned into them with a steam iron and a torch, are now much smaller and more delicately worked in deference to his disability.
Mr. Shalala's adversaries in the six years since the accident have been a pair of former cabbies, John Letsios and Dimitrios Theofanis, owners of the Platform Cab Corporation, a small company that leases out two medallions. But unlike Mr. Shalala, they were relatively unaffected by the accident. The company kept operating. And when a judge found it to be liable for the accident, not only did the owners try to avoid paying Mr. Shalala, but they also continued borrowing money against their medallions to protect their assets.
The driver who hit Mr. Shalala was Bhagwan Singh. The accident was his third of 1992; his fourth came the next day. Since then, his license has been suspended four times. Last week, Mr. Singh completed the last suspension, for running a red light while under sanctions for drunken driving.
Mr. Shalala filed a lawsuit in March 1994. But after fighting through the legal process, he was upset to find that in December 1996, just two weeks after a judge held Platform and Mr. Singh liable, Mr. Letsios and Mr. Theofanis borrowed $132,000 against their medallions.
Then last June, after a Brooklyn jury had awarded Mr. Shalala the $3.2 million, the men applied for an additional loan of $100,000 -- "for business investment," the loan papers said. The documents show that the two men received their checks four days before Mr. Shalala's lawyer, Eric H. Green, received formal notice of the judgment, which he needed before he could block them from draining the company's assets.
State law allows businesses to borrow against an asset until a judgment is executed and collection notices are served. But moving the money around makes it harder for an accident victim to collect, and Mr. Green's plans to chase that last $100,000 stalled when he was told by Platform's leasing agent that the two owners lived in Greece.
When Mr. Green tried to seize Platform's medallions, another surprise awaited him: Platform faced lawsuits stemming from three other accidents. This allowed the company effectively to play the victims off each other for the funds that were left.
In January, Mr. Shalala, afraid that he might never get anything if he kept waiting, agreed to settle for $132,000. Much of the money will end up going to Medicaid or Medicare, which paid some of his medical bills.
Mr. Shalala said his experience with Platform has left him queasy. "I basically think they're crooks," he said. "It was the taxicab company that made this situation, and it should be their responsibility to help me. Instead I feel like they were hiding from the law and hiding from the court."
In fact, some of the money borrowed against Platform's medallions may never have left the country. Mr. Theofanis lives in Flushing, Queens, not Greece, and is a banquet waiter at a Manhattan hotel. In a brief interview at the hotel, he said he had no direct role in running his cabs.
As for the accident, Mr. Theofanis said: "Those things happen, you know? People will sue for anything. For anything. You could trip coming down this ramp, and I'll be in trouble."
 
The Regulators
Agency Views Suits From the Sideline
The Taxi and Limousine Commission, charged with overseeing the business, has historically done little to insure that medallion owners take care of accident victims.
Current and former commission officials say the agency has viewed that as a matter for the courts. It does not keep track of how much owners borrow against their medallions. Nor does it punish owners who fail to honor court judgments. It has intervened in rare cases where owners have tried to sell a medallion that is subject to a large injury claim, making sure enough money was set aside to cover an award.
Several personal injury lawyers say that even when the commission has tried to help accident victims, it has sometimes bungled.
They point to the case of Mr. More, the medallion owner who went sailing in the Mediterranean with two huge accident suits looming. He defied a judge's order last year by borrowing $1.6 million against his medallions, then quit making payments on the loans. When the lenders decided to seize the medallions, the taxi commission helped alert the lawyer for one of the victims, but inexplicably failed to tell the other's lawyer until it was too late.
The first victim was able to work out a $200,000 settlement with the lenders. Frank V. Floriani, the lawyer for the second victim, was left fuming that his client emerged empty-handed. Commission officials say they were just trying to help. But referring to the regulators, Mr. Floriani said, "They really don't care about the traveling public."
Allan J. Fromberg, the commission's spokesman, said that the increased insurance and the $100,000 bond would solve most of the problems faced by accident victims and "would clearly be far more equitable than anything that existed in the past."
The bond, which would guarantee that winners of court judgments could collect up to $100,000, in addition to the $100,000 insurance settlement, would have to be bought by every individual and corporation owning medallions. Given its cost, officials view the bond as a clever way to prod medallion owners to stop splitting their holdings and reconsolidate into fewer companies, with more assets for accident victims to go after.
But these proposals -- rushed out in reaction to the recent string of accidents -- have come under fire from the industry.
Insurers estimate that increasing liability coverage to $100,000 from $25,000 would cost taxi operators anywhere from $3,000 to $11,000 more each year in premiums. And even some former taxi regulators say the bond proposal is poorly thought out and unlikely to force medallion owners to change the structure of their businesses.
Fidel F. Del Valle, a former chairman of the taxi commission, said that fleet owners "will never do that, regardless of what kind of cost they put on it, because it still isn't worth risking your entire fleet."
Underwriters would require taxi operators to set aside at least $100,000 in cash or a credit line as collateral. Industry officials said this could crush many owner-operators and force the fleets to tie up millions of dollars, while helping only the relatively few accident victims who push their cases all the way to court judgments.
But even if these proposals are enacted, they are unlikely to end the creativity of cab companies trying to minimize liability.
Consider the case of Thomas Armstrong, a blind pencil seller who, along with his dog, Smokey, was hit by a cab in 1992 outside of Tiffany & Company. Mr. Armstrong required operations for a broken leg and shoulder, and needs a walker to get around. In 1997 he won a $965,000 award against Brant Taxi Inc., but so far he has been able to get only $10,000 of it.
Exasperated, Mr. Armstrong's lawyers moved to seize the company's medallions last fall. The company then filed for bankruptcy to prevent Mr. Armstrong from recovering money by forcing the sale of its medallions. In its bankruptcy filing, Brant Taxi said it was simply trying to reorganize "free from creditor harassment."
Its biggest creditor, Mr. Armstrong, now 70, said: "I'm getting tired of waiting. But there ain't nothing I can do."

HEADLINE: THE FALL OF SUHARTO: THE OUTLOOK;
A Key Figure Says the Need For Elections Is Imperative

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, May 23

 BODY:
Indonesia's new President, B. J. Habibie, swore in his new Cabinet here this morning, and one of its most influential members immediately questioned whether the Government should survive.
Ginandjar Kartasasmita, the Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry, said in a briefing after the ceremony that it was "imperative" to hold elections for a Government with a popular mandate. Mr. Habibie, who became President on Thursday after the resignation of President Suharto, seems determined to serve out Mr. Suharto's term, which runs until 2003. 
 "One thing is for sure," Mr. Ginandjar said, "we need to have a new Government with a new mandate from the people. So it is very important that we have a general election as soon as possible."
Many of Indonesia's students are calling for the same thing. Even after they were evicted from the Parliament by hundreds of troops early today, students rallied against Mr. Habibie again today at the University of Indonesia in central Jakarta. About 2,000 soldiers guarded the Parliament to prevent the students from trying to reclaim the building, which they had occupied for five days.
Mr. Ginandjar, who is Indonesia's top economic policy-maker, as he was under President Suharto, blamed continuing political instability for the nation's economic woes. "The uncertainty comes from the fact that the economic ministers have no control over the political process," he said.
Experts say Mr. Ginandjar must play a central role if Indonesia is to mend its shattered economy. At a time when the International Monetary Fund has put a $43 billion economic rescue package on hold, he has strong ties to both the fund and to senior officials in the West. Mr. Ginandjar said he had spoken to the United States Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, and to I.M.F. officials, who pledged to help restore Indonesia's economy.
Regardless of his skepticism about the Government, Mr. Ginandjar said he would set about trying to restore confidence in Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, and on reining in spiraling inflation. He said his goal was to bolster the rupiah's exchange rate to 6,000 to the dollar -- though he added that the current political climate made it hard to predict when that could be achieved.
The rupiah seesawed wildly this week after escalating unrest forced Mr. Suharto to step down on Thursday. It finished the week at about 10,000 rupiah to the dollar, recovering from an earlier level of 14,000 to the dollar.
Outside experts agreed that Indonesia must resolve its murky political situation before it can hope to attract either aid or investment.
"I think the I.M.F. will mark time until they know who they're dealing with, and how long these people are going to be around," said Richard Margolis, a regional strategist with Merrill Lynch & Company in Hong Kong.
Expatriate business people, who fled Jakarta by the thousands after riots and looting, have begun to return to the city on flights from Singapore. But foreign investors are still holding back, according to several experts, out of fear that the unrest could flare up again.
"There seems to be a general consensus that Habibie is a transitional figure," Mr. Margolis said. "Now people who are products of Suharto's system are working out how far and fast to go. It's very chancy territory."
After reacting guardedly to Mr. Habibie's announcement of his new Cabinet on Friday, opposition leaders began to pick apart the choices -- complaining that they do not represent enough of a break with the Suharto era. Fifteen of the 36 ministers in the Cabinet, including Mr. Ginandjar, held the same posts under Mr. Suharto. Four others were simply shuffled to new jobs.
"The people in the Cabinet who have been working under Mr. Suharto for 30 years are the ones who made Indonesia the most corrupt country in the world," said Laksamana Sukardi, an adviser to Megawati Sukarnoputri, one of the most prominent opposition leaders.
Mr. Habibie did try to reach out to some opposition figures, most notably Kwik Kian Gie, a chief adviser to Ms. Megawati. But Mr. Kwik, who was sounded out about becoming State Minister for Investment, declined because he feared it would erode his credibility with reformers, according to people who know him.

HEADLINE: Fast Times for Engineering Graduates, as a Slump Ends

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
With the economy booming, college graduates are facing the best job market in years. And for students in engineering and computer science -- a small group who chose their majors when companies were downsizing and engineers were being tossed aside like used Kleenex -- the market is sizzling.
Most have multiple job offers, signing bonuses are common, and some are even being offered stock options, a benefit normally reserved for top executives. On many campuses in the New York metropolitan region, engineering and computer science graduates are receiving salary offers of $45,000 to $50,000 a year as employers compete for one of the smallest graduating classes of engineers in a decade. Those offers are up as much as 20 percent over last year's, and well above offers to graduates in fields like economics and psychology. Career counselors at Ivy League colleges and commuter schools are shaking their heads in amazement. 
 At Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., for example, the average annual starting salary is $45,621, and one computer science undergraduate has accepted a job for $70,000.
"Student salaries are out of sight," said Thomas Tarantelli, director of the R.P.I. career center, who said they surpassed salaries in his office long ago. "We often sit around and joke about the fact that the students are coming to us for advice."
Paul J. Kostek, a consulting engineer in Seattle and president-elect of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers-U.S.A., said: "I call the class of '98 the class of optimists. These students took a chance, and that chance has paid off."
Allison Cooke, a 25-year-old student at the City College of New York, recalls the job market when she chose chemical engineering as her major. "It was kind of grim," she said. "Dow Chemical was being sued for its silicone implants. Companies were laying off workers."
As she struggled through fluid mechanics and kinetics and passed up invitations to parties so she could spend nights in the laboratory, she questioned her choice of major again and again. But as she prepares to graduate, she has received two job offers, one for more than $45,000 a year and the other for more than $50,000.
"Now I feel I can exhale," she said. "I'm really making it. The job market for chemical engineers right now is fantastic. We are so in demand."
With computers on nearly every desk and factory floor in America, companies are hungry for people who can program and maintain them. (The Senate voted on Monday to allow more foreign workers into the United States to fill jobs in computer programming and related areas.) And as other fields like biotechnology and financial services explode, they, too, are eager to hire people with technological and analytical expertise.
Eileen Kohan, executive director of the Center for Career Services at Columbia University, said she expected annual salaries for engineering graduates to average more than $50,000 this year, with bonuses ranging between $5,000 and $10,000 at many Wall Street firms and communications companies. "I've been watching this since the fall, and I was like, 'Whoa,' " she said.
She said that although engineers have long been among the most highly paid graduates, the gap widened this year, with engineers averaging about $8,000 more than liberal arts graduates.
She said one student had accepted an offer with a high-technology company in San Francisco with a base salary of $50,000, an annual bonus of 5 to 10 percent and stock options. "It's the first time I've seen stock options," she said.
The booming market for engineers is a sharp turnaround from just a few years ago. In the early 1990's, the engineering work force was shrinking and unemployment among engineers was climbing.
Not surprisingly, the number of students going into engineering dropped. By 1996, there were only 356,000 engineering majors, down nearly 20 percent from 13 years earlier, just before the decline began. Last year, only 65,000 students earned bachelor's degrees in engineering, down from 76,000 a decade earlier. And although data are not yet available for this year's graduating class, some colleges, like Clarkson University in Potsdam, N.Y., say the number is even smaller.
For Monika Posluszna, 23, a senior in computer engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., the demand for engineers has made it easy to find a job. Ms. Posluszna, who did not learn English until she arrived in New Jersey from Poland in the 10th grade, interviewed with nine companies and accepted a job with Mars Inc., the candy company -- at more than $60,000 a year.
James Destro, 22, a chemical engineering major at R.P.I., sent his resume to 25 companies and got 22 responses. After the interviews, more than half of them invited him to visit their plants, and 7 companies made him offers. The lowest was $45,000, with a $3,000 bonus for signing on. On June 26, he will start with the Exxon Corporation at a salary of more than $50,000. Until then, he will be scuba diving off the Great Barrier Reef.
"I'll be totally relaxed," he said. "The last time that happened was between high school and college."
Although salaries in the region are higher than in many other parts of the country, salaries everywhere for computer majors and other graduates in technical fields have jumped, after a long period of stagnation.
In its April salary survey, the National Association of Colleges and Employers in Bethlehem, Pa., found that salaries for chemical engineers were averaging close to $46,000, up from about $42,500 a year earlier. The average for computer science graduates was nearly $41,000, up from about $36,000 last year, and 10 percent of the offers to computer science graduates from computer software companies topped $48,000.
"Nerds are king now," said Bill Linstaedt, director of career services at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Ind., where the average salary offer to computer engineers is more than $44,000 and 40 percent have received signing bonuses. "It's not easy to go through engineering school," he said, "but this is the payoff."
For students, it is a world they were not fully prepared for. Some were unsure about the ethics of accepting bonuses, others about how to balance competing job offers.
Cassandra Simmons, director of corporate recruitment at City College, said that one electrical engineering student went to her to discuss whether he could accept a $6,000 bonus if he signed on with a telecommunications company. She told him that he could, but that he should look at the job itself, not just the money. (He liked the job and took it.)
Another issue for many students was simply how to juggle so many interviews and job offers. R.P.I. brought in financial planners and time-management experts to help students like Sarah Jordan, 21, a computer science and systems engineering major, who had so many job interviews (30) and company visits (7, including trips to Texas and Massachusetts) that some weeks she had trouble fitting them in around her classes.
"People saw me in a suit almost every day," she said. "It was a plain black run-of-the-mill suit, but thank goodness it was very durable."
She ultimately chose Hewlett-Packard in Andover, Mass., because she liked the atmosphere, and will start on July 16 at a salary of $49,200.
Sometimes, though, the career office officials were not sure the students needed much help. Mr. Tarantelli cited the case of one student who went to him a month ago with a $70,000 offer, asking, "How do I negotiate?"
"Our reaction was, 'What are you, nuts?' " Mr. Tarantelli said.
For companies, the challenge has been how to lure students to interviews -- and then get them to sign on. On college campuses, companies sponsored dinners and ran lotteries for mountain bikes and trips to Hawaii to draw in students. They also sweetened their financial packages. But many also recognized that the biggest challenge was to convince students that they would be working in a good environment.
Sapient Corporation, an information-technology consulting company in Cambridge, Mass., offered salaries of $45,000 to $55,000, annual bonuses and immediate stock options. But it also brought in potential recruits -- 25 to 40 at a time -- for two-day visits that included not only interviews but also team exercises and social events.
"They really get to see that they will be working with other smart people doing really cool things, versus sitting in a cubicle, writing code," said Nikki Fisher, Sapient's vice president for marketing.
Companies also widened their recruiting to include nonengineering students who showed any hint of experience -- or interest -- in a technical job.
"We were looking at bright, smart students who might have a newly budding interest in information technology," said Allan Jones, manager of college recruiting for American Management Systems, an information-technology consulting company in Fairfax, Va., that is hiring about 600 undergraduates and 200 graduate students this year.
"We looked at students like history majors who worked in the computer center, or philosophy majors who had an internship where they stumbled on information technology and realized that was the way they wanted to go."
For now, there is no sign that next year's supply of graduating engineers will be larger, and companies are already vying for interview slots at the colleges.
Some college career-service officials say that their interviewing rooms are already booked for the fall, and that they will need to line up conference rooms and faculty offices on campuses -- as they did this year -- to accommodate all the companies that want to interview students.
Meanwhile, corporate officials and engineering experts say they hope the job market will entice more students into engineering.
But some, like Mr. Linstaedt at Rose-Hulman, remain concerned that students may be put off by what he called the "Dilbert" factor, after the comic-strip character: "the idea of engineers as nerds without lives who have lousy jobs, evil bosses, tiny offices, no sense of style and a personal life to match."
That is a real problem, said Gregory Schuckman, a spokesman for the American Association of Engineering Societies in Washington.
"If we can get people to focus on other role models than Dilbert, maybe we can get our enrollments up," he said hopefully. "Everybody likes to read 'Dilbert.' But do you know anyone who wants to be Dilbert?"

Trade Deficit Jumps

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit jumped sharply in March, providing the clearest evidence yet of how Asia's economic woes are being felt in the United States. The gap rose to $13 billion, far higher than analysts had expected. 
 The report showed that exporters are losing business in Asia, and hurting profits and jobs in the United States. But it might not be a bad thing for trade to slow the economy somewhat, since growth has been so strong that it might ignite inflation. RICHARD W. STEVENSON

HEADLINE: Suharto's 'Painful' Fall? Not for Indonesians

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Suharto's Stealthy Foe: Globalizing Capitalism" (news article, May 20) does not mention a second vital element in the current world revolution: the spread of the ideas of equality and democracy. 
 Although capitalism may be creating the conditions and imperatives that lead to the demand for more open economies and political systems in Asia, Latin America and Africa, there is more. We should not underestimate the importance of the worldwide diffusion of the idea that all people are equal, that they do not need to be ruled by kings, emperors, presidents-for-life, commissars, rajahs or patriarchs.

The Great Betrayal
 How American Sovereignty and
 Social Justice Are Being Sacrificed
 to the Gods of the Global Economy.
 By Patrick J. Buchanan.
 376 pp. Boston:
 Little, Brown & Company. $22.95. 
 IN an effort to save turtles around the world, Congress passed a law several years ago that bars the importation of shrimp into the United States unless they are captured in nets equipped with a device that keeps sea turtles from harm. The device, called a turtle excluder, is cheap and easy to use. But Thailand and other countries that troll for shrimp consider it both a nuisance and a symbol of American overreach. They challenged the rule in the new court of international trade, the World Trade Organization, and a short time ago they won. A three-judge panel -- the sort of officials Patrick J. Buchanan had regularly denounced during his 1996 Presidential campaign as "faceless foreign bureaucrats" -- ruled that Congress had to lift the ban or pay damages to the shrimp-catching nations of the world.
This was hardly the biggest case to emerge from a world court. But it highlights exactly the kind of loss of sovereignty that sends Buchanan and his many allies to the barricades, and it lies at the heart of "The Great Betrayal." Fleshing out arguments he has made as a candidate, a television commentator and a columnist, Buchanan has written not one book but three: a diatribe against the evils of globalization, a rallying call for a renewed sense of nationalism and a fascinating if selective history of the ideological struggle between protectionists and free-traders. Not surprisingly, he concludes that America must construct anew "a tariff wall built by Washington, Hamilton, Clay, Lincoln and the Republican Presidents who followed."
It's not every political tract these days that calls for a return to the policies of William McKinley or lionizes Warren Harding. And, by his own admission, Buchanan is a late convert to the anti-free-trade camp; he berates himself now for subscribing to the modern Republican party line when he served Presidents Nixon and Reagan. So today he finds himself in agreement with some unlikely allies -- Ralph Nader and the A.F.L.-C.I.O., among others.
It would be easy to dismiss some of Buchanan's assertions in "The Great Betrayal" as political pandering, positioning himself for another run at the Republican nomination, especially if America's boom times come to an unhappy end. There are plenty of applause lines drawn from his campaign speeches. "To a citizen of the world," Buchanan writes, "a hollowing out of America's industrial power is an inconsequential, even a positive, development. It matters deeply only to American patriots." And, visiting the remnants of downtown Detroit, he declares, "The Empire of the Sun has its revenge."
Buchanan has never been known as a man who wallows in nuance, and he leaves readers in little doubt of who the enemy is: Government officials who sell out American interests at the negotiating table, and the C.E.O.'s of transnational corporations who boast that their companies are citizens of the world. Nor does he dance around the solution. America, he writes, must reject "a world of open borders and untrammeled trade."
This is, of course, hardly the first book to warn of the perils of free trade. But the fact is that these days every country has a prominent equivalent to Pat Buchanan. In Japan there is Shintaro Ishihara, the man who, in brighter economic times in Tokyo, called for his country to cut off America's supply of computer chips if it didn't quit its hectoring about trade deficits. In Indonesia, politicians argue that the International Monetary Fund is emasculating the country, ruining its distinctive national identity. And there is never any shortage of French leaders who see global competition threatening a national way of life.
In short, the economy may be international these days, but resistance is local. Globalization always looks ugliest on the ground, whether you are standing around an abandoned textile mill in South Carolina, wiped out by competition from Mexico, or a near-bankrupt car factory in Yokohama, crippled by the economic downturn in Bangkok.
To be sure, all the immediate evidence suggests that America is winning many more of the global battles than it is losing. After all, the United States, with 15 millions new jobs since 1992, is the job-creating envy of the world. Then there is the soaring stock market, which has not only generated wealth for the richest Americans but also benefited many ordinary workers through their retirement and pension funds. In Europe, where joblessness runs at 12 percent, and in Asia, where an economic miracle has turned into a morass, it might be hard to find much sympathy for Buchanan's argument that America has become the world's patsy.
But Buchanan is unimpressed with this sheen of prosperity. It hides, he argues, a far uglier truth: the American economy is no longer being run by or for Americans. As government has receded and markets have taken over, the country's economic fate has been placed in the hands of men like the Citibank official who in 1981 defended loans to Communist Poland by saying: "Who knows which political system works? The only test we care about is: Can they pay their bills?"
Certainly, plenty of Buchanan's arguments are open to alternative interpretation, if not outright challenge. For example, Buchanan claims that since rising exports create jobs for Americans, rising imports necessarily destroy an equivalent number of jobs. That is not the case. Imports are rising dramatically now, and unemployment is at its lowest since 1970. Often, imports free up productive capacity to produce higher-tech, higher-profit goods. Otherwise, we'd still have workers in Silicon Valley stamping out 1-cent transistors.
But intermingled with Buchanan's questionable claims are plenty of worthwhile insights. He rightly debunks the assertion that trade inevitably leads to peace. Trade didn't stop Japan from invading China, or the former Yugoslavia from warring on itself. He assails corporate America for pressing Washington to lift all sanctions against China without pressing the Chinese equally hard to adopt the rule of law and improve protections for both foreign businesses and domestic dissidents.
And Buchanan rightly observes that the argument over free trade has become a class issue, pitting vulnerable factory workers against lawyers, journalists, corporate lobbyists and academics whose jobs are not threatened. "Not every American belongs to the cognitive elite," Buchanan writes. "Not every American is equipped by nature or nurture to 'accelerate' into a 'Third Wave Information Age.' "
Perhaps Buchanan's most stinging observation is that American foreign policy operates too often in an economic vacuum. Too many Americans fail to see the connection between foreign policy and their own lives.
The problem is not so much with Buchanan's analysis as it is with his solutions. His remedy, he says without apology, is "a new perspective, a perspective of enlightened nationalism." For example, he wants virtually every car sold in the United States to be made in the United States. Unfortunately, other countries feel the same way. China wants its cars domestically produced, and so do Brazil, India and Thailand. Replicated around the globe, an American build-it-here requirement would force Ford, General Motors and Chrysler to put even more resources into opening new plants abroad -- where they would immediately hire the kind of low-wage, non-American workers that Buchanan views as such a threat.
Wonderful as those magical years from 1869 to 1900 may have been, American industry grew then by tapping a limitless domestic market. But today the United States accounts for 5 percent of the world population and 20 percent of the world economy. The greatest prospects for growth are beyond our borders. Faced with that kind of statistical reality, America doesn't have a lot of choice: to keep growing at the rates needed to keep America first, it has to sell abroad. After all, half the population of the world has yet to make a phone call or click a single Kodak moment.
The trick is to design a global economy that plays to America's many strengths -- to keep the world open to American goods and American technology, insisting on access to closed foreign markets in return for access to ours. But it is hard to argue that other countries should open their doors if we seal up ours.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT: FOCUS ON TECHNOLOGY STOCKS;
Washington Sideshow for Technology

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
LAST MONDAY, as the Department of Justice and 20 state Attorneys General filed their antitrust suits against the Microsoft Corporation, a question circulated among the venture capitalists huddled in partners meetings on Palo Alto's Sand Hill Road and other nerve centers of high-technology finance.
Is it safe again to invest in desktop software? 
 "I had that question posed to me yesterday for the first time in two years," said Roger B. McNamee, a principal in Integral Capital Partners, which invests in private and public technology companies. "It looks like it's almost time to take aim at Microsoft's core business, whether they're vulnerable or not. There isn't anything happening yet, but I expect entrepreneurs to focus on this, people who couldn't get funded before."
In recent years, venture capital has simply not been available for software start-ups focused on desktop applications, programming tools or, in your dreams, operating systems. New companies dancing at the edge of Microsoft's vision had to plug along on their founders' savings or meager income from shareware licenses -- the $10 or $20 a head sent in on the honor system by people who copied the product from friends or downloaded it from a bulletin board.
The lucky companies, like Vermeer Technologies Inc., developer of the Front Page program for creating Web sites, were acquired by Microsoft on rewarding terms; the unlucky ones died young.
Venture capitalists have a longer horizon than most mutual fund managers or retail investors, and they count on making outsize returns for taking outsize risks on early-stage companies. So theirs are usually the first heads to pop up from cover when a monster like Microsoft turns its gaze elsewhere.
But the landmark antitrust suits should prompt all technology investors to reconsider their strategies and to question the possible consequences of the suits for their portfolios.
For many investors, U.S. v. Microsoft leaves the landscape little altered from before, despite the huge headlines of last week. So far, 1998 has been a turbulent year for technology companies: Many face significant near-term challenges independent of the suits, which could take many years to play out. The case is just one more variable to add to the equation.
Most analysts say the short-term consequences will likely be small, in terms of both harm to Microsoft's financial results and help to companies in its line of fire, like Netscape Communications or Novell.
As Mr. McNamee put it: "It doesn't make sense to invest in companies whose success depends on Microsoft's failure." That has not changed, and it is worth noting that among the 200 securities firms surveyed by First Call, none lowered its rating of Microsoft last week. Two added coverage of Netscape, but rated it a hold; just one raised its rating on Novell, from a buy to a strong buy.
In the longer term, a Microsoft chastened, or at least distracted, by years of antitrust litigation may be less inclined to "cut off the air supply" of promising new software companies, as a now-famous internal company memorandum put it. But analysts say it is too early for most investors to identify those promising players.
Better to focus for now, they say, on software companies that have found growth areas outside the giant's core business, like supply chain management or sales force automation. Or better to look at companies that are developing ideas for overcoming the limitations of networks and telecommunications systems, the main choke points in computing today.
Most analysts also say that investors must contend with a number of broad issues confronting the technology group. Many of the industry's leading companies have reported disappointing financial results in recent quarters, including Intel, Compaq Computer and Hewlett-Packard.
Yet in most cases, prices of technology stocks remain high. Shares in I.B.M. actually rose after it reported a 13 percent decline in earnings. No one wants to sit out the information age without owning some technology shares, but choosing stocks is more difficult than ever.
Bruce Lupatkin, director of technology research at Hambrecht & Quist, said he believed the long-term consequences of the suit would be positive. "Although it is perhaps initially negative for the market from a psychological perspective, it is overwhelmingly positive for the industry going forward," he said.
"If it were to actually check some of the behavior of Microsoft, or Microsoft's sphere of influence got even marginally narrowed, it creates opportunities that wouldn't otherwise be there," he said. "It would fuel investment in a bunch of areas people are afraid of today."
But Mr. Lupatkin has a hard time finding technology shares to recommend right now. "If you look at business fundamentals, and then look at share prices, there is a bit of a dichotomy," he said. "The market certainly feels a bit toppy, and everybody seems to be waiting.
"Communications and connectivity companies are doing very well, and likely to continue," he added, naming Cisco Systems and Ascend Communications. "The companies to be avoided are the PC-centric folks."
A delay in the release of Microsoft's Windows 98 would inevitably delay some personal-computer purchases, but analysts say the PC makers are already in a slump for more fundamental reasons. One is a glut of inventory, largely created by Compaq as it moved to emulate Dell Computer's build-to-order business model. In cleaning out old product, Compaq packed dealers and distributors with deeply discounted machines that have yet to sell through to customers.
ANOTHER factor is the erosion of the historical link among microprocessor upgrades, new software releases and PC sales. Depending on which factor you see as more important, the PC slump may be half over, or just beginning.
"I think we're largely through it," said John T. Rossi, a managing director at Banc America Robertson Stephens. He said he expects PC sales to rebound next year with the release of Microsoft's Windows NT 5.0 for corporate networks of computers. "Even though the near-term view is scary, this new operating system, even slowed down or changed by the Government, will likely lead to a good PC market next year."
Mr. Rossi said shares of the major PC companies and the component manufacturers had been beaten up enough to warrant buying them at current prices.
"Buy a list of leadership companies, like Seagate, Quantum, Intel, Micron," he said. "They actually stand out in an overvalued market. It's almost a value approach to technology issues."
He cautions against stocks with high valuations in areas like enterprise software, which face more downside risk.
But others see a more structural problem for the PC industry. It used to be that Intel would make faster microprocessors, Microsoft would enlarge its operating system, and customers would buy new PC's to run new applications that took advantage of the changes. But in an interconnected world, in which the speed limit is imposed not by the computer but by the home user's pokey modem or the corporate customer's creaky network, a 300-megahertz Pentium is not likely to offer significant performance gains over a 166-megahertz chip. Intel has had to respond by dropping processor prices far more rapidly than in the past, and PC manufacturers have followed suit, to entice upgraders.
Investors seeking the next big growth opportunity may do best to focus on companies attacking this communications bottleneck, like purveyors of cable modems for home users or high-speed network switches for corporate environments, said Thomas Thornhill, director of technology research for Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. "Look at the entire infrastructure and identify the companies working to remove the constraints on performance," he said.
Among those companies, he likes Cisco, Lucent, Ciena, Tellabs, Ascend and 3Com. The sector "is very fragmented, and there are a wide range of alternatives," he said.
FOR more conservative investors, the regional Bell companies are a good play, Mr. Thornhill said, as they move from offering dial-tone to data services, Internet connections and video. "You take the lid off their revenue growth," he said.
But bandwidth plays are long-term investments. In the short term, many analysts fear that the technology market is headed for its habitual summer swoon, prompted by long European vacations and exacerbated this year by the Asian economic crisis.
"We're not going to have a great summer, for sure," said Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter. "You still have the aftereffects of the inventory glut. Europe is doing O.K., but instead of getting better, it seems to be flattening. Japan isn't getting better at all."
Mr. Murphy is worried that the broad market remains overvalued and vulnerable to an Alan Greenspan-prompted crash. Mr. Murphy has protected the accounts he manages with index puts -- options that pay off if the associated stock indexes fall -- while remaining invested in technology stocks.
Mr. Murphy picks those stocks by identifying companies whose share prices are low relative to a combination of earnings and research-and-development funds, a figure he calls growth flow. Companies he finds attractive on that measure include Adobe Systems, which he believes has benefited as Microsoft has been busy attacking Netscape on the Internet instead of taking on desktop publishing, where Adobe is dominant despite a weak first quarter.
"Adobe's not the biggest danger to them," he said.
He also likes Applied Materials, the big semiconductor equipment manufacturer; Cypress Semiconductor, and LSI Logic.
The growth flow approach, as explained by Mr. Murphy in his recent book, "Every Investor's Guide to High-Tech Stocks and Mutual Funds" (Broadway Books), is a variation on value investing. It is less concerned with identifying the next Microsoft than with buying quality companies that are currently undervalued by Wall Street. The strategy seems to work for Mr. Murphy; the average annual return of the newsletter's picks for over a decade is 45.7 percent.
Competing for technology investors' attention is "The Gorilla Game" (Harper Business), by Geoffrey A. Moore, Paul Johnson and Tom Kippola, whose thesis is that new technology markets naturally anoint leaders, or "gorillas," which define standards, grow very rapidly and dominate the market for decades as a result. Microsoft is the quintessential gorilla in software, but so is Intel in microprocessors, Cisco in networking equipment, Oracle in relational data base software. The book says investors can gain by buying and holding gorilla stocks, regardless of their apparent value.
"Technology-driven markets self-generate monopolies," said Mr. Moore, who is chairman of the Chasm Group, a Silicon Valley marketing consulting firm. "That phenomenon isn't going to change, regardless of what the Government does."
Microsoft is not worth any less, and Netscape is not worth any more, as a result of the lawsuits filed last week, he said.
Mr. Moore divides investing opportunities between platform companies, like Microsoft, Intel and Cisco, and applications companies, like Oracle, SAP A.G. and Peoplesoft. Though applications do not create as powerful a monopoly position, the leader in any category still enjoys outsized growth.
Though Mr. Moore is not an investment adviser, he currently favors companies in supply chain management software, like Manugistics and I2 Technologies, and companies in sales force automation, like Siebel Systems, Vantive and Clarify. Several of these concerns are his consulting clients.
"Find a category that is going into hypergrowth," Mr. Moore advised. "Rather than guess who is going to be the winner, buy every legitimate candidate and hold them until the market identifies the winner. When you see it has clearly won, sell the other shares and put the money into the gorilla, and hold it until the category is eliminated."
"The irony," he said, "is that at no point in that time will the gorilla look undervalued."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 31, 1998, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the possible effects on technology investments from antitrust suits against the Microsoft Corporation misstated the location of Sand Hill Road, a California center for venture capital firms. It is in Menlo Park, not Palo Alto.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Mercurial"
Technology stocks are prone to more euphoric highs and despondent lows than the broader market, with substantial differences from sector to sector. Graph tracks several sectors since Dec. 31, 1995, plotted monthly.
 
Lately, as sales growth has slowed, technology stocks have been more likely to disappoint and less likely to delight investors than the broader market.

HEADLINE: From Submarine Warfare to Show Biz

BYLINE: By BILL SLOCUM 

 BODY:
FOR a while, as they sat in a studio at Sonalysts Inc. in Waterford, the composing partners Neil Goldberg and Dave Fraser cheerfully answered questions about the business of scoring a prospective television documentary. As the questions became more technical, the two men suddenly clammed up.
"We might tell you more, but we'd have to kill you," Mr. Goldberg said. 
 It is a common refrain among Sonalysts employees, jokingly intended but deeply rooted all the same. The company, started 25 years ago by former Navy commander David Hinkle and his wife, Muriel Hinkle, began as a submarine-warfare research firm with strong ties to the Navy. Those military ties remain firm today, even as Sonalysts branches out into new fields like mass entertainment.
The seven-building Sonalysts campus, just off Interstate 95, might well be Disney World as envisioned by Tom Clancy. Among the many high-tech services offered are a worldwide weather analysis station and three-dimensional computer graphics design.
Sonalysts takes pride in the Navy experience of many members of its work force, printing a list of ships and submarines aboard which employees once served the same way a law firm might tout the alma maters of its associates. Yet the growing creative side of Sonalysts' business has attracted people with perspectives and appearances often quite different from the Annapolis norm.
"You see long hair, earrings," said Larry Clark, a 10-year Navy veteran who is Sonalysts' chief financial officer, with a indulgent shake of the head. "Haven't seen any nose rings yet, though."
While executives embrace military terminology and terms like "esprit de corps" in describing their company, Sonalysts is also employee-owned and enjoys a fair amount of democracy. Workers set their own hours and can initiate company-wide projects themselves.
"One of the best things around here is people feel in charge of their own lives," Mr. Hinkle said.
Last year, Sonalysts opened its third and largest sound stage on site, the 15,000-square foot Studio 15, with the filming of what became a 16-minute segment in the Steven Spielberg movie "Amistad." Photographs of Anthony Hopkins, the first actor to perform on Studio 15, adorn many rooms at Sonalysts, yet there are parts of the complex that neither Mr. Hopkins nor any other non-American citizen would be permitted to enter. Access to some sensitive areas is closely restricted by agreement with the Department of Defense.
There, Sonalysts carries on its core research work in a variety of sensitive fields, the largest being its original area of expertise, sonar. Among the projects going on behind closed doors, as described tersely by a Sonalysts spokesperson, are "quieting techniques" and "signal-processing developments." Yet it was not for any of these reasons that a team of four British Navy officers in uniform stopped by Sonalysts one recent afternoon. They had come to see a computer game called "Hunter/Killer 688i," a submarine simulation that Sonalysts had developed using computer modeling programs developed for U.S. Navy training.
Kim Castro, who served as a lieutenant aboard a Navy destroyer before coming to work for Sonalysts, is the producer of "Hunter/Killer" and recalled the work that went into making sure the operations procedures integrated into the game were not too accurate.
"We had to fuzzy it up," he explained. "We had to make sure we could reference everything back to 'Jane's Fighting Ships'," a co-developer of the game. With previous submarine games, Mr. Castro added, "you could tell they were not done by real submariners; we wanted to make our game more realistic."
A lot of the newer initiatives at Sonalysts seem to have some basis in military technology. The documentary series Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Fraser were providing music for, "A Matter of National Security," is being produced and developed by Sonalysts, now in negotiations for a network deal. The series explores such recently-declassified matters as the attempted salvage of a sunken Soviet submarine by the United States during the Cold War.
Ralph Guardiano, who heads studio production work and whose background is not in the military but rather in television promotion, describes Sonalysts as a "one-stop film production place." In Waterford, a film can be shot, scored and edited in various portions of the Sonalysts campus. The company describes its three sound stages as the largest in New England.
Sonalysts has not been in the entertainment business long. It was only nine years ago that they helped design the sound effects for "The Hunt for Red October," not coincidentally a movie about submarines. Last winter, Sonalysts completed principal shooting of its first self-produced film, "Mystic Nights and Pirate Fights," a G-rated swashbuckling yarn.
The submariner sensibility at Sonalysts runs deep. Since "Red October" the company has helped out on the production of another film involving submarines, the comedy with Kelsey Grammer, "Down Periscope." But executives say that a third film Sonalysts was to have helped out on, the thriller "Crimson Tide," never happened because of misgivings the Navy had about the script, which involved mutiny aboard a nuclear submarine.
Mr. Hinkle says he is pleased with the work going on with Sonalysts entertainment arm. "I'm convinced that some day we will be big in television, because Mike and Ralph know that business," he said. "They're doing now what we did with a small group 20 years ago."
Sonalysts started out as a Mom-and-Pop operation. Looking for something to do after retiring as a Navy commander in 1973, Mr. Hinkle, originally from eastern Texas, decided to become a country lawyer. To support his law-school education, the Hinkles started Sonalysts in their home, then on Spithead Road in Waterford, not far from the company's present headquarters.
"It was a tough climate to get a loan," Mr. Hinkle said. "We had just gotten kicked out of Vietnam. Muriel went to a lot of banks before she found one in Norwich that was willing to invest in us."
By the time Mr. Hinkle had been admitted to the bar three years later, "I looked around and saw I had a company with 12 people and nearly $1 million in business."
While sonar was the first area of interest for Sonalysts (the name, given by Mrs. Hinkle, was short for Sonar Analysts,) the firm branched out into other military applications, notably computer modeling.
"That's what we did for years," Mr. Hinkle said. In addition to designing commercial war games, Sonalysts has found other applications for this work, such as business gaming. Clients like the Mohegan Sun Casino use the programs to test and train executives.
"We took the same principles of war-gaming and apply them to the business's core values," said Lawrence Crawford, head of business gaming at Sonalysts. "You put managers and assistant managers in high-stress situations, and see how they react."
The company's zest has not always brought success. In 1995, Sonalysts made a series of videotapes on personal health bearing the Time Life imprimatur and narrated by the former Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop; the tapes sold poorly and were soon discontinued. Yet Mr. Clark said the lessons of video production were not wasted and have been useful in other ventures.
This sort of aggressive optimism is not for everyone. John Markowicz was Sonalysts' president until 1994, when he said he was booted out by Mr. Clark and the Hinkles with only 24 hours' notice. His desire for "upfront market research," Mr. Markowicz said, created a wedge between himself and the company directors.
"A fundamental concept at Sonalysts is you bet on the people," he said. "This worked very successfully on the defense side, where you are a known quantity. But if you look at the non-defense side, it's an open question. There can be some successes, but it's more prudent to do market research."
A Sonalysts spokeswoman, Jane Goldsmith, replied to Mr. Markowicz's comments by saying nothing is attempted at the company without a business plan and upfront analysis, and while not without failure, "our record speaks for itself."
Yet, Mr. Markowicz, now executive director of the Southeastern Connecticut Enterprise Region, calls Sonalysts a model for small and mid-sized military companies looking to diversify. Other industry observers agree.
Jeff Blodgett, an analyst with the Connecticut Economic Resource Center Inc., calls Sonalysts "a successful diversification case study," noting the company began to move into civilian applications for its technology in 1990, when the military business in Connecticut was twice what it is now.
Peter Gioia, a research executive with the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said that many military-related businesses in Connecticut suffered from a credit crunch in the same early-90's period when cutbacks in the Department of Defense began, but that those that survived are on firmer footing today, thanks in large part to having found civilian applications for their work.
"They use us as an example," Muriel Hinkle said. "They don't understand we were diversified from Day One. A company like Electric Boat is a specialist. All they build is submarines."
Sonalysts, which is privately owned, has approximately 480 employees, most of whom work in Waterford. "We are growing at better than 100 percent a year," Mr. Hinkle said. "In 25 years, we have never failed to increase sales."
Added Michael Watt, another executive: "We really reinvent the company every day."

'Baby Softs'? Envisioning A Breakup Of Microsoft

BYLINE: By DENISE CARUSO 

 BODY:
Now that the Justice Department and the Attorneys General of 20 states have filed long-threatened antitrust suits against the Microsoft Corporation, the question remains why the most obvious, and perhaps cleanest, solution has yet to be put on the bargaining table: the breakup of Microsoft into its component businesses.
Many analysts and industry executives have noted that the complex, arcane lawsuits filed last week are probably too closely tied to the software giant's current products and business strategies to have any lasting effect. Demands regarding Windows 98, for example, or even specific concessions to Microsoft competitors like the Netscape Communications Corporation will probably be outdated in a matter of months as technology continues to change at its usual breakneck pace. 
 But perhaps most important, the challenges to Microsoft's monopoly do not address the more fundamental issue of how to insure a truly competitive environment in which software code is the currency upon which a new digital economy is increasingly based.
Microsoft's iron-fisted control of the market for operating-system software is the keystone of its continuing efforts to dominate applications programs, new media and other businesses -- a degree of control that has prompted speculation about a breakup for years.
Most recently, a Silicon Valley research institute, SRI International, offered a hypothetical model in which Microsoft eventually becomes five separately owned and operated companies, which SRI called the Baby Softs. According to SRI, these Baby Softs would consist of the following:
*An operating-systems company that sells all versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system.
*An applications-software company that invents, acquires and sells classical productivity applications like word processors, spreadsheets, data bases and Internet browsers.
*A content media company, taking as its genesis today's Microsoft Network, that would acquire, promote and sell access to on-line and traditional media products.
*A networking company that includes network technology assets like the recently acquired WebTV Networks.
*A company that oversees the holdings of Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, and anything else that does not fit into the other companies.
The logic of such a setup becomes apparent when viewed against the specific demands of the lawsuits filed last week.
Most of the demands in the suits are intended to stop Microsoft from using its operating-system monopoly to force personal computer makers and consumers to accept the company's applications and World Wide Web links.
To preserve competition for Internet browser software, Government officials have asked that Microsoft either decouple its Internet Explorer browser from Windows 98 or include Netscape's browser. Yet, this demand might provide an unnecessary entitlement for Netscape, and it still does not provide for what happens when Microsoft ships future versions of the operating system like Windows NT or Windows 2000 -- which, like Windows 98, will incorporate Microsoft's browser in such a way that it appears to be an integral part of the operating system.
The Justice Department has various other goals, including forcing Microsoft to let computer makers distribute rival browsers and modify their opening "boot up" screen if they so choose -- something the company has contractually forbidden manufacturers to do in the past.
The states, in their lawsuit, want to stop Microsoft from linking the sales of its Microsoft Office application suite to sales of Windows for computer makers.
Breaking up Microsoft into separate operating-systems and applications companies, with a clear definition of those two categories, would eliminate the need for all these demands. Leaving Microsoft intact fails to address the original impetus for the antitrust suits: the need to create an environment in which competition can flourish.
In any case, in seeking to re-establish a competitive market, the definition of an operating system versus an application is perhaps the most crucial component of any legal action against Microsoft.
This is a contentious area, and one in which Microsoft has to date been intractable. It is none of the Government's business, the company says, to decide what it will build into its operating-system software, including applications like browsers.
But the malleable nature of software is such that when lines between operating systems and applications blur -- as they have so fully to date -- the ability of Microsoft's competitors to provide innovative applications, and the ability of consumers to buy those products, is all but eliminated.
The argument that an operating system is whatever Microsoft or anyone else says it is has purely technical merit. But one can imagine that the AT&T Corporation felt the same way about what constituted a telephone network in 1974, when the Government first filed suit against the telephone monopoly for keeping competitors out of the now fiercely competitive long-distance and telephone-equipment markets.
In the end, defining the components, and the boundaries, of the software industry will be necessary to level the playing field for Microsoft's competitors and to create a foundation for the future of digital commerce. Rather than cutting incremental deals with Microsoft about specific products and practices, the Government should ask: In what areas are there companies that want to compete? Where are competitors being unfairly stopped by an existing monopoly -- or where might that monopoly unfairly stop them in the future -- and where and how do we draw the line?
"The worst thing would be a settlement agreement with Microsoft," said a prominent Silicon Valley lawyer who contends that the Federal and state governments have not gone far enough in their lawsuits. "There needs to be a bright line drawn that can't be interpreted through wordsmithing," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
"If there are ambiguities on a piece of paper, Microsoft will just do what they want and argue later about the paper. The Government needs to say: 'These are the places where you cannot go. Don't go there!' "
Under that reasoning, a true challenge to Microsoft's monopoly would require that the Government set new definitions and standards not only for operating systems but also for all the product lines and business strategies by which Microsoft and its competitors conduct themselves in the future.
Certainly, it would be no picnic for the Government to enter a definitional debate with Microsoft in an attempt to draw that bright line separating its operating system from other software products.
But by not addressing these fundamental issues, the Government could squander a crucial opportunity to build a firm and lasting foundation for fair competition in the digital age.

HEADLINE: Rubin, Denying Yen Report, Calls Policy on Dollar Unchanged

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: KANANASKIS, Alberta, May 24

 BODY:
Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin said today that American policy on the strength of the dollar was "absolutely unchanged," despite a report that he was willing to let the currency's value rise to an exchange rate of 150 yen to help invigorate Japan's flagging economy.
Mr. Rubin, departing from a meeting of Pacific Rim finance ministers, was asked about an article in U.S. News & World Report that he was willing to let the dollar rise. 
 "Our dollar policy remains absolutely unchanged," he replied. "There was no discussion as far as I can recollect of exchange rates here." Mr. Rubin said he had told the Japanese he shared their concern about a weak yen, although that did not suggest any change in American policy.
The magazine's article said the Treasury Secretary was willing to let the dollar rise if that would help keep Japan's economy afloat. If the dollar strengthens, Japanese-made products would probably become less expensive, helping increase exports.
Mr. Rubin has said that a strong dollar "is in the U.S. national interest." But he has also repeatedly said that Washington shared Japanese concerns about excessive weakness of the yen.
The Secretary, in Canada for meetings with finance ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, met with Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga of Japan on Friday. While they discussed a Japanese proposal to deregulate the sales of yen-based securities, current exchange rates "did not come up," Mr. Rubin said.
The dollar ended last week at 135.90 yen. Analysts predicted it could reach 140 yen in a month, amid Indonesia's turmoil and expectations that the Japanese economy would remain weak.
At the end of three days of meetings at this lake resort in the Canadian Rockies, southwest of Calgary, the finance ministers issued a statement declaring that the International Monetary Fund had a central role in repairing the fractured economies of Asia, while urging the fund, as a lender of last resort, to pay closer heed to the social costs of its programs. "We endorse the approach of the I.M.F.," the ministers said. "We also recognized the flexibility that the I.M.F. has shown in adapting its program requirements to changing economic and social circumstances in the region."
The finance ministers also welcomed efforts by China and other countries to stabilize their currencies, and recommended that new impetus be given to development of bond markets in Asia.
The Pacific nations' endorsement of the I.M.F.'s role comes as critics say that the fund's terms for a $43 billion international rescue of Indonesia's shattered economy, including the ending of price subsidies on fuel and other goods, were too harsh and contributed to riots that left hundreds dead and pushed President Suharto to resign after 32 years in power.

HEADLINE: 'Dummies' Publisher Files for Stock Sale

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
IDG Books Worldwide Inc., the publisher of "Windows for Dummies," "Wine for Dummies" and other instructional books, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise as much as $50 million through the sale of common stock.
The company, which was founded in 1990 and is based in Foster City, Calif., has become famous for explaining complex subjects, ranging from computer software to personal finance, in an easy-to-understand format. 
 The success of the concept is based in part on falling prices for personal computers. Lower prices have attracted more novices who need help using word processors, computer spreadsheets and the Internet.
IDG's links to the computer world begin with its parent company, International Data Group Inc., the Boston-based publisher of magazines and newspapers like PC World, Computerworld and Infoworld. International Data will continue to hold a controlling stake in IDG after the stock sale.
The plain-English instruction manuals helped revenue grow at an annual compounded rate of 46.2 percent from the fiscal year 1993 through 1997.
Nevertheless, the company remains heavily dependent on the computer sector, with roughly 50 percent of its net revenue in the fiscal year 1997 coming from books devoted to the use of software manufactured by the Microsoft Corporation. IDG noted in the registration statement that it would have to write off about $3 million of books on Windows 98 if the Justice Department's antitrust suit against Microsoft led to changes in the software package.

HEADLINE: Frank C. Montero, Racial Pioneer, Dies at 89

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Frank C. Montero, a racial pioneer who in his various guises as political gadfly, government official, foundation executive and real estate developer devoted his life to smoothing the way toward an integrated society, died on May 8 at a nursing home in Oberlin, Ohio. He was 89 and a longtime resident of the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
In a career in which he spent a dozen years as associate executive director of the National Urban League, directed a foundation that brought African students to the United States, ran a program for the United States Mission to the United Nations to acclimate African and other third world delegates to American society, put in a stint as vice president of a corporation promoting integrated real estate developments and later became vice president of the Tishman real estate company, Mr. Montero was Exhibit A in a lifelong campaign to integrate American society. 
 From the time he was a youngster, Mr. Montero was in the forefront of integration. His, for example, was one of the first black families to move into the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, and as a schoolboy, Mr. Montero, who was regularly beaten by his white classmates, learned early the problems of being black in a white-dominated society.
As the son of a largely uneducated Virginia-born baseball player who played in South America in an era when black players were not welcome in the major leagues, Mr. Montero did pretty well for himself, graduating from a New England prep school, studying under Ralph Bunche at Howard University, receiving one master's degree, in social work, from Columbia University and another, in public administration, from New York University.
His mother, who was also from Hampton, Va., was a school teacher who knew the value of education, and, as one of the few black teachers in the New York City public school system, a woman who had little truck with the strictures of a racist society.
When her son showed signs of becoming a juvenile delinquent, she packed him off to Mount Hermon, an exclusive boarding school in Northfield, Mass., where as only the school's second black student, albeit a distinctly light-skinned one, he thrived, becoming captain of the basketball team.
In what he later described as an effort to "find my identity," he passed up the chance to attend a white college and enrolled at Howard, a traditionally black university, where he majored in economics and came under the influence of his political science instructor, Mr. Bunche.
His work with the Urban League in the 1940's and 1950's brought him to prominence in New York, but for all that, Mr. Montero, a highly gregarious man whose jokes and big, booming laugh made him a cherished companion, was considered so much of an oddity on the local political scene that newspaper accounts of his activities invariably identified him by his race. In 1950, for example, when Mr. Montero, whose previous marriage had ended in divorce, married a wealthy and socially prominent Boston woman descended from the Puritan preacher, Cotton Mather, the headline on The New York Times account read, "Miss Anne Mather Married To Negro."
Well, not just any Negro. The article said Mr. Montero, who had met his bride when she did volunteer work for the Urban League, was "a prominent Negro social worker."
It was several years before his wife's parents fully accepted Mr. Montero, but since she had money of her own, the estrangement did not keep the couple from buying a house in Riverdale, where Mr. Montero, whose daughters attended the Fieldston School, was once again a racial pioneer in a predominantly white neighborhood. The couple were divorced in 1974.
In 1960, Mr. Montero became a footnote to John F. Kennedy's presidential victory when the State Department turned down a request from a foundation headed by Mr. Montero for a $100,000 grant to bring poor African students to the United States and a Kennedy family foundation gleefully provided the money.
Drawn to the reform wing of New York Democratic politics, Mr. Montero plunged into politics as a campaign coordinator for Mayor Robert F. Wagner's 1961 re-election run against the Democratic bosses.
His political efforts won him appointment to the city's human rights commission and a job as special assistant to Ambassador Adlai E. Stevenson, the American delegate to the United Nations.
His survivors include a daughter from his first marriage, Curle M. Lee of England; two other daughters, Marianne of Riverdale and Laurie of Ashland, Ore.; a sister, Marian Johnston of Sea Cliff, N.Y., and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Their Suharto And Ours

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

 BODY:
In December, 1975, President Ford and his Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, visited President Suharto in Indonesia. They reacted with a nod and a wink to his plans to seize East Timor. The day after they left, Indonesian forces invaded the distant island, using American arms. In the invasion and ensuing occupation, a third of East Timor's 600,000 people died.
When it was pointed out that using American arms aid for aggression violated U.S. law, Mr. Kissinger reportedly told his staff: "Can't we construe stopping a Communist government in the middle of Indonesia as self-defense?" (East Timor was in fact remote from Indonesia, and its mostly Roman Catholic people wanted independence, not Communism.) 
 That episode tells us that an element in American foreign policy also fell when President Suharto resigned last week. He was one more in a string of dictators who were admired by U.S. governments but rejected, in the end, by their own people.
Mr. Kissinger was most closely identified with the policy: the idea that we should support authoritarian rulers because they could assure stability. Thus Mr. Kissinger smiled on the Shah of Iran, Augusto Pinochet of Chile, Yahya Khan of Pakistan and the like.
But it has turned out that tyranny does not assure stability. Democracy does. Suharto lasted a very long time compared with other tyrants, 32 years. But eventually resentment of his kleptocracy -- the corrupt enrichment of his children and other relatives -- boiled over.
Suharto ruled by fear, as tyrants always do. Anyone who looked like a potential opponent was imprisoned or brutalized into silence. But that system of oppression stopped working, for reasons brilliantly described by a New York Times correspondent in Jakarta, Nicholas D. Kristof.
What overthrew Suharto was not a guerrilla insurgency, Mr. Kristof wrote, "but a conspiracy of far more potent subversives: capitalism, markets and globalization. . . . Mr. Suharto's security forces never figured out how to handcuff them or torture them into submission. His sophisticated military equipment can detect a guerrilla in the jungle of East Timor at night, but it was unable to discern bad bank loans or prop up a tumbling currency."
Under the pressures of economic crisis, ordinary Indonesians -- students especially -- lost their fear of the regime. Protests continued even after troops made the mistake, fatal for Suharto, of firing on an unarmed crowd.
The events in Indonesia have also buried a theoretical justification of strongman rule. That is the notion -- invented by Lee Kuan Yew, the longtime ruler of Singapore -- that Asians prefer order to freedom, and that such "Asian values" underlie the region's decade of rapid economic growth.
The economic miracle has come to an end in the Asian financial crisis. And political change, first in Thailand and South Korea, now in Indonesia, has shown that Asians do not really prefer to live under authoritarian regimes. They want a voice, and they want freedom.
The Indonesian story is not over. Will an aroused public be content with an anointed Suharto successor, B. J. Habibie, as President -- and content to let the Suharto family keep its monopolistic grip on the economy? It seems unlikely. Just as doubtful is Mr. Habibie's ability to meet the international conditions that would stabilize Indonesia's currency.
The larger implications of Indonesian events are for China. Its Communist rulers have maintained stability by rapid economic growth and tight political control. Indonesia shows the limits of that formula. Continuing stability will surely depend on the introduction of democracy in China, however gradually.
There is also a lesson for the United States. Right up to the end, the U.S. Defense Department was training Indonesian units that specialize in the torture and "disappearance" of dissidents. Congress banned American training of Indonesian forces in 1992, but it went on secretly until a victim of torture escaped and told his story this month, shaming the Pentagon into cutting off the program.
In the world as it is, the United States cannot deal only with nice guys. We need good relations with some undemocratic governments. But we do not have to condone savagery, much less assist it.

HEADLINE: THE FALL OF SUHARTO: VOICES;
New Freedoms Feed Ethnic Frictions

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: GRESIK, Indonesia, May 24

 BODY:
Doni Setiawan leaned over the pot of boiled corn cobs that he was selling on the street and steam swirled around his flashing eyes as he argued with his buddy Sarpin.
It was a triumphal moment for democracy, the first time the two friends had ever felt free enough to discuss national affairs openly. Yet the topic they chose to discuss as they exercised their new right of free expression was this: Should Indonesia expel all citizens of Chinese origin? 
 "We're really being monopolized and colonized by the Chinese," declared Mr. Setiawan, 27, who was hovering over his pushcart on a bustling street in this city 400 miles east of the capital, Jakarta. "The Chinese should be kicked out! Then we would be freed of them forever."
Mr. Sarpin, 34, thought that was too extreme. But after more discussion he nodded his head.
"Yeah, they do treat us like slaves," Mr. Sarpin reflected. "I guess the Chinese should be kicked out."
The exchange captured the volatile mood in Indonesia these days: exultant at the overthrow of President Suharto a few days ago, exuberant at the expectation of new freedoms, and pregnant with dangers. There are plenty of signs that Mr. Suharto's resignation on Thursday marked not just the end of a tumultuous roller coaster ride but also the beginning of a new one.
The triumph of a form of "people power" in Indonesia raises critical questions about what kind of country the people seek. The answers are unclear, but conversations with dozens of people here suggest that a democracy might be less tolerant and compassionate than the dictatorship was, and that a democracy might allow an outlet for the hatreds lurking among poor workers and peasants.
 
Unexpected Threat: 'Illiberal Democracy'
No one place can fully capture the patterns of an entire country like Indonesia, but this city seems a fairly typical window into the restive national soul. An old trading port of 720,000 people on the northeast coast of the main Indonesian island of Java, Gresik -- like most places in Indonesia -- has not been the scene of any violence so far and is simply one more Indonesian hub where peasants come to sell vegetables and buy sarongs.
In Gresik, as in most cities, most Indonesians tend to live in cramped houses or shacks with dubious plumbing, while a small minority of ethnic Chinese often live in mansions with satellite dishes in the yards. Ethnic Chinese account for less than 3 percent of Indonesia's population of 210 million but control perhaps half the economy.
President Suharto emphasized ethnic and religious harmony and strictly forbade hate-mongering, so the news media never gave an outlet to the bitterness that many poor, uneducated workers and peasants feel for the Chinese.
Now, if political freedoms come to Indonesia, one possibility is what has been called an "illiberal democracy" -- a system where the majority rules and decides quite democratically to oppress a minority.
If Indonesia becomes more democratic, policy making may be based not on the considered views of the cosmopolitan ruling class in Jakarta but on the simmering anger of people like Arudji Sutanjo, a 38-year-old small businessman.
"Our blood will never mix with Chinese blood," Mr. Sutanjo said earnestly over coffee in his living room. "Actually, we hate the Chinese, but we couldn't do anything about them before, because they were protected by Suharto. But I don't think they will be protected any more."
"We should send all the Chinese men back," Mr. Sutanjo said in a genial tone. "The women can stay and marry Indonesians, and then the Chinese race here will disappear.
"And if they convert to Islam, then they can stay because they will change. Because Chinese who convert do not act like Chinese. They are not arrogant and they do not swagger."
 
A Poor Economy Feeds Hardening Attitudes
It is difficult to gauge how many people think this way, because just a week or two ago it was a forbidden topic. Now, the press has become more open, but nobody knows what the rules are.
Just this weekend, Indonesia's leading newspaper, Kompas, suggested in the course of a long article that the taboo on public discussion of the Chinese in Indonesia should be lifted. It also quoted Mr. Probosutedjo, a leading Indonesian businessman who is Mr. Suharto's half-brother, as urging that a new legal structure be established to discriminate against ethnic Chinese in business.
Attitudes toward the Chinese seem to be hardening because of the nation's economic distress. Here in Gresik, people complain about the rising prices with more passion than they discuss the fall of Mr. Suharto.
"My expenses are up, because I'm staying at a place where I can't cook and I have to eat street food, and the prices have gone way up," complained Mr. Muri, 38, who runs a portable arcade: he carries around a duffel bag full of electronic games and charges children the equivalent of a penny to play for five minutes.
"I have fewer customers now," Mr. Muri added bleakly. "Maybe that's because parents are giving their kids less pocket money."
Indonesia already has some of the most racist laws anywhere in the world, all directed at the Chinese minority. Chinese-language schools are banned, Chinese-language materials are forbidden, and it is illegal to celebrate Chinese New Year.
Any further tightening or expulsion is unlikely in the immediate future. Indonesian politics are still dominated by an educated and relatively tolerant elite, and the likely contenders for President have never given signs that they might seek to exploit Indonesia's racial issues.
A Muslim leader, Amien Rais, may eventually emerge as President, and he would represent a dramatically different style from the secular leaders of the past. But Mr. Rais has never tried to exploit racial animosities; on the contrary, he is a sophisticated moderate with a Ph. D in political science from the University of Chicago.
How Indonesia handles these issues will be enormously important for all of Asia. Few analysts believe that China would ever intervene militarily to protect ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia, but Chinese minorities are also resented for their economic success and supposed arrogance in countries like the Philippines and Malaysia, and the only place where they have really assimilated successfully is Thailand.
 
Amid the Debate, A Call for Fairness
Among ordinary Indonesians, opinions about the Chinese range widely. While many in Gresik said that they thought that the Chinese should be expelled, there were also people who boldly expressed the opposite view.
"Chinese are Indonesian citizens, too," said Agus Supriono, who works for the power company in Gresik, as he sat on a stool in front of a hardware store and disagreed with a half-dozen of his friends who had just railed against the Chinese. "If they are good citizens, they are O. K. with me. After all, they contribute to the economy as well."
"I'm against putting restrictions on them, against expelling them," Mr. Supriono said, as his friends listened intently. "In Islam, there is nothing about treating races differently. We should treat everybody the same.
"But if there were a vote on expelling the Chinese," Mr. Supriono added sadly, "at least 75 percent of Indonesians would vote yes."
Of course, it is far from clear that Mr. Suharto's downfall will lead to the kind of democracy that will empower ordinary workers and peasants. There may be a military coup, or the educated ruling elite may continue to run the show under some authoritarian system.
While people are getting used to the idea that a dictatorship may be ending, they seem profoundly unsure what kind of country they want. Some speak of their desire to introduce Islamic law or even create an Islamic state, noting that 90 percent of Indonesians are Muslims. Others yearn for Western-style democracy and the rule of law. Yet others prefer a more authoritarian model, saying that they are wary of the chaos of democracy and the introduction of too much freedom.
"I don't like the American system at all, not at all" said Ms. Kumala, an unemployed 19-year-old who graduated from high school last year. "Americans are too free," she added. "They do not follow religion very much. And they have free sex."
Whatever political system is on the horizon, the age of strongman rule seems to be on the wane, and even a new dictatorship might have to be more responsive to public sentiment. Thus one possibility may be new restrictions on Chinese businesses, perhaps modeled on the laws in Malaysia that help indigenous people at the expense of Chinese. Even those in Gresik who did not like the idea of expelling the Chinese seemed to favor new laws to restrict their business influence.
 
Restrictions on Chinese Are Likely to Backfire
"Expelling the Chinese might work, but I don't know," said Ramsiana Kasuma, a 20-year-old college student. "My neighbor is Chinese and she is very kind and gets along with us well. So I wouldn't want her sent away.
"Maybe we should just put restrictions on the Chinese so that they do not dominate the economy."
One brake on any efforts to expel the Chinese or confiscate their wealth is that it might be catastrophic for Indonesia as a whole. East African countries like Uganda expelled ethnic Indians in the 1970's because they had dominated business and were bitterly resented. But the exodus shattered the local economies.
The most important Chinese-controlled assets in Indonesia are not the physical buildings they own but their contacts and business savvy. In a modern economy like Indonesia's, any move to drive away Chinese businesses would send the stock market and currency tumbling and would harm almost everyone.
The attitudes toward Chinese are varied and complex, not loathing so much as smoldering resentment, and all sprinkled with a grudging respect. When a visitor asks why the ethnic Chinese are invariably much richer than the Indonesians around them, the answers are often surprisingly straightforward.
"They work harder," said Mrs. Sumayah, a 36-year-old housewife. "In a Chinese family, you see the mothers working, the kids working, everyone working."
"Sometimes we feel jealous," she added. "We think, why are we Javanese below the Chinese?"
Mrs. Sumayah's husband emerged from the doorway and laughingly interjected: "Sometimes? We don't feel jealous just some of the time. We feel that way all the time!"
Most Indonesians in Gresik said that Chinese prosper because they are better at business than other people and work harder. But some also insisted that Mr. Suharto favored the Chinese.
It is true that some prominent Chinese tycoons are close to Mr. Suharto and were given monopolies that helped them prosper. But most Chinese in Indonesia struggle against acute discrimination -- in Gresik, for example, the town center has a large market with countless stalls, but ethnic Chinese are banned from operating in that market.
Religious tensions are overlaid on the ethnic division, for Indonesians are mostly Muslims while many of the Chinese are Christians. Some Indonesians complained that the Chinese are trying to build too many churches, or are trying to show up the Muslims by building fancy new churches next to old mosques.
"The Christians are over-expanding and taking advantage of religious freedom," complained Mr. Sutaryo, a 27-year-old worker in a petrochemical factory.
Still, many Indonesians here speak fondly of individual Chinese even as they complain about the Chinese as a class. On one street in Gresik, the townspeople spoke glowingly of the Chinese Christian pastor, Petrus Riady, whom they have elected as head of the neighborhood. Last week, when there was talk that there might be rioting against Chinese, the neighbors set up a 24-patrol around Mr. Riady's house to protect him.
"I was very happy about that," Mr. Riady said as he sat in the entrance to his modest house. "There may have been some riots elsewhere in society, but there are many nice and kind people as well."
One sign of progress, of a sort, is that in the upheavals of 1965-66, when Mr. Suharto pushed out his predecessor, Sukarno, and seized power, thousands of Chinese were killed in an explosion of popular rage. In recent months, there have been anti-Chinese riots in many cities, but the pattern has been for Indonesians to loot Chinese shops but not to assault the Chinese themselves.
 
Fearing for the Future While Trying to Fit In
"If the Government doesn't solve the economic crisis, the next time the riots will be even worse," said Imam Riyanto, a 37-year-old college graduate who does odd jobs. "Even so, while people would take things and burn the shops, we wouldn't actually hurt the Chinese."
Mr. Riyanto had said a moment earlier that he favored the introduction of Islamic law, including amputation of a hand for stealing. But when he was asked whether the looters in the riots should have their hands amputated, he shook his head. "No, that's a different situation," Mr. Riyanto said. "The looters took things from Chinese, not from Indonesians."
All this leaves the Chinese shopkeepers in Gresik jittery about the risks of renewed upheavals.
"We're afraid it could be like it was 30 years ago, and so we have to be very careful," said a 58-year-old Chinese shop owner who insisted on not being identified. "We have a lot of Indonesian friends, and our neighbors around here wouldn't bother us. But if there are riots, you never know what strangers might do."
In recent decades, Chinese have tried harder to fit into Indonesian society, so hard that most young people speak the Indonesian and Javanese languages, but no Chinese.
"Older folks are sad about that, of course," the shop owner said, speaking Mandarin with a strong Javanese accent. "But that's the way it is. We're living in Indonesia."

HEADLINE: Summer's Plague of Angels Arrives;
After Scraping By, Adirondack Town Braces for Crowds and Jobs

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: LONG LAKE, N.Y., May 24

 BODY:
Three months ago, the streets of this Adirondack hamlet were nearly deserted. In Hamilton County, where Long Lake -- population 750 -- is practically a metropolis, the unemployment rate was up to 18 percent, higher than any other county in the state. Business was so slow at the grocery store here that the owner had to take out a loan to cover expenses, and he said later that he had stayed open only as a public service.
But in the last few days, the gloom that hung over Long Lake all winter has lifted. American flags are flying from telephone poles. Boats and docks have been moved from storage into the lake. The diner is drawing a breakfast crowd for the first time in months. And John Hosley, who owns Hoss's Country Corner, has just stocked his ice cream store across the street with 9,000 plastic spoons. 
 It happens every year, just about now. Long Lake welcomes back hundreds of summer homeowners and visitors on Memorial Day weekend, and in only a few days the number of people in this sleepy town in the state's most sparsely populated county quadruples. It is all part of the migration that transforms this region, sometimes called the Appalachia of the North, into a rustic retreat for the well-heeled refugees of New York City and its suburbs.
There are, of course, summer towns across the country that go through a similar boom every Memorial Day weekend. In all of them, urban dwellers revel in their escape to the country, while the locals brace themselves for quite the opposite: three months of hard work and an end to peace and quiet.
Still, few changes are as stark as in this lakeside getaway, nestled in the vast Adirondack wilderness. For the year-round residents, summer is the time to make the money that will support them the rest of the year. It is an irksome reminder to people who pride themselves on independence that their livelihood depends on the arrival of what they call the flatlanders.
"Wake up Saturday morning, and you see a metamorphosis," said Mr. Hosley, whose upscale general store offers everything from handmade wooden canoes to fresh dill pickles. "The intellectual world will have arrived," he added wryly.
The village of Long Lake is one of two hamlets in the town of Long Lake, population 930, in the heart of the Adirondack Park, an expanse of public and private land about the size of Massachusetts. It is about 250 miles northwest of New York City, and you can get here only by traveling at least 50 miles of two-lane highway, or chartering a seaplane.
The small downtown includes a lodge-like turn-of-the-century hotel (no telephones, no televisions, but two stuffed bears in the lobby and a big porch overlooking the water), a grocery, Mr. Hosley's store, four restaurants that close or cut back their hours come October and two summer ice cream shops. The highway into town is lined with about a dozen motels and inns, as well as a state campground.
But the town is less known for amenities than for cool lakes and lush forests, and over the last year, it has been the focal point for one of the state's biggest environmental disputes. This is where Marylou Whitney hoped to develop luxury estates on the family's immense "camp" -- the term here for all summer homes, even mansions like Mrs. Whitney's -- but instead was persuaded to sell the 15,000 acres to the park.
To many residents, that decision was a disappointment, denying them jobs and new customers, and it was yet another example of how "outsiders" -- whether environmentalists or summer vacationers -- controlled their fate.
This situation is not new. The village has attracted vacationers since the late 19th century. But in recent years, as logging, mining and other businesses have faded, the summer trade has carried its economy.
"You either make your money now, or you eat bark for the rest of the year," remarked Tom Bissell, a 70-year-old native and Town Supervisor.
Over the next few months, this town becomes a place of hotels without vacancies, crowded campgrounds and quaint turn-of-the-century stone and shingle cottages. Seaplanes shuttle some people into the back country for fishing expeditions, and other people take boats to old homes that are accessible only by water.
It is a second home to old money, like the heirs of William C. Whitney, the 19th-century industrialist, as well as a hideaway for celebrities like Sigourney Weaver, the actress.
A few miles outside town, at the state campground at Eaton Lake, Rick Martin was relieved to be back at work on Friday. In February and March, there was no work to be had, and he had run out of savings, started collecting unemployment checks of $300 a week and had little to do all day but watch television.
"You try to hunker down, but you get anxious," he said. Still, with the coming of summer, Mr. Martin's job as supervisor of the campground had started again, and on Saturday more than half the 135 campsites were filled. He was busy overseeing three newly hired employees as they raked the shoreline, fixed the restrooms and handled a flurry of last-minute phone calls.
In summer, there are jobs here for anyone who wants one, teen-agers are called at their homes and offered work, and some hotels bring in women from England because they can't find enough help locally.
But this modest prosperity does not come without a price, which is being overrun by vacationers who cause long lines at the post office, complain that their cell phones don't work and panic when the New York newspapers are a day late.
"One of the things that happens today is that you go from leaving your car keys in the ignition all the time to locking the doors wherever you park," Robert Gibson, the town's park, recreation and tourism director, remarked.
Mr. Bissell added, "We all realize that we depend one way or another on the people coming here, but that doesn't mean we aren't glad to see Labor Day."
The outsiders and the locals don't mix much. But on Friday morning, as Mr. Bissell and other regulars gathered at their usual table at the Long Lake Diner for breakfast, they happily counted the unfamiliar faces walking through the door.
"The snowbirds are coming back," said Gregg Wallace, a contractor at the table, using the term for retirees who winter in Florida and summer in the Northeast.
"No more weekends," Mr. Hosley mused.
"Thank God," Mr. Bissell remarked.
After pouring the table another round of coffee, Shea Farrell, 19, who was working her first day as a waitress after coming home from college, said that some of the new arrivals could be snooty, but that it was a welcome change. "You can get tired of being in a small town where everyone knows everything about everyone," she said.
The silver lining to the summer traffic, Ms. Farrell explained, is seeing friends from past summers and meeting new people.
George A. Woods, who grew up in the Adirondacks, described it in his memoir-like novel, "Vibrations" (Harper and Row, 1970): "Summer meant people, change, faces you hadn't seen for a year. People opening up their summer homes and camps, people pale but with smooth skin, not the leathery, beaten-down, lined expression of the year-round residents who had to live through the wind and the weather. It was the summer people who pumped blood into us and money and a new life."
It is a love-hate relationship.
On Friday morning, David Lamos, a Long Lake native who owns Northern Borne, the town's grocery, ground double the amount of hamburger that he had the day before and chatted with anyone who walked by. "These summer people are very sweet, classy people," he exclaimed at one point.
The winter had been rough. The grocery had stayed open but cut back its hours, and dropped from a dozen employees to only a couple. The business had needed to take out some loans to survive the winter. And he and his wife, who home-school their children, continued to live without basics that he dismisses as "fancy frills," like a television.
So this weekend, Mr. Lamos was pleased to see the return of families that have been coming here for generations. As he sliced some ham for one summer regular, a woman who had just arrived from Delaware, he explained to another visitor why he had never left.
"It's like a cocoon, the changes, that's what I like," he said.
The woman waiting for cold cuts added her own opinion. "What I like is that it never changes," she said. "It never gets cutesy. It just stays the way it's always been since my father started coming here in 1917." And she begged, "Don't tell people to come here."
That was not Mr. Lamos's attitude, and he said quietly as she walked away, "These people want it to themselves, but that's what it's here for -- for people to come."
And then he urged the visitor to come back and bring the entire family.

HEADLINE: Haitians Bear H.I.V. Alone, Waiting for Word on Asylum

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
When Amos Dacy fled his native Haiti in a wobbly boat, he had a simple goal: to live. But though he left behind the political persecution he says could have killed him, his ordeal continues.
Every day, Mr. Dacy sits in a Brooklyn apartment, alone and sick. "I spend many sleepless nights," he said, his eyes staring aimlessly. "I think that if I had stayed in Haiti, I would have been killed. Now I wonder if it's worse to die alone." 
 Five years have passed since Mr. Dacy and 200 other Haitian refugees with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, were confined in a camp at the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Under a judge's order, they were finally allowed into the United States. But most of them still have not won the political asylum they seek. Some have sickened and died; others are poor and unable to get work.
And like Mr. Dacy, most are struggling alone: They find themselves cut off from fellow Haitian immigrants, bereft of the community support that sustains many newcomers far from family and home. The stigma of AIDS runs so deep among many Haitians that most of the H.I.V.-positive refugees hide their condition, and few fellow Haitians have extended open arms to them.
Revealing her plight "would be like a death sentence," said a woman in St. Albans, Queens, who, like most of a dozen refugees interviewed, agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity. "This is something that my family and only close friends know about. I can't deal with that kind of publicity."
For a brief moment, back in 1993, the refugees' struggle had flared into public view. As they languished at Guantanamo -- held far longer than their fellow refugees who did not carry the AIDS virus -- they became something of a cause celebre, with vocal support from AIDS groups and celebrities like Bruce Springsteen and Susan Sarandon rallying to their side.
Eventually, they were permitted to enter the United States as they awaited a final ruling on their requests for political asylum, and about 150 came to New York City. But settling here proved to be just the beginning of their battle.
As their cases crawl through the immigration bureaucracy, most have been unable to get work permits, and hold menial jobs at best. And as attention has turned to other causes, financing has largely dried up for the nonprofit groups that were helping them resettle.
They are still haunted by their time at Guantanamo, confined in what a Federal judge called "an H.I.V. prison camp." Some still seem unable or unwilling to believe that they are infected with a deadly virus. At the same time, many are growing sicker, and about 20 have died of AIDS, including three in the last few weeks.
On top of everything has come the cold reception from their countrymen here. For many Haitian immigrants in New York, the refugees represent all the worst stereotypes Haitians have fought to overcome: impoverished, AIDS-carrying boat people. Some of the stigma lingers from the early days of the AIDS epidemic, when Haitians in general were mistakenly classified as a high-risk group. Now, some social workers say, it is almost as if Haitians are not allowed to have AIDS.
When the organizations aiding the refugees were in danger of losing public financing, pleas to organize against the cutback failed to galvanize the usually vocal community. And no one has raised any private money to offset the loss.
In February, three social service agencies lost the Federal grants -- roughly $200,000 a year for each group -- that they had used to find housing for the refugees, provide health care and counseling, and assist with immigration issues. A fourth organization had its grant sharply reduced.
City officials who dole out the Federal money, which is intended to help people with H.I.V., said only that they had received 400 applications and could only finance about 100 programs this year. "It was a competitive process," said John Gadd, a spokesman for the city's Department of Health. "There were a lot of worthy applications."
Most of the refugees still get welfare benefits and housing subsidies. But with money for additional services cut off, Haitian social workers warned that the refugees could face growing isolation and depression. They could also find it harder to get medical treatment, even as new drugs are allowing people with H.I.V. to live longer and stay healthier.
While the stark images of confinement at Guantanamo galvanized outrage and support for the refugees, their silent ordeal here has left them and their social workers wondering whether people still care. "I don't think they're totally forgotten," said Gabrielle Kersaint, executive director of the Haitian Women's Program, one of the organizations whose financing was eliminated. But, she added, "The pie is getting smaller, and people are less sympathetic toward refugees and immigrants."
Although the refugees came from every region of Haiti, the broad outlines of their stories are similar. In October 1991, after a bloody, military-led coup that overthrew Haiti's elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, soldiers hunted down many Aristide supporters. About 40,000 went into hiding and eventually fled in dangerously overcrowded sailboats, many of which were intercepted at sea by United States Coast Guard cutters.
The refugees were held at the American base at Guantanamo as officials reviewed their accounts of political persecution. Most were eventually determined to have fled for economic, rather than political, reasons, and were returned to Haiti. But about 15,000 were found to have strong claims for asylum, and were allowed into the United States while their applications were processed. Even now, however, fewer than 2 percent have formally been granted asylum.
Refugees who tested positive for H.I.V. at Guantanamo were detained longer, under immigration rules that generally denied entry to the United States for people with the virus. But in June 1993, Judge Sterling Johnson Jr. of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, calling the detention "a tragedy of immense proportion," ordered that the camp be closed and all the remaining refugees allowed into the country.
Among them was the woman who now lives in St. Albans, who settled into a comfortable three-bedroom home with her sons and other relatives. But she said her uncertain immigration status had left her unable to find a decent job. Like most of the others, she gets by on public assistance, which pains her, she said.
"I don't want them," she said, stroking her thick corn braids and referring to food stamps and Medicaid. "I didn't come here to live off the state. But I don't have asylum."
One man refused to be interviewed at his home because he said it was not fit for a guest. Standing on a street corner along Nostrand Avenue in Flatbush, Brooklyn, he described the routine of loneliness his life has become -- days spent wandering aimlessly around town, with an occasional trip to see his social workers or lawyers, who are themselves overloaded with cases.
Like the others, he has no green card and has not held a job in more than four years. Experts say there is little likelihood that the refugees will be deported, even if their asylum applications are for some reason rejected, but the legal limbo they live in wears on them.
"I'm constantly reminded that I'm not home," he said, a cigarette dangling between his fingers as it slowly burned. "When I walk down the street, I don't know when they're going to come and send me back. So I'm always on edge."
Getting asylum and finding work have been the most pressing goals for most of the refugees. Many left spouses and children behind in Haiti, and still hope to bring their families here one day. For some, the fact of their illness seems to be pushed to a dark corner of a mind preoccupied with more immediate problems.
"I don't think it's as much denial," said Dr. Marie Carmel Pierre-Louis, program director with the Haitian Coalition on AIDS, which is based in Brooklyn. "It's a complete disbelief."
She said the refugees' treatment at Guantanamo had left them confused and deeply suspicious.
The refugees, who were apparently mostly infected through heterosexual contact, said they were not clearly informed of their status at Guantanamo. Instead, they said, they were told that they had a "problem with their blood" and would be kept apart from the thousands of their countrymen for a while. But they remained isolated for more than a year and said they were beaten and abused.
"To them, being labeled H.I.V.-positive was part of a large conspiracy against them," said Dr. Pierre-Louis, who worked with most of the refugees when they were at Guantanamo. "Their thinking was that, 'If I was as sick as they said, how come they didn't release me so I can get help?' "
Now, some are fatalistic about their situation. "I don't even think about it," said one man who now lives in East Flatbush with his wife and son. "We're all going to die one day. So I take care of myself."
Mr. Dacy spends his days watching television and listening to a Creole-language radio station in his bedroom, which also serves as a makeshift living room. He rarely goes out and has no friends besides his social workers, he said. Mr. Dacy's life is not here, in the fifth floor walk-up in Crown Heights. It lies in the little plastic photo album perched at the edge of his bed, next to the remote control.
In the album are images of the family Mr. Dacy left behind, and every day he wonders whether he will see them again, or die first. He knows that he is in a race against time, although he has not shown any symptoms of his infection. Mr. Dacy, a small, stocky man, takes a daily cocktail of four medications in the hope of keeping his illness at bay.
"They are awful," he said.
Mr. Dacy gets $615 a month to pay his rent, $120 in food stamps and Medicaid coverage. He rents out a back room in his apartment for $215, some of which he sends back to his family in Haiti. Despite his loneliness, Mr. Dacy said he could not return to his home in "Cite Soleil," a vast expanse of cardboard huts widely considered the most wretched slum in the Western Hemisphere. His home was recently burned, he said, and his tormentors are still around.
Benedict Jean will not return home to Haiti either. His body lay peacefully last month in the Gomez funeral home at the edge of Park Slope, Brooklyn, his coffin surrounded by a wreath and two small potted plants.
The gathering was unusually small for a Haitian wake. There was no wailing, no widow, no relatives; Mr. Jean's family members are all in Haiti. Those who came to the wake -- the preacher, social workers and a couple of church members -- were all recent acquaintances, people whom Mr. Jean had met in the last days of his life. They spoke of his courage, his determination until the very end to win asylum in the adopted country where he died alone.
Although some of Mr. Jean's fellow refugees from Guantanamo have stayed in touch with one another, none of them were at the wake either. "It is a reminder of their own mortality," said Ronald Aubourg, a policy analyst with the Haitian Centers Council in Brooklyn, who met the refugees at Guantanamo and has attended nearly every wake and funeral. "They don't want to face that."
And as the refugees' cause has faded from public notice, most of the supporters who once flocked to their defense have moved on.
"No one is around anymore," said one refugee, a woman who lives in Flatbush. "When I'm hungry, there's no one to give me a dollar. I realize I have to help myself."

HEADLINE: Riding High, Bush Eases Into 2000 Election

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: CROCKETT, Tex., May 20

 BODY:
As his campaign plane bounced from town to town over the piney woods of East Texas this week, George W. Bush said he had a message: "I am totally focused on getting re-elected as Governor. My head and my heart are in Texas."
Of course, Mr. Bush has made a few quick swings out of state in recent weeks, to California, Arizona and Ohio, all to raise money for Republican candidates. ("My head and my heart is right there in Texas," he told reporters in Ohio.) And just in case, his chief political consultant has taken the helpful step of reserving the rights to some catchy-sounding sites on the World Wide Web, like www.Bush2000.org. 
 But in the main, the Governor of the nation's second-largest state is spending his time with the voters of Texas, playfully parrying reporters who constantly try to draw him out about a Presidential race with responses like, "Nice try, guy!" Should he win re-election -- polls currently show him 40 points or more ahead of his Democratic opponent -- he is almost certain to spend the first several months of next year insisting that his mind is still on Texas and the legislative session in Austin.
With a famous name and enormous fund-raising abilities, including a huge out-of-state donor list that draws heavily on supporters of his father, former President George Bush, the Texas Governor is able to wait before he kicks any Presidential effort into high gear. And with those attributes, he is clearly enjoying a luxury that many other prospective candidates for the Republican nomination in 2000 -- who are already on the rubber-chicken circuit in early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire -- simply cannot afford.
Even without any heavy campaigning outside of Texas, and even with his insistence that he will not think seriously about a Presidential race until well into next year, the 51-year-old Mr. Bush routinely tops polls in which likely voters are asked to survey the prospective Republican field.
A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll earlier this month even showed him running about as well as Vice President Al Gore in a hypothetical one-on-one matchup, though that striking result begs the question of whether voters are still confusing him with his father. (In a question in a poll by The New York Times taken last week, in which people were reminded of the distinction between the father and the son, more than 70 percent of those polled said they had no opinion of the younger Mr. Bush.)
Mr. Bush does not deny that he enjoys all the attention he is generating these days, but he waves off questions about the White House.
"He's not running for Governor of Texas," he said of Mr. Gore the other day. "So therefore he's not on the radar screen."
Mr. Bush says he is working harder than he ever has in his re-election bid, crisscrossing Texas and campaigning hard even in the "Yellow Dog Democrat" stronghold of Crockett, where he got a thunderous ovation with a speech at the local community center.
Alighting from the plane in Crockett (named for Davy), Mr. Bush was greeted by a jocular county commissioner who also happens to be named George Bush, though everyone calls the official by his nickname, Buzzy. Asked if he were a Republican, Buzzy Bush gripped the other Mr. Bush's hand, and with a huge smile, said, "Well, I am today!"
The Governor said he rarely has time for indulgences like movies. He said he could not remember the last film he saw in a theater, and the last video he recalled renting was "Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery," the James Bond parody starring Mike Myers.
"Liked it! Funny guy!" said the Governor, sounding, almost exactly like his father, right down to the famous aversion to pronouns.
As he campaigns around Texas on issues like ending the social promotion of youngsters who cannot pass state reading tests, some of the broad themes of his campaign stump speeches could clearly amount to a preview of a national speech.
In variations of one of those addresses ("the legacy speech," as his aides call it), Mr. Bush invokes the sacrifices made by his father's generation, which fought and won World War II, and then asks this generation to respond to a different set of threats.
"Today's children are not afraid of a distant threat from across the world, but a threatening violence in their own schools, their own neighborhoods," the Governor said this week in a speech before a convention of retailers in Dallas. "Today's challenge lies not so much outside our borders as inside our souls."
In Crockett and in other campaign stops, the Governor routinely addresses young people in the crowd, urging them to shun drugs and alcohol and telling them, "There is honor in abstaining from sex until you've found the person you want to marry."
Mr. Bush himself has said he had some "wild years" as a bachelor in his days as a West Texas oilman, and he was a serious drinker until he quit cold turkey on the morning after his 41st birthday party. But he said he sees no conflict in squaring the moral themes he emphasizes today with his conduct in his younger days.
"I'd be the first to admit that when I was young and irresponsible, I was irresponsible," Mr. Bush said the other day. "I've assumed the mantle of being a governor and a father in a responsible way, and the signal we ought to send to our children is that in spite of what happened in the 60's and 70's, we have learned some lessons. And the lesson ought to be, don't be using drugs and alcohol. Learn the lessons from the past."
As he campaigns around the state, Mr. Bush is emphasizing education as an issue, and he is clearly basking in recent news that Texas schoolchildren are passing the state's standardized tests in record percentages. He is also benefiting from the strong economy, though the lopsided margin he enjoys in polls over his Democratic opponent, State Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, is bound to tighten up when voters start focusing on the race this fall.
Mr. Mauro recently said Mr. Bush was "darn sure testing the Presidential waters" and ought to acknowledge it to the voters. And a state Democratic Party spokesman jumped all over the Governor when Mr. Bush gave a speech to film makers in Los Angeles last month, demanding that he "explain why he is hobnobbing with Hollywood stars and political elites rather than tending to the needs of Texans."
Mr. Bush has clearly mastered one part of the political craft, that of turning aside some questions by framing the answers in totally different terms.
For instance, asked the other day whether the Republican Party should emphasize social-issue themes like opposition to abortion in this fall's campaigns, he quickly cut in with this answer: "Themes? I emphasize themes. I emphasize the importance of the Hispanic vote. I intend to hopefully get 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in the state of Texas. I think that's an important theme for the Republican Party."
Pressed on whether he favored banning abortion, a core issue for many religious conservatives, Mr. Bush said he was a "pro-life candidate" who wanted to find ways to reduce the number of abortions, but he did not specifically endorse a legal ban on the procedure.
"We should talk about parental notification, adoption, abstinence," he said. "Issues over which we can make a difference."
As he spoke in Crockett, Mr. Bush basked in a huge ovation and was mobbed afterward for pictures and autographs. Several people in the crowd said they had come because they believed they were getting a glimpse of a future President.
"I believe he's going to run," said Thomas Frizzell, an 18-year-old senior at Crockett High School. "Of course, I don't have any personal insight into the situation, but that's what I believe. You listen to what he talks about, and it sure seems like he's setting himself up for something bigger."
For his part, as the plane took off for the next stop, Mr. Bush said he could not focus on the question until late next spring at the earliest, and would need to talk it over at considerable length with his wife, Laura, and their 16-year-old twin daughters.
"I've got a campaign to run, an inauguration to give, a legislative session to end," he said. "And then we'll see."

HEADLINE: CLINTON AIDE SAYS CHINA TRIP DELAY WOULD BE MISTAKE

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
President Clinton's national security adviser said today that "it would be an enormous mistake" to postpone Mr. Clinton's trip to China next month simply because of the current political storm over the export of satellite technology.
Nonetheless, White House officials are already scrambling to find diplomatic offerings they can bring to Beijing without worsening the controversy, since many of the initiatives Mr. Clinton is considering would use access to American satellites and joint space research as a lure for China to take further steps in limiting weapons proliferation. 
 Appearing on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, dismissed calls by virtually all the Republican leaders in Congress for Mr. Clinton to cancel his trip. Among those leaders was Speaker Newt Gingrich, who said on the CNN program "Late Edition," "Until we know the truth about what was going on, it is very inappropriate for the President to go to China." Mr. Gingrich added that "it would be an embarrassment to both countries to have the meeting."
White House officials say there is virtually no chance Mr. Clinton will cancel plans for his meeting with Chinese leaders in late June, which Mr. Berger said comes at a critical moment in relations with Beijing. Noting India's recent tests of nuclear weapons and the turmoil caused by the Asian financial crisis, Mr. Berger said, "China is key to all of those."
At the same time, a continuing criminal investigation and the opening of several Congressional inquiries into the actions of two satellite makers are bound to affect the agenda of the trip, according to several officials and informal advisers to the Administration on China.
"It's obvious that a lot of what we had hoped to offer in return for Chinese commitments on proliferation -- especially in the space and technology area -- are going to have to be reviewed," one senior adviser to Mr. Clinton said. "That's just the political reality."
For example, a month ago Administration officials were discussing with the Chinese the possibility of a blanket waiver of sanctions imposed after the killing of demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989. The waiver would allow China to launch American-made satellites without case-by-case Presidential review. In return, the White House was looking for a commitment from China to join the Missile Technology Control Regime, the main international group that limits exports of missile technologies.
But in the current political climate, that proposal appears all but dead. Not only would it cause an uproar in Congress, according to Administration and other officials, but China has so far not indicated a willingness to join the missile regime, though it already adheres to some of its principles.
There are also questions about another major proposal: an agreement between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and its Chinese counterpart to conduct scientific observations from space.
Before the current controversy, Administration officials say, the Pentagon and the nation's intelligence agencies had insisted on restrictions to make sure that the space accord did not enable China to improve its spy satellite capability, or its ability to use global positioning satellites to allow more precise targeting of ballistic missiles. The cooperation agreement was focused mostly on observing agricultural changes and pollution.
"Even with that," one Administration official said this weekend, "people are going to look at this carefully because it has the words 'space' and 'satellite' in it."
It is unclear how, or even if, the satellite controversy will affect other offerings to the Chinese. Some are not technology-related: for example, the Administration has considered lifting an eight-year-old ban that has prevented two Government agencies, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Trade and Development Agency, from promoting deals between American companies and the Chinese Government.
The Overseas Private Investment Corporation provides political risk insurance to American companies for a fee. The Trade and Development Agency finances feasibility studies of overseas projects that could create jobs for American workers.
Last week, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed amendments to a military spending bill that would prohibit virtually all satellite exports to China. Among the House members who voted for the bill were a number who had urged Mr. Clinton to allow such exports in the past, rather than let the business go to rival European companies.
Mr. Berger suggested today that Congress had acted prematurely and emotionally. "I always thought we went from accusation to fact to conclusion to remedy," he said.
On the talk shows today and on Capitol Hill last week, participants in the debate often conflated three separate issues into a broad argument over whether the Clinton Administration has taken actions that could compromise national security.
The first of those issues concerns a waiver President Clinton signed earlier this year allowing Loral Space and Communications, a major military contractor, to export a satellite that is scheduled to be launched by the Chinese in November. The President's decision was complicated by the fact that Federal prosecutors have been investigating a 1996 incident in which Loral's engineers are accused of having breached security by advising the Chinese on how to build more reliable rockets.
That advice followed an investigation into the causes of the explosion of a Long March rocket, the mainstay of China's commercial rocket fleet and its nuclear arsenal. Classified memorandums, made public by the White House on Friday, show that there was intense debate within the Clinton Administration over whether to approve this year's launching.
The question is whether the White House was influenced by appeals from Loral to sign the waiver quickly, before contractual penalties of more than $4 million were imposed by the Chinese for a delay in delivering the satellite. Mr. Berger defended the decision to allow the export, saying that "no technology was being transferred by the license." He noted that the license could still be revoked if the investigation led to an indictment of the company or any of its employees.
The second issue concerns Mr. Clinton's pattern of issuing waivers that allow such launchings. The White House has noted that President George Bush did the same, signing nine waivers between December 1989 -- only six months after the Tiananmen Square killings -- and 1992. Mr. Clinton has signed 11 waivers since July 1993.
Documents shown to reporters on Friday made it clear that the waivers are given to the Chinese as a reward for an action that pleases Washington, or used as an incentive for future action. For example, the State Department recommended that Mr. Clinton approve the February waiver because it would "provide an incentive for China to observe M.T.C.R. missile proliferation guidelines."
But the waivers are also motivated by a desire to assure that American companies remain ahead of their European competitors in the race to get satellites aloft, serving telephone users and television viewers around the world.
Thus the Administration is open to charges that it has twisted its security judgments for the benefit of American companies, including those whose officers are known to have made large campaign contributions. The issue is complicated by the fact that some of the waivers clearly aided the China Aerospace Group, a conglomerate owned by the Chinese Government. An executive of China Aerospace, Liu Chaoying, is believed to have been the conduit for surreptitious donations to the Democratic Party in 1996. Ms. Liu has denied the accusation.
And almost lost in the Washington debate is what may be the most critical question: why President Clinton, in March 1996, overrode his Secretary of State, Warren M. Christopher, by ruling that satellites would no longer be classified as munitions. That eased the process of getting export waivers approved.
"I am convinced the national security was not compromised by any decision that we made," Mr. Berger said today.

HEADLINE: Democratic Party Loves Vallone, but He's Mostly Unknown Upstate

SERIES: EARLY STEPS: The Gubernatorial Campaign

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
For some of the Democrats running for Governor, this week's state party convention will be a struggle for delegate support, even a fight for survival. For Peter F. Vallone, the clear favorite of party leaders, it could be more like an anointment, at least among party loyalists. 
 Mr. Vallone, the Speaker of the New York City Council, heads into the convention Wednesday in Rye Brook as the only candidate assured of getting the 25 percent of the delegates' votes needed to win an automatic place on the September primary ballot. The talk among Mr. Vallone's supporters is about whether he will top 50 percent in the delegates' balloting.
 But some of the party's strategists wonder how well Mr. Vallone, little known to voters outside the city, will shift from what has been an insiders' game, courting party officials and raising money, to a broader campaign, courting Democratic voters from Niagara Falls to Montauk in his effort to be the candidate to challenge Gov. George E. Pataki.
"He's old-fashioned in good senses and bad senses," said Hank Morris, a Democratic political consultant who is not involved in the governor's race. "Goes to church, loyal to friends almost to a fault, almost small-town. The negative of that is, you run a campaign in New York State, it's more than retail politics."
Mr. Vallone and his aides say that their campaign so far has been focused largely on the convention, and that once it is over, they are ready to make the needed transition.
He has taken what most politicians consider the right steps toward a statewide campaign, including raising more money than any other Democrat in the race except Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, whose campaign fund is supplied almost entirely by her financier husband, Wilbur L. Ross Jr. Mr. Vallone has assembled an experienced team, with consultants like David Doak and Stanley S. Greenberg, veterans of President Clinton's campaigns.
For a candidate who fails to win 25 percent of the delegates' votes at the convention, the only route to the primary ballot is through a difficult and expensive process of gathering thousands of signatures on petitions. That means the convention may be a make-or-break event for some contenders. But by most accounts Mr. Vallone had 25 percent of the vote sewn up months ago.
Mr. Vallone, 63, has spent decades cultivating the intertwined roots of New York City's neighborhood organizers, lobbying groups and elected officials, groundwork that has enabled him to win the backing of much of the party hierarchy, and to raise more than $3 million for this race. He often attends three or four political events a day, greeting leading lights and minor figures alike with hugs and pats on the cheek.
"I'm a product of Queens," Mr. Vallone, who is from Astoria, said between events one recent evening. "And Queens is made up of a lot of little villages. It's like everyone's from a small town, where everybody knows everybody."
The same could be said of the political world he inhabits, but Mr. Vallone needs to introduce himself to several million voters outside the city who do not know him.
Promoting himself statewide may be a tall order even with enough money for an extensive advertising campaign. Mr. Vallone, by his own admission, is not a stellar speaker -- recently he earnestly declared at a meeting of of representatives from cultural groups, "There would be no New York City without the things that make New York City special" -- and he has never been elected to office outside his Queens Council district. In addition, he is closely identified with the city, a place viewed with mistrust by many upstaters.
In the primary, he is likely to face Ms. McCaughey Ross, the erstwhile Republican, who is better known and commands attention from the news media wherever she goes. And in the general election awaits Mr. Pataki, who is popular and has more money than his would-be Democratic challengers combined.
Still, many prominent Democrats say Mr. Vallone will prevail in the primary, and fare respectably against Mr. Pataki, even if he loses.
"I believe he will win the Democratic nomination because he's the most versed in what it will take to win, and he has a very good team," said Edward I. Koch, the former Mayor, who is supporting Mr. Pataki.
Mr. Vallone insists he has no concerns about taking his campaign to places like Utica and Binghamton. "If we just stick to our game plan, I think we'll be fine," he said.
When Ms. McCaughey Ross won the Liberal Party nomination, she agreed to the party's demand that she campaign through the November election even if she did not win the Democratic primary in September. That has many Democrats complaining of a disaster in the making, one that could split the anti-Pataki vote in November.
But Mr. Vallone says he sees the matter differently. "I think it helps us," he said. "It shows she's ready to betray the Democratic Party the way she betrayed the Republican Party. The voters will figure it out."
Mr. Vallone exudes the confidence of someone with a comfortable lead, though he trails Ms. McCaughey Ross in public opinion polls. He has passed up candidates' forums and televised debates that other contenders have attended.
He also has been less aggressive than the Lieutenant Governor and another candidate, James L. Larocca, about stumping for votes upstate, the region that knows him least and accounts for a sizable portion of any statewide vote.
The other Democrats in the race are Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney, and Richard A. Kahan, former chairman of the state's Urban Development Corporation.
Even if he gains the nomination, Mr. Vallone needs to convince voters that a change is needed. He argues that there are problems -- sluggish economic growth upstate, failing public schools, the ethics of Mr. Pataki's fund-raising -- that the Governor has ignored. "This Governor just doesn't get it," he told the Tilden Democratic Club. "He thinks there is nothing wrong. If you don't see the problems, you're not going to do anything about them."
He has also tried hard to make issues of Mr. Pataki's budget vetoes last month, and of the bid by the Governor and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to end remedial education and open admissions at the City University of New York.
But there is scant evidence, at this early stage, that such talk appeals to the public. The subject that gets Mr. Vallone the loudest reactions these days is the Yankees, with the Speaker having positioned himself as the premier advocate of keeping the team in the Bronx. But that issue is not likely to mean much to voters north of Westchester County.
Some of his advisers acknowledge privately that Mr. Vallone's unassuming manner, which has served him so well in courting the political class, may undercut his message. They say he does not get credit for being as smart or as driven as he is -- much the same complaint that Mr. Pataki's aides had four years ago. Indeed, Mr. Vallone's easy demeanor has led some political professionals to question his fire for this race, though he has been plotting his run for Governor for five years.
In many ways, he cuts an odd figure for a politician. He often does not dominate gatherings, even small ones, letting aides do much of the talking. When C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan Borough President, held a recent news conference to endorse Mr. Vallone, she spoke for six minutes, and he for less than one. He gives every speech like the emcee of an awards dinner, pointing out people in the audience.
He is a homebody who gets home nearly every night for dinner with his wife, Tena, in their home a block and a half from where he was born. He attends Mass every morning, and rarely swears, even in private conversation.
Thanks to the city's hierarchy and his own personality, in 12 years as chief of the Council, Mr. Vallone has tended to be overshadowed by mayors -- not just larger-than-life figures like Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mr. Koch, but even the more taciturn David N. Dinkins.
As a result, even many city residents are unaware of his legislative record, which includes joining Mr. Dinkins in expanding the police force by 7,000 officers, initiating campaign finance restrictions, and allowing a gay rights bill to go to the floor of the City Council, despite his personal opposition.
Surveying the contest ahead of him, Mr. Vallone said: "I know this is an uphill fight. But if it's about people's records, I can win."

HEADLINE: THE N.B.A. PLAYOFFS;
Utah Plods Right Back To the Finals

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

DATELINE: INGLEWOOD, Calif., May 24

 BODY:
The enduring image of the Western Conference finals will not arouse curiosity on Madison Avenue today: the balding power forward who uses a hair-growth product receiving a pass from a 36-year-old point guard with a surgically repaired knee. The play ending in a nondescript layup instead of a scintillating dunk, followed moments later by two free throws to seal the game.
Yet what Karl Malone, John Stockton and the Utah Jazz did today to the Los Angeles Lakers -- what they have done for the last eight days, really -- is far preferable to summer vacation. 
 That is where Shaquille O'Neal and his team are headed after the Jazz polished them off in four games to retain their conference title, the finale a 96-92 victory before a disbelieving crowd at the Great Western Forum.
For sentimentality's sake, Malone and Stockton earned a return trip to the finals in their 13th and 14th seasons, respectively.
For logic's sake, what happened to the highfalutin Lakers and those highlight-reel dunks?
"If I got a couple old race horses that are worn and old, and I've got a couple of thoroughbreds that are young and full of vinegar, I'd take the old horses that have won," said Malone, whose 32 points, 14 rebounds and 5 assists carried the Jazz. His 15-foot baseline jump shot with 1 minute 49 seconds remaining provided a 6-point margin and was as clutch as any shot in the series.
This was not a game -- or a series for that matter -- until midway through the fourth quarter when O'Neal and Eddie Jones began trying to siphon a smidgen of respect out of their young, immature team.
The Lakers trailed by 12 in the third quarter. Their last chance came after Kobe Bryant converted a 3-point play with 22 seconds left to cut the deficit to 92-90. But the Jazz played keep-away for the next 12 seconds, the Lakers scurrying around like the Washington Generals trying to find the dribbling Globetrotter Marques Haynes.
They finally settled on the wrong man to foul: Stockton. He made both free throws with 10.5 seconds left -- his fifth and sixth straight and Utah's 14th and 15th straight going back to the third quarter -- to give the Jazz the cushion they needed to advance.
"Guys just have to step up," said a frowning O'Neal, who finished with 38 points and was part of a team swept for the fourth time in his five post-seasons. "They have to find out what's most important to them. If they don't want to play, then they need to ask for a trade. If they don't want to play, then get off my team."
The Jazz was much more subdued than last season, when Stockton's last-second 3-pointer knocked Houston out of the conference finals. But there was a quiet dignity to their celebration that seemed to encapsulate their season, one featuring the injury to Stockton and many challenges from younger, more athletic teams in the Western Conference.
"We fought an uphill battle all year, and when the dust settled, we were the ones left standing on this side," Malone said. "We believe in each other, we hung in there, and we're going back to the big dance."
Waiting for either Chicago or Indiana to emerge from the East, Utah has a lot of time to primp and preen. The sweep could give the Jazz as much as nine days between games and will provide at least six days' rest. The finals will start no earlier than next Sunday.
"We took care of business," Malone said, "but our job is not done yet."
It was Jazz economy versus Laker excess from long range.
Utah took 30 3-pointers in the series and made 16. Howard Eisley made 3 of 4 in the first half today. The Lakers were an abominable 19 of 74 from beyond the arc in four games, including 6 of 16 today.
The Jazz outscored the Lakers in transition, 48-31, beating them at their own game.
Of course, when your opponent shoots close to 50 percent -- as Utah did -- and you have to keep removing the ball from the net, it is hard to run the floor.
And O'Neal brought his old liability to bear.
With 27.6 seconds left, he missed two free throws that could have cut the Jazz lead to 1. He made 10 of 18 on the afternoon and 25 of 55 in four games.
Yet beyond the numbers, the West was won with attitude.
You never got the feeling the Lakers truly wanted this series. They stood around between games, mulling their options but never sounding assertive about their chances. On Saturday, Nick Van Exel seemed resigned to losing, saying: "Being swept or losing 4-3, there's not much of a difference. You just lose vacation time."
Antoine Carr, the veteran forward of the Jazz, had some advice for the team Utah conquered.
"All that bouncing around they do before the games, that uses energy," he said. "They need to save it for when they get on the floor next time. We don't play any high-flying, great-looking type of basketball; ours is more nose-to-the-grindstone ball. It still works, though."

HEADLINE: High-Tech Hypocrisy About Government

BYLINE: By Mitchell Kapor; Mitchell Kapor, the founder of Lotus Development Corporation, is an investor in high-tech start-ups.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
In the mid-1980's, during my tenure at Lotus, I was, I believe, the first person to publicly compare Microsoft to Standard Oil. Both companies sought and used monopoly control over a new industry critical to the nation's economy. And both were headed by men -- John D. Rockefeller Sr. and Bill Gates -- who would stop at virtually nothing to gain what they sought. Back then no one took the comparison seriously -- except Bill Gates himself, who made it clear to me how irate he was about it.
Like Mr. Gates, I believe in and have profited from the free market. But I'm also a technorealist, which means that unlike many of my colleagues in the high-tech industry, I don't automatically see Government as the enemy of technological progress. Such views are all too fashionable in Silicon Valley, where the prospect of Government intervention causes a bad case of heartburn. 
 What my colleagues need to see is that the market cannot work unless our society sets rules of play and enforces them. Microsoft has benefited from the stability and opportunities provided by those rules, but it has been flouting them as well. The antitrust suits filed last week against Microsoft are therefore regrettable but necessary.
Despite all of Mr. Gates's talk about the right to innovate, his company uses its power to limit consumer choice and impede a free marketplace. Only the Government has the ability to take on Microsoft, and the Justice Department's antitrust chief, Joel Klein, has done his homework. He's a pragmatist, not a crusader.
Mr. Klein understands that the real threat to entrepreneurial innovation is Microsoft's anticompetitive arrogance. Great discoveries in computing often come from small start-up companies. Yet with Microsoft's dominance, vast areas of the product market -- including but hardly limited to basic applications like word processors and spreadsheets -- are barren zones where venture capitalists and entrepreneurs fear to tread because Microsoft has staked a claim or is seen as likely to do so. It is a sad but telling fact that in the high-tech field, virtually no business plan will be financed today without a convincing answer to the question of what is to be done about competition from Microsoft.
The Government also recognizes that Microsoft's dominance will only intensify as the Internet becomes an integral part of mainstream culture. The browser war is just the beginning. Microsoft claims droit du seigneur in any area of computing that becomes strategically important -- voice recognition, home appliances, auto navigation and so on.
It's unfortunate that Microsoft is so aggressively self-interested that an external check is necessary. I would prefer to live in and help create a society in which self-regulation makes antitrust suits unnecessary. But until such a business ethos prevails, we must rely on other means.
Ultimately, the extent of the Government-mandated reform may depend on Microsoft's willingness to begin acting like a more socially responsible industry leader. To the extent that the company remains recalcitrant, it's likely that radical solutions will gain favor.
The most drastic action, of course, would be to break Microsoft up into a series of Baby Bills, separating operating systems from applications and from content and services. Today that seems like overkill, but in the coming years, short of a sincere change of heart by Mr. Gates, it may well become the preferred solution.

HEADLINE: Dollar Hits Highest Level Against Yen In 7 Years

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 25

 BODY:
The dollar rose above 137 yen today for the first time in almost seven years as expectations mounted that neither the United States nor Japan would be willing to stem the yen's decline. The dollar also gained against the mark.
"Japan would probably not be well advised to try and turn the tide while market sentiment is for a weaker yen," said Dieter Hluchy, a trader at Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein. 
 Koji Tanami, the Vice Finance Minister of Japan, suggested that the Bank of Japan may step into the currency market to take action to stem weakness in the yen.
U.S. News & World Report has reported that Robert E. Rubin, the Secretary of the United States Treasury, is willing to let the yen drop to 140 to 150 to the dollar.
When asked about the U.S. News report, Mr. Rubin said the United States shares Japanese concerns about a weak yen, but added that the strong-dollar policy remains "absolutely unchanged."
The dollar was at 137.05 yen after having climbed as high as 137.20 yen. The dollar bought 1.7657 marks, up from 1.7595 marks at the London close Friday. The mark bought 77.640 Japanese yen, up from 77.200 yen at its London close.
The Japanese central bank sometimes sells dollars when the United States currency is declining. That was the case on Dec. 17, when the bank sold about $2 billion just after it unexpectedly called for an income tax cut. The bank also sold as much as $18 billion April 9 and 10, during the Easter and Passover holidays.
Underpinning the dollar's gains against the mark were price reports in Germany showing that inflation was in check. That news bolstered expectations that the Bundesbank would leave interest rates unchanged when its policy council gathers for its meeting on Thursday.
"With inflationary pressures being so low in Germany it's very unlikely the Bundesbank will move already now," said Bastian Hepperle, an analyst at Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale.
A German rate rise would make mark-denominated assets more attractive to investors, aiding the mark against the dollar. While inflation is tame in Germany, analysts still expect the Bundesbank to raise interest rates by the end of the year to close the gap in short-term borrowing costs among countries joining Europe's single currency.
Long-term interest rates in most of Europe have fallen closer to the low German levels. Still, a large gap in money-market rates remains, with Italian three-month rates more than 2 percentage points higher than German three-month rates. The 11 national central banks must bring the rates in line by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Jobs Out of Reach for Detroiters Without Wheels

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
At about 3 on weekday afternoons, Dorothy L. Johnson heads to her job in the suburbs cleaning office buildings. Two buses and two hours later, she reports to work. At 11 P.M., her shift ends and she begins the trip back home. A little before midnight, she steps off a suburban bus just inside the Detroit border, and waits for the city bus that will get her home by 12:30.
Getting to and from work in the suburbs is a job in itself, but the suburbs offer the best opportunity for Ms. Johnson, 50. "There aren't too many jobs here in Detroit," she said. And those closer to home have another drawback, she said: "The city sort of pays less." 
 The routine would be far easier if she could afford a car: the drive would take only 25 minutes. But here in the Motor City, cars are out of reach for Ms. Johnson and thousands of other poor people. Only 1 in 4 residents owns one. On weekend nights in some of the poorest sections, young men pedal around on bicycles instead of cruising the streets in cars.
But it is in work, not play, where the lack of a set of wheels really haunts Detroiters. Jobs are more plentiful in suburban areas nationwide, and Detroit is no exception. The unemployment rate in this city of one million is 7.2 percent, a vast improvement from the 17 percent during the 1992 recession, but more than double the unemployment rates in suburbs. The city, however, has no subway or commuter rail lines in its 140 square miles, and it ranks last in public transportation funding among the 20 largest metropolitan areas nationwide. Even the officials running the city and suburban bus systems acknowledge that public transportation here is inadequate.
So while suburbanites have no trouble driving to jobs downtown, city dwellers without cars find the reverse commuting difficult. The result is that suburban businesses have increased their wages and still cannot find enough workers -- fast-food restaurants struggle to fill openings at $7 an hour, well above the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour -- while the city's poor struggle to get to the jobs that would lift them from the welfare or unemployment rolls.
"Low-income families and welfare recipients need to have ready access to jobs and opportunities wherever they exist," said Bruce Katz, director of the Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy at the Brookings Institution.
The mismatch is maddening, Mr. Katz said, because it "not only undermines the ability of people to get to work in the morning in a timely way but undermines the ability of corporations to hire workers."
The conundrum of having pools of would-be workers far from pools of jobs creates inefficiencies in the job market.
"This is an absolute historic opportunity because what you have here is the corporate sector at the table and the corporate sector experiencing worker shortages," Mr. Katz said.
Many Detroiters have given up trying for suburban jobs. Alice A. Newell, a 32-year-old college graduate who lives in a neighborhood called The Hole, quit work in a suburb a half-hour's drive and a world away from her, where she was helping a retired Ford Motor Company executive keep track of his investments. The two-hour bus trips lengthened her work day so much that she could not find affordable and reliable child care.
"I just said forget it, I won't go to the suburbs, I'll just work in the city," Ms. Newell said.
But the city bus also brings problems for workers like Ms. Newell, who prays before she heads to the neighborhood bus stop.
"Right across the street there's people out selling crack or selling pot, and they all carry guns," said Ms. Newell, who said she fears going out in the dark mornings with her 4-year-old daughter.
In addition, the buses are often late, a particular problem in Detroit's cold winters.
Riders are not the only ones complaining. State legislators and suburban governments, Detroit's Mayor and even the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation have voiced concerns about the city's public transportation system, which is as renowned for its poor service as for its political infighting.
Two bus systems serve metropolitan Detroit: the city's Department of Transportation oversees routes inside the city, while a suburban government coalition manages suburb-to-suburb routes and the city-to-suburb lines.
"What we have is a system that is woefully lacking in funding," said Albert A. Martin, director of the Detroit Department of Transportation.
Mr. Martin's counterpart in the suburban bus system agrees.
"For a number of historical reasons, the metro Detroit area doesn't have a very thorough transportation system," said Richard C. Kaufman, general manager of the Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation. "For many years the car companies thought that public transportation was a competitor," a view that has since changed, he said.
Mr. Martin, like Mayor Dennis W. Archer, advocates merging the bus systems, saying the current setup "is wasteful of tax dollars." But Mr. Kaufman counters that a merger is impractical because the suburbs, with a population of almost three million, now contribute a third as much to the bus systems as Detroit does, and suburbanites are unlikely to support increases in financing. In addition, he said, the unions representing city and suburban transportation workers would fight any job cuts that might result from streamlining.
Racial tensions are not far below the surface. For years, suburban bus routes were designed to avoid matching up too closely with city routes near the Detroit line, making it difficult for city residents, 76 percent of whom are African-Americans, to reach the mostly white suburbs. Even now that service has improved, it is still so inadequate that some transportation experts wonder whether civil rights laws are being violated.
Detroit's separate bus systems are "a clear case of presenting barriers to people accessing jobs and opportunity," said Mr. Katz, of Brookings. Because both systems receive Federal funding, the Government should investigate to be sure the rights of minorities and the poor are being upheld, he said.
Leaders of both systems rejected the notion that the inadequate bus service constituted a violation of civil rights.
"You can get to the suburbs," Mr. Martin said. "You may not be able to get out there as frequently as you like."
