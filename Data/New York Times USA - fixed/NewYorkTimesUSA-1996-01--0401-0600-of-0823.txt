HEADLINE: Paul Borsky, 75; Studied Effects Of Sonic Booms

BYLINE: By SARAH JAY 

 BODY:
Paul Borsky, who studied the effects of aircraft noise on people just when the term sonic boom was entering the common vocabulary, died last Tuesday at his home in Plainview, L.I. He was 75.
The cause was cancer, his daughter Phyllis Borsky said. 
 At a time when jet planes were making the world an ever smaller and noisier place, Mr. Borsky measured the psychological consequences on communities and people.
As a result, Mr. Borsky, a professor at Columbia University's School of Public Health, was called by government agencies as an expert witness. His professional publications included a study of human reactions to sonic booms, a work on fear as a factor of community annoyance at airplane noise and reports of sleep disturbances near air traffic.
Mr. Borsky, who was born on Nov. 15, 1920, in Paterson, N.J., was valedictorian of his class at Lincoln High School in Brooklyn. He graduated from Brooklyn College in 1942 and completed his graduate courses in economics in 1946 at American University.
His interest in airplane noise began a decade later, while he was a senior study director for the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.
To find his research subjects, Mr. Borsky sometimes looked no farther than his own children. In the early 1970's, he asked his son Arthur, then a senior at Adelphi University, to gather some college friends to be in a control group. But Arthur rode to his father's office in a car with a faulty muffler, leaving him with a short-term hearing loss that kept him from participating in the study.
Besides his son, Arthur, of Princeton, Mass., and his daughter Phyllis, of Westbury, L.I., Mr. Borsky is survived by his wife, Rosalyn; another daughter, Susan Cohen of Columbia, Md.; a sister, Ruth Gold of Mexico, and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Fortune Attacks Rival Forbes And Its Editor

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
In an unusual direct attack on a competitor, Fortune charged in a cover story today that some large advertisers in Forbes magazine had been "exempt from tough editorial criticism."
The article said General Motors, Ford Motor, Rockwell International, General Electric and the insurer American International Group were among the advertisers enjoying favorable treatment. 
 Beyond challenging the integrity of Forbes, Fortune questioned whether the magazine's editor in chief, Steve Forbes, is qualified for public office. Mr. Forbes is seeking the Republican Presidential nomination and ranks second in many polls. It also questioned his motivation, with a cover headline that asked: "Does he really want to be President? Or is he just trying to sell magazines?"
Mr. Forbes promptly denounced the Fortune article as untrue.
"I am astonished that a direct competitor would stoop so low," Mr. Forbes said in a telephone interview from Anchorage, where he was campaigning yesterday. "Competitively, we've cleaned Fortune's clock for 10 years. We have consistently beaten them in editorial quality, in circulation and in advertising, and they are just sore."
Fortune said one editor at Forbes, who was not identified, had provided the names of the companies that it said received favorable treatment.
Fortune said seven current or former Forbes editors had told of how "during Steve Forbes's stewardship they have seen stories changed if the writer has turned in a negative assessment of an advertiser," adding: "In other words, the magazine's editors are turning downbeat stories into upbeat stories in order to keep advertisers happy -- even at the risk of misleading their own readers."
Fortune said the former employees of Forbes magazine who now work at Fortune did not provide information for the article.
Fortune, which is owned by Time Warner Inc., said it had drafts of two articles by Willy Stern, now a writer at Business Week, which supported its claim. Fortune also cited two stories in Forbes -- a March 1993 piece on the Georgia-Pacific Corporation and an April 1994 story on the AT&T Corporation -- in which "a negative assessment became a positive one" after the stories were sent to Mr. Forbes and his publisher. Fortune said the two men read all Forbes articles before publication.
Mr. Forbes confirmed that was so, although he noted that he was now on leave to campaign. He also acknowledged that he directly solicits advertisers "as did my father and my grandfather" when they ran the magazine.
In its article, Fortune said that it and Business Week, which is published by McGraw-Hill Inc., did not allow advertising or other noneditorial executives to review articles before publication. The Fortune article, written by Jeanie Russell Kasindorf, asserted, "Forbes is alone among major business publications in tolerating such a cozy relationship between its editorial and advertising operations."
Forbes magazine is owned by Forbes Inc.
Fortune's managing editor, John Huey, said his magazine was simply practicing good journalism in exploring the fitness of a prominent candidate for President.
"Our article is kind and gentle and nice and polite," Mr. Huey said from his home in Georgia. "We are not saying he is unelectable or unfit for public office, but we are saying here is a barrel full of stuff that in the typical political process he is going to have to deal with -- and with a press that has a lot sharper teeth than we do."
Forbes magazine publishes an annual list of what it estimates are the 400 richest Americans, a list that does not include Mr. Forbes, Fortune noted. Fortune estimated that Mr. Forbes is worth $438.9 million, and that most of his wealth was from the 35 percent stake that he inherited in Forbes Inc., and his 51 percent of Forbes voting stock.
That figure would place Mr. Forbes among the 300 richest Americans on the Forbes list.
Mr. Forbes declined to comment on his wealth or his income and said that he would not release his income tax returns even if he wins his party's nomination. He also said he found nothing objectionable in Fortune's efforts to determine his wealth.
Fortune's 12-page article also examined what it called Mr. Forbes's "aggressive tax-avoidance" strategy at a time when he is campaigning against tax breaks. Fortune said Mr. Forbes, by using a New Jersey law intended to preserve farmland, pays $2,251 in annual property taxes on land worth nearly $9 million.
"The law is intended to preserve open space," Mr. Forbes said. "I pay the taxes that are required."
The article also scrutinized the practices of a Forbes family land-sales company that Fortune charged "has left hundreds of buyers feeling ripped off."
Mr. Forbes responded that his family's real estate company engaged in ethical conduct and let buyers recoup their money for up to a year after their purchase, "no questions asked."
Fortune said that in his campaign for the Republican nomination, Mr. Forbes had benefited from "soft" and "gauzy" coverage including "a celebrity kiss from Vanity Fair; uncritical sketches in The New York Times and The Washington Post; affectionate columns on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, whose supply-side economic fanaticism marks the true north of his ideology."
Officials of the other Republican candidates' campaigns have been complaining to the press for several days about what they felt was gentle coverage of Mr. Forbes. These officials said the press had not probed deeply into his conduct and interests.
Two prominent educators who study press ethics said yesterday that they had not seen the Fortune article but were delighted to see one major magazine investigate another.
"One of the problems with the media in this country is that they don't watch each other enough," said David M. Rubin, dean of the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.
Stephen D. Isaacs, who teaches journalism ethics at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, said, "It is great when one media organization takes on another because the media tends to be too much of a club."
Professor Isaacs said he regularly read Forbes closely and had "not seen any pulling of punches." He added, "But I am suspicious, as we all should be, of the press, and it is important to keep in mind that most people believe that the press takes money for articles."

HEADLINE: THE NEXT WONDER: A special report.;
Cracks Show Early in China's Big Dam Project

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: SANDOUPING, China

 BODY:
From horizon to horizon, the ancient landscape here has been sundered, scored and stripped by the big steel blades of countless front-end loaders. Dust storms rise from monster truck caravans hauling a million boulders across a riven plain to the place where the Three Gorges Dam is to emerge, eventually, to mount and tame the timeless and often devastating flood of the Yangtze River.
Mountains are disappearing and a new concrete topography is rising in their place, connected in a manmade design whose foundations are being laid across a dust bowl so broad that it seems almost planetary in scale. 
 As soon as the river's torrent is blocked and diverted by a spectacular berm of crushed rock, legions of engineers and workers are to begin installing the largest array of hydroelectric turbines and generators ever bolted to the earth.
Thus this dream of China's Soviet-trained engineering corps, this symbol of Chinese Communism's triumph -- some say arrogance -- over nature and economic backwardness, and the bane of environmentalists is relentlessly becoming a reality.
But a year after construction began on this vast project in central China, serious problems are arising that underscore the politically precarious future of the world's largest dam.
Interviews with municipal officials and engineers along the 400-mile stretch of river that will swell to inundate a treasure of Chinese relics and vistas say chronic money shortages are plaguing the resettlement of the 1.13 million people who will be displaced by the dam project. This is causing serious disaffection among a population whose economic security is crucial to the success of the effort and to the political stability of the region.
In addition, environmental engineers in Chongqing, a city of 15 million that will sit at the head of the serpentine Three Gorges Lake that is to be created by the dam, say national and local leaders have no money to treat the 265 billion gallons a year of raw sewage and industrial waste that they say will flow into the impounded waters.
These engineers, who have prepared for decades to create a reservoir deep enough to bring ocean traffic 1,500 miles inland to Chongqing, accuse national authorities of shortsightedness and of misleading the public about the potential threat of the untreated industrial and municipal sewage that will flow from dozens of cities and towns along the reservoir.
They say an environmental impact statement recently given to the United States Embassy in Beijing glosses over fundamental concerns about pollution. Further study is needed, they argue, including the use of models to show how the huge sewage flows will affect vital fresh water supplies and the environment, which will be critical to the survival of the tourist industry.
"I am just telling the truth," said Guo Chengmo, a senior engineer and technical adviser in Chongqing's Environmental Bureau. "There are a lot of problems that have to be solved, and I don't think the leaders are thinking that far ahead. This is my personal opinion."
 
The Marvel
Feat of Engineering And Political Clout
The Three Gorges project managers acknowledge that there are no immediate solutions to a host of problems, most dealing with money, environmental threats and the impact of huge volumes of sediment that could settle in the upper lake and choke Chongqing's aspirations to become a major port upstream from Shanghai.
But they are unwavering in their commitment to the project, which they say will protect millions of Chinese from disastrous floods, boost China's electrical output by 10 percent with "clean" hydropower (as opposed to coal) and further open markets in China's interior, where nearly 400 million people live in the Yangtze watershed.
"As water resources engineers, we are proud to be involved in this project," said Yang Guowei, a leading scientist at the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission, the state organization of 7,000 professionals who have planned and designed every aspect of the Three Gorges Dam.
Mr. Yang exudes the confidence of a Communist Party stalwart who not only believes in his ability to complete his mission, but also understands that Prime Minister Li Peng has muscled the Three Gorges project through the party leadership to make it China's highest-priority construction project. The project has a work force of 40,000 and an estimated cost of anywhere between $17.3 billion (the official figure) and $30 billion.
If completed, the dam will be an engineering marvel, conveying ocean-going vessels onto the lake through huge locks. At 610 feet high, its profile would be lower than the 726-foot Hoover Dam in the United States. But it will span 6,864 feet, dwarfing the Hoover's 1,244-foot breadth. With 26 sets of 700-megawatt turbines and generators, Three Gorges will have the capacity to generate 18,200 megawatts of electricity, which is 15 times as much as a standard 1,200-megawatt nuclear power station and almost twice as powerful as the Grand Coulee Dam.
Over the next 24 months, the project may well pass the point of no return, Mr. Yang asserted. "From a technical point of view, if we block the channel," as is planned for the fourth quarter of 1997, "it would be so difficult to stop construction," he said.
But critics say that any change in the political climate in Beijing would reopen the debate on the merits and science of the dam.
"For those of use who have spoken out and held different views, our actions have been labeled as counterrevolutionary," said Dai Qing, an influential Chinese journalist who was expelled from the Communist Party and imprisoned in 1989 in part because she sought to organize Chinese scientists opposed to the dam project. "If there aren't any problems, why are they afraid of an open debate on the project?"
A lack of openness and debate appears to be one of the reasons for the more vocal challenges from Chongqing's frustrated environmental bureau. Mr. Guo, for instance, was highly critical of the Government's environmental impact statement.
"Personally and bluntly speaking, that report was very roughly done and lacks in-depth analysis," he said. "That is my opinion as an engineer."
 
The Money
Shallow Pockets Add to Problems
Mr. Guo's concerns and those of his colleagues in Chongqing echo the reservations expressed by the Clinton Administration last fall and by international lending institutions like the World Bank, which have declined to provide assistance to the project.
In September Samuel R. Berger, the deputy national security adviser to President Clinton, told the United States Export-Import Bank, a Government-financed lending agency, that it should avoid supporting the project. Mr. Berger argued that it would be "unwise for the U.S. Government to align itself with a project that raises environmental and human rights concerns on the scale of Three Gorges."
But the bank, which has the authority to grant export loans to American companies, has asserted its right to decide the matter independently. It is considering loan requests from American companies like Caterpillar Inc., the heavy equipment maker, and Rotec Industries, a construction firm, to support their bids on dam contracts.
[Rita Trevino Flynn, a spokeswoman for the bank, said on Friday that the bank's "engineers and financial analysts are continuing the process of conducting an independent financial, technical and environmental review of issues surrounding this project." A date for a decision on those loans has not been set.]
Lack of money for a host of critical projects now seems to be the principal weakness of the overall Three Gorges plan, a number of experts say.
As Mr. Guo pointed out, "Waste-water processing facilities are not even on the agenda of the city government, and I don't think that even for the next 10 years these facilities are going to be on the priority list."
There is also no money to remove the 1,000-year-old landfills of solid wastes, garbage and toxic materials like mercury and arsenic in vast dumping grounds on river banks that will be flooded.
Referring to Chongqing, Mr. Guo said: "This city right now is facing urgent problems. We have electricity outages, traffic jams. We need bridges and roads and telecommunications and housing projects. They all need funds."
Mr. Guo pointed out that even if Chongqing raised the $500 million needed to build new sewers and 24 waste-water treatment plants, "the operational costs are going to be huge," amounting to tens of millions of dollars a day. "Even if we completed them, we don't have the money to operate them," he said.
"The Government doesn't have a single penny to control waste-water discharge from these cities," said Ms. Dai, "and there are several hundred pollution sources along the river from Chongqiing to Sandouping."
 
The Masses
Human Shell Game Earns Disaffection
Long before any foul tide of Three Gorges pollution confronts Chinese officials, the problems of relocating such a large population have already emerged.
In Wanxian, where a third of the city's 300,000 people must move to higher ground, thousands of residents who are part of the first phase of relocation have been living in tents. The local government's promise to provide jobs for farmers pushed off their ancestral lands has foundered on a shortage of money to start construction on the chemical plant that was to employ 20,000 of them.
Meanwhile, thousands of farmers whose homes were bulldozed to clear the way for the chemical complex are living on subsidies of $7.22 per month.
"If you get a chance to speak to the high officials, you ought to tell them that the resettlement program is not working very good," said Cheng Changhe, 28, who works for the Three Gorges Resettlement Construction Corporation in Wanxian. "When they demolished our houses, they said we would move to a new place in the same year, but then for three years there were no houses, and a lot of people had to live in tents. And they still haven't solved the problem of offering jobs.
"Wanxian is only a small city. If we can't solve a small number of resettlement problems here, just think about the overall project."
Past relocation programs involving more than 10 million Chinese have set off riots over compensation questions, and Prime Minister Li has warned provincial and local leaders that the success of the entire project rides on managing the relocation program.
Mr. Cheng's neighbors in Apartment Block No. 38 have not been able to find work to supplement their $14.44 monthly subsistence payment. "Right now we make and sell dumplings to make money," said 27-year-old Liu Jianmin. "When I was young, I looked forward to the Three Gorges, but with no job and so little money -- it's really not enough."
The Three Gorges project spans such a long time that more than 300,000 Chinese who have not even been born yet are among those counted to be relocated. The dam is to be completed in 2009, but anticipated problems with resettling the residents of 13 large cities, 140 towns and 326 villages have deferred the filling of the reservoir to its full capacity by another decade, to 2019.
Downstream, just above the dam site, Maoping, a town of several thousand residents, begun full-scale relocation in 1994. In August of that year, Cui Bangfen led a demonstration of 300 residents who sought to block the motorcade of leaders who came to inspect how the relocation program was going.
The 61-year-old Mrs. Cui is angry over the small amount of compensation she got for her land, her orange grove and her house, about $1,100 in all. And she is angry that her new house is too small and so poorly constructed that cracks already have appeared in the foundation and load-bearing walls.
"Some people in the neighborhood say my house is so small it looks like a toilet," she said.
So when the leaders came to her village, "We stood hand in hand and blocked the cars until the police came to push us away," she said, "but we would not move and the police said, 'If you don't get away, we are going to shoot.' "
"I'm old," she continued, "so I am not afraid, and I told them, 'If you shoot me then for sure I will not have to move.' "
In the end, she and her neighbors got no satisfaction. Mrs. Cui was fined $24, the equivalent of three months' subsidy. "It's not fair," she sobbed, "I am alone. My husband is dead. And I am the only one who got fined."
All along the river there are similar stories of disaffection. Many residents say they support the national policy to build the Three Gorges Dam, but they intensely mistrust their local leaders.
"I think the central Government should do an investigation to see whether the money has been spent wisely," said Xu Shikai, 37, whose family was relocated to Yichang.
Others, like 52-year-old Wang Zuozhu, suspect corruption. "In our village," she said, "the village committee leaders used part of the relocation money to buy a big transport boat, but only a few people are benefiting from the profits of that business.
"Since we moved to the city, no one can find those village leaders or the money the village was paid for enterprises and common property. We don't know where they are."

G.O.P. Abandons Tactic In Budget Dispute
 The chairman of the House Budget Committee said Republicans would restore the Government's authority to borrow money, thereby abandoning what is potentially their strongest weapon in a drive to force a budget agreement with the Clinton Administration on Republican terms. "We're going to raise the debt ceiling, in my opinion," said Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio. "My sense is you don't want to mess around with defaulting here in the United States." 
 Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Friday that Congressional leaders would "find a way to take care of" the debt-limitation problem. The Republicans seem to have decided that with the debt-ceiling issue still unresolved, the risks of failure to reach a budget agreement with the Clinton Administration would be too great. The talks are expected to resume Wednesday, and Mr. Kasich said the two sides were still "universes apart." [Page A14.]

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Rangers (and Fans, Too) Get Even With Keenan

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

 BODY:
Playoff memories blended with playoff intensity last night at Madison Square Garden when Coach Mike Keenan returned. His current team, the St. Louis Blues, met his previous team, the Rangers, in a gritty, thrilling game filled with nasty collisions and many loud sounds from the crowd. Both teams earned a grueling point in a 3-3 tie.
Pat Verbeek, who wasn't a Ranger when Keenan coached the team to the Stanley Cup in 1994, scored twice, bringing the Rangers back from a 3-1 deficit. He took over the team goal lead at 32, one ahead of Mark Messier. And Coach Colin Campbell gave Verbeek credit for exhorting his teammates on the bench when they fell behind by two goals. 
 "Pat got a little verbal," Campbell said. "And he did something about it. He showed a little leadership."
Verbeek said afterward that he couldn't remember what he had said. He added that it isn't fair to expect Messier, the captain, to make all the speeches and score all the important goals.
"We had to get desperate, we had to stir it up a little bit," Verbeek said. "You get a feel of when things are starting to slip. It was a great hockey game. It was very intense and hard-hitting, the kind of game you love to play, an uplifting experience."
Part of the reason was the subplot involving Keenan, who left the Rangers in a contract dispute shortly after the cup was clinched on June 14, 1994. This was his first trip back.
When Keenan took his place behind the Blues' bench, he was greeted by many deep boos and a few hands clapping in applause. He seemed to be struggling to keep a smile off his face. Several security guards stood behind the bench, often looking into the crowd. They remained in the vicinity throughout the game.
A few fans brought signs to comment on Keenan's departure. One of the signs said, "Keenan, You Traitor!" Another said, "You Lied to Every One of Us!" A third said, simply, "Rat."
During play, fans chanted crude insults, which grew in intensity as the pace and passion of the game increased.
"It's to be expected, I guess," Keenan said. "It really wasn't that bad. I can understand fans' reaction, but it doesn't mean I have to enjoy it, accept it or embrace it."
Neil Smith, the Rangers' president and general manager who feuded with Keenan, said: "You're only remembered for your very last act. I guess that's what the fans were thinking about."
He said the fans were emotional but not harsh and "almost playful." He said they weren't as harsh as they were in the playoffs of 1990. Smith was right. In that series, against the Islanders, Ranger fans attacked the ambulance of Pat LaFontaine after the Islander star suffered a concussion.
Messier, when asked about the fans at the Garden, smiled and said: "No place like it. I don't think anybody got cheated. A fun game to play in and be a part of."
Stephane Matteau, one of the Ranger heroes of the Stanley Cup season, scored once for his new team, St. Louis, and assisted on the other two goals, by Craig Johnson and Dale Hawerchuk. But he shot wide of the Ranger net in the final minute of overtime when he had a chance to score from the slot on a power play. All the St. Louis goals were on the power play.
Ulf Samuelsson, the Ranger defenseman, appeared to sustain a hip pointer but should return when the Rangers next play, after seven days off for the All-Star break, Campbell said. Leaving early for St. Louis was Shayne Corson, the Blues' captain, with a groin injury.
Grant Fuhr, the St. Louis goalie, stopped 41 of 44 shots, including a dangerous one in the final minute of regulation by Ranger defenseman Brian Leetch, who rushed to the slot and fired.
"I knew he had a good glove," Leetch said. "I tried to go against it. I guess he guessed glove, but it hit the leg that he left there."
Ranger goalie Glenn Healy stopped 34 of 37 shots and made a key save off Geoff Courtnall with a little more than a minute left in overtime, blocking a screened shot that was deflected en route, possibly by a Ranger.
The result extended the Rangers' home undefeated streak to 20 games, 4 short of the team record of 24 set in 1970-71. Over all, the Rangers' current undefeated streak, home and road combined, is five games (3-0-2). The Blues were playing their fourth game in six nights, all on the road. It was their third consecutive tie.
Before the game, Keenan said he experienced "the whole gamut of emotions" and some nervousness as he entered the Garden.
"It's not a normal night at the office," he said. "I was hoping I wouldn't make a wrong turn and I did. I wasn't quite sure where the visitors' locker room was."
Keenan also continued to talk about the possible acquisition of Wayne Gretzky from the Los Angeles Kings. Gretzky and his agent, Mike Barnett, have been openly discussing Gretzky's options.
"We're very interested," Keenan said when asked if he would try to get Gretzky if he becomes available. "Wayne fits into the economics of the industry and particularly our situation as an entity unto himself."
Gretzky's agent is expected to meet with the Kings' owners tomorrow. He has some leverage. If they don't accommodate his wishes to acquire new players and they don't trade him, Gretzky can leave the Kings without compensation in the summer.
"This won't take long," Gretzky said of the impending conversations. "We'll know on Tuesday."
Matteau, traded by the Rangers to St. Louis on Dec. 28, was involved in all aspects of the game. He scored the first goal and assisted on the next two as the Blues held a 3-2 lead after two periods.
The first, on the power play, tied the score at 1-1 at 15 minutes 3 seconds of the first period. He skated to the slot in front of Healy and put the puck past him after a pass from Brett Hull.
Hull had lost his helmet on the play, and, as he carried the puck down the right side of the ice, with his long blond hair flying behind him, fans of a certain age couldn't help but recall his father, Bobby Hull, who made similar plays for the Chicago Blackhawks in the 1960's and early 70's.
Hull fanned on the first shot attempt, but then put a spin move on Leetch before sending the puck across to Matteau. It was Matteau's fourth goal in his last three games.
Niklas Sundstrom scored the first Ranger goal, giving them a 1-0 lead at 7:00 of the first period with a backhanded shot from the slot past Fuhr, after he and Sergei Nemchinov had outworked the Blues in the left-wing corner for possession of the puck. It was his first goal since Oct. 31.
Verbeek scored his first with the teams playing four skaters each by knocking in a rebound from close range at 15:37 of the second period. He tied the score at 3-3 at 6:31 of the third period, also from close range, this one off the rush, after taking a pass from Ray Ferraro.

HEADLINE: Prisons Are a Bargain, by Any Measure

BYLINE: By John J. DiIulio Jr.; John J. DiIulio Jr. is professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton University.

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
All 30 Republican governors elected or re-elected in 1994 promised to get tough on crime. Most, like George Pataki of New York, are keeping their word. But several, like Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, who has said he would build no more prisons, are quietly promoting plans to put more convicted criminals back on the streets.
Most experts applaud Governor Thompson's new-found "wisdom" and lament Governor Pataki's "hard-line" approach. As these experts love to repeat, "incarceration is not the answer." 
 If incarceration is not the answer, what, precisely, is the question? If the question is how to prevent at-risk youths from becoming stone-cold predators in the first place, then, of course, incarceration is no solution.
But if the question is how to restrain known convicted criminals from murdering, raping, robbing, assaulting and stealing, then incarceration is a solution, and a highly cost-effective one.
On average, it costs about $25,000 a year to keep a convicted criminal in prison. For that money, society gets four benefits: Imprisonment punishes offenders and expresses society's moral disapproval. It teaches felons and would-be felons a lesson: Do crime, do time. Prisoners get drug treatment and education. And, as the columnist Ben Wattenberg has noted, "A thug in prison can't shoot your sister."
All four benefits count. Increased incarceration explains part of the drop in crime in New York and other cities. As some recent studies show, prisons pay big dividends even if all they deliver is relief from the murder and mayhem that incarcerated felons would be committing if free.
In two Brookings Institution studies, in 1991 and 1995, the Harvard economist Anne Piehl and I found that prisoners in New Jersey and Wisconsin committed an average of 12 crimes a year when free, excluding all drug crimes. In other studies, the economist Steven D. Levitt of the National Bureau of Economic Research estimated that "incarcerating one additional prisoner reduces the number of crimes by approximately 13 per year."
The economists Thomas Marvell and Carlisle Moody of William and Mary College found that "a better estimate may be 21 crimes averted per additional prisoner." Patrick A. Langan, senior statistician at the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, calculated that tripling the prison population from 1975 to 1989 may have reduced "violent crime by 10 to 15 percent below what it would have been," thereby preventing a "conservatively estimated 390,000 murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults in 1989 alone."
Studies by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 94 percent of state prisoners in 1991 had committed a violent crime or been incarcerated or on probation before. Of these prisoners, 45 percent had committed their latest crimes while free on probation or parole. When "supervised" on the streets, they inflicted at least 218,000 violent crimes, including 13,200 murders and 11,600 rapes (more than half of the rapes against children).
Most Americans are more likely to be a victim of violent crime than to suffer injury in a car accident. As estimated in a forthcoming National Institute of Justice study, the violent crimes committed each year will cost victims and society more than $400 billion in medical bills, lost days from work, lost quality of life -- and lost life.
Here's the revolving-door rub. Known felons whom the system has put back on the streets are responsible for about one in three violent crimes, and barely one violent crime in a hundred results in imprisonment. On any given day in 1994, about 690,000 people were on parole and 2.96 million were on probation. About 1.5 times as many convicted violent felons were on probation or parole as were in prison.
All told, research shows it costs society at least twice as much to let a prisoner loose than to lock him up. Compared with the human and financial toll of revolving-door justice, prisons are a real bargain.
Prison definitely pays, but there's one class of criminal that is an arguable exception: low-level, first-time drug offenders.
Most drug felons in state prisons do not fit that description. Instead, they have long adult and juvenile records involving plenty of serious non-drug crimes. And most Federal drug traffickers are not black kids caught with a little crack cocaine or white executives arrested for a small stash of powder cocaine. The average amount of drugs involved in Federal cocaine-trafficking cases is 183 pounds, and the average amount involved in Federal marijuana trafficking cases is 3.5 tons.
Still, though the numbers of petty drug offenders may prove small, it makes no sense to lock away even one drug offender whose case could be adjudicated in special drug courts and handled less expensively through intensively supervised probation featuring no-nonsense drug treatment and community service.
Thus, Governor Pataki needs to repeal undiscriminating Rockefeller-era drug laws as part of his campaign to keep violent and repeat criminals where they can't harm the rest of us.
Meanwhile, Governor Thompson should pursue whatever "alternative to incarceration" policies he fancies subject to one condition: He should agree to make public in a timely fashion the complete histories of all criminals released from custody because of his "reforms."
All elected leaders should reckon that those who break their promises to protect society from career criminals can count on voters to shorten their political careers.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Traders Focus on New Data And Fresh Talks on Budget

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
While the markets for Treasury securities were closed yesterday for the holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., traders began looking forward to a greater clarity in trading this week.
They are waiting for the budget talks to resume in Washington on Wednesday and for the release this week of some long-delayed Government economic statistics. The Government shutdown prevented the gathering and compilation of economic indicators, meaning that many market participants postponed investment decisions or took smaller positions based on private statistics, which are typically less comprehensive. 
 Traders said yesterday that the debt market remained optimistic that the budget talks had a chance of reaching agreement.
James S. Collins, a senior vice president at Smith Barney in Chicago, who manages research for the institutional financial futures group, said the market was likely to be encouraged that the Republicans this weekend stopped linking the budget talks to a renewal of the debt ceiling.
Nonetheless, Mr. Collins said he did not rule out some pullback in the market this week, with the yield on the long bond possibly rising to between 6.20 and 6.25 percent, equating to a price of about 1188/32 to 10/32 on the March bond futures contract. On Friday the yield was 6.14 percent on the benchmark issue.
"The budget talks will apparently resume in earnest on Wednesday," Mr. Collins said, "and I think the tone of those meetings will be significant to the market. The last round was quite sour by the time it wound down."
The market will be vulnerable during the negotiations, he added. "If the tone of the meetings continues to suggest irreconcilable differences and nothing substantial is achieved until the election, I think that would put substantial pressure on the long bond," he said.
"The data mills are reopening," he said, and though the dates are uncertain, the market could see the housing starts report today and the trade balance tomorrow.
The weekly jobs data will be important, Mr. Collins said, particularly because the reports have been stalled for five weeks.
Today the Treasury will conduct its weekly sale of three- and six-month bills, postponed a day because of yesterday's holiday. At the close of Friday's abbreviated session, the rate for a three-month maturity was 5.01 percent and the six-month issue, 4.95 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Edges Up in Light Trade On Remark Over German Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar finished slightly higher yesterday against leading currencies amid further speculation that Europe is headed for another round of interest rate cuts.
A German monetary official's comments that there was room for lower rates helped the dollar against the mark, which would suffer if German investments paid lower yields. 
 The dollar remained flat against the Japanese yen as traders speculated that political changes in Japan would lead to a stronger economy.
With holidays in Japan and the United States, only Europe was involved in anything approaching significant trading volume. Smaller trades took on greater importance in the market because of the low volume.
By late yesterday, the dollar sold for 1.4465 marks, up from 1.4420 late Friday. The dollar ended at 105.20 yen, unchanged from Friday.
In Paris yesterday, the head of the International Monetary Fund played down Europe's economic problems, saying there was currently no recession on the Continent.
But Hans-Jurgen Kobnick, president of the German regional central bank in Mainz, was quoted in a German newspaper as saying that there was room for another rate cut by the Bundesbank, but that the timing for such a cut was uncertain.
A country lowers its interest rates to spur lending and growth, though cuts weaken a currency because fewer investors acquire it to buy that country's assets, which are consequently less attractive.
Mr. Kobnick's remarks follow the recent release of economic data showing that Germany is in a slowdown. Traders are particularly watching monetary officials in Britain and France, where interest rates might be lowered this week.
"As a result of this, you have the dollar looking O.K.," Lisa Finstrom, an analyst at Smith Barney, said. "The dollar is benefiting from that right now."
In Japan, Ms. Finstrom said, the change in prime ministers and a shift in the leadership of a political party portends "positive movement toward achieving structural reform" and alleviating Japan's four-year economic slide.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late Friday, included these: 1.1655 Swiss francs, up from 1.1625; 4.9585 French francs, up from 4.9494, and 1,574 Italian lire, up from 1,572. The British pound was quoted at $1.5460, unchanged from Friday.

Cocoa Prices at 4-Week High As Ivory Coast Deliveries Decline

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Cocoa prices jumped to their highest level in four weeks yesterday after shipments of beans from Ivory Coast, the world's biggest producer, began winding down.
Cocoa for March delivery jumped $30, to $1,286 a metric ton, rebounding from a low of $1,240 at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York. 
 In other commodity markets, coffee prices fell to less than $1 a pound; oil prices rebounded; natural gas prices sank and metals prices fell. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities fell 1.64 points, to 239.95.
New cocoa supplies have not kept up with global demand for several years, but analysts had expected a bumper crop in Ivory Coast to help balance supply and demand.
Traders in Ivory Coast said, though, that the pace of cocoa supplies pouring into its port cities had slowed. "Deliveries are maybe 10,000 tons less than in previous weeks," one trader said.
Coffee prices also fell sharply late in the session, with the March contract off 3.75 cents, to 98.95 cents a pound.
Analysts said the market had discounted worries about freeze damage to Mexico's coffee fields and were skeptical that global producers would succeed in manipulating supplies. "People who bought the market at $1 liquidated today," said Judith Ganes, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
Copper prices fell to 16-month lows on fears of rising inventories and weak economic growth. The March copper contract fell 1.05 cents, to 111.65 cents a pound, at the Commodity Exchange.
Japanese buyers were on a holiday, reducing buying interest, said Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential Securities.
"There is also a generally negative feeling about the macroeconomic outlook in terms of the U.S.," Ms. Raptopoulos said. Much of the demand for copper comes from industrial activity.
Crude oil prices broke a four-day string of declines, with February crude rising 13 cents, to $18.38 a barrel, at the New York Mercantile Exchange. February gasoline rose eight-tenths of 1 cent, to 53.90 cents a gallon.
Forecasts for warmer weather along the East Coast pulled February heating oil down 0.27 cent, to 53.30 cents a gallon, and February natural gas lost 30 cents, to $2.017 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
The market predicts the Super Bowl and vice versa, so they say.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
THE bull market is good for another year, no matter which team wins this year's Super Bowl. And that is just as well, because the stock market right now sees the game as very close, although last week's sharp fall in share prices has given the Dallas Cowboys a small edge.
Those are the results of two theories relating the stock market to the Super Bowl. It is, of course, absurd to think there is any relation between the two, but that doesn't stop Wall Street from paying attention.
First, the future of the market. That theory has been around for years, occasionally tweaked to make it work better. In its current form, it says that if a team from the old National Football League wins the game, the stock market will rise during the year until the next game. But if a team from the old American Football League wins, share prices will fall. 
 The good news for the bulls was locked in a week ago: All four teams in the conference championship games played Sunday, including the two from the American Football Conference, were old N.F.L. teams. So the bulls clearly have it.
That theory has worked this year. A year ago, it was San Francisco (old N.F.L.) over San Diego (old A.F.L.) in the Super Bowl, which the theory said meant prices would rise. Sure enough, the Dow Jones industrial average is now 31 percent over the 3,857.99 level where it stood entering that game. That brings the record for the indicator to 25 of 29. The failures came after the 1970, 1987, 1990 and 1994 games. In 1970, the game falsely forecast falling share prices; in the other years it was wrongly bullish.
Dallas was the winner in the last of those games, but the market did go up after its other three victories. Similarly, share prices rose after each of Pittsburgh's four previous victories.
The newer theory, written about in this column seven years ago, attempts to use the stock market to forecast the game. It holds that if the Dow rises from the end of November until game day, the franchise from later in the alphabet will win.
In this case, that means the Pittsburgh Steelers will benefit from a bull market, while the Dallas Cowboys will be favored if share prices fall.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended November at 5,074.49, and subsequently got up to a high of 5,216.47. But last week's sharp fall, the worst week for the index in more than a year, left the average at 5,061.12, below the magic number, and it fell further, to 5,043.78, yesterday. But there are nine trading days left before the game, with a gain of just over 30 points needed to forecast a Pittsburgh win.
When the theory regarding the Dow forecasting the Super Bowl game was first written about in this column, it had correctly forecast 12 of the previous 14 games. Since then, it has gotten six of seven correct, bringing its total record to 18 of 21.
By contrast, the Las Vegas point spread has correctly picked the winner in 16 of 20 games over the same stretch, with one game, in 1982, going off with no favorite.
The three games in which the football theory has failed to forecast the Super Bowl game were in 1982, when San Francisco beat Cincinnati; in 1986, when Chicago topped New England, and in 1990, when San Francisco beat Denver.
People who buy or sell stocks or place bets on football games based on such indicators probably should not be allowed to manage their own money. But the existence of indicators with such apparently superb records nonetheless does serve a use, by reminding investors that the fact that two things are correlated may or may not indicate that they are related. That is useful to consider when looking at other indicators that seem to make more sense.
But if you are unwilling to accept that warning, here's another correlation to ponder. The last three times the economy had at least one quarter in which it did not show growth, after adjusting for inflation, were in 1982, 1986 and 1990. And, as it happens, they were also the years in which the stock market failed to forecast the Super Bowl.
Therefore, if this indicator does not get the game right on Jan. 28, you should watch out for a recession this year.

HEADLINE: Buses Using Natural Gas Do Well in Pilot Program

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
New York City buses have long been notorious for the black soot many of them spew out of their exhaust pipes. Now, as the Transit Authority is starting to convert the fleet to run on cleaner-burning fuels, several state legislators and environmentalists say the efforts fall far short of what is needed.
They are urging the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Transit Authority's parent agency, to convert all 3,600 city buses to alternative fuels like natural gas, methanol, ethanol and electricity. 
 The Transit Authority has already bought 100 buses that run on cleaner diesel fuel and has begun to test 34 others equipped to run on compressed natural gas, an effort some have criticized as paltry given the city's pollution problems.
"What the M.T.A is trying to do is bad public health, bad environmental policy and bad economics," Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, chairman of the Assembly's Committee on Environmental Conservation, said last week. "So far, they've done everything wrong."
Mr. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, released data from the State Department of Environmental Conservation showing that midtown Manhattan has experienced a sharp increase in soot, primarily from diesel buses.
Soot levels at Madison Avenue and 46th Street have worsened since hitting a modern-day low in 1992 of 42 parts per million. The 1994 average was 53, and for the first three quarters of 1995, the pollutants averaged 55 parts per million. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency has ruled that soot levels above 50 parts per million are hazardous.
The city's experimental gas buses, which have been on the streets of Brooklyn since November, got good reviews the other day from riders on the B11 route, which goes through Sunset Park and Red Hook. The buses' tailpipes emit no polluting fumes.
"That's good," said one passenger, Pietra Madison. "There sure is a lot of smoke from these other buses that make you cough and all."
Anna Gonzalez said, "Whatever they can do to reduce the smoke is fine with me."
Many of the riders did not realize that the bus was running on natural gas. Aside from the square gas tank on the roof, and a modest sign, the bus looks like the standard model.
Despite the apparent advantages of compressed gas, New York transit officials warn against jumping on the bandwagon too quickly. Advanced diesel fuel, which is cleaner than the old diesel, they point out, satisfies Clean Air Act requirements and is cheaper and easier to handle than compressed natural gas.
"There's no question that C.N.G. is cleaner," said Vincent D. Pellegrin, the Transit Authority's chief of research and development. "What we're saying is, look at the total issue to see if this is the most economically effective way for us to clean the environment."
Transit officials are also studying buses powered by alternative fuels like methanol, ethanol and electricity.
With growing pressure from environmentalists, and mindful of a 500-year supply of natural gas in the United States, transit agencies and private transportation companies across the country are switching to compressed natural gas.
While diesel is still king for transit systems, compressed natural gas is the fastest-growing alternative fuel. In January 1994, there were 297 natural-gas buses nationwide; now, 1,000 of the nation's 52,000 municipal buses use gas. More than a dozen transit systems have pledged to stop buying diesel buses, including Los Angeles, Atlanta, Houston and Cleveland.
Still, Transit officials said there is no rush to convert the entire fleet to natural gas because of the huge amount of money it would require to modify depots and to train mechanics. The buses themselves cost $277,000, $42,000 more than a standard diesel bus.
Transit officials have spent more than $1.6 million to install a natural gas fueling station and modify air vents and other mechanical adjustments at the site of the experiment, the Jackie Gleason Depot in Sunset Park, named for the actor who played Ralph Kramden, the bus driver from Bensonhurst, in "The Honeymooners."
Officials said their most ambitious plan is to buy 100 more buses at the end of the compressed gas experiment later this year.
Through a $3 million Federal transportation grant, the Taxi and Limousine Commission plans to give incentives to taxi fleet owners to convert 157 of the city's 11,787 taxis to compressed natural gas. Fleet owners would receive up to $5,000 for the engine and fuel tank conversion and an extra $2,000 in tax breaks.
Minute particles of carbon and other compounds in the sooty clouds spewing from buses and heavy trucks are estimated to raise the annual death rate in cities with pollution levels like New York's 15 percent above those in cities with cleaner air, according to a 1995 study by the Harvard School of Public Health that has been cited by environmentalists.
The particles lodge deep in the lungs and can raise the risk of developing emphysema, asthma and cancer, the E.P.A. said.
Last June, the Natural Resources Defense Council started a "Dump Dirty Diesel" campaign, and filed a lawsuit against the M.T.A. after the agency refused to run an ad from the group. The ads were to be placed on the rear of the bus, and read: "Standing behind this bus could be more dangerous than standing in front of it."
The lawsuit was settled after M.T.A. officials agreed to run the ads.

HEADLINE: Peru Mocks Due Process

 BODY:
Lori Helene Berenson of New York City may indeed have conspired with violent terrorists, as the Peruvian Government claims, helping them obtain weapons, rent safe houses and gather information for guerrilla attacks. Or Ms. Berenson's activities with the Tupac Amaru revolutionary movement may have been strictly nonviolent, as she insists. A fair trial might have determined the answer. But a fair trial is exactly what she did not get.
Ms. Berenson's lawyers were not allowed to cross-examine witnesses or challenge evidence. The identities of her military judge was concealed. The court then convicted her of treason, an offense that, as a non-Peruvian, she cannot be guilty of, and sentenced her to life in prison, although the prosecutor had only sought 30 years. The United States Government has strongly protested the entire proceeding. 
 Peru began subjecting civilians to this kind of military trial as a weapon against the once-dangerous Shining Path guerrilla movement, a threat that has now been largely contained. But the military courts continue to deprive Peruvians and foreigners of their most basic rights to due process. They are among the more disturbing trappings of President Alberto Fujimori's authoritarian regime.
Mr. Fujimori was democratically elected to a second term last year. Voters rewarded his success in rolling back the guerrilla challenge and taming hyperinflation. But he still rules in partnership with a military that has never accepted democracy and is responsible for grave human rights abuses. Though there is once again an elected congress, replacing the one Mr. Fujimori dissolved in 1992, its powers are weak and are rarely exercised. Nor is there any longer much of an independent judiciary. Mr. Fujimori's power knows no real constitutional check.
Throughout the 1980's, Peru maintained a constitutional democracy on paper. But its blessings were negated by economic decline, violent terrorism and a notoriously parasitic bureaucracy. Now public order is much improved and the economy revived. But the Peruvian people are subject to arbitrary arrest, unfair trials and other abuses of their most basic rights.
Ms. Berenson's lawyers are appealing the verdict, asking that the treason charges be reduced, perhaps to terrorism or collaboration, and the trial sent to a civilian court. The State Department rightly deplores the conduct of the trial and calls for her appeal to be heard in an open civilian court. Whatever she may or may not have done, she is surely entitled to that minimal degree of due process.
Ms. Berenson is strongly committed to the Tupac Amaru cause. She wants no special help from Washington, asking to be treated no differently than her Peruvian co-defendants. They too are entitled to due process in an open trial. Peru's progress in other areas does not have to come at the expense of its people's elementary rights.

Here We Go Again

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WIESMAN 

 BODY:
F. Scott Fitzgerald said that there are no second acts in American lives, but the Republican Party aims to give it a try. The G.O.P. wants to recreate the glory days of 1981, when President Reagan pushed a budget through Congress by rallying enough conservative Democrats to his side to get a majority. Now the Republican Congressional leaders say they will attempt to persuade a handful of Democratic senators and at least 55 Democratic House members to provide a two-thirds majority for their seven-year balanced budget plan that could withstand a veto from President Clinton.
On the surface, the Republican scheme is plausible enough. There are plenty of Democrats in the House who are close to the Republicans on many issues and not too fond of Mr. Clinton. But the odds seem to be against the latest Republican gambit because of an important historical shift that, ironically enough, can be traced back to Mr. Reagan's budget adventures of 15 years ago. 
 Back then conservative Democrats were enthralled by the supply-side alchemy that a tax cut would pay for itself by producing growth in the economy. Now the conservative Democrats happen to be the most outspoken opponents of the tax cut that is the centerpiece of the Republican agenda. Many of them happily embrace the term "blue dog Democrats" -- a send-up of the old expression "yellow dog Democrats," referring to party members who are so loyal they would vote for a yellow dog over a Republican.
But the blue dogs, it turns out, are so far more loyal to fiscal conservatism than they are to either party. They are among the most articulate and vehement opponents of a tax cut, and many are concerned about the accompanying sharp cuts in social programs for children, the elderly and the poor.
To get the blue dog support, the Republicans would have to scale back their tax cut more sharply. Such a step would almost certainly be welcomed by Bob Dole and many of his fellow Republican mandarins in the Senate if they could get Mr. Clinton to move their way on cutting Medicare and some domestic spending programs. But the party seems unable to move in that direction because of opposition by conservative Republicans in the House, particularly those disciplined and zealous freshmen. One of the paradoxes of the current stalemate is thus the unbridgeable gap on the tax-cut issue between the conservatives of the two political parties.
How did we get here? In retrospect, Mr. Reagan's sweeping tax cut of 1981 looks like an even more important turning point than it seemed at the time. For one thing, it started a debate that rages today. On one side is the Republican orthodoxy that the tax cut spurred the "morning in America" that Mr. Reagan rode to re-election. On the other is the Democratic orthodoxy that the tax cut pushed the country toward mounting deficits and debt service burdens for future generations.
After their election triumph in 1994, the Republicans made a tax cut the highest party priority. To their credit, they have at least been intellectually honest enough this time to admit that the tax cut would not pay for itself. By embracing a tax cut along with a balanced budget, many acknowledge that their real objective is to force a historic retrenchment in domestic programs -- particularly welfare, Medicaid and Medicare.
The Republicans may well succeed in winning over some of the blue dogs and other conservative Democrats, but it will be hard. They are laboring, for example, without the warm, reassuring presence of Mr. Reagan that entranced Americans more than a decade ago.
Remember also that both Medicare and Medicaid pay for the health care of the older generation, Medicare directly and Medicaid because of the huge numbers of middle-class and working-class elderly who turn their assets over to their children in order to qualify for Medicaid-financed nursing home care. It is not even clear that Mr. Reagan would be able to cast the same spell if he suddenly reappeared on the scene. He did not try to remake Medicaid and Medicare when he had the chance in the first act. STEVEN R. WEISMAN

HEADLINE: Health Research, Once Facing Big Budget Cut, Gets an Increase

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
While cutting the budget for most other agencies, Congress has given the National Institutes of Health an increase of 5.8 percent, after Republicans concluded that biomedical research was an engine of economic growth.
A bill signed recently by President Clinton provides $11.94 billion for the institutes in the current fiscal year, an increase of $655 million from the $11.28 billion spent last year. 
 Although Congress has cut most of the President's budget requests, it approved $175 million more than he requested for the N.I.H. The increase, in a bill signed by Mr. Clinton on Jan. 6, won strong support from lawmakers of both parties, including Speaker Newt Gingrich.
The institutes finance biomedical research on their own campus and at universities around the country. But after taking control of the House last year, Republicans skeptically scrutinized the N.I.H. and told scientists to expect substantial cuts as part of the Republican effort to balance the Federal budget.
The institutes' budget grew an average of 14 percent a year in the 1960's and nearly 9 percent a year in the next two decades. But these days an increase of 3 percent or 4 percent, just to keep pace with inflation, is considered a major victory for any agency. The increase for the N.I.H. exceeds the rate of inflation, even for biomedical research.
Ralph A. Bradshaw, president of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, an organization of 10 scientific groups with 44,000 members, said: "We are elated. This is a great day for biomedical research."
After the Republicans won control of Congress, many of them expressed doubts about the need for the Government to finance research on biochemistry, molecular biology and genetics. They said biotechnology companies could pay for more research themselves. But after hearing from many business executives, the Republicans concluded that Federal research spending was a smart investment because it fosters economic growth, creates high-wage jobs and contributes to a favorable balance of trade.
Republicans still generally oppose the kind of industrial policy under which the Government picks certain companies, products or industries for support. But many Republican leaders advocate Federal support for basic scientific research. The history of science is full of cases in which basic research, with no obvious practical application, led to useful products and medications.
Money for the National Institutes of Health is normally provided as part of an appropriations bill that finances the Departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services. That bill is languishing in Congress, but lawmakers singled out the work of the N.I.H. for special treatment.
This is part of a Republican strategy of providing "targeted appropriations" for programs they like while leaving others to fend for themselves. Representative John R. Kasich, an Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, said this tactic would "put some pressure on the President" to accept Republican priorities.
For many programs, Congress has provided money only through Jan. 26 or March 15, but the N.I.H. got money for the full fiscal year, through Sept. 30. At the same time, the House voted to cut programs for elementary and secondary education, for job training and for summer jobs for teen-agers from low-income families.
The budget plan adopted by Congress in the first half of 1995 assumed that N.I.H. spending would be trimmed significantly. The House voted to cut the agency's budget by 5 percent in 1996 and to freeze it at that level for the next six years. The Senate Budget Committee recommended a 10 percent cut, and the full Senate voted to restore most of that money. The conference agreement on the budget, endorsed as a blueprint for the guidance of Congress last June, assumed a 1 percent cut in 1996 and a 3 percent reduction from the 1995 level after that.
But the Appropriations Committees of Congress, which actually write the money bills, did not accept those recommendations and reshuffled money among agencies. Two influential Republicans, Senator Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon and Representative John Edward Porter of Illinois, insisted on an increase for the N.I.H.
Mr. Hatfield is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Mr. Porter is chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee responsible for the health institutes. Mr. Porter said Mr. Gingrich had been "very, very strongly supportive of the increase for N.I.H."
In May, university researchers and executives from biotechnology and drug companies met with Mr. Gingrich to emphasize the importance of biomedical research to the nation and to their industries. In retrospect, they say that meeting was a turning point because they apparently won the Speaker's support.
Among those at the meeting with Mr. Gingrich were Dr. Bradshaw; Dr. Joseph M. Davie, vice president in charge of research at Biogen, a biotechnology company in Cambridge, Mass.; Thomas N. Urban, chairman of Pioneer Hi-Bred International, a plant genetics company in Des Moines; Dr. Leon E. Rosenberg, president of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, in Princeton, N.J., and Dr. Edward E. Penhoet, president of Chiron Corporation, a biotechnology company in Emeryville, Calif.
Mr. Urban said molecular biology of the type financed by the N.I.H. was "extremely important to plant genetics." Knowledge gained from such research will increase the productivity of seeds and agriculture, he said.
Dr. Penhoet said the institutes had provided "the seed money from which America's worldwide leadership in biotechnology has sprung." Dr. Davie said that "probably more than half of the products being developed in biotech as a whole came from discoveries in university laboratories," many of which receive money from the N.I.H.
Republicans suggested to corporate supporters of the N.I.H. that their companies could increase research spending to make up for any Federal cutbacks. But Dr. Davie said, "The amount of money actually spent in the biotech industry in research rather than development is minuscule compared with the amount of basic research supported by the Government."

HEADLINE: If We're So Tired, Why Aren't We Rich?

BYLINE: By Jeffrey Madrick; Jeffrey Madrick is the author of "The End of Affluence."

 BODY:
An idea has been gaining currency lately that goes something like this. The source of frustration and anxiety for so many Americans today is that they simply expect too much. Although the income gap may have widened and real wages fallen over the last couple of decades, most people are still much better off than their grandparents or great-grandparents were. Even in the Roaring 20's, almost everyone worked longer and harder than they do today, comparatively few had pensions, people readily died of minor diseases and half the population didn't even have indoor plumbing. Americans simply became accustomed to an artificially high standard of living during the postwar era that can no longer be sustained.
What is lacking in this view is the recognition of a historical shift that gives Americans good cause for anxiety, and not just because they missed out on the high-living 1950's and '60's. 
 It is true that most workers did not live as well before World War II as they do today. Yet they made extraordinary gains in their standard of living over the course of their lives. In 1920, for example, only one of four families owned a car. By 1930, three of five owned a car. Americans not only bought cars in those years but also, as electricity became available, washing machines, phonographs, refrigerators and radios.
They also finished high school in astonishingly greater numbers, and nearly half owned a home by 1930. Most people's health was considerably better than that of their parents or grandparents; their wages were much higher. Exceeding one's expectations defined what it meant to be American. This relative success gave proof to a powerful new idea of the Age of Reason: an individual (a white one anyway) could shape his destiny.
Now consider what is happening today. In the past 20 years, the rate of economic progress, as measured by statistics like wages and family income, has slowed greatly compared with any time since the Civil War. The most important of these statistics is productivity, the output of goods and services the economy produces per hour of work and the source of our rising standard of living. The rate at which it grows makes us collectively richer or poorer.
Evidence analyzed by economic historians has shown that productivity has grown at an average annual rate of 2.25 percent a year since 1870, not much slower than its pace in the immediate postwar era of 2.7 percent. Since 1973, however, productivity has grown at an average rate of only 1 percent a year, less than half its historical rate. Productivity growth has been higher in the 1990's, as it typically is during expansions. But productivity hasn't grown nearly as rapidly as it did in the 1950's and '60's (or during the 1920's, for that matter).
Had productivity grown at more than 2 percent over the last 20 years, the typical American family would have earned roughly $60,000 more in that time and better than $5,000 more in 1995 alone. There would be no Federal deficit at all at current levels of government spending, but rather a substantial surplus from which to meet our social obligations or reduce taxes. Instead, average wages and salaries have more or less stagnated since 1973, something they hadn't done over so long a period since the Civil War.
As incomes have become less certain and have begun to fall (in real wages) for nearly a third of workers, taxes increasingly feel like an unfair burden. Both spouses must work, though high-quality day care is expensive and hard to find. As for the American dream, while most of us can afford inexpensive new products like VCR's and microwave ovens, a significantly smaller proportion of Americans under 45 own homes.
Most disturbing, rapid growth may raise all ships, but slow growth apparently does not. More and more Americans are being left far behind: children, the poor and workers with only high school educations (still a majority of workers overall), to name the most immediate victims.
Economists cite everything from low savings rates to competition from low-wage countries to explain the slowdown in growth, but there is no clear consensus. What is clear is that, if we hope to improve growth or even maintain current rates, we must place more of our resources in capital investments, research and development and education. Healthy growth has been the glue that has held an otherwise diverse and often discordant people together since the nation's beginnings. Without it, a growing number of citizens feel, with good reason, that they are losing control over their lives. This is not business as usual in America. It is a reversal of our national experience.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin's Assault on Chechens Meets Critics on Left and Right

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 15

 BODY:
If President Boris N. Yeltsin hoped that a last-minute show of force in the six-day hostage crisis in southern Russia would somehow quell his critics, he miscalculated.
By hints and recent personnel changes, President Yeltsin has been sounding more and more like a man preparing himself for a re-election bid. And that may help explain why, immediately after Russian troops began firing on the village of Pervomayskoye where 200 Chechen rebels held about 100 hostages, prominent political figures on his left and right began hammering at the President -- even before the toll was known. 
 The Communist leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, whose party has more seats in the newly elected Parliament than any other, heaped scorn on the decision and called it a "tragedy" for Russia and for Mr. Yeltsin. Calling the assault "a shame for Russian democracy," Grigory A. Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal opposition group Yabloko, threatened to raise the issue of a no-confidence vote against the Government in Parliament.
Only the ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky favored the assault, but then quickly complained that Mr. Yeltsin would lack the resolve to finish the job against the hostage-takers, led by Salman Raduyev.
"You'll see," Mr. Zhirinovsky predicted. "The storming will be stopped and what remains of Raduyev's band will flee back to its nest."
Mr. Yeltsin defended the assault by saying he had exhausted all peaceful means of ending the stand-off. "Talks have been held every day for six days," he told reporters today outside his Kremlin office. "Even this morning we sent them the last warning and shots were the reply. Only then were orders issued for the operation."
But as they waited for the outcome, ordinary Russians did not appear as steadfastly opposed to the assault as most politicians.
"I approve of what the federal troops are doing in Pervomayskoye," said Aleksandr Ignatyev, 44, editor at a publishing house. "If the bandits are unpunished it would become a common practice all over the country. I am sure that neither the United States nor any other country would allow anything like this to happen."
Those who were upset about the assault mostly spoke of their opposition to the yearlong war against the separatists in Chechnya that gave rise to the hostage-taking. "We should have withdrawn our troops to prevent all these deaths and horror," said a 20-year-old construction worker who declined to give his name.
Mr. Yeltsin insisted that the assault had been carefully planned.
"I can't say there won't be casualties, but there will be a minimum of casualties." He did not rule out other assaults on Chechen rebels. "If intelligence reports indicate the presence of armed bandits at certain locations, and there are no civilians there, they should be . . ." Mr. Yeltsin did not finish the sentence, but instead smashed his hand as if squashing a fly.
Even though he was in the middle of a highly risky and sensitive anti-terrorist operation, Mr. Yeltsin did not decline to address his own political future. "It is possible, but not for sure" he said when asked about standing for a second term as President. "I am still thinking."
But he has already moved ahead with key appointments that suggest he could be preparing for a re-election campaign. Today he stunned his critics by appointing as his new chief of administration Nikolai D. Yegorov, the former minister of nationalities who, after intense pressure from Parliament, was fired for his role in the botched hostage-rescue operation in Budyonnovsk last May.
Mr. Yegorov was one of the administration's more hawkish advocates of the Russian military intervention in Chechnya, and his return to favor, on the very day of reckoning in Pervomayskoye, was strangely timed. But Mr. Yeltsin seems suddenly intent on surrounding himself with people he trusts, regardless of what his critics may say.
Mr. Yegorov replaces Sergei A. Filatov, a liberal, who left the Kremlin to begin organizing the presidential elections scheduled for June. Russian political analysts say that if Mr. Yeltsin decides to run, Mr. Filatov would become a key figure on the President's campaign staff.
The Chechen rebels have just as much as Mr. Yeltsin to lose in the battle for public opinion.
Yegor T. Gaidar, a liberal economist and politician who has said his party, Russia's Choice, will not field a candidate for the presidency, described Mr. Yeltsin's decision as "an immense risk."
Referring to the rebel Chechen leader, Dzhokhar M. Dudayev, who ordered the hostage-taking, Mr. Gaidar added: "I think that Dudayev and his people made a big mistake by having put a stake on terror. They gave a trump card to the advocates of a forceful solution."

HEADLINE: Technology Stocks Drag Market Down, and Dow Falls 17.34

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market weakened yesterday in sluggish holiday trading, as investors remained worried about earnings shortfalls and the absence of a budget agreement in Washington.
"There was weakness in the high-tech stocks and that impacted the Dow industrials," said Harry W. Laubscher, senior vice president of Tucker Anthony. "Concern spread that earlier earnings estimates may not come to pass." 
 Among the major market indicators, the largest decline occurred in the technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index, which fell 19.66 points, or 1.95 percent, to 988.57 -- its lowest closing level since Aug. 3, 1995. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 17.34 points, to 5,043.78, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, slipped 1.99 points, to 599.82.
Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange led advancers, 1,330 to 957. Big Board volume slumped to 306.2 million shares, from 383.4 million shares on Friday, as banks and the Treasury bond market were closed in observance of the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Intel was the most actively traded stock yesterday, as traders awaited its fourth-quarter financial report, which is scheduled to be released late today. The semiconductor manufacturer tumbled 3 1/4, to 53 3/8.
Other computer-related companies were also hard hit by investors concerned about waning demand. Micron, the second-most-active issue, which was downgraded by Robertson Stephens & Company, fell 2 1/8, to 30 7/8.Applied Materials dropped 3 7/8, to 31 3/8, and Cabletron Systems declined 4 1/2, to 68. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index plunged 14 points, to 165.7.
Bank stocks were lower, with analysts citing the possibility of higher loan-loss provisions. J. P. Morganclosed at 75 1/2, down 3/4; Chase Manhattan at 57, down 7/8, and BankAmerica at 60 1/4, down 1.
On the other hand, drug stocks gained on expectations that their profits would not be significantly affected by slow economic growth in 1996. Merck rose 1 1/2, to 63 5/8; American Home Products increased 2 3/8, to 97 5/8; Elan advanced 3, to 52 3/4, and Becton Dickinson added 2 3/4, to 76 7/8.
Some insurance issues also managed to finish on the plus side. Aetna closed at 70 1/8, up 2 3/8, and Cigna finished at 111 3/8, up 1 7/8.
After Merrill Lynch raised its ratings for Oxford Health and Wellcare Management, both managed-care companies moved higher. Oxford Health advanced 113/16 , to 653/16 , and Wellcare advanced 2 1/8, to 21.
Maybelline surged 3 1/4, to 40, on prospects of a bidding war for the corporation between L'Oreal of France and Benckiser of Germany. Wisconsin Central Transportation soared 5 1/2, to 73 1/2, after announcing late on Friday that a consortium it leads was selected as the preferred purchaser of British Rail's three freight companies. And Accustaff increased 2, to 43 1/2, after saying that it plans to acquire Additional Technical Support Inc.
But General Acceptance plummeted 5, to 7, after William Blair & Company slashed its earnings estimates. Federal Express declined 3 1/4, to 69 3/4, after saying that profits in its fiscal third quarter will be below expectations. And W. H. Brady dropped 6, to 21, after Robert W. Baird & Company cut its profit projections for the fiscal year ending July 31.

HEADLINE: McCall Faults Job Agencies Under Cuomo

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 15

 BODY:
The Pataki administration has found an unlikely partner in its efforts to portray former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's job development agencies as mismanaged: State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, New York's top elected Democrat.
The unusual alliance with the Republican administration was formed last week, when Mr. McCall issued reports that attacked the lending practices of the Job Development Authority and the Urban Development Corporation during the Cuomo years. 
 "Every step of the loan review approval and monitoring process was done in a way that made J.D.A. vulnerable to losses," Mr. McCall said.
The move drew criticism from Cuomo supporters, who said that Mr. McCall and one of his aides were among those named to evaluate economic programs approved under the previous administration. The Cuomo supporters said Mr. McCall, who is considering a run for governor in 1998, was trying to distance himself from Mr. Cuomo as well as his own role in the two agencies.
Mr. McCall acknowledged that he served on an advisory committee that reviewed loans for the Job Development Authority from 1989 to 1991. His aide, Assistant Deputy Comptroller Alan C. Sullivan, was the deputy commissioner for economic development in the Cuomo years.
"It's ridiculous," said Vincent Tese, the commissioner for economic development in the Cuomo administration. "Maybe Carl forgot that he sat on the review board."
But Cynthia Munk, a spokeswoman for Mr. McCall, said the Comptroller had no recollection of having reviewed any loan that the report had criticized.
"He attended some meetings and participated in a small way on the advisory committee," she said.
The harshest criticism focused on the Job Development Authority, which has made loans and loan guarantees totaling $800 million for 2,000 projects since it was created in 1961. The report said the agency had accumulated a deficit of $57.8 million from April 1990 to March 1995 because of lax evaluations of loan applications.
The findings echoed complaints that the Pataki administration has repeatedly made about Mr. Cuomo's economic development programs. In December, Mr. Pataki's aides pulled back financing from 177 development projects that had been approved under Mr. Cuomo.
That move came several weeks after Charles A. Gargano, Mr. Pataki's Commissioner for economic development, said that the former Governor's staff had mismanaged its economic stimulus programs.
Caroline Quartararo, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gargano, said the Comptroller's findings support what the Commissioner has been saying.
But Mr. Tese defended the agency's record under the Cuomo administration, saying the loans were made to projects that showed "tremendous promise." He said many of the defaults from 1992 to 1995 were due to the recession.

HEADLINE: On Deadline, Yale Students End a Strike

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Facing the loss of teaching jobs for the semester that began today, graduate students at Yale University who had withheld grades from classes they taught last fall gave in and ended their grade strike.
The students said they had not expected that Yale would carry through on its threat to deny them teaching jobs, which many depend on for living expenses. The grade strike was called to pressure Yale to recognize a union for graduate teaching assistants. 
 But Yale had responded to the strike -- the graduate students' most dramatic action in their five-year campaign for a union -- with a flat refusal to negotiate, disciplinary hearings against three leaders and a firm pledge to strip strikers of teaching assignments. And of more than 400 teaching assistants in the humanities and social sciences, only 83 had taken part, the administration said.
"We were met by a level of reprisals that nobody expected," said Gordon Lafer, research director for the graduate group, "and we thought it was irresponsible to put all of our membership in the position of losing all of their income for the spring semester. For quite a lot of people that would have meant leaving New Haven."
As classes resumed today, Yale's final deadline for the teaching assistants to turn in their grades, the university's position had not changed, said a spokesman, Thomas Conroy. Yale would never accept collective bargaining with the graduate students. "They are students, not employees," he said.
And as some graduate students turned in their grades late, they learned that they had, in fact, lost teaching assignments, and that their departments were not guaranteeing to find them new ones.
"It's not going to be resolved today," Mr. Conroy said of the semester's teaching assignments.
Graduate students, who teach nearly 10 percent of the undergraduate courses at Yale College and serve as section leaders in large lecture courses, have campaigned for Yale to recognize the Graduate Employees and Students Organization as their collective bargaining unit.
The organization contends that Yale, like many universities under financial pressure, is using teaching assistants and part-time instructors in place of more expensive full-time faculty, and that as long as Yale is relying on them for teaching it should negotiate with them over pay and benefits.
While Yale waives tuition for nearly all of its graduate students and says that its $4,900-a-semester stipends for teaching are a very small part of its financial aid to them, for many students the stipends are their entire income. To cover their living expenses, they say, they must either take second jobs, at the expense of their doctoral research, or add to their debt.
Feeding their anxiety is a depressed job market, as universities replace full-time faculty jobs with part-time instructors. The job market is worst for Ph.D.'s in the humanities and social sciences, the two divisions that the graduate organization is seeking to represent.
Given those economic circumstances, students decided in a close vote Sunday night to end the grade strike and save their teaching jobs, said Mr. Lafer, who also serves as research director for Locals 34 and 35 of the Federation of University Employees, which represents Yale's blue-collar and clerical workers.
He said the graduate students intend to honor picket lines of those locals if they strike when their contracts expire in two weeks. Local 35, the union for dining-hall and maintenance workers, is resisting a proposal from Yale that would guarantee current employees their jobs and salaries for four years but establish a lower pay scale for new hires.
The union locals have pressed Yale to recognize the graduate student union, but because the National Labor Relations Board does not recognize graduate students as employees, the unions cannot strike over that issue as Local 35 did in the 1980's to win recognition for the clerical union.
Graduate students said today that they might stage job actions this spring in support of their union. They have also filed an unfair-labor-practice charge with the labor relations board that could bring the board to re-examine the issue of graduate students for the first time since the early 1970's.
But administrators said they hoped the students could shift from the issue of collective bargaining to the issues directly concerning them.
"I very much hope that we can now get down to the business of reconsidering the many issues of graduate education and building a more fruitful structure of dialogue," the dean of Yale College, Richard Brodhead said.
"I'm glad for the sake of our undergraduates that we've been able to restore the usual educational process," he said. "And I'm glad for the many graduate students who I knew to be in agony over the decision to withhold grades."
Many undergraduates said today that they were relieved that the grade strike had passed and were critical of the graduate group for calling it. In a survey of undergraduates conducted by The Yale Daily News last year, more than 60 percent said they opposed recognizing a union for teaching assistants.
"The administration should have been more sensitive to their requests, but there's no way they should ever have withheld grades," said Merritt Lear, a junior and history major.

HEADLINE: Ailing Papandreou Resigns, Asking Quick Election of Successor

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: ROME, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Greece's Prime Minister, Andreas Papandreou, a towering political figure whose two-month hospitalization has paralyzed both his Government and his ruling Socialist party, resigned tonight.
"It is obvious that the country cannot remain incapacitated by my illness," wrote Mr. Papandreou, 76, from his hospital bed at the Onassis Heart Center outside Athens. The letter, the end of a long struggle to persuade the ailing leader to relinquish his grip on power, was addressed to the Central Committee of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, the party Mr. Papandreou founded in 1974 and first led to power in 1981. 
 His formal resignation clears the way for the party's 170-member parliamentary majority to elect a successor within three days. The behind-the-scenes battle for succession is said to have narrowed to former Industry Minister Costas Simitis and Defense Minister Gerassimos Arsenis.
In his letter, Mr. Papandreou said his party should "proceed immediately with the election of a prime minister because the country's problems cannot wait."
Even if, as some political experts expect, the still-ailing Mr. Papandreou stays on as leader of the party, his resignation signals the end of an era in Greek politics. A former American citizen who spent 20 years in the United States, Mr. Papandreou was a compelling if often self-contradictory maverick who during his early years in power fought United States policies despite Greece's continuing membership in NATO.
His election in 1981 was a watershed for the left in Greece, paving the way for reforms including broader rights for women and an array of generous welfare programs. But his economic policy was widely regarded as a failure that continues to cripple Greece's growth.
During his last two years, Mr. Papandreou, back in office after four years in the political wilderness, emerged with a different tune. "As the world changed, he changed," said one Western diplomat in Athens recently. "He couldn't play the Americans against the Soviets any more, or rant and rave about U.S. bases in Greece any more. That was then, and this is now. Now, Greece is drawn more and more into the web of Europe."
Above all, he is an artful survivor, a populist with a devoted following and many enemies whose attacks he manages to duck. The son of a former Prime Minister, he returned in 1961 from the United States, where he had married an American and served as chairman of the Department of Economics at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1967, when a military junta took power in Greece, he was put in prison for eight months.
His most remarkable political comeback was in 1993 after four years in opposition, having weathered a corruption scandal, open-heart surgery and a public affair with a mistress 36 years his junior.
For much of his last term in office, he has been dogged by ill health, but that did not prevent him from keeping tight rein on his party and his Government, and from appointing his new wife, Dimitra Liani, 40, the former flight attendant he married in 1989, as his chief of staff.
Admitted to the Onassis Heart Center with pneumonia on Nov. 20, Mr. Papandreou has since undergone kidney dialysis and has been on and off a respirator. In the absence of a designated successor and without guidelines for choosing one except in the case of death or resignation, Greek political life for the last two months has turned on daily hospital bulletins which have tracked the state of the Prime Minister's health in excruciating detail.

HEADLINE: Another Budget Growls in the Wings

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Those Federal budget watchers who cringed last year at the thought of a political train wreck between the White House and Congress over the 1996 spending bills are not going to want to hear this.
Under a timetable set out by law, President Clinton is supposed to submit his budget request for 1997 in less than three weeks. 
 Nearly four months into the Federal Government's 1996 fiscal year, many of the agencies and departments are still without budgets for the year because the Clinton Administration and Republican Congressional leaders cannot agree on a broader plan to balance the budget by 2002. And if current positions hold, negotiations over the 1997 budget will be no easier than the wrangling over the 1996 spending plan.
"The other budget train has not even left the station," said Representative Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. "But we really have a demand to get the 1997 budget over with as quickly as possible, because coming up is an election year where both the President and Congress will be tied up with campaigning.
"But all my intelligence tells me that the Administration has not even begun to focus on 1997."
Neither have the Republicans.
"It is impossible to even think about 1997 until we get through this," said Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee and a lead negotiator on the Republican side in the budget talks with the White House.
So far, work on the 1996 budget has consumed nine months, hundreds of hours of committee and floor debate in the Senate and House and 50 hours of face-to-face meetings between President Clinton and the Republican leaders. And there still seems no solution in sight.
"If I drive the budget horses much harder, they are going to drop dead," Mr. Kasich said. "If I showed up in a room asking people to talk about next year's budget, it might be grounds for commitment."
The budget process usually goes something like this:
In late September departments and agencies submit their budget requests for the coming year to the Office of Management and Budget for review by the director. After the director checks the budget requests, they are sent back to the departments with recommendations, a process that is traditionally completed around Thanksgiving.
The President makes final decisions on the budget requests in December after consulting with senior economic advisers and Cabinet members. And under the 1974 Budget Act, the President presents the spending plan to Congress by the first Monday in February. For this year, that target date is Feb. 5.
The Administration initially stuck to that timetable last fall, with departments and agencies submitting their requests to the Office of Management and Budget and the budget officials beginning an informal review of the requests. But somewhere in the night, the process ran smack into the stalled budget talks of 1996.
"In essence, none of the internal decision-making for the 1997 budget has taken place," said Lawrence J. Haas, a spokesman for the budget office. "Obviously, the President cannot submit a fiscal 1997 budget until we have fiscal 1996 final decisions. Not only do we not have those spending bills, but we have potential changes to entitlement programs and tax policies."
Since 1980, the President has missed the budget deadline seven times -- at least twice because of changes in administrations and the other times because budget negotiations have stretched into the fall.
But the current budget impasse has lasted so long that it has taken the White House and Congress into uncharted waters.
The much-feared budgetary train wreck between the two forces has instead become a game of political chicken, with each side holding its ground in the face of public anger over the partial shutdowns of the Federal Government.
But the timetable for the budget process was thrown off long before now. After taking control of the Senate and the House in January 1995, the Republicans spent the first 100 days pushing through their Contract With America before turning to the budget.
And the Republicans radically changed the rules of the game, setting as their ultimate goal a budget that spanned seven years and ended in the black. The initial year's budget and succeeding ones through 2002 were to be merely components of the overall plan.
The Republicans plan to include in their 1997 budget the privatization of more Federal services and reductions in Cabinet departments -- they went after the Commerce Department in the 1996 budget, and Speaker Newt Gingrich has promised his impatient revolutionaries that the Department of Education would be on the hit list in 1997.
Mr. Kasich and Mr. Livingston said that among the options that Republicans were considering for the 1997 budget was melding it with what is left of the 1996 budget into a package covering a year and a half or so, using goals set out in their balanced budget plan.
"We might not even consider the White House budget," Mr. Livingston said. "Our own numbers are pretty much spelled out in our seven-year balanced budget plan."
That notion brought a sigh of resignation from one of the senior aides on the Democratic staff of the House Budget Committee.
"When you have 218 votes or more, you can do anything you want," he said, "just as the Republicans have done with the 1996 budget process."

NEW YORK CITY
 
Acrimony Takes No Holiday
Celebrating the Martin Luther King holiday was a tricky business for Mayor Giuliani and Governor Pataki. The Mayor, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, found himself caught up in a public argument with the Rev. Al Sharpton, mostly over which of them was the most disrespectful of Dr. King's memory. And at his speech at a church in Harlem, some parishioners murmured criticism of the Governor's proposed budget cuts. [B1.]
 
A Dispute's Deep Roots
As with many of the recent fights over spending at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, New York City's pursuit of a legal claim for $400 million in back rent for La Guardia and Kennedy International airports is part of a deeper dispute. The city believes that the Port Authority has too often favored New Jersey and not invested enough to improve its economy. The Port Authority says the city's claim is "clouding the process" for nearly $2 billion in work at the airports. [B2.]
 
Attack Muddies an AIDS Issue
Many people are outraged that Colete Lopez, 6, of Sunnyside, Queens, who was jabbed in an attack with a hypodermic needle on the F train a month and a half ago, might have been exposed to H.I.V., the AIDS-causing virus. But should that anger be the basis for forcing some criminal suspects to take H.I.V. tests, as Governor Pataki has proposed? NYC by Clyde Haberman. [B1.]
 
Inquiry Into Shooting Continues
Detectives continued to search for clues in the shooting death of an off-duty police officer in Brooklyn on Saturday night and said they still had not determined whether the death was a suicide, a homicide or an accident. The officer, Kimberly Rivera, 28, was shot once in the head outside the Bensonhurst home of her estranged husband, John. [B2.]
 
Salman Rushdie Steals a Visit
Salman Rushdie slipped into New York City this week to promote his latest book. Mr. Rushdie was sentenced to death in 1989 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who said he had blasphemed Islam in his novel "The Satanic Verses." [B6.]
 
REGION
 
In Search of Warm Weather
Last week's great blizzard has spurred a great exodus as East Coast residents seek refuge in the Sun Belt and other warm-weather destinations in record numbers for this time of year. [Page A1.]
 
Ferraro Weighs Another Run
More than three years after losing a bruising Democratic Senate primary in a quest to become the first woman to be a United States Senator from New York, Geraldine A. Ferraro is openly talking about a possible run against Mayor Giuliani next year or Governor Pataki in 1998. The notion clearly energizes her. [B5.]
 
McCall Faults Cuomo Agencies
The Pataki administration has found an unlikely partner in its efforts to portray former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's job development agencies as mismanaged: State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, New York's top elected Democrat. The unusual alliance was formed last week, when Mr. McCall issued reports that attacked the lending practices of the Job Development Authority and the Urban Development Corporation during the Cuomo years. [B5.]
 
Grade Strike Ends at Yale
Facing the loss of teaching jobs for the semester that began yesterday, graduate students at Yale University who had withheld grades from classes they taught last fall ended their grade strike. The grade strike had been called to pressure Yale to recognize a union for graduate teaching assistants. [Page B1.]
 
Ferry Proposal Divides a Town
A conflict in Nyack, N.Y., over a proposal by the New York State Thruway Authority for a high-speed ferry link to New York City offers cautions for government officials bent on promoting ferry travel. Supporters there argue that the ferry would lure day-tripping New Yorkers to savor a still largely undiscovered village graced by 50 antique shops, showcase homes and splendid views of the Hudson. But opponents worry that a daily invasion of more than 500 cars would deter regular customers from the downtown shops, offsetting any profits from the commuter trade. [B1.]
 
Couple's Sentencing Delayed
More than a year after they were convicted of stealing $35 million from some of the nation's largest banks, Robert and Susanna Scaretta, the former owners of an armored car company based in Bohemia, L.I., have yet to be sentenced. An unusually long presentencing hearing has come down to this: who will care for the Scarettas' four children, 4 to 16 years old, if both parents are sent to prison? Since the prosecutor asked for more time -- in part, to permit a court probation officer to interview other members of the family and to review finances and medical and psychiatric reports concerning the children -- sentencing is now scheduled for Feb. 23.

HEADLINE: 2 Rivals, Worlds Apart, Vie for Packwood's Seat

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 15

 BODY:
They have been arguing about guns and taxes, salmon and jobs, abortion and homosexuals.
Still, it is not so much two visions of the United States' future that has shaped the contest for the open Senate seat in Oregon, a nearly monthlong, mail-in election to be decided by the end of January. Rather, it is two American personal narratives, worlds apart. 
 The Democrat, Representative Ron Wyden, is Jewish, a 46-year-old liberal from a big city, Portland. The Republican, State Senator Gordon Smith, is a Mormon, a 43-year-old conservative from a rural area near Pendleton.
Mr. Wyden's father fled Nazi Germany. Mr. Smith's family sent him abroad, as a Mormon missionary.
Mr. Wyden wanted to be a professional basketball player, but instead became a lawyer who helped found the Gray Panthers, a group that lobbies on social issues for the elderly.
Mr. Smith wanted to make money, and has become a millionaire many times over as the owner of one of the nation's largest producers of frozen peas and corn. It is estimated that 1 of every 7 peas grown in this country passes through his factory in Pendleton, in eastern Oregon.
Polls show that the race for the seat vacated last fall, when Senator Bob Packwood, a Republican, resigned amid a storm of controversy over ethics and sexual misconduct, is too close to call.
With an economy so strong that some parts of the state have worker shortages, Oregon would seem to be a prosperous prop for President Clinton's vision of a trade-dependent, environmentally conscious state. Indeed, Mr. Clinton is popular in Oregon, with an approval rating near 60 percent, just as Speaker Newt Gingrich is not, with only about 25 percent approving of how he is doing his job. But neither man has been much of an issue so far.
Both parties have flown in big-name outside help. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, was here on Saturday night, talking up the prospects of Republicans gaining enough seats to have a veto-proof Senate.
Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, was here today, warning that "if Mr. Smith goes to Washington, he will bring with him an anti-choice agenda" on abortion rights.
But as much as others have tried to make this race a referendum on the Republican agenda in Washington or the President, the focus remains on Mr. Wyden and on Mr. Smith.
"Barely half the people think this election is a referendum on anything except the two candidates," said Tim Hibbitts, an independent pollster.
Campaign disclosures have clouded the images that both candidates have tried to project. Mr. Smith has been dogged by questions about water pollution caused by spills from his food plant, Smith Frozen Foods, with one advertisement accusing him of fatal neglect.
Although he has campaigned on the principles of less government and unfettered free enterprise, Mr. Smith received $766,000 in Federal and state grants to bring his plant up to compliance with antipollution laws. State officials say that Smith Frozen Foods has illegally spilled waste into nearby creeks and ponds four times since 1993, and was fined more than $70,000 for one violation. One spill killed thousands of fish.
Mr. Wyden has seized on the cleanup record, calling Mr. Smith "a chronic polluter" who used taxpayers' money to comply with the law when his net worth exceeded $5 million. The Congressman says Mr. Smith, if elected, will be part of an anti-environmental Congress.
"The new majority in Congress is running a polluter's holiday," Mr. Wyden said, just after a televised debate in Portland on Sunday.
Mr. Wyden has built a 15-year career in Congress around an image as a friend of consumers, the elderly and the poor, and these are among the issues he has been pushing in this campaign.
But his link to blue-collar causes took a beating during the primary, when he could not answer questions about the price of milk, bread or gasoline. Mr. Smith ran advertisements suggesting that Mr. Wyden was out of touch, a Washington insider who never went shopping.
Mr. Wyden, while saying he "blew the quiz," has taken to joking about it. In Sunday's debate, he said one of the things he likes to do for fun in his spare time is "shop for groceries with the children."
Mr. Wyden's failure to price the staples of everyday life has taken away what could have been a powerful class issue against Mr. Smith, aides to both campaigns say.
While Mr. Smith has a salary of more than $2 million a year, he pays the workers at his food plant $7 to $15 an hour. He bought four antique golf clubs for $1.25 million and owns a $325,000 ski condo in Utah, a million-dollar home near Pendleton and a fleet of fast cars.
Mr. Smith says he is living the American dream. "The whole notion of the Oregon Trail is about the American Dream," he said in an interview. "People don't fault you for pursuing that."
Mr. Smith is also willing to spend some of his wealth to get elected. He says he will spend about $3.5 million, nearly twice the projected spending of his opponent, and about $2 million will be from his own pocket.
Oregon has had mail-in elections for years, but this is the first for national office. This year's mail-in vote is an experiment whose chief sponsor, Phil Keisling, the Oregon Secretary of State, says produces a better turnout and costs less.
Whether the experiment will help one party or the other remains an open question. Turnout in the vote-by-mail primary, just under 58 percent of registered voters, set an Oregon record for a non-Presidential primary. The Republican turnout was about two percentage points higher than the Democratic turnout.
In a race this close, when only about 15 percent of Oregon's voters have sent in sealed ballots since the vote-by-mail election started on Jan. 9, any gaffe or new disclosure could determine the outcome.
Sunday's debate, the last one of the campaign, was generally a low-intensity affair. Mr. Smith has tried to soften some of his conservative edges, playing up his editorial endorsement by The Oregonian, the state's dominant newspaper.
Oregon tends to elect socially tolerant, fiscally conservative, somewhat independent candidates. The newspaper endorsement, casting Mr. Smith as a centrist conservative, may be enough to sway a few thousand swing voters in the suburbs, Mr. Smith's supporters say.
"With The Oregonian saying that he's not some right-wing wacko, that may reassure a lot of people who are on the fence," said Pat McCarthy, a spokesman for Mr. Smith.
But outside groups trying to influence the race have been broadcasting television advertisements that are anything but reassuring. The teamsters union, for example, has sponsored advertisements implying that lax safety regulations at Mr. Smith's food plant were responsible for one death and more than a dozen serious on-the-job injuries.
Mr. Wyden has denounced the advertisements, asking that they be taken off the air. "Against the advice of my advisers, I've taken all negative ads off the air," Mr. Wyden said in the debate on Sunday.
Mr. Smith replied, "Yes, but you have a surrogate slandering me," referring to the teamsters ads.
Dan Lavey, campaign manager for the Smith campaign, said the advertisements had had "some impact," but he did say how much.
Oregon has not had a new member of the United States Senate since 1968. Now, with Mr. Packwood gone and the pending retirement of the state's senior Senator, Mark O. Hatfield, it will have two in one year.

Stock Market Weakens, Particularly in Technology
The stock market weakened, particularly in technology issues, in sluggish holiday trading, as investors worried about earnings shortfalls and Washington's continued failure to reach a budget agreement. Intel, the most actively traded stock, fell 3 1/4, to 53 3/8, as traders awaited today's earnings report.
The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index fell 19.66 points, or 1.95 percent, to 988.57 -- its lowest closing level since Aug. 3, 1995. Declining less severely, the Dow industrials dropped 17.34 points, to 5,043.78, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, slipped 1.99 points, to 599.82. [Page D12.]
 
Burlington Northern Plans Cuts
Burlington Northern Santa Fe announced plans to cut about 2,600 jobs, or 6 percent of its work force, and shed thousands of miles of little-used track. Because of the cutbacks, the company will take a pretax charge of $585 million in its fourth quarter. [D4.]
 
Microsoft Plans to Buy Vermeer
Microsoft plans to buy Vermeer Technologies and incorporate Vermeer's World Wide Web publishing software into its top-selling suite of office programs. The move, expected to be announced today, could establish Vermeer's Front Page program as the leading way to write information for the Web. [D8.]
 
A Sudden Migration to the Sun
Like the birds that flew south in the autumn, there is now a second mass migration. But this time it's people. Northeasterners fed up with last week's blizzard are jamming the switchboards of travel agents, hotels and airlines, seeking a speedy trip to Florida, the Caribbean, Mexico and other sunny climes. Meanwhile, the human counterparts of snow birds are heading for the ski slopes. [Page A1.]
 
Bigger Biomedical Research Budget
Congress, while cutting most budgets, gave the National Institutes of Health a 5.8 percent increase, viewing that biomedical research as an engine of economic growth. [A13.]
 
Prodigy Endures a Family Squabble
Even as its parents -- Sears, Roebuck and I.B.M. -- haggle, the Prodigy Services Company, the on-line information service, is struggling to maintain life as usual. With Sears apparently seeking an outside buyer, I.B.M. is said to have brought in its own team of investment bankers and consultants. [D2.]
 
Texas Family to Buy Omni Hotels

Brief Contradicts Philip Morris
A legal brief under seal in a Virginia state court argues that secret Philip Morris documents indicate the company runs a "tobacco extract factory" that adds nicotine to cigarettes in precise measurements.

The bull market is good for another year, according to Wall Street's much-discussed Super Bowl indicator, no matter whether the Dallas Cowboys or Pittsburgh Steelers win.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY: NOTEBOOK;
Gretzky Can't Lose Under New System

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

 BODY:
A year ago, when the National Hockey League lockout ended, management celebrated victory over labor. Despite failing to force a salary cap or a luxury tax, team owners seemed assured that other provisions of the agreement would lessen wage inflation while increasing their control over the players.
This may eventually prove true, but the most interesting employer-employee showdown at the moment seems to show one worker with most of the leverage. It is the negotiation between Wayne Gretzky, a veteran superstar and the game's highest-paid player, and the rookie owners of the Los Angeles Kings, Edward Roski and Philip Anschutz. 
 Gretzky's agent, Michael Barnett, was expected to meet with the owners today in Los Angeles. They will discuss Gretzky's short- and long-term future with the team, including the possibility of a trade before the playoffs this spring to a team that is in contention to win the Stanley Cup. Under terms of the new collective bargaining agreement, Gretzky can become a free agent after this season. He's more than 32 years old -- he turns 35 on Jan. 26 -- and his contract is expiring.
Last night, the Kings said they intend to sign Gretzky to a contract extension and end speculation that the superstar may be traded. "We are prepared to offer a contract extension as early as tomorrow to Gretzky's agent, Mike Barnett, to show our intent to keep him," Kings General Manager Sam McMaster told XTRA radio.
Under the old collective bargaining agreement, Gretzky would have been a restricted free agent. His team would have had either the right to match any salary offer or player compensation from the team that signed him. His mobility and his leverage would have been limited next summer. His power this season would have been nil.
Not so now. In the last two weeks, Barnett and Gretzky have launched an impressive publicity blitz that suggests an auction. Mike Keenan, coach and general manager of the St. Louis Blues, is talking openly of acquiring Gretzky. Toronto, Detroit and the Rangers are also mentioned, with less intensity, as possible bidders. The trading deadline is March 20.
The latest published rumors have him going to St. Louis in a multiplayer deal, with his salary to increase from its current $6.5 million a year to $9 million a year for two seasons after this one.
"Where there's smoke, there's fire," Gretzky said of the reports, published in Toronto.
Bob Goodenow, executive director of the N.H.L. Players Association, said "there is no question that older players have better opportunities" than they used to. But he said he wasn't sure what Gretzky's leverage could create in the immediate future in terms of return in a trade.
"I don't know how much teams are going to give in trade now, when, come August, they can have him for free," Goodenow said.
Along with market forces, Goodenow predicted that Gretzky's next salary would be partly dictated "as a function of where he wants to be." Toronto would seem a good fit, if only because he is from near there and Gretzky might lift this veteran team from good to great.
But the Maple Leafs already sell all their seats. What new income could he generate? The Blues, on the other hand, have empty seats to sell. The Rangers and Madison Square Garden, with their in-house cable television network, could increase ratings and demand for commercial time with one more superstar. But they lead the league in payroll at $31 million.
 
Verbeek Lifts Rangers
 Another player in Wayne Gretzky's situation is Pat Verbeek of the Rangers, who will turn 32 on May 24. He is playing under a contract for $1.75 million after a contentious arbitration before the season. Unlike Gretzky, Verbeek isn't threatening to demand a trade if his team doesn't improve itself quickly to contend for the cup. The Rangers are probably a contender. Their 3-3 tie with the Blues on Sunday night at Madison Square Garden left them with 65 points, best in the Eastern Conference.
By scoring twice Sunday to erase a 3-1 deficit, Verbeek raised his goal total to 32, best on the team and one ahead of Mark Messier. His best total in a career that began in 1982 was the 46 he scored for the Devils in 1987-88. The money Verbeek gets with his free agency this summer will indicate the success or failure of the union strategy of sacrificing bargaining power of young players in exchange for increasing the clout of the veterans.
While Messier played an average game against the Blues, Verbeek surged and even took on a Messier-type duty by yelling at his teammates on the bench.
"You can't always rely on Mess to carry the load every time," Verbeek said.
The Rangers are idle until next Monday night, when they will play host to the Kings. Verbeek, Messier and Brian Leetch will represent the Rangers on the Eastern Conference team at Boston's new Fleet Center in the All-Star Game on Saturday night.

HEADLINE: Mayor Seeks $400 Million For Airports

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
In a new turn in the often stormy relationship between the Port Authority and the Giuliani administration, New York City is pursuing a legal claim for $400 million in back rent for the city's two major airports. But as with many of the recent fights over spending at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the dispute goes much deeper.
To Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson, the fundamental issue is that the city believes that the Port Authority has too often favored New Jersey and not invested enough in projects to improve the New York City economy. Mr. Dyson said that, in particular, the authority should make immediate improvements to Kennedy International Airport. 
 The Port Authority chairman, Lewis M. Eisenberg, said the Authority plans to begin nearly $2 billion in work at Kennedy and La Guardia Airports. But he said the city's claim for back rent was "clouding the process."
"The Port Authority is anxious to sit down with the city and resolve this," Mr. Eisenberg said. "We have billions of dollars set aside and we would like to put it to good use."
The airport lease is set to expire in 2015, and the city and the Authority have been trying to negotiate an extension for several years. The Port Authority, which also runs Newark International Airport, has operated Kennedy and La Guardia airports under a series of leases dating to 1947.
The city, which owns the land under both New York City airports, says the Port Authority has systematically shortchanged New York in the long-term lease for the sites.
"Newark gets $17 million a year in rent, while we get $3 million for two airports," Mr. Dyson said. "Three million dollars equates to two floors on the Empire State Building -- not very high up."
For their part, Port Authority officials say the city's action is making it difficult to move ahead with nearly $2 billion in planned improvements at the two airports.
The city's claim stems from a provision in the lease that says the rent is a portion of the revenue from the airports, with deductions for operations and maintenance costs. The annual rent payments hovered around $80 million in the late 1980's, but dropped to as low as $3 million in 1993. Although the rent increased somewhat in 1994, to $6.2 million, the city ordered a review of the lease payments by its own accounting firm in January 1995.
On Dec. 14, the city served the Port Authority with a demand for arbitration, asserting that the Authority had failed to pay a correct portion of the revenue and had inflated operations costs at both airports. City lawyers have said their review indicated a $400 million shortfall between 1991 and 1994.
A large portion of the city's claim, about $126 million, is based on the Port Authority's decision not to include a special $3-per-passenger fee in Kennedy Airport's general revenue. The fee, a charge approved by the Federal Government, is dedicated solely to airport improvements and by Federal regulation is excluded from use in municipal projects. Port Authority officials say the Federal rules that established the special fee do not allow them to forward any portion of the money to the city.
"This money is very specifically authorized by the people in Washington for specific purposes," said Jeffrey S. Green, general counsel for the Port Authority.
Authority officials said the airport rent decreased after 1990 because the authority made over $1 billion in capital improvements to Kennedy and La Guardia, including roadway work at Kennedy and terminal improvement at La Guardia.
The city has asked the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to arbitrate the rent dispute. And the Authority has asked a judge in State Supreme Court in Manhattan to stop the arbitration.
"This is a small part of a larger issue with the Port Authority," said Mr. Dyson, who is Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development. "Two years ago, when I came into this job, the Mayor asked me to look around. The most frequent complaint I heard from business people was the quite terrible condition of our airports, in particular Kennedy Airport."
In fact, Port Authority officials said the Authority's nearly $2 billion improvement plan for the New York airports includes a new $700 million international arrivals building at the Kennedy airport.

HEADLINE: Old-Style Ward Politics Won For Turkey's Islamic Party

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: KONYA, Turkey, Jan. 11

 BODY:
In its campaign to win votes on the back streets of this provincial Anatolian city, Turkey's pro-Islamic Welfare Party left little to Allah and nothing to chance.
Long before last month's elections, in which this onetime fringe party made the leap to the country's No. 1 vote-getter and earned the chance to try, as yet unsuccessfully, to form a governing coalition, its workers fanned out across Konya's neighborhoods, deployed like soldiers in an old-fashioned, big-city party machine. 
 In the city's Meram area, home to new arrivals from Turkey's fast-emptying countryside, each street has its own six-member Welfare Party team that keeps a close watch on the lives of its inhabitants. The sick, the poor, births, weddings, funerals -- all are grist for the regular reports sent into the party district office and on to city hall, which for the last five years has been occupied by a Mayor from the Welfare Party.
Mayor Halil Urun, a civil engineer with a political manner closer to that of a ward-heeler's than an Islamic fundamentalist's, takes it from there. On any given Sunday, he attends between 10 and 15 weddings, greeting as many as 2,000 voters in a single day. "If you don't say hello to people," he said, in the English he learned during a stint in the United States, "they won't vote for you."
The Welfare Party's approach is not just sound politics; it is practically revolutionary here. While Turkey's traditional parties battled each other for ministerial portfolios in Ankara, the Welfare Party cultivated the grass roots, tapping into the widespread alienation that sent millions of Turks looking for an alternative to a political system they perceive to be inbred, corrupt and insensitive to their problems.
"Even if we don't promise them anything, a simple visit makes people happy," said Muzaffer Bolanyig, a local Welfare Party inspector who figures party workers visited every household in his district, encompassing 14 streets and 40,000 inhabitants. "Until now, no one else had ever visited them."
Mayor Urun's administration -- like those of Welfare Party mayors in Istanbul, Ankara and 22 other Turkish cities -- also has focused on clean streets, cheap bread, tram lines and -- in its one bow to the moral code of Islam -- the closing of local brothels.
On Dec. 24, the Welfare Party -- or Refah as it is called in Turkish -- inched past Turkey's main center-right parties to capture 21.4 percent of the national vote, giving it the largest bloc in the 550-seat Parliament. In the province of Konya, the home base of Necmettin Erbakan, the party's leader, the vote for Welfare was 43 percent, while in the city it was 55 percent and in the city's Meram area 60 percent.
The lure of Islam is part of the party's pitch. But according to local party leaders, it is more of an appeal to a common Muslim heritage, shared by 99 percent of Turkey's 65 million people, than a call to arms against Turkey's 70-year-old secular tradition. They tend to discount Mr. Erbakan's tough antisecular, anti-Western campaign polemics and point instead to his recent, more accommodating statements, made in the days since he was tapped by President Suleyman Demirel to put together a governing coalition.
[On Jan. 13, Welfare failed for a second time to form a coalition Government, The Associated Press reported. After meeting with Mr. Erbakan, Mesut Yilmaz, the leader of center-right Motherland Party, said it would be "unusually difficult" to reconcile the two parties' different political philosophies, though he added that Mr. Erbakan appeared to be softening some of his positions.]
Mayor Urun said that during the campaign, Mr. Erbakan "had to say some extremist things, but now that phase is over and our image will change."
Welfare Party leaders, here and in Ankara, are already resigned to the prospect that Mr. Erbakan's coalition-building efforts will fail, rejected by mainstream politicians fearful of letting Islamists get a foothold in government. And they say they are not sorry because, according to their calculations, the more months -- even years -- they spend in opposition, the stronger their appeal to voters disaffected by a rickety economy, with its high inflation and unemployment.
"If the other parties say they don't want to be seen with us, we will say thank you very much, and give the job back," said Abdullah Gul, deputy party chairman. "We are not supported by big banks, big interests. We are not corrupt, we are not involved in hanky-panky, so our expectations are not personal. We can wait two to three years, and then we will be back, with a big majority."
This message is not lost on the Welfare Party's political rivals, particularly on the local level. After sounding out the electorate, Ahmet Alkan, a newly elected deputy from Konya for the Motherland Party, is now convinced that it would be wiser to let the Welfare Party into a government coalition.
"There are two Turkeys," said Mr. Alkan, 42, a city planner. "The people in Ankara and the media want one thing, and the people want another. If Refah stays in opposition, they will get stronger."
Mr. Alkan and his colleague, Mehmet Kececiler, another Motherland deputy from Konya, do not fear the Welfare Party's pro-Islamic stands. Like many Turks, both men are convinced that Turkey's secular society is too strong to turn the clock back to the days before Ataturk, the republic's revered founder, who stripped the state of its ties to Islam.
But Mr. Kececiler does feel that Turkey should be more sensitive to religious yearnings. If, for instance, religious women were allowed to cover their heads at all Turkish universities, in courtrooms and in public offices where head scarves are still banned, then the Welfare Party would lose one of its most effective slogans, he said.
"Religion is a force all over the world," said Mr. Kececiler. "I am against Refah, but I am not against religion. And issues like the head scarf helped Refah. They used it like a flag."
But others are more wary of the ambitions of the Welfare Party.
"If, as they maintain, the essence of culture is religion and that doesn't change, what does that say about secularism, about Turkishness?" asked one top Government adviser, who insisted on anonymity. "Now what we hear is the sweet talk before the big fight. Once in power, they would use every means to install their ideology at critical points of statecraft."
For many who oppose a Welfare-led coalition, the biggest liability is Mr. Erbakan himself, a wily, witty and obstinate 69-year-old politician who served twice in Turkish coalition Governments in the 1970's. "It is very difficult to deal with Mr. Erbakan," said the official, who worked with him 20 years ago. "It is like a marriage where you have to give all the time and get nothing in return."
Here in Konya, the party's pro-Islamic platform has had little effect on daily life. A new Islamic school opened in 1990. It offers intense religious instruction together with an English-language curriculum. City residents say the popularity of the school owes more to its English-language instruction than to its teaching of the Koran, and it receives fewer applicants than the city's other foreign-language high schools.
"It is exaggerated to think of Refah as a party of fundamentalists," said Hasmet Oyken, managing editor of Yeni Konya, a local newspaper. "Refah was able to reach the population here because Konya is a closed, conservative city, with a low standard of living which fosters a kind of naivete among the people. If Konya were to open up to the wider world, then the influence of Refah would drop."

HEADLINE: Yes, Worry About the Budget Deficit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Budget Myths" (column, Jan. 12): Anthony Lewis blames the ballooning deficits of the 1980's and early 1990's on Presidents Reagan and Bush, ignoring that the Democrats controlled Congress throughout the period.
Mr. Lewis goes on to say that United States tax rates are not high compared with countries like France or Germany. But the countries he lists with higher tax rates than our own have anemic growth and unemployment rates that in some cases exceed 12 percent. Should we really be looking to France as a model for our economy? 
 While the budget deficit may not be the immediate crisis some in Congress would have us believe, it contributes to our country's borrowing needs and is a factor in keeping interest rates high relative to inflation.
It is not fair to characterize Republican budget proposals as aimed "to gut government medical and environmental programs." Let us not forget that the cost of these programs grows at double-digit rates annually while our economy has been growing at slightly better than 2 percent. The Republican proposal, for example, merely slows the projected growth of Medicare and Medicaid spending from 11 percent to 7 percent annually.
Mr. Lewis admonishes us to focus on our "real economic problems," one of which he says is the slowdown of growth and productivity. What are the causes of this slowdown? Heavy taxation, entitlement programs and excessive government meddling in the economy do nothing to spur economic or job growth. And that is not a myth.

HEADLINE: New York's Wage Bill Violates No Principle

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re " 'Living Wages,' Fewer Jobs" (Op-Ed, Jan. 12):
Heather Mac Donald's attack on New York City's living wage bill coincides almost point by point with the Giuliani administration's testimony at two City Council hearings on the bill. 
 Ms. Mac Donald says that the bill would "repeal the law of supply and demand" by requiring companies with city contracts to pay an hourly minimum of $12.10, including benefits, to their workers.
Giuliani administration officials and their scarce supporters on the City Council cited the "supply and demand" argument at both hearings.
New York City -- like most local, state and Federal government entities -- is governed by civil service rules and the Federal minimum wage law. Most of the city's direct employees also belong to unions. No doubt Ms. Mac Donald thinks that civil service rules or union contracts and the minimum wage are improper restraints of supply and demand in labor markets. Does Mr. Giuliani think so?

HEADLINE: Wall Street Looks to Information Revolution

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Clyde Haberman's Jan. 12 column on Wall Street's cynicism toward its maintenance workers is an odd mix of sentiment and outdated impressions.
The downsizing of companies is taking a toll on blue-collar as well as white-collar employees. But it masks the fact that American and international high-tech companies are growing dramatically. 
 A recent meeting of information industry professionals at the new Information Technology Center at 55 Broad Street provided an example of what is happening when more than 1,500 people showed up to sell new products and to see this newly wired building, which is one-third leased after only six months.
Thanks to a major tax incentive program initiated by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and signed into law by Gov. George E. Pataki, the absorption of commercial space downtown has turned positive. Thousands of housing units are also now expected to spur Downtown's emergence as the trendiest new residential neighborhood in the city.
Residential developers have staked their claim to major buildings on Wall and Broad Streets, which are becoming the epicenter of the downtown economy's diversification.
There is no denying the financial industry's loss of jobs since the 1987 stock market crash. But Wall Street is in the midst of a transformation that will place it at the forefront of the information revolution, just as lower Manhattan as a neighborhood will emerge as New York's most exciting area.

HEADLINE: A Flawed Flat Tax and the Way Out

BYLINE: By Patrick J. Buchanan; Patrick J. Buchanan is a candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination.

 BODY:
The flat tax of Steve Forbes seems to have been rooted in the dictum that "what's good for Bohemian Grove is good for America." Indeed, it appears to have been drafted on the back of a menu, after a bibilous evening, with the boys down at the yacht basin.
Under Mr. Forbes's plan, the middle class loses all deductions for home mortgage interest and church contributions; the Federal budget would be thrown scores of billions of dollars deeper into deficit; and lounge lizards in Palm Beach pay a lower tax rate than steelworkers in Youngstown. 
 No wonder the Forbes plan is being toasted from Marin County, Calif., to Hobe Sound, Fla.
Under the Forbes flat tax, should Bill Gates, with a fortune estimated at $12 billion, decide to retire early, he would never again pay a dime in income taxes for the defense of his country. But the men and women who continued to work at Microsoft would have to pay at 17 percent. A tax idea that produces such inequity would be laughed out of Congress -- and not undeservedly.
Once dissected, Mr. Forbes's simplistic version of a flat tax may just bring into terminal ridicule an idea with immense merit and appeal. What should be done with Mr. Forbes's flat tax? It should be taken into the body shop for major overhaul.
First, restore the deductions for mortgage interest and contributions to charities, both of which are rooted in middle class values. Next, exempt from inheritance taxes only estates up to $5 million, covering family farms and family businesses, but keeping some inheritance taxes on the super-rich.
Third, impose "consumption taxes" on the imports of foreign nations that steal our intellectual property and impose tariffs on our goods, or, like Japan, use non-tariff barriers to run up annual $65 billion trade surpluses at our expense. Further, impose an "equalization tax" on the imports of third world countries where wage rates are so far beneath those of the United States that they have become meccas for transnational corporations eager to off-load their American workers on the junk heap of the "global economy," and hire Asians at a tenth the price. Corporations that close factories here, and open them up abroad, should pay a price of re-admission to get their goods back into the United States.
And every dollar of those tariff revenues should be used to cut taxes on American small businesses, which have been hiring the workers who have been riffed and fired in the millions by the corporations that provide the munificent ad revenues for Forbes Magazine.
The problem with the Forbes flat tax is that it is grounded in the idea that the best way to feed the sparrows is to first feed the horses. But we have entered a new world. What is good for General Motors is no longer good for America, if General Motors is shutting down plants in Michigan and Ohio, and opening them up outside Mexico City.
All four Presidents on Mt. Rushmore were economic nationalists. All four believed it was the duty of the national Government to produce policies that led to the economic independence of the United States, the industrial supremacy of the American nation, and the highest standard of living in the world for American workers.
The true measure of economic success is not whether America's gross domestic product is setting records, but whether the standard of living of America's middle class is steadily rising. And today, it is not. The middle class finds itself on a slippery slope, losing its grip on the American dream.
The great disputed province of American politics is this angry, alienated middle class that believes, not without justification, that its Government is run by and for powerful special interests who buy their influence with envelopes of PAC money. They are right. The Republican Party will not win them back with a "flat tax" that says David Rockefeller has paid his last dime into the Treasury of the United States.

Providence, R.I., is getting a $375 million shopping mall after nine years of planning.

BYLINE: By Susan Diesenhouse 

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I.

 BODY:
THE development of a regional shopping mall in downtown Providence, nine years in planning, has moved into the site-preparation phase after final approval from the city.
The $375 million project will have 1.2 million square feet of shopping space designed to link the State Capitol with the municipal offices, shops and restaurants of downtown. The Providence Place Mall, as it will be known, has already received lease commitments for 675,000 square feet of retail space. 
 "This will bring retail back to southeast New England and jobs to Providence -- 3,000 construction jobs and 2,800 permanent jobs," said Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr. "This is the linchpin in the downtown redevelopment we started 15 years ago."
Since the 1980's, a 40-acre Capital Center District established by the state has been administered by the Capital Center Commission, a quasi-governmental agency. With the use of Federal highway funds, the agency rechanneled the Woonasquatucket, Moshassuck and Providence Rivers to build a park called Waterplace, which opened in July 1994.
The state has also offered tax incentives and long-term ground leases, which encouraged the construction of two office buildings, an apartment building, a Westin Hotel, a new rail station and a road connecting two highways that run through the city -- I-95 and I-195.
The developer of the mall's 13.2-acre site is the Providence Place Group. Its majority partner, Robert J. Congel, has been a partner in 19 malls developed by the Pyramid Companies of Syracuse. The leasing partner is Peter C. Steingraber, also of Syracuse. The managing partner is J. Daniel Lougash of Dover, Mass., who helped develop malls in the area, and the project director is Richard W. Duggan 3d.
Financing for Providence Place is coming from state, city and private sources. The Fleet Bank will provide a $210 million construction loan, Mr. Lougash said.
Last November, the state agreed to defray the cost of an $80 million, 4,000-car parking garage. It passed legislation that allows the developer to retain two-thirds of the revenues from not more than a total of $5.5 million in state sales tax revenue over the next 15 years to help pay debt service.
The state also passed a law to permit the city to sign a property tax agreement with the developer. The city used the authorization to permit the Providence Place Group to collect property taxes from the mall tenants and use it to offset debt service. To repay the city over 30 years, the developer will eventually turn over about $9 million in mall revenues, Mr. Duggan said.
The Economic Development Corporation, the state agency that owns the land, will sign a 99-year ground lease with the developer. So far, the developer has invested $23 million.
Leases have been signed with three anchor stores. In December 1994, Filene's signed on for 200,000 square feet and Lord & Taylor for 120,000 square feet. Both are units of the May Department Stores Company. In November, Nordstrom signed for 200,000 square feet.
The red-brick mall will have three shopping levels and a nine-floor parking building, with four of the floors below ground. The project was designed by Friedrich St. Florian, a professor of architecture at the Rhode Island School of Design and the architectural firm of ADD Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. The New York firm of Philip Johnson Ritchie & Fiore will manage the architectural consultants and do the construction drawings. The mall is to open for Christmas 1997.
Providence Place will provide a pedestrian bridge to the Westin Hotel that opened early in 1995, have a shuttle bus and a connection to a future rail extension.
"We really need this," one pedestrian said on a recent chilly day. "Providence is a retail ghost town."

HEADLINE: One First Lady to Another

BYLINE: By Blanche Wiesen Cook; Blanche Wiesen Cook, a professor of history at John Jay College, is author of "Eleanor Roosevelt, Volume I."

DATELINE: EAST HAMPTON, N.Y.

 BODY:
Until recently, Eleanor Roosevelt was unrivaled as the most criticized, ridiculed and reviled First Lady. Every speech, every step and every new hairstyle was held up for scrutiny and judgment. Every penny she made was counted and condemned.
No wonder Hillary Rodham Clinton once said she tries to hear Mrs. Roosevelt's voice when she needs advice. 
 Shortly after her 50th birthday, Mrs. Roosevelt experimented with lipstick and a new shade of nail polish. That bit of vanity got the attention of the press. Time magazine ran a picture of Mrs. Roosevelt's new manicure, overshadowing its accompanying story about her visit to homeless sharecroppers in California. It even quoted a migrant woman on her new nails: " 'My, ain't they nice! . . . . She's nice-looking, too -- just as homey as we are.' "
Her political activism, however, was what really made people angry. Mrs. Clinton's cause is, or was, health care. Mrs. Roosevelt's was housing.
In 1934, she championed Arthurdale, an experiment in sustainable community for unemployed families in West Virginia. With friends, she privately financed Arthurdale's school and health clinic and insisted that the new houses have indoor plumbing, root cellars, gardens and livestock. Arthurdale engendered nothing but contempt and was considered a costly failure to everyone but the First Lady and its residents.
Much of her political work was made possible by her paid work. Mrs. Roosevelt was determined to earn what her husband earned as President: $75,000 a year. Through her own writing and radio programs, sponsored by companies like Sweetheart soap, Simmons mattresses and Johns-Manville building materials, she succeeded.
Time magazine wrote: "An indignant citizen once figured that Mrs. Roosevelt got $3,000 for six minutes on the air, [and] said nobody could be worth $500 a minute."
These radio sponsorships confounded even her supporters. She wrote a friend that mail on the subject was divided: half felt she betrayed her principles, besmirched her station and were disappointed; the other half felt she betrayed her principles and besmirched her station, and were glad.
But the criticism did not sway her. "My own income is extremely small and has been cut to about one-third of what it was before the Depression," she wrote. "If I did not do work of some kind much of what I am able to do now would have to be given up."
Odd as it may sound, an activist First Lady had more support in the 1930's. There was an organized movement for better health care, affordable housing and education; reformers were active and appreciated.
In June 1936, during a breakfast in her honor given by the Women's Democratic Committee, Mrs. Roosevelt had words of wisdom for politically active women: "You cannot take anything personally. You cannot bear grudges. . . . You have to take defeat over and over again and pick up and go on. Be sure of your facts. Argue the other side with a friend until you have found the answer to every point which might be brought up against you."

HEADLINE: Pataki Brokers Timber Deal, Pleasing Longtime Foes

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
For the second time in two months, Gov. George E. Pataki has brought together longtime antagonists on an environmental issue and produced a plan that everyone appears to like.
Yesterday, his administration issued a revised permit allowing private landowners in the Adirondack Park to cut down tracts of forest damaged by a freak windstorm that pummeled the Vermont-size park in July. 
 But unlike an earlier version of the permit -- which was assailed by environmentalists in November -- the final "Governor's rewrite," in the words of Timothy J. Burke, an Adirondack environmentalist, should insure that the timber harvest on private lands will not harm adjacent public wilderness.
For 100 years, striking such a balance has been a major challenge for state officials.
The permit has also passed muster with timber and paper companies, as well, which can now begin harvesting trees that had lain for months where they fell.
"You have to give the Governor credit for dealing with this natural disaster pragmatically, and at the same time accommodating legitimate concerns about good forestry and environmental protection," said Robert S. Stegemann, a spokesman for International Paper, a Purchase, N.Y., company that has 305,000 acres of forest in the Adirondacks and is the area's -- and the state's -- largest private landowner. About 3,000 acres of the company's forests were damaged, he said.
Mr. Pataki said yesterday: "This shows that if you work hard to find common ground, you can meld the interests of the private sector and the need to keep the public trust."
Last November, Mr. Pataki's administration helped broker a deal to protect New York City's upstate watersheds that won praise from both environmentalists and upstate officials, who had long opposed regulations they feared might limit economic development.
Debate over logging in the Adirondack Park broke out in the wake of the intense mid-summer storm that toppled millions of trees and killed five people. Landowners appealed to the Adirondack Park Agency to drop normal paperwork requirements and allow the quick salvage of fallen timber before it rotted.
A blanket permit was prepared that would have allowed any landowner who claimed to have suffered damage to at least one of three trees to clearcut an affected tract.
But environmentalists threatened to sue the Park Agency because the permit would have allowed unsupervised cutting on steep slopes and in wetlands. In a park that consists of a complicated mosaic of private and public holdings, they said, erosion and logging-road construction on private land could damage wetlands, streams and forests on public lands.
Two days before the permit was to be issued in November, Mr. Pataki ordered the agency staff to pull it back and make changes that addressed the environmentalists' concerns.
Environmentalists joined with paper and logging companies yesterday in hailing the result. "The Governor has found the middle ground between protecting the critical resources of the park and the legitimate needs of landowners," said Sarah Meyland, executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment.
Under the revised permit, state foresters will inspect any proposed salvage site in a wetland, clearcutting will not be allowed on steep slopes and trees must be winched from slopes, not dragged across the forest floor. Also, permanent roads cannot be built in wetlands .
Gregory A. Hill, assistant director of the Park Agency, said the revisions were aided by satellite photographs that have pinpointed areas of heavy and moderate forest damage. With the images, state foresters can corroborate damage reports mailed in by landowners, he said. Despite landowners' fears that the downed timber would rot, he said it appeared that the cold weather and heavy snow have helped preserve it. The Park Agency has estimated that up to 15,000 acres of private forest were damaged badly enough to justify clearcutting, or stripping the land of all trees.
A separate dispute -- over the fate of fallen trees in the park's preserves, deemed "forever wild" under the State Constitution -- is close to being resolved, the Governor said yesterday. Forest ecologists had said the wind damage was part of the natural flow of life in the wilderness, but state firefighters had wanted to clear the timber to minimize the risk of future forest fires.
Governor Pataki said the final result will most likely be limited salvage of preserve timber where the fire risk might threaten nearby communities. "We're inclined to do the minimum consistent with public safety," he said. A final plan will be presented to his office later this week, state environmental officials said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up, Fed by Anticipation Of European Interest-Rate Cuts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar strengthened against the major currencies yesterday, reaching nearly four-month highs against the German mark and Swiss franc on rising expectations that European interest rates would decline.
Traders said the rally gained momentum after German monetary officials said this week that there might be a need for lower rates in their country. 
 The demand for dollars intensified with the publication of a Swiss newspaper interview with the president of the Swiss central bank, Markus Lusser, who complained of a strong Swiss franc and unsatisfactory economic growth.
By late yesterday in New York, the dollar sold for 1.4638 marks, up from 1.4465 marks on Monday, and 1.1794 Swiss francs, up from 1.1655 Monday. Both dollar rates were the the highest since Sept. 19.
The dollar also gained against the Japanese yen, ending the day at 105.82 yen, up from 105.20 on Monday. It has been slowly rising against the yen for months and has not traded at this level since February 1994.
Traders said the primary motivation for dollar buying stemmed from the view that European economies were weakening and would require lower interest rates to stimulate growth. Lower rates tend to diminish a currency's appeal to investors.
The president of the German central bank, or Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, set the mood for yesterday's trading with remarks late Monday that lower rates might be needed because the growth in the German money supply had been anemic in 1995.
Another prominent German monetary official, Helmut Hesse, president of the regional reserve bank in Bremen state, added to rate-cut speculation yesterday after the German financial news agency VWD quoted him as saying that the Bundesbank might need to trim rates if money growth did not accelerate.
Traders said this strengthened a belief that interest rates would have to come down in Europe before they fell in the United States, where signs of economic sluggishness have also aroused speculation on lower rates.
Other late dollar rates in New York yesterday, compared with late Monday, included: 5.0014 French francs, up from 4.9585 francs; 1,577.5 Italian lire, up from 1,574 lire, and 1.3684 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3630. The British pound was quoted at $1.5360, down from $1.5460.

HEADLINE: Housing Gains as Economic Data Rebound

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
The first in an avalanche of statistics on the economy showed today that home building was buoyant in November throughout much of the country. But in the Northeast, building slumped to its lowest pace in nearly two years.
Builders broke ground on new homes at a 1.42 million annual clip in the month, 5.7 percent higher than in October, according to the Commerce Department report, which had been scheduled for Dec. 19. The gain was entirely in multifamily dwellings, and compares with starts in October that were revised downward. 
 The figures did little to clear the fog that has enveloped the economy as the main Government statistical mills shut down for almost five of the last eight weeks because of the budget stalemate and the East Coast snowstorm.
But by this week's end, analysts will have mounds of fresh material to work over as the Labor and Commerce Departments bring out delayed tallies of jobs, foreign trade, sales of new homes, applications for unemployment insurance, export and import prices and an updated estimate of the gross domestic product for the third quarter of 1995.
Friday's report on the G.D.P. will be accompanied by a comprehensive revision of national income and product accounts for 1959 through the second quarter of 1995. In addition, the Federal Reserve, which was affected only by the blizzard, will report on industrial production and on the results of its periodic regional economic survey.
And the Conference Board, which has taken over from the Commerce Department compilation of the leading economic index, is to publish this predictive indicator, delayed from Dec. 29., on Wednesday.
Still, economists said, it will be hard to tell with any confidence whether the economy has slowed just enough to please policy makers and financial markets or whether it has weakened markedly while economic observation was so obscured.
"Even the more timely numbers will have limited information value since they will be distorted by the effects of the shutdown and the weather," James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan, told clients over the weekend.
Eugene J. Sherman, chief economist at M. A. Schapiro, said that despite the lack of evidence, he thought the economy was probably doing O.K.
"I think there's a basic undertone of strength," he said, adding that corporate investment and exports would provide enough support to offset lethargy among consumers.
In fact, he said, reports of a disappointing holiday season may be more a reflection of overbuilding by retailers and greater use of mail and phone shopping than a serious cutback in overall consumer spending.
Today's housing report found that builders started 1,102,000 single-family homes in November, the same pace as October's, while apartment houses and other multiunit buildings jumped by 77,000 at an annual rate.
Starts climbed 14.5 percent in the South, by far the most active region, and 13 percent in the Midwest. But they eased 5.4 percent in the West and tumbled 22.9 percent in the Northeast.
A Commerce Department aide, who said the Northeast's starts were the lowest since January 1994, could cite no reason for the drop.
Permits for new homes, meanwhile, rose 3.2 percent, to a 1,428,000 annual pace.
Joseph Blalock, senior financial economist for America's Community Bankers, a trade group for savings and loans, predicted that home building would decline about 7 percent in 1996, to about 1,275,000 units, with job worries looming larger than the affordability of housing.
Separately, the Commerce Department disclosed that it had managed with weekend overtime to equip workers around the country with the means to conduct its Current Population Survey this week. This, in turn, will allow the Labor Department to issue the employment report for January as originally scheduled, on Feb. 2. Last week, officials said the January employment report would probably be delayed.
The Labor Department confirmed today that the jobs report for December will be issued this Friday and said its reports on producer and consumer prices for last month are scheduled for Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, respectively. The Employment Cost Index, a quarterly tabulation, is now scheduled for Feb. 13.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
30-Year Bond Yields 6.05% After Rally

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities surged yesterday, supported by a stronger dollar, which makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors; by lower oil prices, and by reports of weak retail sales.
Another upbeat factor among bond traders was the resumption of Government economic reports after the partial Government shutdown, but market participants remained focused on the budget negotiations, which resume today. Analysts note that yields have moved up considerably in recent weeks as hopes for a deal have faded, so if any encouraging news emerges this week, there could be renewed buying. 
 The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 1 11/32, to 111 8/32, bringing the yield to 6.05 percent, down from 6.14 percent on Friday (The market was closed Monday for the holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.) For investors, it meant that every $1,000 of bonds they owned rose $13.44 in value.
Weak retail reports encouraged the buying of bonds. The Mitsubishi Bank/Schroder Wertheim chain-store index declined 1 percent for the week that ended Saturday. The report underscored continuing economic weakness and low inflation, forcing some speculators to enter the market and buy to cover their bets that bond prices would decline. The other retail report, the Johnson Redbook, released in the afternoon showed a decline of nine-tenths of 1 percent for the first two weeks of January, compared with December levels.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said yesterday's release of two other reports, the November housing starts, which were up 5.7 percent, and building permits, up 2.3 percent, had little impact. "The market yawned after the release of the statistics because the results were both largely expected and not very current," he said.
The statistics scheduled for release today -- the trade balance for October and the index of leading indicators for November (minus three of its components) -- are also outdated, he said, but that will not be the case for the Federal Reserve's "beige book" report on business conditions.
"For the most part," Mr. Fine said, "the beige book is usually a rehash of much of the data seen during three months prior to its release, but this time around there was little data released during that period, and as a result, the beige book looms larger than usual."
Some of the information will be anecdotal, he said, but "it will be the most comprehensive source of overall business activity available, and the market's reaction may well be stronger than normal."
"The second blizzard of 1996," Mr. Fine said, "will occur at precisely 8:30 A.M. Friday morning, when the Labor Department will release December's employment report while at the same time the Commerce Department will release revised, benchmarked G.D.P. statistics on the new chain-weight basis.
"This avalanche of numbers should keep everyone busy, with the employment report, as usual, being the major determinant of future market direction."
The market consensus for the number of jobs added in December is somewhere between 125,000 and 150,000. Mr. Fine's own estimate is more than 150,000.
Hamilton Davis, a vice president of government trading at Everen Securities Inc. in Chicago, attributed yesterday's buying in part to George Soros, one of Wall Street's most influential investors, who encouraged Japanese money managers to buy United States Treasury securities yesterday. Bonds initially gained about half a point in overseas trading after Mr. Soros told Japanese managers a resilient dollar and higher interest rates would make Treasuries a good investment this year.
Mr. Hamilton also said that the still-strong European bond markets were also pulling the market higher. "Besides, the market is in a mood that if data show strength, it will ignore it, and if it shows weakness, it will believe it," he said.
At yesterday's regular weekly auction of bills, the three- and six-month bills drew good investor demand at an average discount rate of 5.02 percent and 4.93 percent, respectively. Traders said retail demand was healthy.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: Mayoral Aide Lowers Estimate on Property Tax Revenue

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration's rosy projections of an increase in property tax revenues turned grayer yesterday, increasing New York City's budget gap for the coming fiscal year and raising the likelihood of still deeper cuts in city spending.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's new budget director, Joseph J. Lhota, said the administration had overestimated revenues from property taxes -- the city's largest source of revenues -- by $165 million to $180 million for the fiscal year that begins in July. 
 The total taxable value of the city's real estate -- and thus the revenues -- remained relatively stable, although a slight decrease is expected once property owners conclude their challenges to the new assessments. The Mayor's office, however, had projected an increase of 1.62 percent and based its budget assumptions for the coming fiscal year on it.
The new, lower projection compounds the Mayor's difficulties in balancing the city's next budget. The city already faces steadily rising costs and a less than robust economy, coupled with shortfalls in aid from Albany and Washington.
The Mayor's aides have acknowledged a projected gap of $1.4 billion for the next fiscal year; the shortfall in anticipated property tax revenues means the gap has increased to nearly $1.6 billion, or nearly 5 percent of the total budget of $32.8 billion.
But the state's Financial Control Board recently estimated the gap to be at least $1.8 billion, while Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi's office has said it could reach $2.3 billion. Neither projection includes the new shortfall in property taxes.
Kurt A. Richwerger, deputy director of the City Council's finance department, said the shortfall in property tax revenues could in fact be as high as $212 million, widening the budget gap still more. "It makes a painful situation even worse -- and more difficult to deal with," Mr. Richwerger said.
Yesterday's announcement underscored the extent of the city's financial woes. In his first two years in office, the Mayor has had to close budget gaps of $2.3 billion and $3.1 billion, mostly by reducing spending on welfare and Medicaid and by cutting spending for city agencies.
By the end of the month, Mr. Giuliani is expected to unveil his preliminary plan for dealing with a third straight budget crunch. Moreover, the city still faces a shortfall in the current fiscal year, which fiscal monitors warn could total $750 million or even more in the city's $32 billion budget.
The Mayor has already ordered the city's agencies to cut $200 million, or 18 percent, of spending on expenses not related to staff salaries. Mr. Giuliani had also planned a refinancing of the city's debt to raise $157 million to plug that hole, but Mr. Hevesi used his powers as the Comptroller to block the plan, saying it would hurt the city's finances in the long run.
Neither the Mayor nor his aides have said exactly how they intend to close the gaps. For the new year, the Mayor has only proposed $500 million in cuts to agencies and $675 million in additional help from the state, though the city appears unlikely to receive that amount given Gov. George E. Pataki's budget proposals.
The report of a drop in property tax revenues came as the city's Department of Finance announced its annual assessments of property values, showing a lingering stagnation in most parts of the real estate market from the downturn of the early 1990's.
In general, property values remained relatively stable, reflecting a bottoming out of the decline in the early 1990's, according to the Mayor's Commissioner of Finance, Alfred C. Cerullo 3d. "There may not be anywhere else for the market to go," he said.
The assessments showed a decline in values for commercial properties, including those for office buildings, signaling a continued stagnation in the real estate market in Manhattan. On the positive side, Mr. Cerullo noted increased values for stores outside of Manhattan and for hotels; he attributed the latter to the city's reduction in the hotel occupancy tax.
The assessed value of co-ops, condos and rentals also declined slightly, while that of one-, two- or three-family homes increased slightly, meaning those homeowners can expect higher tax bills.
The city's property tax revenues last year totaled $7.87 billion, or nearly a quarter of the total revenues. The city had projected an increase in the coming year to $7.99 billion; with Mr. Lhota's revision, those revenues are expected to be $7.81 billion to $7.83 billion.

HEADLINE: Blinder Plans To Leave Post As Fed's No. 2

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Alan S. Blinder has told the White House that he will leave as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve when his term ends in two weeks, Fed officials said yesterday.
Mr. Blinder, who was named to the Fed in June 1994, has been the chief voice within the nation's central bank for lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy. His departure comes at a moment when the economy appears to be weakening. The Fed's control of short-term interest rates gives it powerful leverage to try to stem any such weakness, which could become an issue in this election year. 
 The letter announcing Mr. Blinder's decision, sent to the White House yesterday, ended speculation that President Clinton might try to keep Mr. Blinder in place as the Administration's most influential appointee to the Federal Reserve.
Mr. Blinder, a widely respected academic economist from Princeton University, was Mr. Clinton's first appointee to the Federal Reserve's seven-member board of governors. There was some talk at the time that Mr. Blinder, who served on the White House's Council of Economic Advisers in 1993 and early 1994, would eventually be the President's choice to replace Alan Greenspan as chairman. Mr. Greenspan's current term ends in March.
The Republican Congressional victory in 1994 put an end to White House hopes that Mr. Blinder -- often regarded on Wall Street as too willing to tolerate some inflation to keep the economy growing -- could ever gain Senate approval to replace Mr. Greenspan. Recently, however, Administration officials had considered asking the Republican Senate to approve Mr. Blinder's reappointment as vice chairman as part of a package deal that would give Mr. Greenspan another term as chairman.
Mr. Blinder is expected to announce his departure today. A White House spokeswoman would not comment, saying it was up to Mr. Blinder to make public any announcement that he is leaving the Fed at month's end.
Wall Street, which traditionally prefers strong anti-inflationary policies from the Fed, is expected to be glad to see Mr. Blinder leave. "The constituency for easy money -- low rates -- at the Fed has just lost one of its most outspoken champions," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company.
In his letter, Mr. Blinder, who is 50, is said to have told Mr. Clinton that he must return to Princeton at the end of this month, when his Federal Reserve term expires. By law, he could have remained as vice chairman until Mr. Clinton appointed and the Senate approved a replacement. But by failing to return to Princeton now, he would risk losing his tenured position as an economics professor.
Mr. Blinder often said that he intended to return to Princeton, from which he has been on leave for three years, all of it spent working in the Clinton Administration. For a while, though, he considered giving up teaching for a career in Washington, an alternative now discarded.
His departure leaves two unfilled seats among the seven Fed governors. John P. LaWare, who had been named by President George Bush, resigned last year, and Mr. Clinton's attempt to appoint Alicia H. Munnell, a Treasury official, as Mr. LaWare's replacement met a storm of protest in Congress. The White House never formally submitted her name, sending Ms. Munnell instead to the Council of Economic Advisers.
That was more than six months ago, and the White House has made no new attempt to fill the Fed vacancy. Now Mr. Clinton will have two positions to fill, though it is not clear whether he can win Senate confirmation this year for any new member in Mr. Blinder's mold.
Within the next few weeks, Mr. Clinton is widely expected to announce the reappointment of Mr. Greenspan, who faces little opposition in Congress, to a third term as the Fed's chairman.
In addition to Mr. Blinder, Mr. Clinton had also placed Janet L. Yellen, an economist on leave from the University of California at Berkeley, on the Fed board. But he has never been able to tilt the balance of power toward his appointees.
If Ms. Munnell had become a Fed governor, three Democrats might have changed the equation, leading to greater pressure for lower interest rates than Mr. Greenspan might have preferred. The remaining governors, including Mr. Greenspan, were appointed by Mr. Bush or President Ronald Reagan, and fell readily in line with the chairman's views of what should be done.
Not that Mr. Blinder was so far apart from Mr. Greenspan. On basic issues, such as how rapidly the economy could expand or how much the unemployment rate could fall without creating shortages that would push up inflation, the two men did not really differ that much. More than anything, when Mr. Blinder argued at Fed policy meetings for lower rates, as he did late last year, or resisted rate increases, as he did in the fall of 1994, he did so because he sometimes saw less danger of inflation than Mr. Greenspan and more risk of recession.
Whatever the differences, they were not so great that Mr. Blinder ever went so far as to vote against Mr. Greenspan in the Fed's policymaking meetings. Such a dissent would have drawn headlines and roiled the bond market.
The Fed last cut rates, by a quarter-point, on Dec. 19. Mr. Blinder's decision to leave means that he will not participate at the Fed's Jan. 30 and 31 policy-making meeting. But with inflation low and the economy showing some signs of weakening, bond traders are betting that the Fed, with or without Mr. Blinder, will lower interest rates another half-point or so in the coming months.

HEADLINE: In Iowa, It's Organizing vs. Advertising

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Presidential politics may have lost its romance, but the Iowa caucuses are still the stuff of legend.
In other states, Presidential hopefuls rely on television advertising to bring supporters out. In Iowa, it is organization that counts the most. 
 Or so the legend goes.
In the last few months, Republican Presidential candidates have been waging the longest, costliest media battle in Iowa caucus history. Instead of starting after New Year's, as they have in the past, some candidates this time began advertising way back in July. And in recent weeks Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate, has by virtue of advertising alone -- he has almost no organization in the state -- managed to fight his way into second place in the polls, behind Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.
By now many political analysts, including even some longtime caucus participants, are questioning whether the Iowa legend can survive another election cycle.
"All the evidence I've seen indicates that Iowa's becoming much more a media event," said Bill Mayer, a professor of political science at Northeastern University who has studied Presidential caucuses. "And if Forbes does really well, it does away with the myth that you need organization in Iowa."
Keith Uhl, a Des Moines lawyer who has worked on several Presidential campaigns, most recently the abortive bid for the Republican nomination by Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said, "I think it's been gradually changing, and it's truly changed this time."
There are still plenty of people, a good number of them Iowans, who maintain that nothing has changed. Advertising, this group says, can never replace personal contact as the way to pull voters out to the caucuses, which this year are on Feb. 12.
"This is retail politics," said Harlan D. Hockenberg, a Des Moines lawyer who was active in Ronald Reagan's campaigns. "I don't think anything materially has changed about the attitude of the voters or how you reach them."
Many Iowans also note that the flip side of a strong showing by Mr. Forbes that challenges the notion that organization counts would be a weak showing by him that bolsters it. And they argue that the Forbes campaign is more an anomaly than an indication of any trend, because very few candidates have Mr. Forbes's personal wealth.
Since Mr. Forbes is spending his own money and not taking any Federal matching money, he is not subject to the state-by-state spending limits that constrain other candidates' advertising. In Iowa, the spending limit is $1 million. The Forbes campaign has refused to say how much it is spending here, but rival campaigns estimate the figure at close to $2 million.
"Forbes is trying to reinvent the way you win the Iowa caucuses," said Brian Kennedy, chairman of Iowa's Republican Party. "But there's a structural impediment to anybody repeating that. There's just not that many billionaires."
Still, even before Mr. Forbes came on the scene there were indications that the Iowa legend was increasingly being viewed as just that, at least by the Washington-based consultants who tend to run national campaigns.
Advisers to Gov. Pete Wilson of California, for example, said that they, too, had been planning to rely mainly on advertising in Iowa if Mr. Wilson had not dropped out of the race early for lack of cash.
"The Forbes strategy is actually the Wilson strategy with money," one Wilson adviser said.
The reason many Iowans still see organization as pivotal is that the caucuses are high-commitment events. Unlike primaries, where voters come and go at will and register their choices in private, caucuses require an evening to register a preference, and voters must be willing to make their choices known to friends and neighbors.
Those Iowans who maintain that organization is crucial often cite the 1988 caucuses as proof. The surprise of the Republican caucuses that year was the unexpectedly strong showing by Pat Robertson, which was attributed almost entirely to his vigorous grass-roots support among Christian conservatives. But there was also another lesson to be drawn from the 1988 caucuses, and that is the lesson many in Washington seem to remember.
For years leading up to the caucuses, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, had been running a conventional Iowa campaign, visiting all of the state's 99 counties and even installing his wife in the state full time. Yet he appeared to be going nowhere -- until his television advertising campaign went on the air.
"The exit poll showed that the Gephardt campaign personally contacted more Iowa caucus-goers than any other campaign," said Bill Carrick, a Democratic consultant who worked on the Gephardt campaign. "At the same time, I don't think we could have won without the media lift.
"There's no question paid media has become more important each cycle in Iowa."
In 1992, there was virtually no contest in Iowa because one of the state's Senators, Tom Harkin, was running for the Democratic nomination and the other candidates conceded the state to him.
This time around, advertising in Iowa began with unprecedentedly early purchases of television time during the summer by two Republicans, former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Morry Taylor, a wealthy businessman.
Hugh Winebrenner, dean of the College of Business and Public Administration at Drake University and an expert on the Iowa primaries, was so struck by the amount of advertising this year that he decided to see how it compared with previous election cycles. Since there are no central records of how much money candidates spent on advertising in the state, he looked at the books of one Iowa television station, WHO, the Des Moines NBC affiliate.
In 1988, he found, candidates for both the Democratic and Republican nominations spent a total of $189,000 at WHO, all of it after Jan. 1. This time, candidates for the Republican nomination had spent $281,000 just through the end of December. And the Iowa Democratic Party had spent $64,000 on advertisements touting President Clinton's budget.
Even accounting for inflation, Mr. Winebrenner said, "there is much more television money being spent." He quickly added that he did not think advertising alone could overcome organizational deficiencies.
"If you look at this historically, no candidate has ever done well in Iowa without an organization," he said.
According to many neutral observers, Mr. Dole has the most formidable organization in Iowa, followed by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas.
By far the most innovative attempt to build an organization has been Mr. Taylor's. Recently, he sent questionnaires to 100,000 Iowa Republicans offering those who sent the form back a chance to win $5,000. Five lucky winners are to be chosen on Feb. 5; the rest can simply look forward to calls from his campaign.
Mr. Forbes, too, has been trying to build an organization here through direct mail and professional phone banks. According to his organization director, Chip Carter, he now has coordinators in about a quarter of Iowa's counties.
Mr. Winebrenner said that because of Mr. Forbes's limited organization, he was skeptical that the publisher would come in second in Iowa, despite recent polls suggesting that he will.
But if Mr. Forbes does end up in second, Mr. Winebrenner acknowledged, "then all of us who have been at this for the last 15 years will have to rethink what we're doing."

HEADLINE: Fourth-Quarter Results Cap Off the Best Year Ever for the Nation's Big Banks

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The nation's biggest banks capped off their best year ever -- reporting sharply higher operating profits yesterday for the fourth quarter -- as nearly everything went right. Revenue from loans and fees rose faster than costs, while the levels of bad loans continued to be relatively low.
This year, the banks' fortunes may be weakened somewhat, analysts said, by falling interest rates, which will depress profit margins on loans, and by increased losses on loans to consumers. 
 The big New York money center banks -- Citicorp, the Chemical Banking Corporation and the Chase Manhattan Corporation -- beat analysts' expectations. Profits were up at big regional banks, including Nationsbank, First Chicago NBD and Banc One, but these banks earned less than analysts expected, largely because loan losses increased.
"The money centers are doing very well because the credit picture is better than people expected," said Ronald I. Mandle, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
The biggest worry for bank stock investors remains the rise in bad loans to consumers, especially through credit cards. Citicorp, the nation's largest credit card issuer, said losses increased slightly, to 3.77 percent of receivables from 3.70 percent in the third quarter. Losses were similarly modest at Chemical and Chase. But at First Chicago, credit card losses increased to 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter from 4 percent in the third quarter.
"Credit cards will be a bigger problem for regional banks than money centers because the regionals have been growing quickly but don't have the experience," said David S. Berry, research director at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. "Next year the regionals will benefit from lower deposit insurance premiums, but it will be hard for them to maintain momentum in revenue."
Falling interest rates will hurt the banks, Mr. Berry said, because they cannot lower the interest paid on deposits as fast as they will have to cut rates on loans. Loan losses, he predicted, will also increase. The money center banks, with more international operations, will be hurt less by lower rates, he said.
Accordingly, share prices of the New York banks outpaced regional bank stocks yesterday. Citicorp rose 7.5 percent; Chemical, 7.1 percent; Chase, 6.8 percent; Banc One, 4.2 percent; First Chicago NBD, 4.6 percent, and Nationsbank, 0.6 percent.
In its final quarter as the biggest bank in the country -- because of the pending Chemical-Chase merger -- Citicorp beat analysts' expectations of earning $1.65 a share in the fourth quarter, reporting $905 million, or $1.89 a share. Citicorp's profits declined by 13 percent from a year earlier because it had used up tax breaks accumulated from its real estate losses in the early 1990's.
Before taxes, Citicorp's earnings rose 17 percent, to $1.44 billion from $1.23 billion.
Citicorp's decision to favor business with consumers, rather than corporations, was evident in the quarter. Its consumer profits rose 18 percent, to $544 million, led by the activities in the United States and Europe. Profits from corporate banking and trading fell by 9 percent, to $382 million.
Citicorp also said that it had increased its quarterly per-share dividend to 45 cents from 30 cents, restoring it to a level higher than in 1990, the peak before it started to cut back to preserve capital to cover bad real estate loans.
Now flush with capital and averse to making acquisitions, Citicorp is using its profits for dividends and to buy back its stock. The company said yesterday that six months into a two-year program to buy back $3 billion in stock, it had bought $1.5 billion worth. As a result, the program was increased to $4.5 billion.
Since other United States banks will continue to make acquisitions, John S. Reed, Citicorp's chairman, told analysts yesterday that Citicorp's relative position would continue to fall.
"We assume that in the foreseeable future we will end up as No. 4, 5 or 6 in terms of size," he said. Mr. Reed defended Citicorp's strategy, contending that the emphasis on international consumer banking, for which the bank has little competition, will earn a higher stock market value than if it made acquisitions in the crowded regional banking or investment banking businesses.
Chemical earned $490 million in the quarter, up 170 percent from a year earlier, but the earlier quarter included a $152 million charge to pay for cost-cutting initiatives. Chemical's operating earnings were up 48 percent for the quarter. And the earnings of $1.81 a share were well above the $1.61 analysts expected.
Chemical reported a gain of $25 million in the fourth quarter from the sale of half of its 40 percent stake in the CIT Group to Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and the sale of its southern New Jersey branches to PNC Bank.
For its last independent quarter, Chase said its profit rose 48 percent, to $340 million, or $1.70 a share; analysts expected $1.41. The bank earned $137 million from its consumer businesses and $158 million from corporate business and trading. Other items, mainly its real estate portfolio, earned $45 million.
"The Chase-Chemical deal is billed as a merger of equals, but most of us see it as an acquisition of Chase by Chemical," Mr. Berry of Keefe, Bruyette said. "So we could have expected that people at Chase would be more interested in circulating their resumes than doing business, but they worked hard," he said.
Chase's cost-cutting campaign eliminated 4,415 positions during 1995. A total of 12,000 jobs will be eliminated in the merger, which is expected to lead to a $925 million after-tax saving. Chemical announced yesterday that it was closing its municipal-bond operation in a cost-cutting move associated with the merger that would eliminate about 50 jobs in municipal underwriting, trading and investment banking. On a combined basis, the two banks earned $3.0 billion in 1995, up from $2.5 billion in 1994.
Nationsbank, based in Charlotte, N.C., the country's fourth-biggest bank, said its fourth-quarter earnings rose 26 percent, to $510 million. But it disappointed analysts, earning $1.87 a share, compared with the $1.92 predicted. The bank was hurt by a 58 percent increase in charge-offs of bad loans. Consumer loan charge-offs increased by 25 percent. And the bank used some of its profits to charge off $43 million in bad commercial and real estate loans.
Over all, First Chicago NBD, the combination of two Midwest banks that merged last December, said its earnings fell 60 percent, to $126 million, in the fourth quarter after taking $192 million in charges for merger costs and securities losses.
First Chicago's profit, before the merger charge, increased by 1 percent, to $318 million.
First Chicago's fourth-quarter earnings of 96 cents a share, before the merger charges, were less than the $1 estimated by analysts. First Chicago, now the country's seventh-largest bank, set aside $210 million for future credit losses, more than double the $96 million loss provision of its predecessor banks a year ago.
Profits at Banc One, the ninth-biggest bank, increased fourfold, to $337 million, because it took a charge of $220 million a year earlier to cover losses from investments and the cost of job cuts. Operating income increased 32 percent. Its profit of 85 cents a share matched analysts' expectations, even as its loan-loss provision shot up to $165.9 million from $35.6 million a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Aide to Rep. Maloney Wins A Special Council Election

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
A. Gifford Miller, a top aide to Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, won a special election last night for the City Council seat representing the Upper East Side and Roosevelt Island.
Mr. Miller, a Democrat, defeated Judith G. Marcus, a Republican and an aide to Charles Millard, who left the Council in December to become president of the Economic Development Corporation in the Giuliani administration. 
 The 26-year-old Mr. Miller is the youngest person ever elected to the Council.
Although the City Charter forbids candidates from running under the names of established parties, the two candidates were assisted by the strong support of their respective parties. Mr. Miller's election will increase the Democratic majority to 45 of the Council's 51 members.
"This is an indication of the revival of the Democratic Party on the East Side and across the city," Mr. Miller said last night. "People are concerned, and they feel that a Democratic agenda is vital to this city on issues like health care, mass transit and public education."
According to unofficial results from the Board of Elections, Mr. Miller received 6,098 votes, or 57 percent, with Ms. Marcus receiving 4,661 votes, or 43 percent.
The election in the Fifth Council District had been closely watched in part because of its echoes of the East Side Congressional race in 1994, in which Mr. Millard, a Republican, failed in a bid to unseat Ms. Maloney, a Democrat.
Mr. Miller was assisted by a battery of Democratic officials who campaigned on his behalf. They included Borough President Ruth W. Messinger, Public Advocate Mark J. Green and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone. He was also aided by telephone bank campaigning conducted by District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the city's largest municipal employees' union.
For her part, Ms. Marcus, 51, had the help of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who gave her an enthusiastic endorsement and sent a letter to registered voters in the East Side district in which he is also a resident. She was also assisted by the East Side Republican organization headed by State Senator Roy M. Goodman.
Throughout the 45-day campaign, Mr. Miller sought to paint his opponent as an ideological soul mate of House Speaker Newt Gingrich. In a district with a large number of elderly residents, he repeatedly argued that Ms. Marcus, who switched from being a Democrat to a Republican two years ago, had joined the party responsible for cuts to growth in Medicaid and Medicare spending.
The Upper East Side, the home of many of the city's wealthiest residents, is nicknamed the Silk Stocking District. While registered Democrats account for more than half the registered voters in the area, Republicans have had several successes in recent years, although they represent only a fifth of the registered voters.
Mr. Miller is expected to be sworn in at a City Council meeting tomorrow.

HEADLINE: Yale Student Strike Points To Decline in Tenured Jobs

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Jan. 16

 BODY:
The restructuring of the American work force has come to campus, and at Yale University it is fueling a bitter labor dispute over the making of one of the nation's most arcane products: Ph.D.'s.
Facing bleak job prospects when they complete their doctoral study, some Yale graduate students are trying to form a union to improve their lot during their six or more years of research and apprentice teaching here. 
 Threatened by Yale with losing their teaching jobs, the students decided on Sunday to end a strike in which they had withheld grades from courses they had taught last semester. But the battle is focusing new attention on why universities are producing so many Ph.D.'s when financial pressures are prompting them to hire fewer for permanent tenured positions.
Supporters of the Yale students say the answer is obvious: graduate teaching assistants are cheap labor for universities, especially public ones, which rely on them much more than Ivy League institutions like Yale do. An average teaching assistant at Yale is paid $4,970 a semester; a full professor, $90,000 a year.
The idea that the students are serving apprenticeships is delusory, these critics say, because jobs are not waiting for them at the end; increasingly, new Ph.D.'s, particularly those in the humanities and social sciences, join a permanent pool of cheap labor that universities hire as part-time adjuncts in place of full-time professors. And since the job market turned down with the recession in 1989, the number of humanities doctorates awarded annually has increased 20.7 percent, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics.
"The changes in the job market are changing apprenticeship into exploitation," said Prof. Cary Nelson of the University of Illinois at Urbana. Professor Nelson, who teaches liberal arts and writes often about the economic quandary of graduate students, said that as long as universities can not do without graduate teaching assistants, they should at least pay them a living wage.
Yale counters that it cares about both the prospects of its students and their well-being during their years in New Haven. But graduate students are just that, not employees, Yale insists, and the university will never recognize a union for them.
"It's not that there's no problem here with graduate education," Richard C. Levin, president of Yale, said. "Graduate students have some legitimate concerns, and we're prepared to address them through reasoned conversation -- which is different from their idea of negotiation for a written, binding agreement.
In many ways, Yale might seem an unlikely campus for a union struggle by graduate students. Nearly all of them study tuition-free within some of the nation's most prestigious academic departments. Stipends cover most of their living expenses. Teaching loads are relatively light. Of the 11 graduate-student unions that have been recognized, all are at public universities, including Rutgers, the University of Wisconsin and several campuses of the University of California.
"They really are among the blessed of the earth," Prof. Peter Brooks, chairman of the department of comparative literature, said. "So I sometimes feel annoyed at them seeing themselves as exploited." Nevertheless, he said, his students' concerns over employment and financial aid were just.
It is unclear how many of the 1,200 graduate students in the humanities and social-science divisions support the union. In an unofficial vote, 600 of 766 students polled said they wanted it to represent them.
But the sense of graduate students as exploited, with little hope of a tenured reward later, has met with more than sympathy from a union already on campus, the Federation of University Employees, an affiliate of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees International Union. Increasingly, blue-collar unions in search of white-collar workers to organize are financing campaigns for graduate-student unions; in California, for example, the unions are supported by the United Auto Workers.
And as universities trim departments and substitute cheaper part-time labor for full professors, the industrial union model is finding an audience among students who see ivory towers acting more like corporate headquarters.
"I was shocked to find all kinds of people who got Ph.D.'s from Yale taking adjunct positions while they look for a tenure-track job," said Gordon Lafer, who turned down a tenure-track job after taking his Ph.D. in political science from Yale last spring. Instead, he became research director for the Federation of University Employees, which represents 3,800 blue-collar and clerical workers at Yale and supports the graduate-student group.
"The universities are at a critical point," he said. "Either everyone is going to continue to be driven down to the lowest common denominator -- and right now everyone is so desperate they are willing to underbid each other -- or we're going to find a way to pull up the bottom of the market by organizing teaching assistants or organizing adjuncts."
The nightmare of graduate students is to become academic nomads, commuting among campuses, paid by the course.
As that group grows, its members will be trapped in their lower status, while the nature of university teaching itself changes, said Robin Brown, a fifth-year graduate student in comparative literature who is president of the Yale group, the Graduate Employees and Students Organization.
"It's very hard for me to conceive of being an adjunct for the next 40 years," she said.
Statistics on part-time faculty are sketchy, though some estimates put the proportion at 40 percent of all people teaching college courses. What is clear is that the collapse of the job market and the end of mandatory retirement at age 70 delayed thousands of expected openings, and the number of new Ph.D.'s grew.
In 1993, for example, 4,481 Ph.D.'s were awarded in the humanities, compared with 3,500 in 1987, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics.
Since 1992 Yale has reduced its graduate admissions in humanities and social-science departments by as much as a third. (Its science departments, by contrast, are growing, and graduate students there, with more generous stipends provided by research grants, have shown no interest in a union.)
The reduction in admissions has allowed Yale to spread $55.5 million in financial aid among fewer students, said Thomas Appelquist, the graduate dean. And only $5.5 million of that, he said, is paid to students for teaching. Through their first five years, they are expected to teach in only the third and fourth years.
While students want stipends raised to cover full living expenses, so they can devote summers to research instead of working, Mr. Appelquist said Yale's aid was competitive with other leading research universities.
"We provide enormous amounts of financial aid, but it should not be expected, and it was never promised, that we will cover all costs," he said. Of $30,000 a year in tuition and expenses, he said, Yale gives the typical student $26,000 to $27,000.
Yale has hired nontenured lecturers and adjuncts mainly to teach basic foreign-language courses, he said. Students, he said, are the primary instructors for about 9 percent of the enrollment in Yale College, little changed over the last decade.
Supporters of the graduate students acknowledge that many of their complaints will strike the public as whining unless the institution's quality declines by use of the students in place of professors.

HEADLINE: Citing Security, China Will Curb Foreign Financial News Agencies

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Wednesday, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Citing national security, China's Government announced on Tuesday night that it would further restrict the flow of information into the nation by more closely regulating international agencies that supply financial news to China.
International wire agencies selling economic information in China -- namely Reuters and Dow Jones -- will now be "supervised" by the official New China News Agency for the content of their reports as well as the subscriptions they sell to Chinese customers. 
 While the full ramifications of the decision may not be clear for days or weeks, it appears to have been prompted by concern among Chinese leaders about growing access to information from abroad, both from international news agencies and from the Internet, although the Internet is not yet used widely in China. At the very least, the decision seems intended to intimidate foreign news organizations.
"Foreign economic information providers will be punished in accordance with the law if their released information to Chinese users contains anything forbidden by Chinese laws and regulations, or slanders or jeopardizes the national interests of China," said the announcement, as reported by the news agency itself. It described the decision as having been issued by China's Cabinet in the form of a circular.
In addition to the Government's desire to limit information it deems unwelcome, however, a driving force in the decision was apparently the New China News Agency's desire both for hands-on control over information networks and, perhaps even more, the right to charge fees to users and sellers of information.
An American news media executive in Beijing said the Chinese news agency has been "trying to do this for months."
"I can't believe the Government finally went along with it," the executive said. "It's this current climate of paranoia that allowed it to happen."
If the New China News Agency stands to gain, Chinese banks and securities firms that trade currencies, commodities, stocks and bonds may suffer badly, if their access to market information is blocked or slowed.
Although the announcement did not spell out how the New China News Agency intends to vet all the market information, company news and analysis that are available from news organizations each day, it implied that adding a new layer of "supervision" may involve delays.
Of the many issues left fuzzy and uncertain by the announcement, perhaps the largest is whether the news agency will actually try to vet all the market news that Reuters and Dow Jones report each day. Although both news services are oriented toward financial news, they also include political coverage that reaches subscribers.
Access to international news in China has grown steadily in recent years as the fax machine and international travel became common, but there remain strict controls on what can be broadcast or printed within China. Reuters quoted an unidentified Chinese official early today as saying that the new restrictions would not mean a slowdown in up-to-the-minute financial news, and would not constitute censorship.
On Tuesday, executives at Dow Jones and Reuters expressed great surprise at the announcement, in part because it runs counter to a steady trend of allowing more financial information to be available, and allowing agencies to sell freely to Chinese institutions.
"The open flow of economic information is good for China," said James McGregor, who is both chief representative for Dow Jones in Beijing and president of the American Chamber of Commerce. "Abundant information makes markets stable."
A Reuters executive in Hong Kong read from a prepared statement, saying: "On the face of it, this has extremely serious implications for Reuters, as well as for many other organizations active in China."
In recent years, Reuters and Dow Jones have each won thousands of customers among China's banks and securities firms that use up-to-the-minute market information to trade on international and domestic capital markets. Neither company will say exactly how much it earns in China, but one executive said it was in the tens of millions of dollars each.
The financial information business boomed along with China's securities markets in 1993 and 1994, but has fallen since then, in part because a series of scandals led to tighter Government regulation. Bloomberg, a supplier of financial information in much of the world, has just begun to enter China.
"This certainly runs counter to the grand objective of making Shanghai an international financial center," John Pinkel, chief representative of H. G. Asia, a Hong Kong-based securities firm, said on Tuesday. He also questioned whether the official news agency's monopoly on financial information would allow its staff to use it to their advantage.
Other Western executives questioned whether members of China's Cabinet fully understood how damaging their decision could be.
Nor does the decision bode well for Hong Kong, the vibrant financial and trading center over which China will resume control on July 1, 1997.
"I am afraid this latest move will only send the signal that Chinese leaders still do not understand how the freedom of information underpins economic success," Martin C. M. Lee, leader of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, told Reuters.
The announcement did not specify when supervision would begin, but said that foreign wire services already in China would have to apply to the news agency within three months for permission to continue.
Although the announcement was couched in political terms, saying the overall aim was to "safeguard state sovereignty," much of it was concerned with controlling the business side of news distribution. It specifies, for example, that international wire services will no longer be able to sell services directly to customers, and must determine subscription rates together with the New China News Agency.
Part of the reason may be that the agency, which retains considerable political clout, has watched its revenue fall in recent years because of its heavy reliance on Government funding. In contrast, state-run television stations and newspapers that sell their own advertising during a booming economy are doing far better.
Yet another issue raised by the announcement is how badly it might affect China's bid to enter the World Trade Organization. Although Chinese leaders are determined to join, they have been blocked so far because efforts to open their economy have only gone partway.
In the long run, even if China's leaders somehow succeed in limiting information that is available from financial news organizations, it is hard to imagine how they could prevent freer communication via the Internet. Though the Internet craze has not hit China yet, when it does, it will be far harder to control.
"It's a lot easier to control a commercial service, because they're trying to keep track of you so they can charge you," Esther Dyson, chairman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an independent group in New York, said on Tuesday. "They can't control the Internet any more than they can control what people say in their own homes."
Chinese leaders are still grappling with how to control information over the Internet. Last week, one media executive said, all of China's Internet providers were called to a meeting with Government officials, who lectured them on the dangers of pornography on the Internet.
"They're well aware of the Internet, and they're scared," said Ms. Dyson. "In the long run, there's nothing they can do about it."

HEADLINE: Senator Cohen, G.O.P. Centrist, Plans to Retire

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
The corps of Senate moderates dwindled further today with the unexpected announcement by Senator William S. Cohen of Maine that he would not run for a fourth term this year.
The retirement of Senator Cohen, the Republican who made his mark in national politics as an anguished House newcomer voting to impeach President Richard M. Nixon, is the 13th this election year, a Senate record for disenchantment with incumbency. 
 "The recent budget stalemate in Washington over the past several weeks has been instrumental in crystallizing this for me," Mr. Cohen told a gathering of constituents. He said he needed "new challenges" after 24 years in Congress and would seek a role in improving the nation's international trade.
With his announcement at City Hall in Bangor, Me., where the 55-year-old Senator began in politics a generation ago as a Councilor-Mayor, Mr. Cohen broke the Senate retirement record of 1896, a watershed year for American political change that followed the national depression of 1893. By his own account, the polarizing political mood on Capitol Hill was a significant factor in his choice to leave.
He described a sudden change of mind over the New Year holiday when he visited Malaysia, where he has succeeded in establishing commercial links for Maine companies in recent years.
"I had planned on running and had no real opposition at home to speak of," Senator Cohen said in a telephone interview.
But on the trip, he said, he pondered his future along with a mixture of factors. They included the larger implications of the budget standoff for the realignment of politics, as well as the economic need and personal satisfaction he found in creating job opportunities rooted in the global economy.
"The whole budget debate has been necessary and has framed the issues," he said, adding that for him, the greater satisfaction seemed to lie in helping shape global economic ties. "I mulled it over and decided after a quarter of a century in Congress that I'm still young and I want to engage in the international field in an intense way."
that I'm still young and I want to engage in the international field in an intense way."
Mr. Cohen said that in politics he sensed an uncertain, "evolutionary" period of realignment between liberal and conservative forces.
"Right now, the center is more or less disappearing," he said, speaking of voters facing the question of whether they prefer a one-party-dominated government or greater compromise from the antagonists in the present alignment.
Among the many Maine voters shocked at the Senator's announcement was his mother, Clara, whom he said he called last weekend and told, "I've decided I want to do something else." The influential factors in his decision, the Senator said in the interview, included his intended marriage to Janet Langhart, a television journalist.
Senator Cohen, a leader of the slender, dwindling group of Republican moderates, has written novels and poetry. He once wrote of a fictitious senator: "Politics is a life of artifice. You become, through press releases and self-promotion, a figment of the public's imagination."
His real standing, as a moderate bridge between the parties, is such that speculation began immediately about his becoming a Republican Vice-Presidential contender, or a Cabinet member in the next Administration, whether Republican or Democratic. But he said his decision was entirely rooted in personal, not political, factors.
The Senator warned that the current budget stalemate between the Republican Congress and President Clinton was a crucial test of whether the nation returned to "the virtues of self-discipline and fiscal prudence."
"It is a moral imperative that we stop engaging in flagrant consumption and then hand over a $5 trillion debt to our children with little more than a slap on the back and an expression of 'good luck,' " he said.
Of the 33 senators up for re-election, 5 Republicans and 8 Democrats have announced their retirement. Several moderates are among them.
Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said that with Mr. Cohen's departure, the President was "concerned that the center in American politics not lose the capacity to govern."
Kevin Mattson, executive director of the Maine Democratic Party, said Senator Cohen's announcement turned state politics on its head. "Nobody is ready to take that seat," Mr. Mattson said.
Christian P. Potholm, professor of government and legal studies at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Me., who is the Senator's close friend and was the campaign manager in his first Congressional race, in 1972, noted that Mr. Cohen had a popularity rating of more than 70 percent and no significant challenger or successor in sight.
"He's been very wistful about turning 55 and looking to the future," Professor Potholm said, adding that the "disappearance of civil discourse" in the Senate was another factor Mr. Cohen had cited. "It's unbelievable the way people are rushing around up here today thinking, 'Hey, I can be U.S. Senator!' " Professor Potholm said in describing the frenzy touched off by the announcement.
As a freshman representative, Mr. Cohen was catapulted into the spotlight as a member of the House Judiciary Committee, agonizing on national television over the Watergate scandal even as he carefully questioned witnesses. He was the only Republican who voted to request the White House tape recordings that incriminated Mr. Nixon.
Mr. Cohen ultimately voted for impeachment. "The most difficult decision of my life," he said.
In 1986, Senator Cohen, as a member of the Intelligence Committee, challenged another Republican President, Ronald Reagan, in the Iran-contra affair involving arms sales to Iran and the diversion of some of the money to Nicaraguan rebels. He pressed for full disclosure, asserting that the Administration "in effect took foreign policy underground."
Senator Cohen took comfort in that record as an independent. He said he had few regrets, including the fact that "there was a limit to what level I could achieve" as a moderate in a Republican Party increasingly dominated by conservatives.
"That's been a very liberating thing for me," he said.

Biggest Banks Report Their Best Year Ever
Profits soared at the nation's biggest banks for the fourth quarter, capping off their best year ever. Revenue grew for loans and fees, and bad loans remained relatively low. But in 1996, analysts said, the banks' fortunes may fade somewhat, because of falling interest rates and increased losses on consumer loans.
Citicorp, Chemical and Chase all beat analyst expectations. Profits did not meet forecasts at big regionals, like Nationsbank, First Chicago and Banc One, though their profits rose, nonetheless. [Page D3.]

HEADLINE: At the Nation's Table: Terlingua, Tex.;
Dinner Out, In the Desert

BYLINE: By ANNE S. LEWIS 

 BODY:
In remote Terlingua, Tex., in the mountainous Chihuahuan desert near the Mexican border, where basic amenities like indoor plumbing are not taken lightly, dinner matters. That's why "What's tonight's special?" usually refers to the Starlight Theater among the mix of locals, Rio Grande rafters and the on-location film crews who frequent this restaurant that was once a movie theater.
Five years ago, Angie Dean, then an eight-year resident of Terlingua, and Rob Dean, then her husband and partner, rehabilitated the dilapidated and roofless Chisos Theater, an adobe relic of this ghost town's heyday as a cinnabar mining town in the 1920's and 30's. 
 The renamed Starlight Theater, one of only a handful of restaurants in the area, seats up to 100 diners, who can order drinks at the mesquite-wood bar -- with cow skulls hanging from the ceiling -- and dance to live music.
A kitchen crew of two turns out fresh, reasonably priced nightly specials, ranging from shrimp Mexicano and chicken in green-chili cream sauce to a cilantro-spiked tortilla soup; beef features heavily in the regular menu. Dinner ranges from $3.50 to $16.25. Dessert is an assortment of pies ($3.50 a slice).
Ms. Dean welcomes the seasonal swell of tourists from Big Bend National Park and movie people during the temperate winter and early spring months, and she tries to accommodate their varying tastes. "When the Californians are here on film shoots, I'll add more greens, salads and fish to the menu because they're not all that fond of the Texas diet," she explained.
Ms. Dean, who is now the sole owner of the restaurant, stays attuned to the needs of her regulars -- gray-haired men with weathered faces and ponytails and names like Fish and Black George, the local postal and park employees, and river guides. Her restaurant is closed for only one day a year -- for a local school event -- because, she said, "these people have to eat." And she always serves an economical ($2.50) but filling bowl of pinto beans and tortillas for those short on cash.
Starlight Theater is at 2 Ivey Lane, Terlingua, Tex. 79852; (915) 371-2326. Open seven days from 5 P.M. to midnight (1 A.M. on Saturday). Dinner is served until 9. ANNE S. LEWIS

HEADLINE: 700 Jobs, Some From Jersey, Moving to Lower Manhattan

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In a modest sign that New York City's effort to revitalize lower Manhattan is bearing fruit, the New York Life Insurance Company said yesterday that it would move 700 employees to a building in the shadow of the World Trade Center. In doing so, the company will receive $6.5 million in tax incentives.
Most of the 700 employees now work at the company's headquarters at 26th Street and Madison Avenue, but 125 will be moved from New Jersey. The decision is a coup for the city's efforts to retain insurance jobs, since companies like New York Life have long been a major source of white-collar employment. 
 The company said it had leased four floors of the building, at Broadway and Liberty Street, for the new headquarters of Nylcare Inc., a newly formed subsidiary that combines its group health care businesses.
Although New York Life executives had been negotiating for space in the lower Manhattan building for almost a year, they said yesterday that they had waited to sign a lease until the city's revitalization incentives, first announced by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in December 1994, were approved by the State Legislature, which passed them in October.
Under the program, open to any company that moves to a lower Manhattan building constructed before 1973, it will receive incentives worth $3 million in its commercial occupancy tax, real estate tax and electric bills. It negotiated $3.5 million more in so-called discretionary tax breaks from the city.
Mayor Giuliani said yesterday that the deal reinforced "our message to the world, which is that New York is a business-friendly town."

Utility Seeks Shift on Rates

BYLINE: By SUSAN JO KELLER 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
New Jersey's biggest utility company asked state regulators yesterday to change the way its rates are set, anticipating the day when consumers -- especially big ones -- can pick their power supplier. 
 Under one part of the plan presented by Public Service Electric and Gas Company, electric rates would drop when the state Board of Public Utilities approved. The company said the cut would translate into $1.30 a month on a $100 bill, or $50 million a year. Both gas and electric rates would be frozen until the end of the year; after that, the company said, it would base its rate requests on a formula involving the national inflation rate and "uncontrollable" costs of things like environmental cleanups.

Town's Credit Rating Drops

BYLINE: By SUSAN JO KELLER

DATELINE: WEST NEW YORK

 BODY:
Standard & Poor's said yesterday that it was lowering the credit rating on some of West New York's debt from triple B-plus to triple B, which is still investment grade. S. & P. also downgraded the town's rating outlook from stable to negative. Mayor Albio Sires said he was not surprised. "I've been screaming about the finances of the town for years," said Mr. Sires, who took office in May after defeating Anthony DeFino, who had been the Mayor for 24 years. Richard Turner, town administrator, said the S. & P. decision was based on an evaluation that ended on June 30, 1994. He expressed confidence that Standard & Poor's would react positively to the new administration's economic programs.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Gain Despite Budget Block

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Against a backdrop of fresh economic data and on-again, off-again budget negotiations, prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday, especially in the long maturities.
The price of the 30-year bond gained 22/32 of a percentage point, to 111 30/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to 6.01 percent, from 6.05 percent on Tuesday. 
 Included in the economic statistics released yesterday were the trade balance numbers for October, leading indicators and the Federal Reserve's so-called beige book of business activity as reported by the 12 regional Fed banks. The Fed report showed the economy growing at a slow pace and almost inflation free.
Analysts say the beige report is forward looking and therefore may carry more influence than usual at this month's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee because of the partial shutdown that delayed the release of economic indicators from the Commerce and Labor Departments, meaning those reports are unusually lagging. The meeting will take place on Jan. 30 and 31, about six weeks after the last meeting, when the committee lowered the Federal funds rate for overnight bank loans by a quarter of a percentage point.
Leading indicators for November posted their third consecutive monthly decline, as the index dropped by three-tenths of 1 percent, though the components were incomplete. The Federal shutdown delayed the release of the new orders, contracts and orders, and unfilled orders data, excluding these components from the November index.
Economists said an announcement by the Fed that the vice chairman, Alan Blinder, would step down and return to the academic sector had little impact on the market, since few thought it would change anything very much at the Fed.
However, the market did sag when it learned that the Republicans had canceled yesterday's scheduled budget talks, then recouped when Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, indicated that he and Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker, did talk with the President on the phone and that the talks were "frank and useful."
Louis G. Brien, an analyst with Rand Financial Services in Chicago, sees the budget stalemate as bullish, not bearish, for bonds. He believes that once a deal is struck, regardless of whether it favors Republican or Democratic policies, it will not actually reduce the deficit for a couple of years. "The stalemate, which has been perceived as such a bond market negative, might be bullish," he said.
Both sides in the negotiations, Mr. Brien said, are on the record that a Government shutdown is not in the cards. "This should remove any worry of default," he said.
"And if Newt Gingrich is correct and there is not a resolution until November, it means all funding will be stopgap," he continued. "All funding will have to come through the Republican House of Representative. This could create a de facto budget cut this year, not 1998. The house can than be counted on to fund the bare minimums. This may be restrictive on the economy."
Other dips in the session came on the release of the October trade deficit, which caused shorter maturities to drop. The deficit, which was reported at $8.04 billion, compared with a downwardly revised $8.25 billion for September, raised the likelihood that the nation's gross domestic product may be better than expected.
Anthony Dwyer, chief market strategist Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said: "I think the market is saying that despite the fact we have not had Government economic numbers in a while, the economy is weakening as evidenced by the anecdotal numbers leading up to the latest batch of data. Market participants hope that will spur another easing by the Fed.
"The dollar is solid and is drawing foreign investors into the U.S. financial markets. Equities are in a pivotal phase over the short term, as there may be more concerns about corporate profits. But over the longer term the lower interest rate environment should generate increased economic activity and raise corporate profits, thereby boosting equities."
Doug Burtnick, a fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said, "It only took two weeks for domestic investors to completely shrug off the idea that there are a lot of risks for the long end of the bond market if a balanced budget agreement isn't reached soon."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up vs. Mark and Pound On Signs of European Weakness

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied to move higher against most other leading currencies yesterday after overcoming a brief but sharp selloff on word that the Federal budget talks in Washington had broken down.
Traders attributed the dollar's resilience to expectations of lower European interest rates that undermined the German mark, weak British economic statistics that hurt the pound, and a narrower United States trade deficit that suggested the dollar has room to strengthen further. 
 "There's a lot more negative economic data coming out of Europe and Japan," said Elena Shperling, chief currency dealer at the New York branch of Banco di Sicilia. "By comparison in the United States, we're looking pretty good."
In late trading yesterday in New York, the dollar bought 1.4715 marks, up from 1.4638 on Tuesday. It also rallied against other European currencies, notably the British pound, which fell to $1.5205, from $1.5360 on Tuesday. The dollar has not been that strong against the pound since May 1994.
The dollar ended slightly lower yesterday against the Japanese yen, to 105.42 yen from 105.82 yen on Tuesday. But yen dealers said the underlying demand for dollars remained strong.
The dollar and Amerian securities markets faltered in the early afternoon when Republican Congressional leaders scrapped planned budget talks with President Clinton. But the weakness wore off as buyers stepped in. "Within 10 minutes, it was as though nothing had ever happened," Christopher Low, an economist at HSBC Securities in New York, said.
An early catalyst for dollar demand came from the German central bank, which allowed an important short-term interest rate to decline yesterday. That bolstered speculation the central bank would take broader steps to reduce rates at its regular meeting today.
The dollar also derived strength from a big selloff in the pound, spurred by the release of data showing the British Government's deficit and the national unemployment rate have not shrunk as much as expected.
The dollar was further helped by a Commerce Department report that the American trade deficit shrank in October to the smallest imbalance in nearly a year.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday, were: 1.1890 Swiss francs, up from 1.1794; 5.0273 French francs, up from 5.0014, and 1,584.75 Italian lire, up from 1,577.50.

HEADLINE: Fed Survey Sees 'Modest Pace' of Growth

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
The economy was growing at a "generally modest pace" at the turn of the year, a Federal Reserve survey showed today, but an index intended to predict turning points in the economy suggested an increased possibility of a downturn this year.
The Fed's periodic pulse-taking of business conditions in all 12 of its regions found a mixture of disappointing holiday sales, uneven factory activity and subdued inflation. 
 It also found some rebound in commercial real estate and continuing shortages in various areas of the labor market.
The anecdotal findings were over all a bit less buoyant than in the preceding report, which mainly covered November. But analysts took comfort in the fact that the economy had not slumped since mid-December -- during the period when the Government shutdown idled the keeping of statistics by the Labor and Commerce Departments.
The Fed's beige book signifies that growth has slowed from its annual pace of 4.2 percent in the third quarter, said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank in Pittsburgh. But he added that "the economy is still advancing" and would most likely continue to do so even though the predictive index, now compiled by the Conference Board, a business research group in New York, seems to be flashing "a yellow light."
The board reported today that the index of leading indicators fell three-tenths of 1 percent in November, the second straight decline and seventh of 1995. At 100.4, the index has retreated to the lowest point since December 1993.
Indeed, only a small upward revision that lifted the September result to no change prevented a third straight decline in the index, a string sometimes taken as a signal of impending recession.
But analysts were unusually reluctant to draw such a conclusion since three components accounting for 20 percent of the index were not yet available and the declines have not been particularly severe or widespread among index components.
Nor was the Conference Board able, because of missing figures, to publish companion indexes of coincident and lagging indicators that themselves can be used to forecast.
Nonetheless, the persistent weakness of the leading index is somewhat unsettling, analysts said, and would not go unnoticed by the Federal Reserve policy makers as they meet at month's end to set an economic course that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, will lay out before Congress next month.
The Fed's deliberations "may be particularly intense," Joel L. Naroff, chief economist for the First Union National Bank in Philadelphia, said today.
Another somber note was struck by the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, which reported that its quarterly poll of 3,000 American businesses found them "expecting significantly slower growth in sales, profits and employment levels during the first quarter of 1996."
Executives throughout industry said optimism for first-quarter sales was at a three-year low, while the outlook for profits was the lowest since the fourth quarter of 1993, the company said. Still, "this weak expectation of growth is not an indication that a recession is likely in the near future," said Joseph W. Duncan, Dun & Bradstreet's chief economist.
Four of the eight available components in the leading index were negative, the Conference Board's report showed. The biggest effect by far was a decline in prices of materials especially sensitive to the business cycle. Lesser factors were faster deliveries by suppliers, higher first-time claims for unemployment insurance and lower consumer expectations.
Pushing up the index were modest increases in stock prices, building permits and the money supply. The eighth item, the length of the factory work week, was unchanged.
With the latest report, the Conference Board took over the main responsibility for putting together the index, though it still relies on the Commerce Department for some data, and that was incomplete.
The Fed's survey, prepared this time by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, was based on information collected through Jan. 7 and thus did not include any effects of the East Coast snowstorms.
"Holiday sales were generally reported to be below expectations, with extensive discounting," the survey said in its summary. "Manufacturers saw uneven growth, with weakness noted in auto-related production. The Federal Government shutdown hurt winter tourism at national parks, but other areas reported increased activity.
"Single-family home sales are experiencing some seasonal slowing in most of the country. However, commercial real estate contacts in many areas report strengthened markets. Loan demand is steady in most areas. Firms say that prices are generally remaining stable, but some areas still report shortages of skilled workers."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Economic Weakness Stirs Gloom in Europe

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Grim economic reports that include soaring unemployment, bigger budget deficits and lower economic growth, have many in Europe wondering, for the first time in more than two years, whether the Continent is once again heading toward a recession.
Ominous news from Germany, considered the engine of European economic growth, has sent economists back to their forecasting models over the last week to lower their growth figures. 
 The sharpness of the European slowdown, which has emerged over the last two months, has taken economists and government officials by surprise. The last recession was a steep one, and the last two years' recovery has been only moderate, doing relatively little to cut into Europe's high unemployment.
Though no major forecaster is openly predicting a recession yet, economists say that much of Europe is in a spell of no growth or even shrinkage that could persist well into the year.
Some are beginning to label the European economic phenomenon a "growth recession."
"We don't see the classic signs of a recession, but the point for 1996 is that growth will be so low that it is going to feel like a recession to a lot of people," said Richard Reid, chief economist at the Frankfurt office of the Union Bank of Switzerland.
The slowdown comes as the United States economy also appears to be weakening, and it could cut the profits of American multinationals.
The gloom has sent politicians across Europe scurrying to come up with proposals to generate jobs and growth. And they seem to be bending over backward to rebut assertions that only a month after national leaders finally mustered the political will to give a name to the new single currency, the Euro, their economic plans are no longer on track.
"The gloom over the past week has been wildly exaggerated," a senior official of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Government said, adding that "we will meet the Maastricht criteria, without a doubt." He referred the treaty on European union that sets the terms for adoption of a single currency and central bank.
Skeptics say that plans to introduce the first stage of a single currency in 1999 are highly unrealistic because the low growth will so increase budget deficits that countries will not meet the standards required by the treaty for participation in a single currency. "Maastricht no longer exists," said Jacques Calvet, chairman of the French auto maker Peugeot, an outspoken critic of the single-currency plan. "Maastricht is obsolete. Maastricht is dead."
Even Germany last week, the paragon in Europe of budgetary restraint, conceded that its deficit had jumped to 3.6 percent of the gross domestic product, well above the 3 percent limit required by the Maastricht terms. But Finance Minister Theo Waigel promised to have the budget under control by next year.
Economists including Mr. Reid say that in Germany, the third and fourth quarters of 1995 registered no growth at best. They predict that the economy is likely to remain limp through the first half of this year.
The economy of France, Europe's second largest, is essentially not growing, either, and those of Belgium and the Netherlands are slowing considerably. Even in Italy and Spain, where economic output in 1995 was among the strongest in Europe, it is markedly slowing.
Britain appears to be the exception. Its gross domestic product is predicted to remain at the level of 1995 -- about 2.5 percent after inflation -- and may even grow a little faster this year. The Government announced in London today that the number of unemployed fell in December by about 10,000.
But for the rest of Europe, the anemic economic activity will be helpless in combating what almost everyone agrees is the big problem -- 17.5 million unemployed, an average rate of 10.6 percent.
"Not only will growth not be enough to reduce unemployment, it will be so low that unemployment will continue to go up," said Armin Sorg, senior director for economic policy at Siemens A.G. in Munich.
Since Germany accounts for almost 30 percent of the European economy, its performance gets the closest scrutiny, and the slowdown here has generated deep pessimism.
Much of the slowdown has been attributed to the high exchange rate of the German currency. Businesses are struggling with a mark that many say is 25 percent overvalued against the dollar. This has raised the cost of exports and generated losses at companies dependent on export earnings.
Beyond that, German factory wages are the highest in the world and the labor laws, rigid. Mr. Sorg of Siemens argued that an engineer in Germany works three months a year less than one in the United States. And because of union opposition to weekend work, he said, factories have the shortest running times in Europe. As in France and the Netherlands, a worker, once hired, is difficult to let go, so in uncertain times, companies do not hire.
All this has helped create a struggling economy. Normally, a government might consider an antidote of big tax cuts and higher public spending. But the restrictions of a single currency mean that Bonn would have to either raise taxes or cut spending to meet the budget targets, and neither of those avenues is attractive to the Kohl Government. This leaves the task of economic revival to the Bundesbank.
Economists say the central bank is the one institution that has substantial power to pull Germany and Europe out of a slowdown, by lowering interest rates. Today, the Bundesbank lowered the securities-repurchase, or repo, rate -- the one at which it does most of its lending to banks, to 3.65 percent from 3.73 percent. The German discount rate stands at 3 percent, near an all-time low, and economists predict that it will be cut further.
In a television interview on Tuesday night, the Bundesbank's president, Hans Tietmeyer, said he saw room for further cuts in interest rates. Lower rates in Germany mean that central banks across Europe can lower their rates, over the long run generating employment and economic activity.
"These lower interest rates have enormous potential in getting Europe out of its hole," said Steven Englander, international economist at Smith Barney in Paris. "It's not going to happen overnight. But optimism will start to rebound in the second half of this year."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Oil Prices Reverse Their Slide As Prospects Fade for Iraqi Sale

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Oil prices climbed yesterday as doubts emerged about whether Iraq would be allowed to sell oil for humanitarian purposes.
Natural gas prices also surged on expectations of colder-than-normal weather in the Northeast and a snowstorm in the Midwest, key gas-heating regions. 
 Traders spent most of the session trying to decipher Iraq's intentions, said John Saucer, an oil analyst at Smith Barney Inc. in Houston. Prices fell on Tuesday after Iraq surprised investors by announcing it would seek talks with the United Nations on oil sales despite a longstanding embargo that came with its invasion of Kuwait.
Mr. Saucer said traders now believed Iraq would not be allowed to increase production because it was becoming clear that it was insisting that there be no preconditions from the United Nations on how it spent its oil revenue.
On other commodity markets, copper futures prices dropped to 15-month lows. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities rose 1.23 points, to 240.21.
Crude oil for February delivery rose 47 cents, to $18.52 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. February heating oil rose 0.70 cent, to 53.13 cents a gallon, and February unleaded gasoline rose 1.65 cents, to 54.98 cents a gallon.
Crude oil futures prices fell to the lowest level since Nov. 22 on Tuesday after the Iraqi announcement. Traders were reassured yesterday after United Nations officials indicated terms of the deal would remain the same and Iraq would have no control over how the proceeds are spent.
The plan would allow Iraq a $1 billion sale every 90 days. Analysts said that would add about 700,000 barrels a day to bloated world markets.
February natural gas rose 26.2 cents, to $2.336 for 1,000 cubic feet, because of a belief that supplies would fall, a development confirmed by the American Gas Association after the close. Price also rose on the predictions for colder weather.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Winning Hand

BYLINE: By Matthew Miller; Matthew Miller, economics editor of The New Republic, was senior adviser in the Office of Management and Budget from 1993 to 1995.

 BODY:
It's only human for Republicans to sulk now that the President has outmaneuvered them by pressing for a balanced budget deal while attacking their "excessive Medicare cuts" -- which are similar in size to savings he had previously proposed. But the G.O.P. should put frustration aside and realize that the good of the country and its own political survival argue for a deal largely on his terms.
The Republicans complain that, despite the Congressional Budget Office's verdict that the latest Administration plan would achieve balance by the year 2002, Mr. Clinton puts off hard choices. But consider that in the first five years of its own balanced budget bill, the G.O.P. hopes to reduce the deficit by $337 billion. By contrast, President Clinton's 1993 budget package sought to reduce the deficit over five years by $500 billion. Even if Republicans dropped their foolish tax cut, their five-year deficit reduction would rise to only $486 billion. 
 The Republicans also accuse the President of "backloading" his budget savings -- meaning that they would take effect so far in the future as to be illusory. It's true that in his seven-year plan, he would achieve 58 percent of his savings in 2001 and 2002. But the G.O.P. plan passed in November puts off 48 percent of its savings until then. Imagine the campaign battle cry: "We put off half the heavy lifting till tomorrow, but the President puts off a little more!"
Politicians fall prey to the delusion that their side represents Good and the other side Evil. But while Republicans deserve credit for making a balanced budget a priority, they should remember that their plan, like the President's, is deeply flawed. For political reasons, both leave defense, Social Security and most "welfare for the well-to-do" off the table -- areas that together constitute half the budget and from which reasonable people in both parties know savings can be found.
Both parties thus myopically take about half their savings from annually appropriated domestic spending, which makes up only 16 percent of the budget and where needed money for research and development and education, among other things, comes from.
But in walking out on the budget negotiations, it's the Republicans who look worse. Whether there's a deal or not, Bill Clinton can argue honestly in the campaign that after 12 years of rising deficits, he's cut them nearly in half without a single Republican vote.
What's more, the President has a plan that the Republican-controlled Congressional Budget Office says will finish the job. In addition, if there's no deal, Mr. Clinton will be able to label the G.O.P. majority a "do-nothing" Congress since the entire G.O.P. agenda is wrapped up in the budget. This would leave 73 Republican freshman heading to the stump touting only the vague accomplishment of having "changed the debate," which may not stack up well against real, live votes that their opponents will say "slashed Medicare to give big tax cuts to the rich." In the absence of a disaster in Bosnia, the prospect for a big Democratic victory on these terms is real.
In November, many observers (like myself) thought the fiscal endgame would pit the G.O.P.'s politics of balanced budgets against the Democrats' politics of "Mediscare." The genius of the President's recent moves is to co-opt the balanced budget argument without relinquishing the Medicare attack. This strategy carries harsh consequences for the Republicans. They now need a deal more than the President does. That may be frustrating, but it's also reality.
If the G.O.P. is sincere about the national interest, this is no time for sour grapes about not getting enough credit. Instead, it's time to deal. A compromise plan will not be perfect -- the deficit probably won't be eliminated, hard choices will be deferred and taxes may unwisely be cut -- but it will be progress. The Republicans should call the President's bluff, claim joint victory and accept something close to the deal he's offered.

HEADLINE: Essay;
State of the Union

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
President Clinton and a small cadre of aides are feverishly finishing the State of the Union address for presentation to an opposition Congress next Tuesday.
Here is a guide, nonpartisan to the point of Olympian, providing criteria to help viewers judge the only reporting event mandated by the Constitution. 
 1. Does he inspire confidence? We remember Reagan for morning-in-America optimism, Carter for eat-your-peas pessimism. With Republicans deliberately downbeat about budget talks, to remind the President of a recession if he fails to make a deal, Clinton must counter with confidence, in rhetoric and demeanor, without misleading.
2. Does he speak to the politicians in the hall or the people at home? In the television era, Presidents have used the House of Representatives merely as a colorful forum for a speech to the camera. But this time the oratorical challenge to Clinton, in the midst of the budget negotiations, is to play to both hall and home. People in their living rooms are both the target audience and onlookers at a dramatic confrontation; Clinton must be able to carom off Congress to land the ball in our pocket.
3. Does he put the story in the key word? Traditionally the President says "The State of the Union is (fill in adjective)." In hard times, the word is a reassuring "sound"; in better times, the word of choice, in both its senses, is "good." Gerald Ford's assessment in troubled 1975 was stunningly honest: "Not good." Clinton cannot be too honest ("The State of the Union, as we all know, is pretty confused"); more likely, he will go for a word like "strong."
4. Does he look backward or forward? George Bush's failure of vision in his election-year S.O.T.U. made his Presidency seem to have run out of gas. Beyond taking credit for a low-inflation economy, for Clinton to offer a litany of domestic achievements in this year of gridlock and shutdown would be risible; this speech must focus on the future, showing why a second term is needed -- without insulting Congress to its face.
5. Is he just political enough without appearing partisan? His fall campaign theme will be "Without me and my veto, those G.O.P. richies would savage our helpless old folks, pollute the environment and slam the schoolhouse door." But in next week's dignified setting, he must put his vetoes positively, as invitations to improve legislation to more painlessly bring about an agreed goal of a balanced budget. In this regard --
6. Does he inoculate himself from valid campaign criticism of preserving the failed welfare system? This is the place, looking ahead, to try to redefine "ending welfare as we know it" -- when the nation knows he stymied that promised reform this year.
7. Does he in a nonpartisan way exploit the foreign-affairs schism in the Republican ranks? Last weekend's 31-hour photo op in Bosnia, posing in a military jacket, was done just in time to set up a claim of world leadership and defense readiness in this speech. The peacemaker of the Middle East, Ireland and Haiti will publicly praise internationalists like Dole and Gingrich -- they'll smile but hate it -- thereby driving deeper the wedge between them and G.O.P. isolationists.
8. Will he develop his centrist theme of personal responsibility or start running prematurely as the defender of the needy against the greedy? If he can remind us of our duties to one another as individuals, and of our collective duty to educate the young and fight crime and respect our differences, then he can stay on that high road until it becomes necessary for him, later in the campaign, to exploit fear and foment class division.
9. Is he straining to milk applause? Fourteen interruptions of applause and one spontaneous standing ovation from Democrats is about right for a 40-minute S.O.T.U.
10. Does he have a heartstrings-tugger in the balcony? Reagan was master of this visual pointmaker. Look for something like a salute to the First Lady seated next to our first Bosnian casualty, which may be schmaltzy but is entirely appropriate in this patriotic setting.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
When economists talk, few listen if the subject is health policy.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to public policy, does anyone listen to economic experts anymore? Judging from the rise and fall of the Clinton national health care plan -- the Edsel (this is the 90's: make that the "Waterworld") of public policy rollouts -- the answer is discouraging. And economists may have only themselves to blame. Indeed, economic professionals appear to pay little attention to the most knowledgeable people within their own ranks.
That's the bleak message from Victor R. Fuchs, a health care economist at Stanford University and the departing president of the American Economic Association. He tackled the subject last week in his farewell address at the association's annual meeting in San Francisco. And while his words are hardly cheerful reading, Mr. Fuchs touches sensitive points that economists can ignore only at their own peril. 
 The big surprise for political scientists in the health reform debacle was that the first genuine policy wonk to battle his way to the White House proved to be such an amateur at policy-making, according to Theodore R. Marmor of the Yale School of Organization and Management.
"President Clinton had no reason to believe there was a popular consensus for radical change," Mr. Marmor said. But the new President, elected with a bare plurality in a three-way contest, acted as if he were prime minister in a British-style parliamentary system in which party discipline would be decisive.
Seriously misreading the way things work in Washington, Mr. Clinton did all his interest-group bargaining in secret, presenting a finished version to Congress with little room for horse-trading. In the end, Mr. Marmor says, the plan, intricately fiddled and faddled to placate everyone, pleased no one.
For health care economists, there was an even bigger slap in the face. After three decades in which health economics had come into its own as a serious discipline, the research and advice from such experts were virtually ignored in the White House drafting of the bill.
To find out why, Mr. Fuchs put together an opinion survey on health policy, eliciting responses from 46 health economists, 44 economic theorists with no special interest in health care and 42 practicing physicians. While the design of the survey and the choice of experts surveyed may not meet the standards of scientific polling, some of the results are striking.
On the 7 out of 20 questions that Mr. Fuchs labels "value free," the health economists spoke with virtually one voice. For example, 81 percent agreed that "the primary reason for the increase in the health sector's share of G.D.P. over the past 30 years is technological change in medicine." Fully 91 percent took issue with the assertion that "the high cost of health care in the United States makes U.S. firms substantially less competitive in the global economy."
But many of the views of health economists, grounded in solid research, proved to be well-guarded secrets. By contrast to the 89 percent of the health care economists who rejected the idea that "widespread use of currently available screening and other diagnostic techniques would result in a significant reduction in health care expenditures," 83 percent of the economic theorists accepted it. And while not one of the health economists agreed that "differential access to medical care across socioeconomic groups is the primary reason for differential health status," 34 percent of the physicians did.
Perhaps one reason few people paid attention to health economists was that they did not always speak with one voice on fundamental policy issues. The group was split 54 to 46 on whether "the U.S. should seek universal coverage through a broad-based tax with implicit subsidies for the poor and the sick." By the same token, the split was 51 to 49 on whether "insurance companies should be required to cover all applicants regardless of health condition and not allowed to charge sicker individuals higher premiums." While 42 percent agreed that "national standardized health insurance benefit packages should be established," 58 percent did not.
If health economists can't get their research findings across to physicians and other economists, Mr. Fuchs asks, what chance do they have to influence politicians and voters? Not much. And it doesn't help that health economists do not seem to share common objectives, diluting even further their impact on the policy debate.
Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, draws a yet-more-sober conclusion. The closer economists get to the corridors of power, he suggests, the more they are influenced by careerism and ideology. And in straying ever further from the more objective standards of science, they have left themselves open to the public's view of them as experts for sale. "We are self-immolating as a profession," he concludes.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Gap Narrowed Again in October

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit fell to $8.04 billion last October, the lowest level in 10 months and the fourth straight monthly decline, the Commerce Department said today in a delayed report.
The numbers solidified a view among economists that the trade deficit had peaked, but the latest figures also raised new concerns about the nation's trade with Japan and highlighted a lack of progress in opening parts of China's vast market more widely to American goods. 
 And some economists cautioned that these and other problems, including growing United States trade imbalances with Canada and Mexico and a slowdown in Europe's economy, could keep the country's overall trade deficit from dropping significantly next year.
In its report, which was delayed at least a month by the Government shutdown, the Commerce Department said the trade deficit decreased 2.5 percent in October from $8.25 billion in September. That marked the fourth straight monthly fall since the deficit hit $11.39 billion last June.
But even with those gains, several private economists projected that the 1995 deficit would total $150 billion to $165 billion, making it one of the highest in history.
Still, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said the overall trend "is obviously helpful." He added that the trade total, fueled by strong United States exports, "have been moving inextricably in the right direction over the last several months.
"I perceive that is going to continue, but how strongly I can't tell," he said.
Several economists said they were troubled by a jump in the United States trade deficit with Japan, which rose 11.1 percent in October to $4.79 billion from $4.31 billion in September, ending a seven-month stretch of declines.
But Mr. Kantor said in an interview that the overall trade deficit with Japan had dropped 4 percent in the first 10 months of 1995 over the same period in 1994.
He said he was more concerned about trade with China. Hinting that the Administration may seek to reimpose trade sanctions against China next month, Mr. Kantor said: "Things are not going in the correct direction with China. We have focused on China with some intensity, and we intend to be even more intense over the next several months. This goes beyond trade rules to the rule of law. We expect them to live up to their agreements."
Last February, the Clinton Administration suspended $1 billion in tariffs on imports from China to encourage the Chinese Government to crack down on piracy of American movies and computer software and to halt other discriminatory trade practices.
But some trade experts contended that China has not changed many of its practices, and the Commerce report showed that America's deficit with China climbed to $29.09 billion in the first 10 months of 1995 from $24.59 billion in the same period in 1994.
Mr. Kantor and several economists said new trade agreements with other countries and a renewed competitiveness by American companies had helped to increase exports. But, noting that exports dipped slightly in October, they also said that any strengthening in the dollar's value, making United States goods more expensive, and the sluggish nature of the Japanese and European economies, could choke out some of that growth.
Gary C. Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said the latest trade numbers were "slightly better than one might have expected," and he said he expected a continued decline in the overall deficit.
But he also said that "the bigger story is the softness of the U.S. economy," which is improving the balance of trade by slowing purchases of imports by American consumers.
Indeed, the Commerce Department report showed that while exports of American goods and services rose from $64.68 billion last June to $66.75 billion in October, imports dropped from $76.06 billion to $74.79 billion over the same period.
Others, such as Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a former Commerce Department official and a critic of some of Japan's trading practices, said they found the Commerce Department report to be "discouraging" because it showed that the United States deficits were still growing with several of its leading trading partners.
Besides the problems with Japan and China, the report showed that trade deficits had worsened with both Canada and Mexico, the country's partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement.
In addition, America's trade deficit with Western Europe jumped to $1.15 billion in October from $125 million in September, possibly reflecting Europe's growing economic woes.
Commerce Department officials cautioned that such figures could be misleading because the total trade deficit is adjusted for seasonal variations in economic activity, but the country-by-country figures are not.
But Mr. Prestowitz, now president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington, said he was concerned by the numbers.
"Mexico's economy is slowing," he said, "and the forecast is that it will not be robust and Europe will not be robust." In addition, he said, "We have a chronic, big trade deficit with Canada."
Among industrial sectors, some of the biggest declines in October occurred in exports of autos and auto parts, which slipped to $4.77 billion in October from $5.6 billion in September. Imports dropped even more, to $9.51 billion from $10.42 billion.
Imports of foreign oil also declined, to $4.25 billion in October from $4.78 billion in September.
Given the delay in releasing the October figures, economists expect the Commerce Department to follow in early February with the November totals, bringing the trade picture more up to date.
The Japanese Government is expected to report its 1995 trade figures soon, and most experts believe they will show that Japan's huge trade surplus shrank for the first time in five years. If that is so, it could ease trade tensions between Japan and the United States and help keep the dollar strong.

HEADLINE: Panel Proposes a Flat Tax But Fails to Specify the Rate

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
A private commission on tax reform created last year by Republican leaders in Congress today stepped into a central issue in the campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination and recommended that the wages and salaries of all Americans, from corporate magnates to manual laborers, be taxed at a single, low rate.
But the commission stopped short of proposing what that rate should be and avoided, as have the Republican candidates, the politically delicate matter of who might owe more taxes and who might owe less under what is known as a flat tax. The commission also did not address what the effect would be on the budget deficit and whether tax deductions for mortgage interest payments and charitable donations should be retained. 
 This lack of specificity means that the report will have little effect on the flat tax debate among Republican candidates, and probably even less on Congress.
Because the flat tax became such a hot political issue within the party, the commission, officially called the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, was unable to satisfy what Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, and Speaker Newt Gingrich originally saw as its objective, which was to unify Republicans on the question of taxes.
Republican Presidential candidates are already offering rival versions of flat taxes.
Steve Forbes, the publishing executive, gained attention in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the first contests for the nomination will be held next month, with his proposal for a flat tax of 17 percent. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas tried to gain an advantage over Mr. Forbes today by proposing a 16 percent rate. Patrick J. Buchanan, the commentator, would favor a flat tax if it continued tax deductions for mortgage interest payments and charitable contributions, but he places greater emphasis on high tariffs on imports.
Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee oppose the idea of a flat tax but favor other sweeping changes in the tax system.
Senator Dole of Kansas, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, said today at a news conference where the commission report was made public that he could not support any measure that would increase the Federal budget deficit or shift the tax burden toward the middle class and away from the wealthy. And every plan that has been offered so far would almost certainly do one or the other or both.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin issued a statement saying, "Every Republican flat tax we have seen either explodes the deficit or raises income taxes on middle-income families."
Even the most ardent proponents of overhauling the nation's tax system acknowledge that despite all the political talk about taxes, Congress will not vote on the matter this year. The commission report, said Jeff Levey, who follows tax policy developments for Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm, "is just another sort of blip in a lot of blips we're going to see in the next year about tax restructuring."
Under the current system, Federal income tax rates range from 15 percent for taxpayers with modest incomes to nearly 40 percent for the wealthiest.
Mr. Dole and Mr. Gingrich, who together created the commission, tried to put the best face on its report today, not endorsing any proposal specifically but saying it provided an opening for a full-scale debate over how to change the tax system.
Perhaps to draw attention away from divisions within the Republican Party, Mr. Gingrich challenged President Clinton to join a Republican effort to change the tax system or to defend the current system, a challenge the President could hardly accept.
Asked at the news conference why the commission had avoided dealing with specifics, its chairman, Jack F. Kemp, the former Housing Secretary and Republican Congressman from Buffalo, replied, "We're not going to get sidetracked into issues like which deductions are most important."
Mr. Kemp said his personal preference was that the flat tax rate be no higher than 19 percent. The commission said only that the rate should be "as low as possible."
Others on the 14-member commission, a cross-section of Republicans who have been successful in fields outside the Federal Government, included two former Governors, Pete du Pont of Delaware and Carroll Campbell of South Carolina; Theodore J. Forstmann, the investment banker, and John Snow, chairman and president of the CSX Corporation in Richmond.
In a step that would be especially beneficial to upper-income taxpayers, the commission proposed abolishing altogether taxation of interest, dividends, capital gains and estates.
For those less well-to-do, the commission would allow a large personal exemption and permit workers to deduct from their income taxes the money withheld from their paychecks for Social Security and Medicare.
It would thus appear that almost everyone would have lower taxes, obviously a politically attractive proposition. There were no suggestions of where spending might be lowered to offset the tax cuts.
In the 1970's, Mr. Kemp was one of the first prominent politicians to embrace the supply-side theory of economics, which holds that lower tax rates would lead to such growth in the economy that tax receipts would actually increase.
The theory became less fashionable when the Federal budget deficit mushroomed after President Ronald Reagan's deep tax cuts in the early 1980's.
But Mr. Kemp said today that if the commission's recommendations were adopted, economic growth in the years ahead would double, leading to lower interest rates, more jobs and higher revenue for the Government.
The six principles advocated by the commission could hardly be objected to by anyone: economic growth through incentives to work, save and invest; fairness for all taxpayers; simplicity so that anyone can figure it out; neutrality so that people rather than the Government make economic decisions, visibility so that taxpayers know the cost of government, and stability so that the future can be planned for.
The problem is that some of those bromides are contradictory. For example, as a rule, the simpler a tax code is, the more unfair it tends to be; the fairer the law, the more complicated it is likely to be.
There is no mystery to why the idea of a flat tax is appealing. The existing tax system can be maddeningly complicated and expensive to comply with. It rewards consumption and penalizes savings, exactly the opposite of economic common sense. And in many cases it is clearly unfair -- for example, many working couples pay substantially higher taxes on their joint return than do unmarried couples who live together and file separate returns.
But as is the case with balancing the budget and improving the health care system, the problems with the tax law cannot be fixed easily. The more the layers of the problem are peeled away, the less attractive each proposed solution becomes.
The flat tax tends to founder politically because in the end, voters are more interested in what happens to their own taxes than they are in the principles of taxation.
Unless one accepts supply-side economic principles in full -- and relatively few economists do -- then someone's taxes must be increased to offset those whose taxes are cut or the deficit will expand again as it did in the 1980's.
Lowering the top rate substantially and ending taxation of interest, dividends, capital gains and estates is bound to help the wealthy. So the tax increases must be borne by those who are not wealthy -- as is the case with most voters.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
A Sense of Where He Is and Why He Stays There

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:

TIME PRESENT, TIME PAST
A Memoir
By Bill Bradley
Illustrated. 442 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.
What raises Bill Bradley's new book above the usual public figure's memoir is the engagingly fluid way the narrative moves from the personal to the historical to whatever message Senator Bradley wants to convey. 
 For instance, early in "Time Present, Time Past," in a chapter titled "The Garden," the author recalls returning to Madison Square Garden in 1992 to deliver one of three keynote addresses at the Democratic National Convention. This allows him first to touch upon his career as a professional basketball player with the New York Knicks and how he "emerged as role model for many slow-footed white boys"; then to digress at candid length on his "deficiency as a speaker and as a television performer," and finally to deliver the point of his convention speech, which is also the message of this book: that "our challenge as a party and a nation" is to "stop the random violence of our cities, rebuild economic opportunity and jobs for all and provide the moral leadership worthy of our ideals."
 Or, for another example, in a chapter called "The Creedal Society," he moves from the German ancestry of his mother to the history of German immigrants in America, to the German background of his wife, Ernestine, to the experiences ofother nationalities in this country, to his position on immigration policy, to his hopes for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Out of this emerges an appealing portrait of a public figure who seems real, with passions and ideals rooted in his upbringing and heritage. In the best passages he doesn't just advocate positions; he explains how large ideas can be translated into effective action. His several chapters on the United States Senate are fascinating mixtures of gossip, history and advice on how to get things done.
Surprisingly, senators still depend on the currency of one another's word. "But listen very carefully," Senator Bradley advises, "so that you don't hear only what you want to hear." Surprising too is the question he raises of how many votes have been sold within the Senate "for extra paper, more space or an additional pay line for a staff member." His answer: "more than the public knows." Yet if he's good on such details, he's equally engrossing in a chapter called "The Big Picture," where he describes the strategies he used to push legislation on tax reform, third world debt and the distribution of water in the West.
Unfortunately, after a while his mix of memoir and advocacy begins to seem schematic, and you get the sense that you're reading well-crafted position papers on subjects like the role of the United States as a leader in the world, the failure of labor unions, the future of race relations, the excesses of the media, the emergence of women in politics, what we owe American Indians and the plight of the middle class.
What Senator Bradley has to say on these subjects may well be compelling, as is his concern over the pressures being exerted on American society by the transition we are undergoing from a manufacturing economy to an information-based economy. In the new era, "neither capital, labor nor raw materials will be as important as knowledge -- its use and application."
Yet his delivery is just preachy enough to make you wonder if there is a hidden purpose behind "Time Present, Time Past," the title of which comes from T. S. Eliot's "Burnt Norton." Could the book be the announcement of a campaign for the Presidency, as the publication of Gen. Colin L. Powell's memoir, "My American Journey" was at one time thought to be? This was certainly a speculation when Senator Bradley announced last August that he would not run for re-election to the Senate this year.
But such speculation seems scotched by a chapter in the memoir called "Night Thoughts," where Senator Bradley spells out the various complex reasons he chose not to seek the Democratic nomination for President in 1992. Among these are his "skepticism about what any President could accomplish at our current national moment," his concern for his family's well-being, his "natural antipathy to the invasion by the press of all aspects" of his life, his continuing stage fright and "inability to rouse people as a speaker" and his "ingrained assumption (in refutation of which lay a lifetime of achievement) that this small-town boy could never win the biggest contest of all." Unhappily for his admirers, these reasons for not running are so convincingly a part of his self-portrait as to be persuasive.
On the other hand, at the same press conference at which he announced his decision not to run again for the Senate he described himself as "an inveterate scribbler" who for years had been recording his thoughts in college-rule notebooks with No. 2 pencils. So maybe this memoir really was written as a venture of self-discovery. Certainly the results are at once honest and complexly shaded enough to make this charming possibility seem altogether plausible.

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH: Olga Hirshhorn;
The Thrill of Art, Both Fine and Flea

BYLINE: By BARBARA GAMAREKIAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Olga Hirshhorn's normally cheery countenance was gloomy as she peered at the driving rain outside the window of her tiny carriage house in northwest Washington. Her regular Sunday excursion to the Georgetown flea market would have to be scuttled.
"Darn," she said. "I wanted to see if I couldn't get some material to match the pillows I bought last Sunday." From a cabinet, she pulled a Moroccan rug and several pillows in glorious hues of coral, gold, Chinese red and blue-green. "Aren't these colors wonderful? And I only paid $115! He wanted $120, but we flipped for it." 
 Olga Hirshhorn learned the fine art of wheeling and dealing from a master: her late husband, Joseph Hirshhorn, a self-made man who amassed much of his fortune exploring for oil in Canada. A collector of modern painting and sculpture, he also founded the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden here.
Mrs. Hirshhorn, 74, announced in March that she was donating her own collection of paintings, sculpture and works on paper, believed to be worth about $10 million, to the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. The decision surprised many in the museum world, who had assumed she would choose the Hirshhorn.
It was not an easy decision, she said, for she is close to the staff at the Hirshhorn. But she has long had ties to the Corcoran, one of the capital's few private museums, and has served on the board of the Corcoran School of Art since arriving here with her husband in 1977.
Mrs. Hirshhorn has always had an eye for color and design but said she knew nothing about contemporary art when she first met Joseph Hirshhorn in 1961 in her hometown of Greenwich, Conn. As Olga Zatorsky Cunningham, the owner of Services Unlimited, an employment agency, she received innumerable telephone inquiries about chauffeurs and upstairs maids from "a Mr. Hirshhorn" who had just bought a mansion on Round Hill.
"He was very abrupt," she said. "He'd order up a chauffeur like ordering a loaf of bread. And one day he asked me, 'Mrs. Cunningham, how old are you?' And I said: 'Forty-one. How old are you?' He said, 'I'm 64.' And then he asked, 'Mrs. Cunningham, how tall are you?' And I said 5 feet. I didn't ask how tall he was, because I knew he must be short."
Thus did romance bloom between the 5-foot-4-inch Joe Hirshhorn, who was separated from his third wife, and Mrs. Cunningham, who was separated from the schoolteacher husband she had married at 18.
Soon afterward she was invited to drop by his art-filled home. "I was overwhelmed at what I saw and said, 'My, you've got a lot of statues,' " she recalled. "He shook his finger at me and said: 'I don't have statues. I have sculpture.'
"That was my first lesson. The second lesson he taught me was to never say I didn't like a work of art, but to say I didn't understand it."
Two and a half years after they met, Mr. Hirshhorn announced, "If you lose 10 pounds I'll marry you."
"So I lost 10 pounds, very quickly I might say," she explained with a grin. "And we married about a month later."
Life with Mr. Hirshhorn, she said, was total immersion in the art world, for their friends were artists, dealers, collectors, art historians and museum people.
Slowly, she began to build her own collection, beginning with pieces given to her by her husband and artist friends. "The stories you may have heard about Joe's method of buying are true," she said. "He would go to the galleries and point to different things and say, 'I'll take that, that, that and that, and throw that little one in for Olga.' "
She delighted in her first purchase, a painting by Josef Albers. "Although I had many works of art at the time, I never had had the pleasure of choice," she said.
When she began to buy on her own she found that her credit was good. "I didn't have Joe Hirshhorn's money," she said. "But being his wife, I was able to buy things on time, and I would send different galleries $50 or $100 each month."
At her husband's death in 1981, his art collection went to the Hirshhorn Museum, and Mrs. Hirshhorn found herself with bare walls. Her own collection grew rapidly. Since his death, Mrs. Hirshhorn has lectured around the country and in India and Japan about "the Hirshhorn Museum and the Hirshhorn collection and my life with Joe and the artists we have known."
Asked what she most admired and remembered about her husband, she spoke of his sense of humor and zest for living. "For him, every day was Sunday," she said. "He wouldn't like my life style now, because he enjoyed a lot of servants around and a big house and fancy cars. I travel economy and carry my own luggage. It's easier. It's simpler."
It was she who introduced her husband to flea markets. "He thought he had died and gone to heaven," she said with a laugh, "because everything was so cheap."
She said that David C. Levy, the director of the Corcoran Gallery, shares her affinity for flea markets, recently appearing with his latest find: a vintage toaster to add to her collection of antique toasters.
"I've become very close to David and have watched the development of the Corcoran under his directorship," she said, "and I suddenly thought, That's the place for my collection! Because David really cares for that museum and that building and that art school. He wants it to be an important museum, and it will be."
And she is still collecting art. The telephone, which had already rung a dozen times this morning, rang again. It was Michael Clark, a Washington artist, who made a date to come by to hang one of his paintings, a recent acquisition. "I think I'll have him put it up there," Mrs. Hirshhorn said, pointing to a spot just below the 20-foot ceiling of her pint-size kitchen, already filled with art objects, among them a dozen antique toasters and small sculptures by Barbara Hepworth and Mark di Suvero.
A herb garden and a red ribbon at the gate welcome visitors to what Mrs. Hirshhorn calls her "Mouse House," just 500 square feet on three levels with winding stairs leading to a tiny bedroom in a turret. There, a trompe l'oeil ceiling created by Dana Westring, a Washington artist, depicts a deep blue sky studded with gold-leaf stars.
Antique necklaces frame the mirror in the bathroom, which is tucked midway up the staircase, and a peek into the medicine cabinet reveals pre-Columbian and Greek statuary. "There's always awful-looking stuff in medicine cabinets, and I thought I'd surprise my guests," she said.
Over the Victorian sofa (purchased at a yard sale for $6 in 1939) hangs a 19th-century Korean portrait scroll. Across the room, in an interplay of crimson, is a Kenneth Noland target painting, a wedding gift from the artist. There are tiny Calder bronzes and mobiles, Gorky drawings and small de Koonings and Picassos and O'Keeffes, many inscribed "to Olga." And 50 or more drawings, watercolors and etchings form a collage up the staircase.
"It's all touchable, all within arm's length," she said. "It's really a fun house, but living here is an exercise in discipline. After you read a newspaper or book, you have to throw it away." A necessity, given the fact she stores her voluminous art files in the oven and dishwasher.
"Look, isn't this neat?" she asked as she rummaged through the dishwasher, where pens and pencils were stacked in the silverware container. "Here are elastic bands and staples and my money belt and my 'fuzz buster.' I'm ready for a quick getaway."
She indulges her passion for cooking at her two other art-filled houses, on Martha's Vineyard and in Naples, Fla., where she has a waterside estate with eight bathrooms, acres of grapefruit, orange and kumquat trees and a screened-in pool.
On the Vineyard, where she has had a home for six years, she spent her first three summers restoring a barn, which serves as a guest house, and remodeling "a dumb ranch-style house" by raising the ceiling and adding a bay window and a dormer. Of course, both the barn and the house display enchanting works of art.
She relishes all three of her homes and the varying styles of living they provide for her, observing, "I haven't yet decided what is going to be the house of my last illness."
Once again, the telephone rang. It was Ira M. Lowe, a Washington lawyer who advises many artists.
"I'm going there for lunch, and I told him to put a potato on," she explained. "We do it often. Last time, we each had a baked white potato and a baked sweet potato, and he boiled some new potatoes. It's wonderful: you don't realize how much fun it can be to not make a big deal out of lunch."

HEADLINE: With Help of 'Seinfeld,' Legend in His Own Time;
The Real Kramer Tries to Capitalize

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
Seven years ago, when the comedians Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David were sitting in Mr. David's apartment creating a television show about a single comedian in New York, they based a character on the lanky bachelor living across the hall, an affable guy named Kenny Kramer who had no visible means of support and a lot of free time to spend on projects that didn't work out exactly as planned.
Today, the Kramer character on "Seinfeld" is an internationally renowned New Yorker, so famous that his real-life model has an idea for another project. Mr. Kramer, who still lives in the same midtown apartment, is starting up Kramer's Reality Tour, which he cheerfully calls "a shameless attempt to capitalize on my illustrious name and branded identity." 
 Beginning on Jan. 27 at the John Houseman Theater on West 42d Street, Mr. Kramer will show video clips, serve pizza and conduct bus tours of spots sacred to the legions of "Seinfeld" fans. It will be a mobile Off Broadway tribute to New York landmarks: the facade of the coffee shop where the "Seinfeld" characters meet; the bar where Kramer apologized for punching Mickey Mantle; the midtown office building where Kramer found someone to publish his coffee table book about coffee tables; the takeout shop on West 55th Street near Eighth Avenue with the great soup and notoriously strict chef.
The Real Kramer, as Mr. Kramer now calls himself, will also use the tour to differentiate reality from fiction, which gets a little tricky. On the show, Mr. Seinfeld plays himself, Jerry, a comedian living at 129 West 81st Street (Mr. Seinfeld's real former address, although the brick facade shown on television is actually an apartment building in Los Angeles, where the series is taped).
Mr. David, the show's executive producer, is roughly represented by George, a character who acts out Mr. David's most neurotic fantasies. Mr. Kramer is represented by Kramer, an unemployed schemer who lives across the hall from Jerry and likes to burst frantically through the door without warning.
In real life, Mr. Kramer and Mr. David lived across the hall from each other at Manhattan Plaza, the housing complex for performing artists at 43d Street and 10th Avenue. As incredible as it may seem to New Yorkers, these two single Manhattanites actually did leave their apartments unlocked and walk in on each other without knocking.
"Kenny was always coming up with these oddball schemes that sounded like they were made up for a television show," Mr. David recalled. "He'd talk you into doing something with him, and it would invariably turn out bad for you. He'd do something like disappear and leave you waiting in the car for an hour. This new idea, the Reality Tour, is something that the television Kramer would do. I hope it works out for Kenny better than most of Kramer's ideas on the show."
Mr. Kramer, 52, prides himself on never having had a straight job. He grew up in the Tremont section of the Bronx, dropped out of high school at 17, sold magazines door to door, played drums in a Catskills resort band and ended up working as a stand-up comedian for a decade. He gave up that career in 1981 when one of his ideas paid off: electronic disco jewelry.
"I hired handicapped workers to assemble earrings and other jewelry that lit up," Mr. Kramer said. "We'd attach a 15-cent red light to a 10-cent watch battery and sell it for $6 in the discos. People went crazy for it. It had this magical effect when you saw it glowing on someone's ear in the dark. That lasted for a couple of years, and it gave me a financial cushion."
Since the disco jewelry days, Mr. Kramer said, he has occupied himself coaching karate, managing an English rock-reggae band in Amsterdam, converting his bedroom into a mini-studio for recording jingles, promoting a coloring book on substance abuse and doing voice-overs for adult comic strips on CD-ROM. When the first "Seinfeld" episode was being written, he briefly lobbied to be allowed to play himself on the program, but he's now thankful that the actor Michael Richards was chosen instead.
"If I'd played Kramer, it never would have flown the way it has with Michael," Mr. Kramer said. "He's the one who came up with the weird clothes and the physical antics that have nothing to do with me. He has to figure a new way to walk in the door every week. It takes amazing preparation, minute detail and a lot of work."
Such discipline doesn't come naturally to the Real Kramer, which is why he has enlisted another neighbor, Bobby Allen Brooks, to direct and accompany him on the Reality Tour.
"My job," Mr. Brooks said, "is to make Kenny rehearse and make sure that we cover the necessary points during the tour, that Kenny doesn't spend the two-hour tours talking instead about the Internet, which is entirely possible."
The Real Kramer tried to be disciplined as he gave a preview of the Reality Tour last weekend. He walked up Ninth Avenue, pausing near 43d Street to point out Dak's Market, formerly Joe's Market, the name of the fruit stand from which the television Kramer was banned. "In the show it was Kramer who was banned from buying fruit there, but in real life it was Larry David," Mr. Kramer said. "He was squeezing."
Mr. Kramer pointed a few doors down to Kam Wei Kitchen, the Chinese restaurant whose delivery man actually helped Mr. David place a telephone order to China for an ointment purported to cure baldness.
"On the show, after the delivery guy helps George order the stuff, Kramer videotapes George's head so they can see later if any new hair comes in," he said. "In real life, I did that for Larry. We're going to show that videotape of his head during the tour."
Nearby, at the Westway Diner on Ninth Avenue, Mr. Kramer pointed out the booth next to the cash register where Mr. David and Mr. Seinfeld drew up early plans for their show ("a show about nothing," as George describes it to Jerry during the episode in which they're planning to write a show about themselves). Mr. Kramer sat down for a cup of coffee with his director, and for a moment his new discipline flagged.
It was a classically Krameresque situation. Mr. Brooks, hoping to sell some of the $27.50 tickets to the Reality Tour, wanted to tell a reporter the "800" number installed in Mr. Kramer's apartment for information. But Mr. Kramer didn't want it published.
"I've been giving that number to women at parties, and it's amazing how well it works," he said. "An '800' number is a great babe magnet. I don't want to tie up the line with a lot of other calls. Let people call the Houseman Theater if they want information."
Mr. Brooks was getting exasperated. "Here is the insanity of the Real Kramer. He's got the '800' number, he's got The New York Times here, and he'll throw it all away for the possibility of one night with a woman."
Mr. Kramer grinned and described how the Kramer character is endowed with "kavorca," the mysterious Latvian Orthodox "lure of the animal" that women find irresistible.
"When I'm asked how I feel about Kramer," he said, "I say, well, there's the yin and the yang. On the one hand, the show does paint me out to be a pretty messed-up doofus. But thank God they gave me some kavorca."
Mr. Kramer was eventually persuaded to give out the number -- (800) KRAMERS -- but he insisted that the Real Kramer was not about to become permanently disciplined. "I've promised myself that I'll work hard for two years so I can then officially retire," he said, explaining that he already envisions the day when Kramer's Reality Tour goes on without him.
"My goal," he said, "is to have an actor playing my part. That way we'll have art imitating life imitating art imitating life. And I can sit in the Jacuzzi back home."

HEADLINE: Market Closes Lower in Erratic Trading Day

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market zigzagged yesterday, declining late in the day, in a session marked by concern over the budget impasse in Washington and the state of the economy but buoyed by the continuing strength of the bond market.
Stock prices were generally up until an announcement that budget talks between President Clinton and the Republican Congressional leadership had been canceled. Prices then slid sharply, recovering from their lows of the session at the close. 
 "Everything seems to be on hold," Alan Ackerman, senior vice president of Fahnestock & Company, said. "There was not a lot of good news and leadership was tough to find."
The index of leading economic indicators for November showed a deeper-than-expected decline of three-tenths of 1 percent. "The underpinnings of the market are substantially weaker than they have been over the last year," Jerry Hegarty, an equity-market analyst for Thomson Research, said.
Bond prices surged again, with Treasury instruments enjoying their biggest two-day rally since August. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 22/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.01 percent, from 6.05 percent on Tuesday.
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 21.32 points, to close at 5,066.90, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index eased 2.07 points, to 606.37. But the Nasdaq composite index edged up 2.43 points, to 998.30.
Gainers narrowly exceeded losers on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,230 to 1,117. Big Board volume was slightly higher, with 459.4 million shares traded, compared with 425.2 million shares on Tuesday.
Some technology stocks were hurt by a perception that the industry's upward cycle had run its course. Intel, which reported disappointing earnings after the market closed on Tuesday, plummeted 5 3/4, to 50. Trading in its stock was so heavy yesterday -- 68.3 million shares changed hands -- that it set a new record for volume by a Nasdaq issue.
Microsoft, which is expected to report its fiscal second-quarter earnings today, retreated 1 1/2, to 84 7/8. Other technology stocks that finished on the minus side included Compaq, off 2 3/4, to 44; Hewlett-Packard, off 2 3/8, to 76 3/4, and Dell Computer, off 3 9/32, to 23 15/32.
Retail issues weakened in the wake of an announcement by Wal-Mart that it expected fiscal fourth-quarter profit to drop as much as 11 percent, after 99 consecutive quarterly gains. Wal-Mart closed at 20 3/8, down 2 1/8; Sears, Roebuck closed at 40, down 2 1/2, and Gap Inc. closed at 44, down 2.
With pulp prices in the doldrums, some paper companies inched downward. Georgia-Pacific declined 1/8, to 67 5/8; Union Camp fell 1/8, to 45 7/8, and the Nasdaq shares of Jefferson Smurfit dropped 1/8, to 11.
But airline stocks rose on prospects of a favorable outlook this year. Delta Air Lines gained 1, to 70 7/8; AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, increased 1/4, to 71 3/4, and UAL, United Airlines' parent, advanced 1/2, to 160.
Banking-company stocks were higher as the result of favorable earnings reports and lower interest rates. Citicorp closed at 69 3/8, up 1 1/8; Chemical Banking rose to 59 1/2, up 1, and Chase Manhattan closed at 61 7/8, also up 1.
Brokerage issues also gained, amid anticipation of forthcoming solid earnings reports. Merrill Lynch advanced 1 7/8, to 54 7/8; Paine Webber added 3/4, to 19 1/4, and Charles Schwab rose 1 1/8, to 21.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Predicts First Slide In Earnings; Stock Falls 9.4%

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
For the first time in more than 25 years as a public business, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, will report lower quarterly earnings, the company said yesterday in a terse statement. Its shares fell $2.125, or 9.4 percent, to $20.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The news ends a long volume in one of the business world's greatest growth stories. It was a tale that encompassed the transformation of American retailing and the building of one of the nation's largest fortunes. 
 For the quarter ending on Jan. 31, Wal-Mart predicted earnings of 40 cents to 42 cents a share, down from 45 cents for the corresponding quarter last year. The company blamed several factors: a slow Christmas season, higher operating costs, lower margins and a January that has favored shoveling, not shopping.
Analysts, though aware that Wal-Mart's growth was slowing, had expected 47 cents a share. They predicted yesterday that the company's earnings would be bumpier than before, but that the chain would fare better than other discounters whose woes are much worse.
"Retailers have had a difficult year and a very difficult Christmas season," said Bernard Sosnick, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. "Wal-Mart was able to outrun such problems in the past, but wasn't this time."
Wal-Mart's news, which cut $4.6 billion from the company's stock market value, also sliced into other retailing stocks. Shares of Dayton Hudson, Federated, Sears and J. C. Penney fell also fell yesterday.
Retailers have called their Christmas season the worst since the 1990-91 recession, as consumers deeply in debt shunned almost everything that was not marked down. Retailers, meanwhile, had expanded more rapidly than their sales in recent years. Among Wal-Mart's competitors, Kmart, the second-largest discount chain, has fallen far behind, while Caldor and Bradlees filed last year for bankruptcy.
"You've got a bad long-term trend in a bad short-term environment," said Linda T. Christiansen, an analyst at Schroder Wertheim & Company. For Wal-Mart in particular, "it's been increasingly rocky for the last few years, so I see this continuing."
Wal-Mart, which will report the quarterly results on Feb. 27, said that despite the fourth-quarter results, its earnings for the full year will still reach a record $2.7 billion.
With more than 2,600 stores in all 50 states, Wal-Mart is still finding more places to plant its "We Sell for Less" signs. Its foreign expansion appears to be just beginning, and its supercenters, which include grocery stores, are proving popular. But its penetration in the Northwest and Northeast has been limited, and sometimes sharply opposed. And in many regions, its Wal-Mart stores and Sam's Clubs face crowded and mature markets.
Having invested heavily in inventory and distribution systems, Wal-Mart has the lowest expenses in the business. But in the current quarter, those expenses have been higher than the company expected, for reasons it did not detail.
Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., made the Waltons one of the nation's wealthiest families. But the stock no longer paces the market. Even before yesterday's news, the stock was well off its 1995 high of $27.625 a share. At its current levels of around $20, it is appropriately priced, according to Mr. Sosnick, the analyst.

When Victor Spivak joined forces in 1993 with two other immigrants from the former Soviet Union, their export trading company was little more than a cramped studio apartment in New York.
But now the 27-year-old Mr. Spivak is riding the crest of a booming export business. His enterprise -- the Ascop Company -- has some 180 employees and customers from St. Petersburg to Novosibirsk. 
 He owes it all to chicken.
In a scant three years, Russia has become the biggest export market for American poultry, with chicken exports soaring from $81 million in 1993 to $303 million in 1994. And 1995 was another record-setting year, with more than $500 million in sales, according to Agriculture Department estimates.
Even these statistics do not tell the whole story. American officials say millions of dollars of frozen chicken is being shipped from the United States through Eastern Europe to avoid Russia's hefty tariffs. Specialists at the American Embassy in Moscow say actual exports may be twice the official figure.
The stampede began after Russian poultry production plummeted in the economic upheaval that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, and Americans rushed in to fill the void. With money scarce, demand was high for low-cost meat, and "chicken is the cheapest protein in Russia," said August Schumacher, director of the Agriculture Department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
One twist is that since health-conscious Americans have been trained by years of advertising to prefer white meat, Russians are getting the dark meat -- which they prefer anyway. And because the Bush Administration gave exports a strong shove, Russian consumers dubbed the first influx of packaged chicken parts "Nozhki Busha," or "Bush legs."
The exports are so visible that chicken has already been caught up in the rising tide of nationalism in Russia, with angry poultry producers contending that the imports are part of a Western plan to destroy Russian chicken production and capture the market.
In the United States, the growing Russian market is big news for leading poultry producers, like Tyson Foods Inc., the Arkansas giant, which recently opened a Moscow office, and for trading companies like Ascop and its overseas rivals, like the Russian importer Soyuzcontract.
"Maybe 70 percent of poultry in Russian cities is imported," Mr. Schumacher said. "When you see trade go from nothing to $500 million in three to four years, that beats selling notebook computers."
Ascop's story, though, is not just a tale of enterprising immigrants with a feel for the Russian market. It is also a story about Russia's erratic transition to a capitalist economy, its sagging agricultural production, the differing tastes of American and Russian consumers and even superpower politics.
The United States had exported chicken to Russia in the past, but those exports were eroded by political tensions and by subsidized exports from Western Europe and Brazil.
As relations warmed between Moscow and Washington, though, the Bush Administration offered American exporters loan guarantees to promote the sale of chicken leg quarters to Russia.
The idea was simple. Having spent no small amount of advertising dollars to persuade American consumers to purchase white meat, which has less fat and is used in fast-food chicken sandwiches and the ubiquitous chicken nuggets, American producers had a lot of dark meat on their hands.
But Russians preferred dark meat, both for its taste and because it could be used in soups. Also, without the benefits of sophisticated genetic engineering, breast meat in Russian chickens was stringy and unappealing.
The next big lift came from the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and Russia's unsteady progress toward market reforms. Russian chicken production has always been inefficient compared with that of the United States, but economic upheaval took a further heavy toll.
Feed companies were privatized, and the price of Russian chicken feed, which is often of poor quality, rose. Meanwhile, state subsidies to chicken producers were cut off. According to American estimates, Russian poultry production fell 40 percent from 1991 through 1995.
Ascop's managers saw the opportunity early on. Mr. Spivak, who was born in Kiev, emigrated to the United States as a boy, graduating from Northeastern University.
The other principals in the company now are Simon Dikker, who emigrated from Moldova, and Sergy Sparilis, who left Uzbekistan, as well as Michael Varshisky, who came from Novosibirsk.
At first, Ascop traded in metals. "The purpose of the company was simple: trade with Russia," Mr. Spivak recalled. "It was strictly opportunistic."
But Mr. Spivak had his eye on frozen food, and soon after he joined the company it began to charter ships and fill them with frozen poultry for export to Russia. Its first shipment was in April 1993.
Even then, some American poultry companies were skeptical that the trade in chicken would really take off, Mr. Spivak recalled. Meanwhile, distributors in Russia were still learning about the trade, which led to some setbacks. Some chicken in an early shipment to St. Petersburg spoiled when the Russian buyer failed to manage the cargo properly.
But gradually the business took off. In 1995, Ascop exported about $180 million worth of frozen poultry to Russia, about a third of the officially recorded trade, Mr. Spivak said. The company also distributes their chicken by rail to cities throughout Russia.
"Everyone from babushkas to C.E.O.'s" buys it, Mr. Spivak said. "The Russian food industry is depleted." He said Ascop had a profit margin of about 10 percent.
"They have the Russian connections," said Dale Posthumus, a consultant on trade with Russia. "They work in between the suppliers and importers. They have good relations with the major importers."
Big agricultural producers, like Tyson and Goldkist, have benefited handsomely as well despite sizable tariffs, which were increased last year from 20 to 25 percent. The Russians have also imposed an 11.5 percent value-added tax on imports.
Archie Schaffer, a Tyson spokesman, said that exports accounted for about 10 percent of the company's $5.5 billion in annual sales and that Russia was the largest foreign customer.
Bob Anthony, chairman of American Poultry International, a consortium of American poultry exporters, said the going rate for dark meat was about 45 cents a pound and ranged as high as 52 cents for chicken prepared for export and packed on cargo ships, double the price before the current boom.
Even with the tariffs, though, it has been hard for Russian poultry producers to compete. Russian producers must receive 10,000 rubles a kilo -- about $2.10 -- to break even, according to an American Government analysis. But imported poultry sells for about 8,500 rubles a kilo in Moscow and other Russian cities.
Indeed, the export business is becoming institutionalized. This month, Russian veterinarians started inspections of about 360 American poultry plants, a condition the Russians insisted on to insure quality control.
"We get calls weekly from people in Russia," said Toby Moore, a spokesman for the United States Poultry and Egg Export Council, an industry trade association based in Atlanta. American companies, Mr. Moore added, are "making money hand over fist."
For the American poultry industry, foreign sales, which now make up about 15 percent of the expanding poultry market, are no longer merely a means of handling excess production. They have become an integral and lucrative part of the market.
American officials project a 5 percent increase in exports for 1996, a respectable increase but a far cry from the sharp rises of past years. But Mr. Anthony said he expected exports to Russia to continue to grow at a higher rate.
"The question is," observed Mr. Schumacher, "is this sustainable?"
And will it be politically viable? "Low prices and huge volumes of imported poultry may strengthen the anti-trade positions of the Communist and Agrarian Parties before the Presidential elections in June 1996," according to a report from the American Embassy in Moscow.
The pressure from Russian producers could lead to still higher tariffs or new subsidies at home in the short term. Grigory Nerubenko, the head of the Russian association of poultry producers, has appealed for as much as 2 trillion rubles, or up to $430 million in subsidies.
But there is a powerful countervailing pressure that is likely to keep the market open to foreign exports: the demand by Russian consumers for lower-cost meat.
In effect, the politics of chicken pits Russia's consumer-packed urban areas against Russian producers, and Russian mayors have proved to be a powerful friend of the consumer.
Mr. Posthumus noted that American companies were considering how to diversify beyond Bush legs to processed chicken foods like chicken meal for sausage, chicken fast-food nuggets and chicken franks, which are already sold in Russia.
But Mr. Spivak is concentrating on how to improve Ascop's distribution and is not worried that Russian producers may grab back the trade. The Russian agricultural sector, he said, has "a lot of problems which will take a very long time to solve."

HEADLINE: Michigan Moves to Untie Joblessness and Welfare

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: LANSING, Mich., Jan. 17

 BODY:
Gov. John Engler, a darling of Congressional Republicans for his efforts to pare welfare rolls, announced tonight an experimental project seeking to eliminate unemployment among welfare recipients in six areas of Michigan.
The plan calls for caseworkers to visit all those areas' welfare recipients at home and offer them job-hunting assistance, free or subsidized transportation to jobs and subsidized child care. Under a provision of the plan that, unlike others, would require Federal approval, any recipient who was capable of working but declined to do so would lose all benefits. 
 "We will measure success not by the number of families that are getting government checks, but by the number of families that are earning paychecks and don't need us anymore," Mr. Engler said in his State of the State Message to the Michigan Legislature tonight.
With Federal social policy frozen as a result of Washington's lengthy budget dispute, the nation's real policy changes are coming piecemeal in state capitals across the country. But while many governors have begun to give their annual addresses to state legislatures, Michigan's pioneering role in welfare policy made the project that Mr. Engler announced tonight one of the most widely awaited.
The program, called Project Zero because the goal is zero unemployment among welfare recipients, incorporates many elements of welfare policy changes approved with little fanfare by the State Legislature last month. Sheldon Danziger, a professor of social work and public policy at the University of Michigan, said the program appeared to be the most ambitious of those now under way in 25 to 30 states that are aimed at putting welfare recipients to work. Most of those programs have sought to reduce unemployment among recipients, rather than eliminate it entirely as Michigan's would.
But one of the most striking features of the project is the extent to which it differs from the Federal welfare legislation that Congressional Republicans have been unable to persuade President Clinton to sign.
While the Michigan program would deny welfare benefits to recipients who refused to look for a job, it would not set any limit on the length of time that beneficiaries could collect welfare if they did try to work.
In contrast, the Republican Congressional bill, vetoed once by Mr. Clinton and now part of Washington's broader budget debate, would limit eligibility to five years, a provision that is a big source of the welfare savings the Republicans seek. Mr. Clinton himself has endorsed a two-year time limit, but with many exceptions.
Governor Engler's plan also omits the Congressional Republicans' controversial provision denying benefits to children born to women already on welfare.
And Michigan recipients who could not find paying jobs would be allowed to perform volunteer community service to retain their welfare benefits, a provision that many Congressional Republicans have opposed.
In addition, the Governor's plan calls for the state to provide subsidized child care and transportation for welfare recipients who are willing to take jobs, going somewhat further than Republicans in Congress in guaranteeing the availability of those services.
These differences are only the latest sign that Republican governors are reluctant to pursue the kinds of changes envisioned by House Republicans. Mr. Engler, himself a conservative Republican, has been a strong advocate of Congressional Republican efforts to turn Federal welfare spending into block grants to the states. But while many Republican conservatives in Congress have tried to link these block grants to a variety of social policies, Mr. Engler has led Republican governors over the last year in contending that states should have nearly complete freedom in spending the money.
The project that Governor Engler announced tonight is to begin on April 1 and last a year. It will be carried out in a poor Detroit neighborhood; in Romulus, a Detroit suburb, and in four rural counties.
"If it does what I'm sure it will do, the project will then go statewide," said Gerald H. Miller, director of Michigan's Department of Social Services.
As a result of an earlier initiative by Mr. Engler, which required a Federal waiver, Michigan already reduces benefits by 25 percent for welfare recipients who refuse to work. But the new program's provision eliminating such recipients' benefits entirely could not take effect without further Federal approval. A stipulation allowing such policies at the state level is included in the Congressional Republicans' welfare bill.
Mr. Miller said he expected the Governor's program to pay for itself through lower welfare payments. But Professor Danziger, of the University of Michigan, was skeptical. "I don't know of any of the other state demonstration projects that have been able to save money" in the first couple of years, he said.
Timothy M. Smeeding, an economics professor at Syracuse University, said many beneficiaries of Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the main Federal welfare program, might be unable to work. Some studies have shown that up to 40 percent of the recipients have learning disabilities, drug abuse problems or other difficulties.
Mr. Miller said he doubted the studies. The truly disabled should be receiving disability benefits, not welfare, he said. But there are people working in Michigan now, he added, "who five years ago, even one year ago, were in a state institution."
Michigan has had one of the best success rates in the nation recently in putting welfare recipients to work. Employment among recipients stood at 30.9 percent in December, more than three times the national average.
Partly because of his visibility on welfare policy, Mr. Engler has been rumored to be a prospective Republican Vice-Presidential nominee. But although he emphasized the national implications of his welfare policies in his speech tonight, he said in an interview afterward that he had not discussed the nomination with any of the Republican Presidential candidates.

With club owners on the verge of approving regular-season games matching teams in the American League against teams in the National, the issue of the designated hitter threatened today to undermine the revolutionary concept before it can be implemented.
The owners plan to vote on interleague play, something that has never existed in Major League Baseball except for the World Series, at their joint meeting Thursday. The ruling executive council voted unanimously Tuesday night to recommend its adoption on an experimental basis for the 1997 season, and the owners discussed the plan at their separate league meetings today. 
 But even if the owners vote for the plan, which they are expected to do with perhaps only minor opposition, they would have to negotiate it with the Players Association. By itself, interleague play most likely would not present any problems for the union. But the status of the designated hitter would be another matter.
In a possible scenario suggested today by comments from people on the two sides of the labor fence, the union could propose, as a way of creating the same rules in both leagues, adding the designated hitter to the National League instead of eliminating it from the American League, and the N.L. owners could opt to scuttle interleague play instead of adopting the d.h.
Under the plan presented to the owners for interleague play, teams in one league would match up with teams in the same division in the other league. Teams in the five-team East and Central Divisions would play three games with each of their counterparts in the other league for a total of 15. This would allow, for example, the Yankees and the Mets to meet three times, as well as the White Sox and the Cubs.
Teams in the four-team West Divisions would play four games with each other for a total of 16. The 162-game schedule would be maintained, with a team playing 11 or 12 games with the other teams in its league.
"I'm sure the players will be sensitive to what the fans want in terms of interleague play," Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said by telephone from New York. He also said the union would discuss with the owners the elimination of the designated hitter if they propose it.
But noting there would be "enormous complications" in taking that step, Orza then said: "It never comes up in the context of instituting the d.h. in the National League. If the elimination of the d.h. is proposed toward alleviating a problem, it's equally eliminated by not eliminating the d.h. but doubling it. It's interesting that that side of the case is never raised. Why is the elimination of the d.h. the proposed solution rather than the expansion of the d.h. the proposed solution?"
But some National League owners and executives quickly rejected that notion when it was presented to them.
"I'd be less interested in interleague play if we had to keep the d.h.," said Peter Magowan, owner of the San Francisco Giants, who favors interleague play. Asked if the d.h. could be a make-or-break issue, he said, "I think so."
Larry Lucchino, president of the San Diego Padres, who previously served the Baltimore Orioles in that capacity, said he would like to see interleague play on the limited basis that has been discussed but not if the plan would mean the d.h. in the National League.
"We wouldn't be inclined to accept that compromise, just speaking for the Padres," he said. "I'm not sure the National League adopting the d.h. is a compromise. That's a major change."
Few on the management side would acknowledge it, but the desire to eliminate the designated hitter is more an economic issue than one of the sanctity of the nine-man lineup. By adopting wild-card playoff teams and their intention to adopt interleague play, owners have expressed their contempt for traditionalist thinking in baseball in light of their need to generate additional revenue.
The designated hitter has been used in the American League since 1973, and those who serve in the role are generally veteran, productive players who are among the highest-paid in the game. Last season, the average salary for 10 regular designated hitters was $3,458,573, second in the American League only to the average pay for first basemen of $3,570,603. The previous two seasons the average d.h. salary was the highest in the league.
Among last season's regular designated hitters were Edgar Martinez, Eddie Murray, Paul Molitor, Juan Gonzalez, Jose Canseco and Chili Davis.
The working plan for the 1997 season, said Drayton McLane, the Houston Astros' owner and chairman of the strategic planning committee, is to follow the system that is used in the World Series: The d.h. is in the lineup for American League home games but not for National League home games.
Many people in baseball find that system a poor compromise because it creates two sets of rules for the World Series, and it penalizes the A.L. teams because they use the d.h. all season, then cannot use him for the most important series of the year, while being forced to use pitchers who often have not batted for years.
Marge Schott, owner of the Cincinnati Reds, said she doesn't like the d.h., but she said she wasn't sure she liked interleague play either.
"I think we're making a lot of changes too fast," she said. "We should give some more thought to what's good for the fans and everything. I think people were very confused in the playoffs. Who's playing who and what's what? I was confused by that. I guess tradition is what I think baseball is all about. I think you have to be very careful on this type of thing."
Pat Gillick, the senior general manager in the major leagues, said it would "make more sense" to add the d.h. to the National League but offered two reasons why it probably wouldn't happen: money and N.L. stubbornness.

HEADLINE: When AIDS Patients Confront the Managed-Care System

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Managed care companies and other health insurers have incentives to provide a lesser quality of care to chronically ill patients (front page, Jan. 15). If a managed care company were to provide superior care to its sickest patients, it would be flooded with such patients during the next enrollment period, raising its costs relative to competitors'. 
 Countries like Israel and the Netherlands provide reimbursement subsidies to managed care plans that enroll a greater number of elderly in their case mix and are devising methods to provide additional reimbursement to plans that enroll a greater number of the chronically ill. The United States should follow their lead.

HEADLINE: Gramm Adds Voice to Calls In the G.O.P. for Flat Tax

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Formally joining the Republican chorus calling for a flat tax, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas today proposed taxing income at 16 percent, edging a rival Presidential candidate, Steve Forbes, by one percentage point.
While Mr. Forbes would tax only earned income at 17 percent, Mr. Gramm said he would tax investment income as well. Unlike Mr. Forbes, Senator Gramm would preserve deductions for mortgage interest and for donations to charities. 
 The proposal was included in what Mr. Gramm called "an eight-year program to change America, to bring back the American dream and to share that dream with people who missed it the first time around."
The program, which he outlined in a speech to the Cato Institute, a conservative research organization, brought together many ideas that Mr. Gramm, a former economics professor, has proposed before. He has been offering them piecemeal in Iowa and New Hampshire as he has scrambled to elbow aside Mr. Forbes and establish himself as the most credible challenger to Senator Bob Dole, the clear front-runner in the two states and nationally. Mr. Dole has said he might support a flat tax but has yet to propose his own plan.
Today, Mr. Gramm projected numerous, specific benefits from his economic plan. He said that by the end of the eighth year of a Gramm administration, his plan would expand the number of jobs nationally to 142 million from 125 million; would raise average income for a family of four to $57,500 from $45,000, in 1994 dollars, and would move 9.7 million people out of poverty.
In a recent interview, Mr. Gramm denied that he was advocating a flat tax to horn in on what has proved a potent issue for Mr. Forbes. "I was for a flat tax, a variant of it, in 1976," he said, when he taught economics at Texas A&M. Asked if he would be raising the idea now if Mr. Forbes had not, he said, "I didn't even know Forbes in 1976."
But Mr. Forbes took credit for the idea today, saying in a prepared statement: "I'm delighted that Senator Gramm has finally seen the light on the flat tax, even if it's an election-year conversion. I hope his conversion is more than poll deep."
Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator who is seeking the Republican nomination, has proposed a version of a flat tax, and other candidates have discussed the idea. A commission headed by Jack F. Kemp today supported one without specifying a rate.
Like Mr. Forbes, Mr. Gramm would not tax inheritance. But in other respects, the two tax plans differ significantly, in part because Mr. Gramm would tax unearned income, like capital gains. Mr. Forbes, a multimillionaire, has been attacked by his rivals for proposing a plan that would enable wealthy investors to escape tax on a large part of their income.
"I reject the idea that income derived from labor should be taxed, and that income derived from capital should not be taxed," Mr. Gramm said. He called Mr. Forbes's approach "totally unfair, totally indefensible" and argued that it would distort investment.
Mr. Gramm posed the example of a father who sends one child to Stanford to become a doctor, while giving the other an equal amount of money to invest. Why, he asked, should the first child pay taxes on income, while the second does not?
In his statement, Mr. Forbes said: "Although Senator Gramm doesn't understand it, one of the virtues of a flat tax is that all income is taxed at its source, including investment income. Investment income is effectively taxed at the corporate level, not the personal level." In other words, Mr. Forbes would tax corporate profits only when the company earns the money, not again when it pays it out to stockholders in the form of dividends.
For a family of four, Mr. Gramm's rate of 16 percent would apply on income over $32,000, an amount he said could rise to $40,000 over eight years. For the same family, Mr. Forbes's 17 percent tax would start on income over $36,000.
Mr. Gramm said that his plan could cause a shortfall in Federal revenue of about $40 billion in its first year but that spending cuts would take care of the gap.
Critics of flat-tax proposals have argued that they could raise taxes for some middle-income families. But Mr. Gramm said his plan was "structured to try to guarantee that no middle class American will pay more taxes than they do now."
Mr. Gramm also said his program would balance the budget in four years and then enact a "spending pause" over the following four years to limit the Government's growth to the rate of inflation. He also called for a one-year moratorium on Federal regulations, beginning in 1997, except in cases of imminent danger to human health and safety.
And Mr. Gramm defended his support of free-trade agreements. "If there's anything we've learned in American history, it is that trade produces prosperity and opportunity," Mr. Gramm said. "Trade won the cold war."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Gain Despite Budget Block

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Against a backdrop of fresh economic data and on-again, off-again budget negotiations, prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday, especially in the long maturities.
The price of the 30-year bond gained 22/32 of a percentage point, to 111 30/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to 6.01 percent, from 6.05 percent on Tuesday. 
 Included in the economic statistics released yesterday were the trade balance numbers for October, leading indicators and the Federal Reserve's so-called beige book of business activity as reported by the 12 regional Fed banks. The Fed report showed the economy growing at a slow pace and almost inflation free.
Analysts say the beige report is forward looking and therefore may carry more influence than usual at this month's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee because of the partial shutdown that delayed the release of economic indicators from the Commerce and Labor Departments, meaning those reports are unusually lagging. The meeting will take place on Jan. 30 and 31, about six weeks after the last meeting, when the committee lowered the Federal funds rate for overnight bank loans by a quarter of a percentage point.
Leading indicators for November posted their third consecutive monthly decline, as the index dropped by three-tenths of 1 percent, though the components were incomplete. The Federal shutdown delayed the release of the new orders, contracts and orders, and unfilled orders data, excluding these components from the November index.
Economists said an announcement by the Fed that the vice chairman, Alan Blinder, would step down and return to the academic sector had little impact on the market, since few thought it would change anything very much at the Fed.
However, the market did sag when it learned that the Republicans had canceled yesterday's scheduled budget talks, then recouped when Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, indicated that he and Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker, did talk with the President on the phone and that the talks were "frank and useful."
Louis G. Brien, an analyst with Rand Financial Services in Chicago, sees the budget stalemate as bullish, not bearish, for bonds. He believes that once a deal is struck, regardless of whether it favors Republican or Democratic policies, it will not actually reduce the deficit for a couple of years. "The stalemate, which has been perceived as such a bond market negative, might be bullish," he said.
Both sides in the negotiations, Mr. Brien said, are on the record that a Government shutdown is not in the cards. "This should remove any worry of default," he said.
"And if Newt Gingrich is correct and there is not a resolution until November, it means all funding will be stopgap," he continued. "All funding will have to come through the Republican House of Representative. This could create a de facto budget cut this year, not 1998. The house can than be counted on to fund the bare minimums. This may be restrictive on the economy."
Other dips in the session came on the release of the October trade deficit, which caused shorter maturities to drop. The deficit, which was reported at $8.04 billion, compared with a downwardly revised $8.25 billion for September, raised the likelihood that the nation's gross domestic product may be better than expected.
Anthony Dwyer, chief market strategist Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said: "I think the market is saying that despite the fact we have not had Government economic numbers in a while, the economy is weakening as evidenced by the anecdotal numbers leading up to the latest batch of data. Market participants hope that will spur another easing by the Fed.
"The dollar is solid and is drawing foreign investors into the U.S. financial markets. Equities are in a pivotal phase over the short term, as there may be more concerns about corporate profits. But over the longer term the lower interest rate environment should generate increased economic activity and raise corporate profits, thereby boosting equities."
Doug Burtnick, a fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said, "It only took two weeks for domestic investors to completely shrug off the idea that there are a lot of risks for the long end of the bond market if a balanced budget agreement isn't reached soon."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up vs. Mark and Pound On Signs of European Weakness

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rallied to move higher against most other leading currencies yesterday after overcoming a brief but sharp selloff on word that the Federal budget talks in Washington had broken down.
Traders attributed the dollar's resilience to expectations of lower European interest rates that undermined the German mark, weak British economic statistics that hurt the pound, and a narrower United States trade deficit that suggested the dollar has room to strengthen further. 
 "There's a lot more negative economic data coming out of Europe and Japan," said Elena Shperling, chief currency dealer at the New York branch of Banco di Sicilia. "By comparison in the United States, we're looking pretty good."
In late trading yesterday in New York, the dollar bought 1.4715 marks, up from 1.4638 on Tuesday. It also rallied against other European currencies, notably the British pound, which fell to $1.5205, from $1.5360 on Tuesday. The dollar has not been that strong against the pound since May 1994.
The dollar ended slightly lower yesterday against the Japanese yen, to 105.42 yen from 105.82 yen on Tuesday. But yen dealers said the underlying demand for dollars remained strong.
The dollar and Amerian securities markets faltered in the early afternoon when Republican Congressional leaders scrapped planned budget talks with President Clinton. But the weakness wore off as buyers stepped in. "Within 10 minutes, it was as though nothing had ever happened," Christopher Low, an economist at HSBC Securities in New York, said.
An early catalyst for dollar demand came from the German central bank, which allowed an important short-term interest rate to decline yesterday. That bolstered speculation the central bank would take broader steps to reduce rates at its regular meeting today.
The dollar also derived strength from a big selloff in the pound, spurred by the release of data showing the British Government's deficit and the national unemployment rate have not shrunk as much as expected.
The dollar was further helped by a Commerce Department report that the American trade deficit shrank in October to the smallest imbalance in nearly a year.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday, were: 1.1890 Swiss francs, up from 1.1794; 5.0273 French francs, up from 5.0014, and 1,584.75 Italian lire, up from 1,577.50.

HEADLINE: Fed Survey Sees 'Modest Pace' of Growth

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
The economy was growing at a "generally modest pace" at the turn of the year, a Federal Reserve survey showed today, but an index intended to predict turning points in the economy suggested an increased possibility of a downturn this year.
The Fed's periodic pulse-taking of business conditions in all 12 of its regions found a mixture of disappointing holiday sales, uneven factory activity and subdued inflation. 
 It also found some rebound in commercial real estate and continuing shortages in various areas of the labor market.
The anecdotal findings were over all a bit less buoyant than in the preceding report, which mainly covered November. But analysts took comfort in the fact that the economy had not slumped since mid-December -- during the period when the Government shutdown idled the keeping of statistics by the Labor and Commerce Departments.
The Fed's beige book signifies that growth has slowed from its annual pace of 4.2 percent in the third quarter, said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank in Pittsburgh. But he added that "the economy is still advancing" and would most likely continue to do so even though the predictive index, now compiled by the Conference Board, a business research group in New York, seems to be flashing "a yellow light."
The board reported today that the index of leading indicators fell three-tenths of 1 percent in November, the second straight decline and seventh of 1995. At 100.4, the index has retreated to the lowest point since December 1993.
Indeed, only a small upward revision that lifted the September result to no change prevented a third straight decline in the index, a string sometimes taken as a signal of impending recession.
But analysts were unusually reluctant to draw such a conclusion since three components accounting for 20 percent of the index were not yet available and the declines have not been particularly severe or widespread among index components.
Nor was the Conference Board able, because of missing figures, to publish companion indexes of coincident and lagging indicators that themselves can be used to forecast.
Nonetheless, the persistent weakness of the leading index is somewhat unsettling, analysts said, and would not go unnoticed by the Federal Reserve policy makers as they meet at month's end to set an economic course that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, will lay out before Congress next month.
The Fed's deliberations "may be particularly intense," Joel L. Naroff, chief economist for the First Union National Bank in Philadelphia, said today.
Another somber note was struck by the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, which reported that its quarterly poll of 3,000 American businesses found them "expecting significantly slower growth in sales, profits and employment levels during the first quarter of 1996."
Executives throughout industry said optimism for first-quarter sales was at a three-year low, while the outlook for profits was the lowest since the fourth quarter of 1993, the company said. Still, "this weak expectation of growth is not an indication that a recession is likely in the near future," said Joseph W. Duncan, Dun & Bradstreet's chief economist.
Four of the eight available components in the leading index were negative, the Conference Board's report showed. The biggest effect by far was a decline in prices of materials especially sensitive to the business cycle. Lesser factors were faster deliveries by suppliers, higher first-time claims for unemployment insurance and lower consumer expectations.
Pushing up the index were modest increases in stock prices, building permits and the money supply. The eighth item, the length of the factory work week, was unchanged.
With the latest report, the Conference Board took over the main responsibility for putting together the index, though it still relies on the Commerce Department for some data, and that was incomplete.
The Fed's survey, prepared this time by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, was based on information collected through Jan. 7 and thus did not include any effects of the East Coast snowstorms.
"Holiday sales were generally reported to be below expectations, with extensive discounting," the survey said in its summary. "Manufacturers saw uneven growth, with weakness noted in auto-related production. The Federal Government shutdown hurt winter tourism at national parks, but other areas reported increased activity.
"Single-family home sales are experiencing some seasonal slowing in most of the country. However, commercial real estate contacts in many areas report strengthened markets. Loan demand is steady in most areas. Firms say that prices are generally remaining stable, but some areas still report shortages of skilled workers."

Economic Weakness Stirs Gloom in Europe

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Grim economic reports that include soaring unemployment, bigger budget deficits and lower economic growth, have many in Europe wondering, for the first time in more than two years, whether the Continent is once again heading toward a recession.
Ominous news from Germany, considered the engine of European economic growth, has sent economists back to their forecasting models over the last week to lower their growth figures. 
 The sharpness of the European slowdown, which has emerged over the last two months, has taken economists and government officials by surprise. The last recession was a steep one, and the last two years' recovery has been only moderate, doing relatively little to cut into Europe's high unemployment.
Though no major forecaster is openly predicting a recession yet, economists say that much of Europe is in a spell of no growth or even shrinkage that could persist well into the year.
Some are beginning to label the European economic phenomenon a "growth recession."
"We don't see the classic signs of a recession, but the point for 1996 is that growth will be so low that it is going to feel like a recession to a lot of people," said Richard Reid, chief economist at the Frankfurt office of the Union Bank of Switzerland.
The slowdown comes as the United States economy also appears to be weakening, and it could cut the profits of American multinationals.
The gloom has sent politicians across Europe scurrying to come up with proposals to generate jobs and growth. And they seem to be bending over backward to rebut assertions that only a month after national leaders finally mustered the political will to give a name to the new single currency, the Euro, their economic plans are no longer on track.
"The gloom over the past week has been wildly exaggerated," a senior official of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Government said, adding that "we will meet the Maastricht criteria, without a doubt." He referred the treaty on European union that sets the terms for adoption of a single currency and central bank.
Skeptics say that plans to introduce the first stage of a single currency in 1999 are highly unrealistic because the low growth will so increase budget deficits that countries will not meet the standards required by the treaty for participation in a single currency. "Maastricht no longer exists," said Jacques Calvet, chairman of the French auto maker Peugeot, an outspoken critic of the single-currency plan. "Maastricht is obsolete. Maastricht is dead."
Even Germany last week, the paragon in Europe of budgetary restraint, conceded that its deficit had jumped to 3.6 percent of the gross domestic product, well above the 3 percent limit required by the Maastricht terms. But Finance Minister Theo Waigel promised to have the budget under control by next year.
Economists including Mr. Reid say that in Germany, the third and fourth quarters of 1995 registered no growth at best. They predict that the economy is likely to remain limp through the first half of this year.
The economy of France, Europe's second largest, is essentially not growing, either, and those of Belgium and the Netherlands are slowing considerably. Even in Italy and Spain, where economic output in 1995 was among the strongest in Europe, it is markedly slowing.
Britain appears to be the exception. Its gross domestic product is predicted to remain at the level of 1995 -- about 2.5 percent after inflation -- and may even grow a little faster this year. The Government announced in London today that the number of unemployed fell in December by about 10,000.
But for the rest of Europe, the anemic economic activity will be helpless in combating what almost everyone agrees is the big problem -- 17.5 million unemployed, an average rate of 10.6 percent.
"Not only will growth not be enough to reduce unemployment, it will be so low that unemployment will continue to go up," said Armin Sorg, senior director for economic policy at Siemens A.G. in Munich.
Since Germany accounts for almost 30 percent of the European economy, its performance gets the closest scrutiny, and the slowdown here has generated deep pessimism.
Much of the slowdown has been attributed to the high exchange rate of the German currency. Businesses are struggling with a mark that many say is 25 percent overvalued against the dollar. This has raised the cost of exports and generated losses at companies dependent on export earnings.
Beyond that, German factory wages are the highest in the world and the labor laws, rigid. Mr. Sorg of Siemens argued that an engineer in Germany works three months a year less than one in the United States. And because of union opposition to weekend work, he said, factories have the shortest running times in Europe. As in France and the Netherlands, a worker, once hired, is difficult to let go, so in uncertain times, companies do not hire.
All this has helped create a struggling economy. Normally, a government might consider an antidote of big tax cuts and higher public spending. But the restrictions of a single currency mean that Bonn would have to either raise taxes or cut spending to meet the budget targets, and neither of those avenues is attractive to the Kohl Government. This leaves the task of economic revival to the Bundesbank.
Economists say the central bank is the one institution that has substantial power to pull Germany and Europe out of a slowdown, by lowering interest rates. Today, the Bundesbank lowered the securities-repurchase, or repo, rate -- the one at which it does most of its lending to banks, to 3.65 percent from 3.73 percent. The German discount rate stands at 3 percent, near an all-time low, and economists predict that it will be cut further.
In a television interview on Tuesday night, the Bundesbank's president, Hans Tietmeyer, said he saw room for further cuts in interest rates. Lower rates in Germany mean that central banks across Europe can lower their rates, over the long run generating employment and economic activity.
"These lower interest rates have enormous potential in getting Europe out of its hole," said Steven Englander, international economist at Smith Barney in Paris. "It's not going to happen overnight. But optimism will start to rebound in the second half of this year."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Oil Prices Reverse Their Slide As Prospects Fade for Iraqi Sale

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices climbed yesterday as doubts emerged about whether Iraq would be allowed to sell oil for humanitarian purposes.
Natural gas prices also surged on expectations of colder-than-normal weather in the Northeast and a snowstorm in the Midwest, key gas-heating regions. 
 Traders spent most of the session trying to decipher Iraq's intentions, said John Saucer, an oil analyst at Smith Barney Inc. in Houston. Prices fell on Tuesday after Iraq surprised investors by announcing it would seek talks with the United Nations on oil sales despite a longstanding embargo that came with its invasion of Kuwait.
Mr. Saucer said traders now believed Iraq would not be allowed to increase production because it was becoming clear that it was insisting that there be no preconditions from the United Nations on how it spent its oil revenue.
On other commodity markets, copper futures prices dropped to 15-month lows. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities rose 1.23 points, to 240.21.
Crude oil for February delivery rose 47 cents, to $18.52 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. February heating oil rose 0.70 cent, to 53.13 cents a gallon, and February unleaded gasoline rose 1.65 cents, to 54.98 cents a gallon.
Crude oil futures prices fell to the lowest level since Nov. 22 on Tuesday after the Iraqi announcement. Traders were reassured yesterday after United Nations officials indicated terms of the deal would remain the same and Iraq would have no control over how the proceeds are spent.
The plan would allow Iraq a $1 billion sale every 90 days. Analysts said that would add about 700,000 barrels a day to bloated world markets.
February natural gas rose 26.2 cents, to $2.336 for 1,000 cubic feet, because of a belief that supplies would fall, a development confirmed by the American Gas Association after the close. Price also rose on the predictions for colder weather.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Winning Hand

BYLINE: By Matthew Miller; Matthew Miller, economics editor of The New Republic, was senior adviser in the Office of Management and Budget from 1993 to 1995.

 BODY:
It's only human for Republicans to sulk now that the President has outmaneuvered them by pressing for a balanced budget deal while attacking their "excessive Medicare cuts" -- which are similar in size to savings he had previously proposed. But the G.O.P. should put frustration aside and realize that the good of the country and its own political survival argue for a deal largely on his terms.
The Republicans complain that, despite the Congressional Budget Office's verdict that the latest Administration plan would achieve balance by the year 2002, Mr. Clinton puts off hard choices. But consider that in the first five years of its own balanced budget bill, the G.O.P. hopes to reduce the deficit by $337 billion. By contrast, President Clinton's 1993 budget package sought to reduce the deficit over five years by $500 billion. Even if Republicans dropped their foolish tax cut, their five-year deficit reduction would rise to only $486 billion. 
 The Republicans also accuse the President of "backloading" his budget savings -- meaning that they would take effect so far in the future as to be illusory. It's true that in his seven-year plan, he would achieve 58 percent of his savings in 2001 and 2002. But the G.O.P. plan passed in November puts off 48 percent of its savings until then. Imagine the campaign battle cry: "We put off half the heavy lifting till tomorrow, but the President puts off a little more!"
Politicians fall prey to the delusion that their side represents Good and the other side Evil. But while Republicans deserve credit for making a balanced budget a priority, they should remember that their plan, like the President's, is deeply flawed. For political reasons, both leave defense, Social Security and most "welfare for the well-to-do" off the table -- areas that together constitute half the budget and from which reasonable people in both parties know savings can be found.
Both parties thus myopically take about half their savings from annually appropriated domestic spending, which makes up only 16 percent of the budget and where needed money for research and development and education, among other things, comes from.
But in walking out on the budget negotiations, it's the Republicans who look worse. Whether there's a deal or not, Bill Clinton can argue honestly in the campaign that after 12 years of rising deficits, he's cut them nearly in half without a single Republican vote.
What's more, the President has a plan that the Republican-controlled Congressional Budget Office says will finish the job. In addition, if there's no deal, Mr. Clinton will be able to label the G.O.P. majority a "do-nothing" Congress since the entire G.O.P. agenda is wrapped up in the budget. This would leave 73 Republican freshman heading to the stump touting only the vague accomplishment of having "changed the debate," which may not stack up well against real, live votes that their opponents will say "slashed Medicare to give big tax cuts to the rich." In the absence of a disaster in Bosnia, the prospect for a big Democratic victory on these terms is real.
In November, many observers (like myself) thought the fiscal endgame would pit the G.O.P.'s politics of balanced budgets against the Democrats' politics of "Mediscare." The genius of the President's recent moves is to co-opt the balanced budget argument without relinquishing the Medicare attack. This strategy carries harsh consequences for the Republicans. They now need a deal more than the President does. That may be frustrating, but it's also reality.
If the G.O.P. is sincere about the national interest, this is no time for sour grapes about not getting enough credit. Instead, it's time to deal. A compromise plan will not be perfect -- the deficit probably won't be eliminated, hard choices will be deferred and taxes may unwisely be cut -- but it will be progress. The Republicans should call the President's bluff, claim joint victory and accept something close to the deal he's offered.

State of the Union

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
President Clinton and a small cadre of aides are feverishly finishing the State of the Union address for presentation to an opposition Congress next Tuesday.
Here is a guide, nonpartisan to the point of Olympian, providing criteria to help viewers judge the only reporting event mandated by the Constitution. 
 1. Does he inspire confidence? We remember Reagan for morning-in-America optimism, Carter for eat-your-peas pessimism. With Republicans deliberately downbeat about budget talks, to remind the President of a recession if he fails to make a deal, Clinton must counter with confidence, in rhetoric and demeanor, without misleading.
2. Does he speak to the politicians in the hall or the people at home? In the television era, Presidents have used the House of Representatives merely as a colorful forum for a speech to the camera. But this time the oratorical challenge to Clinton, in the midst of the budget negotiations, is to play to both hall and home. People in their living rooms are both the target audience and onlookers at a dramatic confrontation; Clinton must be able to carom off Congress to land the ball in our pocket.
3. Does he put the story in the key word? Traditionally the President says "The State of the Union is (fill in adjective)." In hard times, the word is a reassuring "sound"; in better times, the word of choice, in both its senses, is "good." Gerald Ford's assessment in troubled 1975 was stunningly honest: "Not good." Clinton cannot be too honest ("The State of the Union, as we all know, is pretty confused"); more likely, he will go for a word like "strong."
4. Does he look backward or forward? George Bush's failure of vision in his election-year S.O.T.U. made his Presidency seem to have run out of gas. Beyond taking credit for a low-inflation economy, for Clinton to offer a litany of domestic achievements in this year of gridlock and shutdown would be risible; this speech must focus on the future, showing why a second term is needed -- without insulting Congress to its face.
5. Is he just political enough without appearing partisan? His fall campaign theme will be "Without me and my veto, those G.O.P. richies would savage our helpless old folks, pollute the environment and slam the schoolhouse door." But in next week's dignified setting, he must put his vetoes positively, as invitations to improve legislation to more painlessly bring about an agreed goal of a balanced budget. In this regard --
6. Does he inoculate himself from valid campaign criticism of preserving the failed welfare system? This is the place, looking ahead, to try to redefine "ending welfare as we know it" -- when the nation knows he stymied that promised reform this year.
7. Does he in a nonpartisan way exploit the foreign-affairs schism in the Republican ranks? Last weekend's 31-hour photo op in Bosnia, posing in a military jacket, was done just in time to set up a claim of world leadership and defense readiness in this speech. The peacemaker of the Middle East, Ireland and Haiti will publicly praise internationalists like Dole and Gingrich -- they'll smile but hate it -- thereby driving deeper the wedge between them and G.O.P. isolationists.
8. Will he develop his centrist theme of personal responsibility or start running prematurely as the defender of the needy against the greedy? If he can remind us of our duties to one another as individuals, and of our collective duty to educate the young and fight crime and respect our differences, then he can stay on that high road until it becomes necessary for him, later in the campaign, to exploit fear and foment class division.
9. Is he straining to milk applause? Fourteen interruptions of applause and one spontaneous standing ovation from Democrats is about right for a 40-minute S.O.T.U.
10. Does he have a heartstrings-tugger in the balcony? Reagan was master of this visual pointmaker. Look for something like a salute to the First Lady seated next to our first Bosnian casualty, which may be schmaltzy but is entirely appropriate in this patriotic setting.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
When economists talk, few listen if the subject is health policy.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to public policy, does anyone listen to economic experts anymore? Judging from the rise and fall of the Clinton national health care plan -- the Edsel (this is the 90's: make that the "Waterworld") of public policy rollouts -- the answer is discouraging. And economists may have only themselves to blame. Indeed, economic professionals appear to pay little attention to the most knowledgeable people within their own ranks.
That's the bleak message from Victor R. Fuchs, a health care economist at Stanford University and the departing president of the American Economic Association. He tackled the subject last week in his farewell address at the association's annual meeting in San Francisco. And while his words are hardly cheerful reading, Mr. Fuchs touches sensitive points that economists can ignore only at their own peril. 
 The big surprise for political scientists in the health reform debacle was that the first genuine policy wonk to battle his way to the White House proved to be such an amateur at policy-making, according to Theodore R. Marmor of the Yale School of Organization and Management.
"President Clinton had no reason to believe there was a popular consensus for radical change," Mr. Marmor said. But the new President, elected with a bare plurality in a three-way contest, acted as if he were prime minister in a British-style parliamentary system in which party discipline would be decisive.
Seriously misreading the way things work in Washington, Mr. Clinton did all his interest-group bargaining in secret, presenting a finished version to Congress with little room for horse-trading. In the end, Mr. Marmor says, the plan, intricately fiddled and faddled to placate everyone, pleased no one.
For health care economists, there was an even bigger slap in the face. After three decades in which health economics had come into its own as a serious discipline, the research and advice from such experts were virtually ignored in the White House drafting of the bill.
To find out why, Mr. Fuchs put together an opinion survey on health policy, eliciting responses from 46 health economists, 44 economic theorists with no special interest in health care and 42 practicing physicians. While the design of the survey and the choice of experts surveyed may not meet the standards of scientific polling, some of the results are striking.
On the 7 out of 20 questions that Mr. Fuchs labels "value free," the health economists spoke with virtually one voice. For example, 81 percent agreed that "the primary reason for the increase in the health sector's share of G.D.P. over the past 30 years is technological change in medicine." Fully 91 percent took issue with the assertion that "the high cost of health care in the United States makes U.S. firms substantially less competitive in the global economy."
But many of the views of health economists, grounded in solid research, proved to be well-guarded secrets. By contrast to the 89 percent of the health care economists who rejected the idea that "widespread use of currently available screening and other diagnostic techniques would result in a significant reduction in health care expenditures," 83 percent of the economic theorists accepted it. And while not one of the health economists agreed that "differential access to medical care across socioeconomic groups is the primary reason for differential health status," 34 percent of the physicians did.
Perhaps one reason few people paid attention to health economists was that they did not always speak with one voice on fundamental policy issues. The group was split 54 to 46 on whether "the U.S. should seek universal coverage through a broad-based tax with implicit subsidies for the poor and the sick." By the same token, the split was 51 to 49 on whether "insurance companies should be required to cover all applicants regardless of health condition and not allowed to charge sicker individuals higher premiums." While 42 percent agreed that "national standardized health insurance benefit packages should be established," 58 percent did not.
If health economists can't get their research findings across to physicians and other economists, Mr. Fuchs asks, what chance do they have to influence politicians and voters? Not much. And it doesn't help that health economists do not seem to share common objectives, diluting even further their impact on the policy debate.
Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, draws a yet-more-sober conclusion. The closer economists get to the corridors of power, he suggests, the more they are influenced by careerism and ideology. And in straying ever further from the more objective standards of science, they have left themselves open to the public's view of them as experts for sale. "We are self-immolating as a profession," he concludes.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Gap Narrowed Again in October

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit fell to $8.04 billion last October, the lowest level in 10 months and the fourth straight monthly decline, the Commerce Department said today in a delayed report.
The numbers solidified a view among economists that the trade deficit had peaked, but the latest figures also raised new concerns about the nation's trade with Japan and highlighted a lack of progress in opening parts of China's vast market more widely to American goods. 
 And some economists cautioned that these and other problems, including growing United States trade imbalances with Canada and Mexico and a slowdown in Europe's economy, could keep the country's overall trade deficit from dropping significantly next year.
In its report, which was delayed at least a month by the Government shutdown, the Commerce Department said the trade deficit decreased 2.5 percent in October from $8.25 billion in September. That marked the fourth straight monthly fall since the deficit hit $11.39 billion last June.
But even with those gains, several private economists projected that the 1995 deficit would total $150 billion to $165 billion, making it one of the highest in history.
Still, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said the overall trend "is obviously helpful." He added that the trade total, fueled by strong United States exports, "have been moving inextricably in the right direction over the last several months.
"I perceive that is going to continue, but how strongly I can't tell," he said.
Several economists said they were troubled by a jump in the United States trade deficit with Japan, which rose 11.1 percent in October to $4.79 billion from $4.31 billion in September, ending a seven-month stretch of declines.
But Mr. Kantor said in an interview that the overall trade deficit with Japan had dropped 4 percent in the first 10 months of 1995 over the same period in 1994.
He said he was more concerned about trade with China. Hinting that the Administration may seek to reimpose trade sanctions against China next month, Mr. Kantor said: "Things are not going in the correct direction with China. We have focused on China with some intensity, and we intend to be even more intense over the next several months. This goes beyond trade rules to the rule of law. We expect them to live up to their agreements."
Last February, the Clinton Administration suspended $1 billion in tariffs on imports from China to encourage the Chinese Government to crack down on piracy of American movies and computer software and to halt other discriminatory trade practices.
But some trade experts contended that China has not changed many of its practices, and the Commerce report showed that America's deficit with China climbed to $29.09 billion in the first 10 months of 1995 from $24.59 billion in the same period in 1994.
Mr. Kantor and several economists said new trade agreements with other countries and a renewed competitiveness by American companies had helped to increase exports. But, noting that exports dipped slightly in October, they also said that any strengthening in the dollar's value, making United States goods more expensive, and the sluggish nature of the Japanese and European economies, could choke out some of that growth.
Gary C. Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said the latest trade numbers were "slightly better than one might have expected," and he said he expected a continued decline in the overall deficit.
But he also said that "the bigger story is the softness of the U.S. economy," which is improving the balance of trade by slowing purchases of imports by American consumers.
Indeed, the Commerce Department report showed that while exports of American goods and services rose from $64.68 billion last June to $66.75 billion in October, imports dropped from $76.06 billion to $74.79 billion over the same period.
Others, such as Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a former Commerce Department official and a critic of some of Japan's trading practices, said they found the Commerce Department report to be "discouraging" because it showed that the United States deficits were still growing with several of its leading trading partners.
Besides the problems with Japan and China, the report showed that trade deficits had worsened with both Canada and Mexico, the country's partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement.
In addition, America's trade deficit with Western Europe jumped to $1.15 billion in October from $125 million in September, possibly reflecting Europe's growing economic woes.
Commerce Department officials cautioned that such figures could be misleading because the total trade deficit is adjusted for seasonal variations in economic activity, but the country-by-country figures are not.
But Mr. Prestowitz, now president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington, said he was concerned by the numbers.
"Mexico's economy is slowing," he said, "and the forecast is that it will not be robust and Europe will not be robust." In addition, he said, "We have a chronic, big trade deficit with Canada."
Among industrial sectors, some of the biggest declines in October occurred in exports of autos and auto parts, which slipped to $4.77 billion in October from $5.6 billion in September. Imports dropped even more, to $9.51 billion from $10.42 billion.
Imports of foreign oil also declined, to $4.25 billion in October from $4.78 billion in September.
Given the delay in releasing the October figures, economists expect the Commerce Department to follow in early February with the November totals, bringing the trade picture more up to date.
The Japanese Government is expected to report its 1995 trade figures soon, and most experts believe they will show that Japan's huge trade surplus shrank for the first time in five years. If that is so, it could ease trade tensions between Japan and the United States and help keep the dollar strong.

HEADLINE: Panel Proposes a Flat Tax But Fails to Specify the Rate

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
A private commission on tax reform created last year by Republican leaders in Congress today stepped into a central issue in the campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination and recommended that the wages and salaries of all Americans, from corporate magnates to manual laborers, be taxed at a single, low rate.
But the commission stopped short of proposing what that rate should be and avoided, as have the Republican candidates, the politically delicate matter of who might owe more taxes and who might owe less under what is known as a flat tax. The commission also did not address what the effect would be on the budget deficit and whether tax deductions for mortgage interest payments and charitable donations should be retained. 
 This lack of specificity means that the report will have little effect on the flat tax debate among Republican candidates, and probably even less on Congress.
Because the flat tax became such a hot political issue within the party, the commission, officially called the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, was unable to satisfy what Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, and Speaker Newt Gingrich originally saw as its objective, which was to unify Republicans on the question of taxes.
Republican Presidential candidates are already offering rival versions of flat taxes.
Steve Forbes, the publishing executive, gained attention in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the first contests for the nomination will be held next month, with his proposal for a flat tax of 17 percent. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas tried to gain an advantage over Mr. Forbes today by proposing a 16 percent rate. Patrick J. Buchanan, the commentator, would favor a flat tax if it continued tax deductions for mortgage interest payments and charitable contributions, but he places greater emphasis on high tariffs on imports.
Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee oppose the idea of a flat tax but favor other sweeping changes in the tax system.
Senator Dole of Kansas, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, said today at a news conference where the commission report was made public that he could not support any measure that would increase the Federal budget deficit or shift the tax burden toward the middle class and away from the wealthy. And every plan that has been offered so far would almost certainly do one or the other or both.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin issued a statement saying, "Every Republican flat tax we have seen either explodes the deficit or raises income taxes on middle-income families."
Even the most ardent proponents of overhauling the nation's tax system acknowledge that despite all the political talk about taxes, Congress will not vote on the matter this year. The commission report, said Jeff Levey, who follows tax policy developments for Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm, "is just another sort of blip in a lot of blips we're going to see in the next year about tax restructuring."
Under the current system, Federal income tax rates range from 15 percent for taxpayers with modest incomes to nearly 40 percent for the wealthiest.
Mr. Dole and Mr. Gingrich, who together created the commission, tried to put the best face on its report today, not endorsing any proposal specifically but saying it provided an opening for a full-scale debate over how to change the tax system.
Perhaps to draw attention away from divisions within the Republican Party, Mr. Gingrich challenged President Clinton to join a Republican effort to change the tax system or to defend the current system, a challenge the President could hardly accept.
Asked at the news conference why the commission had avoided dealing with specifics, its chairman, Jack F. Kemp, the former Housing Secretary and Republican Congressman from Buffalo, replied, "We're not going to get sidetracked into issues like which deductions are most important."
Mr. Kemp said his personal preference was that the flat tax rate be no higher than 19 percent. The commission said only that the rate should be "as low as possible."
Others on the 14-member commission, a cross-section of Republicans who have been successful in fields outside the Federal Government, included two former Governors, Pete du Pont of Delaware and Carroll Campbell of South Carolina; Theodore J. Forstmann, the investment banker, and John Snow, chairman and president of the CSX Corporation in Richmond.
In a step that would be especially beneficial to upper-income taxpayers, the commission proposed abolishing altogether taxation of interest, dividends, capital gains and estates.
For those less well-to-do, the commission would allow a large personal exemption and permit workers to deduct from their income taxes the money withheld from their paychecks for Social Security and Medicare.
It would thus appear that almost everyone would have lower taxes, obviously a politically attractive proposition. There were no suggestions of where spending might be lowered to offset the tax cuts.
In the 1970's, Mr. Kemp was one of the first prominent politicians to embrace the supply-side theory of economics, which holds that lower tax rates would lead to such growth in the economy that tax receipts would actually increase.
The theory became less fashionable when the Federal budget deficit mushroomed after President Ronald Reagan's deep tax cuts in the early 1980's.
But Mr. Kemp said today that if the commission's recommendations were adopted, economic growth in the years ahead would double, leading to lower interest rates, more jobs and higher revenue for the Government.
The six principles advocated by the commission could hardly be objected to by anyone: economic growth through incentives to work, save and invest; fairness for all taxpayers; simplicity so that anyone can figure it out; neutrality so that people rather than the Government make economic decisions, visibility so that taxpayers know the cost of government, and stability so that the future can be planned for.
The problem is that some of those bromides are contradictory. For example, as a rule, the simpler a tax code is, the more unfair it tends to be; the fairer the law, the more complicated it is likely to be.
There is no mystery to why the idea of a flat tax is appealing. The existing tax system can be maddeningly complicated and expensive to comply with. It rewards consumption and penalizes savings, exactly the opposite of economic common sense. And in many cases it is clearly unfair -- for example, many working couples pay substantially higher taxes on their joint return than do unmarried couples who live together and file separate returns.
But as is the case with balancing the budget and improving the health care system, the problems with the tax law cannot be fixed easily. The more the layers of the problem are peeled away, the less attractive each proposed solution becomes.
The flat tax tends to founder politically because in the end, voters are more interested in what happens to their own taxes than they are in the principles of taxation.
Unless one accepts supply-side economic principles in full -- and relatively few economists do -- then someone's taxes must be increased to offset those whose taxes are cut or the deficit will expand again as it did in the 1980's.
Lowering the top rate substantially and ending taxation of interest, dividends, capital gains and estates is bound to help the wealthy. So the tax increases must be borne by those who are not wealthy -- as is the case with most voters.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
A Sense of Where He Is and Why He Stays There

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT

 BODY:

TIME PRESENT, TIME PAST
A Memoir
By Bill Bradley
Illustrated. 442 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.
What raises Bill Bradley's new book above the usual public figure's memoir is the engagingly fluid way the narrative moves from the personal to the historical to whatever message Senator Bradley wants to convey. 
 For instance, early in "Time Present, Time Past," in a chapter titled "The Garden," the author recalls returning to Madison Square Garden in 1992 to deliver one of three keynote addresses at the Democratic National Convention. This allows him first to touch upon his career as a professional basketball player with the New York Knicks and how he "emerged as role model for many slow-footed white boys"; then to digress at candid length on his "deficiency as a speaker and as a television performer," and finally to deliver the point of his convention speech, which is also the message of this book: that "our challenge as a party and a nation" is to "stop the random violence of our cities, rebuild economic opportunity and jobs for all and provide the moral leadership worthy of our ideals."
 Or, for another example, in a chapter called "The Creedal Society," he moves from the German ancestry of his mother to the history of German immigrants in America, to the German background of his wife, Ernestine, to the experiences ofother nationalities in this country, to his position on immigration policy, to his hopes for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Out of this emerges an appealing portrait of a public figure who seems real, with passions and ideals rooted in his upbringing and heritage. In the best passages he doesn't just advocate positions; he explains how large ideas can be translated into effective action. His several chapters on the United States Senate are fascinating mixtures of gossip, history and advice on how to get things done.
Surprisingly, senators still depend on the currency of one another's word. "But listen very carefully," Senator Bradley advises, "so that you don't hear only what you want to hear." Surprising too is the question he raises of how many votes have been sold within the Senate "for extra paper, more space or an additional pay line for a staff member." His answer: "more than the public knows." Yet if he's good on such details, he's equally engrossing in a chapter called "The Big Picture," where he describes the strategies he used to push legislation on tax reform, third world debt and the distribution of water in the West.
Unfortunately, after a while his mix of memoir and advocacy begins to seem schematic, and you get the sense that you're reading well-crafted position papers on subjects like the role of the United States as a leader in the world, the failure of labor unions, the future of race relations, the excesses of the media, the emergence of women in politics, what we owe American Indians and the plight of the middle class.
What Senator Bradley has to say on these subjects may well be compelling, as is his concern over the pressures being exerted on American society by the transition we are undergoing from a manufacturing economy to an information-based economy. In the new era, "neither capital, labor nor raw materials will be as important as knowledge -- its use and application."
Yet his delivery is just preachy enough to make you wonder if there is a hidden purpose behind "Time Present, Time Past," the title of which comes from T. S. Eliot's "Burnt Norton." Could the book be the announcement of a campaign for the Presidency, as the publication of Gen. Colin L. Powell's memoir, "My American Journey" was at one time thought to be? This was certainly a speculation when Senator Bradley announced last August that he would not run for re-election to the Senate this year.
But such speculation seems scotched by a chapter in the memoir called "Night Thoughts," where Senator Bradley spells out the various complex reasons he chose not to seek the Democratic nomination for President in 1992. Among these are his "skepticism about what any President could accomplish at our current national moment," his concern for his family's well-being, his "natural antipathy to the invasion by the press of all aspects" of his life, his continuing stage fright and "inability to rouse people as a speaker" and his "ingrained assumption (in refutation of which lay a lifetime of achievement) that this small-town boy could never win the biggest contest of all." Unhappily for his admirers, these reasons for not running are so convincingly a part of his self-portrait as to be persuasive.
On the other hand, at the same press conference at which he announced his decision not to run again for the Senate he described himself as "an inveterate scribbler" who for years had been recording his thoughts in college-rule notebooks with No. 2 pencils. So maybe this memoir really was written as a venture of self-discovery. Certainly the results are at once honest and complexly shaded enough to make this charming possibility seem altogether plausible.

HEADLINE: Gramm Adds Voice to Calls In the G.O.P. for Flat Tax

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Formally joining the Republican chorus calling for a flat tax, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas today proposed taxing income at 16 percent, edging a rival Presidential candidate, Steve Forbes, by one percentage point.
While Mr. Forbes would tax only earned income at 17 percent, Mr. Gramm said he would tax investment income as well. Unlike Mr. Forbes, Senator Gramm would preserve deductions for mortgage interest and for donations to charities. 
 The proposal was included in what Mr. Gramm called "an eight-year program to change America, to bring back the American dream and to share that dream with people who missed it the first time around."
The program, which he outlined in a speech to the Cato Institute, a conservative research organization, brought together many ideas that Mr. Gramm, a former economics professor, has proposed before. He has been offering them piecemeal in Iowa and New Hampshire as he has scrambled to elbow aside Mr. Forbes and establish himself as the most credible challenger to Senator Bob Dole, the clear front-runner in the two states and nationally. Mr. Dole has said he might support a flat tax but has yet to propose his own plan.
Today, Mr. Gramm projected numerous, specific benefits from his economic plan. He said that by the end of the eighth year of a Gramm administration, his plan would expand the number of jobs nationally to 142 million from 125 million; would raise average income for a family of four to $57,500 from $45,000, in 1994 dollars, and would move 9.7 million people out of poverty.
In a recent interview, Mr. Gramm denied that he was advocating a flat tax to horn in on what has proved a potent issue for Mr. Forbes. "I was for a flat tax, a variant of it, in 1976," he said, when he taught economics at Texas A&M. Asked if he would be raising the idea now if Mr. Forbes had not, he said, "I didn't even know Forbes in 1976."
But Mr. Forbes took credit for the idea today, saying in a prepared statement: "I'm delighted that Senator Gramm has finally seen the light on the flat tax, even if it's an election-year conversion. I hope his conversion is more than poll deep."
Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator who is seeking the Republican nomination, has proposed a version of a flat tax, and other candidates have discussed the idea. A commission headed by Jack F. Kemp today supported one without specifying a rate.
Like Mr. Forbes, Mr. Gramm would not tax inheritance. But in other respects, the two tax plans differ significantly, in part because Mr. Gramm would tax unearned income, like capital gains. Mr. Forbes, a multimillionaire, has been attacked by his rivals for proposing a plan that would enable wealthy investors to escape tax on a large part of their income.
"I reject the idea that income derived from labor should be taxed, and that income derived from capital should not be taxed," Mr. Gramm said. He called Mr. Forbes's approach "totally unfair, totally indefensible" and argued that it would distort investment.
Mr. Gramm posed the example of a father who sends one child to Stanford to become a doctor, while giving the other an equal amount of money to invest. Why, he asked, should the first child pay taxes on income, while the second does not?
In his statement, Mr. Forbes said: "Although Senator Gramm doesn't understand it, one of the virtues of a flat tax is that all income is taxed at its source, including investment income. Investment income is effectively taxed at the corporate level, not the personal level." In other words, Mr. Forbes would tax corporate profits only when the company earns the money, not again when it pays it out to stockholders in the form of dividends.
For a family of four, Mr. Gramm's rate of 16 percent would apply on income over $32,000, an amount he said could rise to $40,000 over eight years. For the same family, Mr. Forbes's 17 percent tax would start on income over $36,000.
Mr. Gramm said that his plan could cause a shortfall in Federal revenue of about $40 billion in its first year but that spending cuts would take care of the gap.
Critics of flat-tax proposals have argued that they could raise taxes for some middle-income families. But Mr. Gramm said his plan was "structured to try to guarantee that no middle class American will pay more taxes than they do now."
Mr. Gramm also said his program would balance the budget in four years and then enact a "spending pause" over the following four years to limit the Government's growth to the rate of inflation. He also called for a one-year moratorium on Federal regulations, beginning in 1997, except in cases of imminent danger to human health and safety.
And Mr. Gramm defended his support of free-trade agreements. "If there's anything we've learned in American history, it is that trade produces prosperity and opportunity," Mr. Gramm said. "Trade won the cold war."

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH: Olga Hirshhorn;
The Thrill of Art, Both Fine and Flea

BYLINE: By BARBARA GAMAREKIAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Olga Hirshhorn's normally cheery countenance was gloomy as she peered at the driving rain outside the window of her tiny carriage house in northwest Washington. Her regular Sunday excursion to the Georgetown flea market would have to be scuttled.
"Darn," she said. "I wanted to see if I couldn't get some material to match the pillows I bought last Sunday." From a cabinet, she pulled a Moroccan rug and several pillows in glorious hues of coral, gold, Chinese red and blue-green. "Aren't these colors wonderful? And I only paid $115! He wanted $120, but we flipped for it." 
 Olga Hirshhorn learned the fine art of wheeling and dealing from a master: her late husband, Joseph Hirshhorn, a self-made man who amassed much of his fortune exploring for oil in Canada. A collector of modern painting and sculpture, he also founded the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden here.
Mrs. Hirshhorn, 74, announced in March that she was donating her own collection of paintings, sculpture and works on paper, believed to be worth about $10 million, to the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. The decision surprised many in the museum world, who had assumed she would choose the Hirshhorn.
It was not an easy decision, she said, for she is close to the staff at the Hirshhorn. But she has long had ties to the Corcoran, one of the capital's few private museums, and has served on the board of the Corcoran School of Art since arriving here with her husband in 1977.
Mrs. Hirshhorn has always had an eye for color and design but said she knew nothing about contemporary art when she first met Joseph Hirshhorn in 1961 in her hometown of Greenwich, Conn. As Olga Zatorsky Cunningham, the owner of Services Unlimited, an employment agency, she received innumerable telephone inquiries about chauffeurs and upstairs maids from "a Mr. Hirshhorn" who had just bought a mansion on Round Hill.
"He was very abrupt," she said. "He'd order up a chauffeur like ordering a loaf of bread. And one day he asked me, 'Mrs. Cunningham, how old are you?' And I said: 'Forty-one. How old are you?' He said, 'I'm 64.' And then he asked, 'Mrs. Cunningham, how tall are you?' And I said 5 feet. I didn't ask how tall he was, because I knew he must be short."
Thus did romance bloom between the 5-foot-4-inch Joe Hirshhorn, who was separated from his third wife, and Mrs. Cunningham, who was separated from the schoolteacher husband she had married at 18.
Soon afterward she was invited to drop by his art-filled home. "I was overwhelmed at what I saw and said, 'My, you've got a lot of statues,' " she recalled. "He shook his finger at me and said: 'I don't have statues. I have sculpture.'
"That was my first lesson. The second lesson he taught me was to never say I didn't like a work of art, but to say I didn't understand it."
Two and a half years after they met, Mr. Hirshhorn announced, "If you lose 10 pounds I'll marry you."
"So I lost 10 pounds, very quickly I might say," she explained with a grin. "And we married about a month later."
Life with Mr. Hirshhorn, she said, was total immersion in the art world, for their friends were artists, dealers, collectors, art historians and museum people.
Slowly, she began to build her own collection, beginning with pieces given to her by her husband and artist friends. "The stories you may have heard about Joe's method of buying are true," she said. "He would go to the galleries and point to different things and say, 'I'll take that, that, that and that, and throw that little one in for Olga.' "
She delighted in her first purchase, a painting by Josef Albers. "Although I had many works of art at the time, I never had had the pleasure of choice," she said.
When she began to buy on her own she found that her credit was good. "I didn't have Joe Hirshhorn's money," she said. "But being his wife, I was able to buy things on time, and I would send different galleries $50 or $100 each month."
At her husband's death in 1981, his art collection went to the Hirshhorn Museum, and Mrs. Hirshhorn found herself with bare walls. Her own collection grew rapidly. Since his death, Mrs. Hirshhorn has lectured around the country and in India and Japan about "the Hirshhorn Museum and the Hirshhorn collection and my life with Joe and the artists we have known."
Asked what she most admired and remembered about her husband, she spoke of his sense of humor and zest for living. "For him, every day was Sunday," she said. "He wouldn't like my life style now, because he enjoyed a lot of servants around and a big house and fancy cars. I travel economy and carry my own luggage. It's easier. It's simpler."
It was she who introduced her husband to flea markets. "He thought he had died and gone to heaven," she said with a laugh, "because everything was so cheap."
She said that David C. Levy, the director of the Corcoran Gallery, shares her affinity for flea markets, recently appearing with his latest find: a vintage toaster to add to her collection of antique toasters.
"I've become very close to David and have watched the development of the Corcoran under his directorship," she said, "and I suddenly thought, That's the place for my collection! Because David really cares for that museum and that building and that art school. He wants it to be an important museum, and it will be."
And she is still collecting art. The telephone, which had already rung a dozen times this morning, rang again. It was Michael Clark, a Washington artist, who made a date to come by to hang one of his paintings, a recent acquisition. "I think I'll have him put it up there," Mrs. Hirshhorn said, pointing to a spot just below the 20-foot ceiling of her pint-size kitchen, already filled with art objects, among them a dozen antique toasters and small sculptures by Barbara Hepworth and Mark di Suvero.
A herb garden and a red ribbon at the gate welcome visitors to what Mrs. Hirshhorn calls her "Mouse House," just 500 square feet on three levels with winding stairs leading to a tiny bedroom in a turret. There, a trompe l'oeil ceiling created by Dana Westring, a Washington artist, depicts a deep blue sky studded with gold-leaf stars.
Antique necklaces frame the mirror in the bathroom, which is tucked midway up the staircase, and a peek into the medicine cabinet reveals pre-Columbian and Greek statuary. "There's always awful-looking stuff in medicine cabinets, and I thought I'd surprise my guests," she said.
Over the Victorian sofa (purchased at a yard sale for $6 in 1939) hangs a 19th-century Korean portrait scroll. Across the room, in an interplay of crimson, is a Kenneth Noland target painting, a wedding gift from the artist. There are tiny Calder bronzes and mobiles, Gorky drawings and small de Koonings and Picassos and O'Keeffes, many inscribed "to Olga." And 50 or more drawings, watercolors and etchings form a collage up the staircase.
"It's all touchable, all within arm's length," she said. "It's really a fun house, but living here is an exercise in discipline. After you read a newspaper or book, you have to throw it away." A necessity, given the fact she stores her voluminous art files in the oven and dishwasher.
"Look, isn't this neat?" she asked as she rummaged through the dishwasher, where pens and pencils were stacked in the silverware container. "Here are elastic bands and staples and my money belt and my 'fuzz buster.' I'm ready for a quick getaway."
She indulges her passion for cooking at her two other art-filled houses, on Martha's Vineyard and in Naples, Fla., where she has a waterside estate with eight bathrooms, acres of grapefruit, orange and kumquat trees and a screened-in pool.
On the Vineyard, where she has had a home for six years, she spent her first three summers restoring a barn, which serves as a guest house, and remodeling "a dumb ranch-style house" by raising the ceiling and adding a bay window and a dormer. Of course, both the barn and the house display enchanting works of art.
She relishes all three of her homes and the varying styles of living they provide for her, observing, "I haven't yet decided what is going to be the house of my last illness."
Once again, the telephone rang. It was Ira M. Lowe, a Washington lawyer who advises many artists.
"I'm going there for lunch, and I told him to put a potato on," she explained. "We do it often. Last time, we each had a baked white potato and a baked sweet potato, and he boiled some new potatoes. It's wonderful: you don't realize how much fun it can be to not make a big deal out of lunch."

HEADLINE: With Help of 'Seinfeld,' Legend in His Own Time;
The Real Kramer Tries to Capitalize

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
Seven years ago, when the comedians Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David were sitting in Mr. David's apartment creating a television show about a single comedian in New York, they based a character on the lanky bachelor living across the hall, an affable guy named Kenny Kramer who had no visible means of support and a lot of free time to spend on projects that didn't work out exactly as planned.
Today, the Kramer character on "Seinfeld" is an internationally renowned New Yorker, so famous that his real-life model has an idea for another project. Mr. Kramer, who still lives in the same midtown apartment, is starting up Kramer's Reality Tour, which he cheerfully calls "a shameless attempt to capitalize on my illustrious name and branded identity." 
 Beginning on Jan. 27 at the John Houseman Theater on West 42d Street, Mr. Kramer will show video clips, serve pizza and conduct bus tours of spots sacred to the legions of "Seinfeld" fans. It will be a mobile Off Broadway tribute to New York landmarks: the facade of the coffee shop where the "Seinfeld" characters meet; the bar where Kramer apologized for punching Mickey Mantle; the midtown office building where Kramer found someone to publish his coffee table book about coffee tables; the takeout shop on West 55th Street near Eighth Avenue with the great soup and notoriously strict chef.
The Real Kramer, as Mr. Kramer now calls himself, will also use the tour to differentiate reality from fiction, which gets a little tricky. On the show, Mr. Seinfeld plays himself, Jerry, a comedian living at 129 West 81st Street (Mr. Seinfeld's real former address, although the brick facade shown on television is actually an apartment building in Los Angeles, where the series is taped).
Mr. David, the show's executive producer, is roughly represented by George, a character who acts out Mr. David's most neurotic fantasies. Mr. Kramer is represented by Kramer, an unemployed schemer who lives across the hall from Jerry and likes to burst frantically through the door without warning.
In real life, Mr. Kramer and Mr. David lived across the hall from each other at Manhattan Plaza, the housing complex for performing artists at 43d Street and 10th Avenue. As incredible as it may seem to New Yorkers, these two single Manhattanites actually did leave their apartments unlocked and walk in on each other without knocking.
"Kenny was always coming up with these oddball schemes that sounded like they were made up for a television show," Mr. David recalled. "He'd talk you into doing something with him, and it would invariably turn out bad for you. He'd do something like disappear and leave you waiting in the car for an hour. This new idea, the Reality Tour, is something that the television Kramer would do. I hope it works out for Kenny better than most of Kramer's ideas on the show."
Mr. Kramer, 52, prides himself on never having had a straight job. He grew up in the Tremont section of the Bronx, dropped out of high school at 17, sold magazines door to door, played drums in a Catskills resort band and ended up working as a stand-up comedian for a decade. He gave up that career in 1981 when one of his ideas paid off: electronic disco jewelry.
"I hired handicapped workers to assemble earrings and other jewelry that lit up," Mr. Kramer said. "We'd attach a 15-cent red light to a 10-cent watch battery and sell it for $6 in the discos. People went crazy for it. It had this magical effect when you saw it glowing on someone's ear in the dark. That lasted for a couple of years, and it gave me a financial cushion."
Since the disco jewelry days, Mr. Kramer said, he has occupied himself coaching karate, managing an English rock-reggae band in Amsterdam, converting his bedroom into a mini-studio for recording jingles, promoting a coloring book on substance abuse and doing voice-overs for adult comic strips on CD-ROM. When the first "Seinfeld" episode was being written, he briefly lobbied to be allowed to play himself on the program, but he's now thankful that the actor Michael Richards was chosen instead.
"If I'd played Kramer, it never would have flown the way it has with Michael," Mr. Kramer said. "He's the one who came up with the weird clothes and the physical antics that have nothing to do with me. He has to figure a new way to walk in the door every week. It takes amazing preparation, minute detail and a lot of work."
Such discipline doesn't come naturally to the Real Kramer, which is why he has enlisted another neighbor, Bobby Allen Brooks, to direct and accompany him on the Reality Tour.
"My job," Mr. Brooks said, "is to make Kenny rehearse and make sure that we cover the necessary points during the tour, that Kenny doesn't spend the two-hour tours talking instead about the Internet, which is entirely possible."
The Real Kramer tried to be disciplined as he gave a preview of the Reality Tour last weekend. He walked up Ninth Avenue, pausing near 43d Street to point out Dak's Market, formerly Joe's Market, the name of the fruit stand from which the television Kramer was banned. "In the show it was Kramer who was banned from buying fruit there, but in real life it was Larry David," Mr. Kramer said. "He was squeezing."
Mr. Kramer pointed a few doors down to Kam Wei Kitchen, the Chinese restaurant whose delivery man actually helped Mr. David place a telephone order to China for an ointment purported to cure baldness.
"On the show, after the delivery guy helps George order the stuff, Kramer videotapes George's head so they can see later if any new hair comes in," he said. "In real life, I did that for Larry. We're going to show that videotape of his head during the tour."
Nearby, at the Westway Diner on Ninth Avenue, Mr. Kramer pointed out the booth next to the cash register where Mr. David and Mr. Seinfeld drew up early plans for their show ("a show about nothing," as George describes it to Jerry during the episode in which they're planning to write a show about themselves). Mr. Kramer sat down for a cup of coffee with his director, and for a moment his new discipline flagged.
It was a classically Krameresque situation. Mr. Brooks, hoping to sell some of the $27.50 tickets to the Reality Tour, wanted to tell a reporter the "800" number installed in Mr. Kramer's apartment for information. But Mr. Kramer didn't want it published.
"I've been giving that number to women at parties, and it's amazing how well it works," he said. "An '800' number is a great babe magnet. I don't want to tie up the line with a lot of other calls. Let people call the Houseman Theater if they want information."
Mr. Brooks was getting exasperated. "Here is the insanity of the Real Kramer. He's got the '800' number, he's got The New York Times here, and he'll throw it all away for the possibility of one night with a woman."
Mr. Kramer grinned and described how the Kramer character is endowed with "kavorca," the mysterious Latvian Orthodox "lure of the animal" that women find irresistible.
"When I'm asked how I feel about Kramer," he said, "I say, well, there's the yin and the yang. On the one hand, the show does paint me out to be a pretty messed-up doofus. But thank God they gave me some kavorca."
Mr. Kramer was eventually persuaded to give out the number -- (800) KRAMERS -- but he insisted that the Real Kramer was not about to become permanently disciplined. "I've promised myself that I'll work hard for two years so I can then officially retire," he said, explaining that he already envisions the day when Kramer's Reality Tour goes on without him.
"My goal," he said, "is to have an actor playing my part. That way we'll have art imitating life imitating art imitating life. And I can sit in the Jacuzzi back home."

HEADLINE: Market Closes Lower in Erratic Trading Day

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
The stock market zigzagged yesterday, declining late in the day, in a session marked by concern over the budget impasse in Washington and the state of the economy but buoyed by the continuing strength of the bond market.
Stock prices were generally up until an announcement that budget talks between President Clinton and the Republican Congressional leadership had been canceled. Prices then slid sharply, recovering from their lows of the session at the close. 
 "Everything seems to be on hold," Alan Ackerman, senior vice president of Fahnestock & Company, said. "There was not a lot of good news and leadership was tough to find."
The index of leading economic indicators for November showed a deeper-than-expected decline of three-tenths of 1 percent. "The underpinnings of the market are substantially weaker than they have been over the last year," Jerry Hegarty, an equity-market analyst for Thomson Research, said.
Bond prices surged again, with Treasury instruments enjoying their biggest two-day rally since August. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 22/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.01 percent, from 6.05 percent on Tuesday.
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 21.32 points, to close at 5,066.90, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index eased 2.07 points, to 606.37. But the Nasdaq composite index edged up 2.43 points, to 998.30.
Gainers narrowly exceeded losers on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,230 to 1,117. Big Board volume was slightly higher, with 459.4 million shares traded, compared with 425.2 million shares on Tuesday.
Some technology stocks were hurt by a perception that the industry's upward cycle had run its course. Intel, which reported disappointing earnings after the market closed on Tuesday, plummeted 5 3/4, to 50. Trading in its stock was so heavy yesterday -- 68.3 million shares changed hands -- that it set a new record for volume by a Nasdaq issue.
Microsoft, which is expected to report its fiscal second-quarter earnings today, retreated 1 1/2, to 84 7/8. Other technology stocks that finished on the minus side included Compaq, off 2 3/4, to 44; Hewlett-Packard, off 2 3/8, to 76 3/4, and Dell Computer, off 3 9/32, to 23 15/32.
Retail issues weakened in the wake of an announcement by Wal-Mart that it expected fiscal fourth-quarter profit to drop as much as 11 percent, after 99 consecutive quarterly gains. Wal-Mart closed at 20 3/8, down 2 1/8; Sears, Roebuck closed at 40, down 2 1/2, and Gap Inc. closed at 44, down 2.
With pulp prices in the doldrums, some paper companies inched downward. Georgia-Pacific declined 1/8, to 67 5/8; Union Camp fell 1/8, to 45 7/8, and the Nasdaq shares of Jefferson Smurfit dropped 1/8, to 11.
But airline stocks rose on prospects of a favorable outlook this year. Delta Air Lines gained 1, to 70 7/8; AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, increased 1/4, to 71 3/4, and UAL, United Airlines' parent, advanced 1/2, to 160.
Banking-company stocks were higher as the result of favorable earnings reports and lower interest rates. Citicorp closed at 69 3/8, up 1 1/8; Chemical Banking rose to 59 1/2, up 1, and Chase Manhattan closed at 61 7/8, also up 1.
Brokerage issues also gained, amid anticipation of forthcoming solid earnings reports. Merrill Lynch advanced 1 7/8, to 54 7/8; Paine Webber added 3/4, to 19 1/4, and Charles Schwab rose 1 1/8, to 21.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Predicts First Slide In Earnings; Stock Falls 9.4%

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
For the first time in more than 25 years as a public business, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, will report lower quarterly earnings, the company said yesterday in a terse statement. Its shares fell $2.125, or 9.4 percent, to $20.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The news ends a long volume in one of the business world's greatest growth stories. It was a tale that encompassed the transformation of American retailing and the building of one of the nation's largest fortunes. 
 For the quarter ending on Jan. 31, Wal-Mart predicted earnings of 40 cents to 42 cents a share, down from 45 cents for the corresponding quarter last year. The company blamed several factors: a slow Christmas season, higher operating costs, lower margins and a January that has favored shoveling, not shopping.
Analysts, though aware that Wal-Mart's growth was slowing, had expected 47 cents a share. They predicted yesterday that the company's earnings would be bumpier than before, but that the chain would fare better than other discounters whose woes are much worse.
"Retailers have had a difficult year and a very difficult Christmas season," said Bernard Sosnick, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. "Wal-Mart was able to outrun such problems in the past, but wasn't this time."
Wal-Mart's news, which cut $4.6 billion from the company's stock market value, also sliced into other retailing stocks. Shares of Dayton Hudson, Federated, Sears and J. C. Penney fell also fell yesterday.
Retailers have called their Christmas season the worst since the 1990-91 recession, as consumers deeply in debt shunned almost everything that was not marked down. Retailers, meanwhile, had expanded more rapidly than their sales in recent years. Among Wal-Mart's competitors, Kmart, the second-largest discount chain, has fallen far behind, while Caldor and Bradlees filed last year for bankruptcy.
"You've got a bad long-term trend in a bad short-term environment," said Linda T. Christiansen, an analyst at Schroder Wertheim & Company. For Wal-Mart in particular, "it's been increasingly rocky for the last few years, so I see this continuing."
Wal-Mart, which will report the quarterly results on Feb. 27, said that despite the fourth-quarter results, its earnings for the full year will still reach a record $2.7 billion.
With more than 2,600 stores in all 50 states, Wal-Mart is still finding more places to plant its "We Sell for Less" signs. Its foreign expansion appears to be just beginning, and its supercenters, which include grocery stores, are proving popular. But its penetration in the Northwest and Northeast has been limited, and sometimes sharply opposed. And in many regions, its Wal-Mart stores and Sam's Clubs face crowded and mature markets.
Having invested heavily in inventory and distribution systems, Wal-Mart has the lowest expenses in the business. But in the current quarter, those expenses have been higher than the company expected, for reasons it did not detail.
Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., made the Waltons one of the nation's wealthiest families. But the stock no longer paces the market. Even before yesterday's news, the stock was well off its 1995 high of $27.625 a share. At its current levels of around $20, it is appropriately priced, according to Mr. Sosnick, the analyst.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
U.S. Chickens in Russian Pots

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

 BODY:
When Victor Spivak joined forces in 1993 with two other immigrants from the former Soviet Union, their export trading company was little more than a cramped studio apartment in New York.
But now the 27-year-old Mr. Spivak is riding the crest of a booming export business. His enterprise -- the Ascop Company -- has some 180 employees and customers from St. Petersburg to Novosibirsk. 
 He owes it all to chicken.
In a scant three years, Russia has become the biggest export market for American poultry, with chicken exports soaring from $81 million in 1993 to $303 million in 1994. And 1995 was another record-setting year, with more than $500 million in sales, according to Agriculture Department estimates.
Even these statistics do not tell the whole story. American officials say millions of dollars of frozen chicken is being shipped from the United States through Eastern Europe to avoid Russia's hefty tariffs. Specialists at the American Embassy in Moscow say actual exports may be twice the official figure.
The stampede began after Russian poultry production plummeted in the economic upheaval that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, and Americans rushed in to fill the void. With money scarce, demand was high for low-cost meat, and "chicken is the cheapest protein in Russia," said August Schumacher, director of the Agriculture Department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
One twist is that since health-conscious Americans have been trained by years of advertising to prefer white meat, Russians are getting the dark meat -- which they prefer anyway. And because the Bush Administration gave exports a strong shove, Russian consumers dubbed the first influx of packaged chicken parts "Nozhki Busha," or "Bush legs."
The exports are so visible that chicken has already been caught up in the rising tide of nationalism in Russia, with angry poultry producers contending that the imports are part of a Western plan to destroy Russian chicken production and capture the market.
In the United States, the growing Russian market is big news for leading poultry producers, like Tyson Foods Inc., the Arkansas giant, which recently opened a Moscow office, and for trading companies like Ascop and its overseas rivals, like the Russian importer Soyuzcontract.
"Maybe 70 percent of poultry in Russian cities is imported," Mr. Schumacher said. "When you see trade go from nothing to $500 million in three to four years, that beats selling notebook computers."
Ascop's story, though, is not just a tale of enterprising immigrants with a feel for the Russian market. It is also a story about Russia's erratic transition to a capitalist economy, its sagging agricultural production, the differing tastes of American and Russian consumers and even superpower politics.
The United States had exported chicken to Russia in the past, but those exports were eroded by political tensions and by subsidized exports from Western Europe and Brazil.
As relations warmed between Moscow and Washington, though, the Bush Administration offered American exporters loan guarantees to promote the sale of chicken leg quarters to Russia.
The idea was simple. Having spent no small amount of advertising dollars to persuade American consumers to purchase white meat, which has less fat and is used in fast-food chicken sandwiches and the ubiquitous chicken nuggets, American producers had a lot of dark meat on their hands.
But Russians preferred dark meat, both for its taste and because it could be used in soups. Also, without the benefits of sophisticated genetic engineering, breast meat in Russian chickens was stringy and unappealing.
The next big lift came from the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and Russia's unsteady progress toward market reforms. Russian chicken production has always been inefficient compared with that of the United States, but economic upheaval took a further heavy toll.
Feed companies were privatized, and the price of Russian chicken feed, which is often of poor quality, rose. Meanwhile, state subsidies to chicken producers were cut off. According to American estimates, Russian poultry production fell 40 percent from 1991 through 1995.
Ascop's managers saw the opportunity early on. Mr. Spivak, who was born in Kiev, emigrated to the United States as a boy, graduating from Northeastern University.
The other principals in the company now are Simon Dikker, who emigrated from Moldova, and Sergy Sparilis, who left Uzbekistan, as well as Michael Varshisky, who came from Novosibirsk.
At first, Ascop traded in metals. "The purpose of the company was simple: trade with Russia," Mr. Spivak recalled. "It was strictly opportunistic."
But Mr. Spivak had his eye on frozen food, and soon after he joined the company it began to charter ships and fill them with frozen poultry for export to Russia. Its first shipment was in April 1993.
Even then, some American poultry companies were skeptical that the trade in chicken would really take off, Mr. Spivak recalled. Meanwhile, distributors in Russia were still learning about the trade, which led to some setbacks. Some chicken in an early shipment to St. Petersburg spoiled when the Russian buyer failed to manage the cargo properly.
But gradually the business took off. In 1995, Ascop exported about $180 million worth of frozen poultry to Russia, about a third of the officially recorded trade, Mr. Spivak said. The company also distributes their chicken by rail to cities throughout Russia.
"Everyone from babushkas to C.E.O.'s" buys it, Mr. Spivak said. "The Russian food industry is depleted." He said Ascop had a profit margin of about 10 percent.
"They have the Russian connections," said Dale Posthumus, a consultant on trade with Russia. "They work in between the suppliers and importers. They have good relations with the major importers."
Big agricultural producers, like Tyson and Goldkist, have benefited handsomely as well despite sizable tariffs, which were increased last year from 20 to 25 percent. The Russians have also imposed an 11.5 percent value-added tax on imports.
Archie Schaffer, a Tyson spokesman, said that exports accounted for about 10 percent of the company's $5.5 billion in annual sales and that Russia was the largest foreign customer.
Bob Anthony, chairman of American Poultry International, a consortium of American poultry exporters, said the going rate for dark meat was about 45 cents a pound and ranged as high as 52 cents for chicken prepared for export and packed on cargo ships, double the price before the current boom.
Even with the tariffs, though, it has been hard for Russian poultry producers to compete. Russian producers must receive 10,000 rubles a kilo -- about $2.10 -- to break even, according to an American Government analysis. But imported poultry sells for about 8,500 rubles a kilo in Moscow and other Russian cities.
Indeed, the export business is becoming institutionalized. This month, Russian veterinarians started inspections of about 360 American poultry plants, a condition the Russians insisted on to insure quality control.
"We get calls weekly from people in Russia," said Toby Moore, a spokesman for the United States Poultry and Egg Export Council, an industry trade association based in Atlanta. American companies, Mr. Moore added, are "making money hand over fist."
For the American poultry industry, foreign sales, which now make up about 15 percent of the expanding poultry market, are no longer merely a means of handling excess production. They have become an integral and lucrative part of the market.
American officials project a 5 percent increase in exports for 1996, a respectable increase but a far cry from the sharp rises of past years. But Mr. Anthony said he expected exports to Russia to continue to grow at a higher rate.
"The question is," observed Mr. Schumacher, "is this sustainable?"
And will it be politically viable? "Low prices and huge volumes of imported poultry may strengthen the anti-trade positions of the Communist and Agrarian Parties before the Presidential elections in June 1996," according to a report from the American Embassy in Moscow.
The pressure from Russian producers could lead to still higher tariffs or new subsidies at home in the short term. Grigory Nerubenko, the head of the Russian association of poultry producers, has appealed for as much as 2 trillion rubles, or up to $430 million in subsidies.
But there is a powerful countervailing pressure that is likely to keep the market open to foreign exports: the demand by Russian consumers for lower-cost meat.
In effect, the politics of chicken pits Russia's consumer-packed urban areas against Russian producers, and Russian mayors have proved to be a powerful friend of the consumer.
Mr. Posthumus noted that American companies were considering how to diversify beyond Bush legs to processed chicken foods like chicken meal for sausage, chicken fast-food nuggets and chicken franks, which are already sold in Russia.
But Mr. Spivak is concentrating on how to improve Ascop's distribution and is not worried that Russian producers may grab back the trade. The Russian agricultural sector, he said, has "a lot of problems which will take a very long time to solve."

HEADLINE: Michigan Moves to Untie Joblessness and Welfare

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: LANSING, Mich., Jan. 17

 BODY:
Gov. John Engler, a darling of Congressional Republicans for his efforts to pare welfare rolls, announced tonight an experimental project seeking to eliminate unemployment among welfare recipients in six areas of Michigan.
The plan calls for caseworkers to visit all those areas' welfare recipients at home and offer them job-hunting assistance, free or subsidized transportation to jobs and subsidized child care. Under a provision of the plan that, unlike others, would require Federal approval, any recipient who was capable of working but declined to do so would lose all benefits. 
 "We will measure success not by the number of families that are getting government checks, but by the number of families that are earning paychecks and don't need us anymore," Mr. Engler said in his State of the State Message to the Michigan Legislature tonight.
With Federal social policy frozen as a result of Washington's lengthy budget dispute, the nation's real policy changes are coming piecemeal in state capitals across the country. But while many governors have begun to give their annual addresses to state legislatures, Michigan's pioneering role in welfare policy made the project that Mr. Engler announced tonight one of the most widely awaited.
The program, called Project Zero because the goal is zero unemployment among welfare recipients, incorporates many elements of welfare policy changes approved with little fanfare by the State Legislature last month. Sheldon Danziger, a professor of social work and public policy at the University of Michigan, said the program appeared to be the most ambitious of those now under way in 25 to 30 states that are aimed at putting welfare recipients to work. Most of those programs have sought to reduce unemployment among recipients, rather than eliminate it entirely as Michigan's would.
But one of the most striking features of the project is the extent to which it differs from the Federal welfare legislation that Congressional Republicans have been unable to persuade President Clinton to sign.
While the Michigan program would deny welfare benefits to recipients who refused to look for a job, it would not set any limit on the length of time that beneficiaries could collect welfare if they did try to work.
In contrast, the Republican Congressional bill, vetoed once by Mr. Clinton and now part of Washington's broader budget debate, would limit eligibility to five years, a provision that is a big source of the welfare savings the Republicans seek. Mr. Clinton himself has endorsed a two-year time limit, but with many exceptions.
Governor Engler's plan also omits the Congressional Republicans' controversial provision denying benefits to children born to women already on welfare.
And Michigan recipients who could not find paying jobs would be allowed to perform volunteer community service to retain their welfare benefits, a provision that many Congressional Republicans have opposed.
In addition, the Governor's plan calls for the state to provide subsidized child care and transportation for welfare recipients who are willing to take jobs, going somewhat further than Republicans in Congress in guaranteeing the availability of those services.
These differences are only the latest sign that Republican governors are reluctant to pursue the kinds of changes envisioned by House Republicans. Mr. Engler, himself a conservative Republican, has been a strong advocate of Congressional Republican efforts to turn Federal welfare spending into block grants to the states. But while many Republican conservatives in Congress have tried to link these block grants to a variety of social policies, Mr. Engler has led Republican governors over the last year in contending that states should have nearly complete freedom in spending the money.
The project that Governor Engler announced tonight is to begin on April 1 and last a year. It will be carried out in a poor Detroit neighborhood; in Romulus, a Detroit suburb, and in four rural counties.
"If it does what I'm sure it will do, the project will then go statewide," said Gerald H. Miller, director of Michigan's Department of Social Services.
As a result of an earlier initiative by Mr. Engler, which required a Federal waiver, Michigan already reduces benefits by 25 percent for welfare recipients who refuse to work. But the new program's provision eliminating such recipients' benefits entirely could not take effect without further Federal approval. A stipulation allowing such policies at the state level is included in the Congressional Republicans' welfare bill.
Mr. Miller said he expected the Governor's program to pay for itself through lower welfare payments. But Professor Danziger, of the University of Michigan, was skeptical. "I don't know of any of the other state demonstration projects that have been able to save money" in the first couple of years, he said.
Timothy M. Smeeding, an economics professor at Syracuse University, said many beneficiaries of Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the main Federal welfare program, might be unable to work. Some studies have shown that up to 40 percent of the recipients have learning disabilities, drug abuse problems or other difficulties.
Mr. Miller said he doubted the studies. The truly disabled should be receiving disability benefits, not welfare, he said. But there are people working in Michigan now, he added, "who five years ago, even one year ago, were in a state institution."
Michigan has had one of the best success rates in the nation recently in putting welfare recipients to work. Employment among recipients stood at 30.9 percent in December, more than three times the national average.
Partly because of his visibility on welfare policy, Mr. Engler has been rumored to be a prospective Republican Vice-Presidential nominee. But although he emphasized the national implications of his welfare policies in his speech tonight, he said in an interview afterward that he had not discussed the nomination with any of the Republican Presidential candidates.

HEADLINE: Fighting Crime, Gently

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 17

 BODY:
In the annals of this city's political history, 1995 will go down as a watershed, a year when liberalism returned here in full force. And the person perhaps most responsible is not the politician at center stage, the flamboyant new Mayor, Willie L. Brown Jr., but the new District Attorney, Terence Hallinan.
In Mr. Hallinan, San Francisco has elected a prosecutor who says he believes that prostitutes and minor drug offenders should not be jailed, who opposes the death penalty, who advocates greater gun control and who says he will work around California's "three-strikes" law by using it only against "vicious, violent criminals." 
 By choosing Mr. Hallinan to enforce its laws, San Francisco is also going against a national trend, as communities elsewhere take ever tougher measures against criminals. Indeed, at a time when crime fighting increasingly means sending as many people as possible to prison -- and prison construction is booming -- this city is likely to become a testing ground for compassionate law-enforcement strategies.
"I don't see this right-wing Republican approach, this lock-'em-up for longer and longer periods of time, as the only solution to crime," Mr. Hallinan said last week in his office at the Hall of Justice, which he had just occupied. "There has to be more to it than that, and I think people will eventually come to agree with me."
But some California officials find Mr. Hallinan's ascendancy disturbing. State Senator Quinton Kopp, a former member of the city's Board of Supervisors, said Mr. Hallinan's election in December indicated that San Francisans were "willing to accept a District Attorney who doesn't enforce laws that the Legislature enacts and thinks that the laws are too onerous."
Mr. Koop, an independent and a conservative, added, "San Francisco is in a world of it's own, and I'm resigned to it."
Jeff Brown, the San Francisco public defender for 17 years, countered: "Liberals feel comfortable in San Francisco. When someone like Hallinan speaks of addressing the roots of crime, that resonates here. There's a sense of really wanting to fight for poor people, to fight for economic justice, to fight against racism. Those are very important criteria by which San Franciscans choose candidates."
Mr. Hallinan, a onetime amateur boxer and former criminal defense lawyer, has long been an outspoken crusader for liberal, if not radical, ideas. In the 1960's, he was arrested for his advocacy of civil rights and opposition to the war in Vietnam, but at least three earlier arrests involved brawls that resulted in criminal charges.
When he was 17 he was made a ward of the Marin Juvenile Court after pleading guilty to petty theft and battery after he and others beat three Coast Guardsmen and took a case of beer, according to The San Francisco Examiner. At 18, the newspaper reported, he was given a suspended sentence, placed on curfew and fined $150 after pleading guilty to assault and battery and disturbing the peace in the severe beating, along with others, of the owner of a ski lodge. He was acquitted of charges of felony assault in another case.
Mr. Hallinan, who acknowledged in the interview he was a quick-tempered person, said: "As for my personal temperament, I've been a boxer. I know you're not going to win anything by just going out and slugging. You've got to figure out what you're going to do, then when you see an opening you've got to hit."
Mr. Hallinan was one of six brothers who were taught by their father, Vincent, that they had to fight to defend their beliefs. He was nicknamed Kayo by his father, a name he used in his amateur boxing career, and it has followed him since.
His legal scrapes led the state bar to try to deny him a license to practice on the ground of character, but he won the right after a two-year court fight.
In a city known for tolerance, Mr. Hallinan, a Democrat, still stands out. After election to the Board of Supervisors in 1988, he successfully sponsored legislation guaranteeing equal rights for people here who have or are changing their sex.
For much of the 1960's and 1970's, Mr. Hallinan practiced alongside his father and his brother Patrick, handling criminal defense and civil cases, many of the high-profile kind, but many of lesser note, too. It was San Francisco's psychedelic heyday, and he represented hundreds of people living in the Haight-Ashbury District against drug charges.
The District Attorney acknowledged using marijuana as a young person but said he had never used cocaine or heroin. But in "Pearl," a biography of the singer Janis Joplin, the author Ellis Amburn said that Mr. Hallinan had almost died of a heroin overdose administered by the singer at a party in her San Francisco apartment.
Mr. Hallinan denies the story.
Mr. Hallinan was also a defense lawyer in the court-martial of the "Presidio 27," a group of soldiers at the San Francisco Army base who were charged with mutiny for engaging in what their superiors said was an anti-Vietnam War demonstration. Two of the 14 soldiers Mr. Hallinan represented were acquitted while the others received sentences of 6 to 26 months. All the others were convicted and received sentences up to 16 years.
Mr. Hallinan's reputation has also endured a number of personal legal entanglements, including a paternity suit brought in the 1980's by a former client; he eventually agreed to pay child support. More recently, a former aide accused him of sexual harassment, an accusation that he denied, before settling the woman's suit out of court earlier this year.
Mr. Hallinan is now living with his second wife, Lisa Streeter, a former administrative aide, and their daughter, as well as with her daughter. He has a son from his first marriage.
How Mr. Hallinan's ideas will translate into crime fighting remains to be seen, but they leave this city's law-enforcement establishment facing a possibly momentous shift. His ties to Mayor Brown go back to the early 1960's, and they have what Mr. Hallinan calls a "warm relationship." But so far, Mr. Brown has not openly endorsed Mr. Hallinan's crime-fighting policies.
In the election campaign, San Francisco's two daily newspapers and most of the law-enforcement establishment supported Mr. Hallinan's opponent, Bill Fazio, a former Deputy District Attorney, who was dismissed last April by District Attorney Arlo Smith. The move prompted Mr. Fazio to run for the office, and both he and Mr. Hallinan finished ahead of Mr. Smith in the general election. In December's runoff, Mr. Hallinan outpolled Mr. Fazio by 52 percent to 48 percent.
The "worst part of prostitution," Mr. Hallinan asserted, is "the nuisance it creates on the public streets." He would prefer that prostitution be handled as a public health issue rather than in the criminal justice system.
"I don't know if you can solve the problem," he said. All the current criminal system does in its approach to prostitution, he said, is to "chase it around town to keep it from becoming terrifyingly oppressive in any one area."
"It seems to me," he said, "as a society we can come up with a better way of dealing with it."
Similarly, he said, "In a theoretical sense, I don't think the criminal courts are the appropriate place to handle drug problems, but we don't really have any other place to handle them, so that's where they end up."
One innovation he is pushing is the placing of prosecutors in the neighborhoods, perhaps in police precincts. "I want attorneys walking around, getting to meet people, putting out their cards, going to meetings," he said.
Such a move, he hopes, would lessen the skepticism some people, especially blacks, feel about the legal system. Indeed, Mr. Hallinan calls the issue of race one of society's most pressing issues, characterizing relations between blacks and whites as being "in terrible condition."
He says much of the fault lies with whites. "The ball's in our court, the white people," he said. "It's in our court to come up with some alternative ways to work toward finding what we have in common."
One of his goals, he said, is to "thoroughly integrate" the criminal justice system. He noted by way of example that across the bay, in Alameda County, about a third of the prosecutors are black.
In San Francisco, he said, "I think there are 7 African-Americans out of 117 prosecutors, and it took years to reach that.
"It's not only a matter of fairness," he said. "You get juries that go to courtroom after courtroom and the only black face they see is sitting behind the defense table, and they don't like that, and sometimes they acquit someone who shouldn't be acquitted because they're just upset about it, so I intend to overcome that."
Mr. Hallinan is also an ardent supporter of affirmative action, a position that pits him squarely against Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, and much of the state's political establishment.
Mr. Hallinan has already angered some in the San Francisco District Attorney's office by suggesting that he may replace many of the higher-paid lawyers with younger less-costly ones. And some lawyers complain that because he has no prosecutorial experience he is not fit to serve as the District Attorney.
"It's a little weird to have someone in that job who's spent his entire career on the other side, as a defense lawyer," said a San Francisco lawyer who characterized himself as an admirer of Mr. Hallinan but who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Mr. Hallinan dismisses those who say he is not qualified to be a prosecutor. "There's no truth in that," he said. "I'm a lawyer, and you aren't trained in law school to be a defense lawyer or a prosecutor, they train you to be a lawyer."
The seminal influence in Mr. Hallinan's life was his father, a legendary figure in San Francisco legal circles who, among other things, represented Harry Bridges, the leader of a longshoremen's union, during his trial in 1950 on charges that he lied when he denied being a Communist. The elder Hallinan later ran for President under the Progressive Party banner, while serving time in jail for contempt. He was twice suspended from the practice of law and spent 18 months in a Federal prison for tax evasion. He died in 1992 at the age of 95.
Terence Hallinan says his father literally taught his sons how to fight.
Mr. Hallinan recalled: "My father said, 'Teach them how to box and they'll stand up for things they believe in.' I got into a lot of fights when I was a kid." Indeed, he fought at the college level while studying at Berkeley and was good enough to make the 1960 Olympic trials.
As for accomplishing his goals, Mr. Hallinan is supremely confident. "We have a real opportunity here," he said.
There is now a clear choice, he added, between "going back to the Republican way of doing things, of squeezing the poor, of getting tough and putting people in prison, helter-skelter, or seeing if we can really come up with some new ways of doing things."
"In other words," Mr. Hallinan said, "if we don't do it now, we've got only ourselves to blame."

HEADLINE: When AIDS Patients Confront the Managed-Care System

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Managed care companies and other health insurers have incentives to provide a lesser quality of care to chronically ill patients (front page, Jan. 15). If a managed care company were to provide superior care to its sickest patients, it would be flooded with such patients during the next enrollment period, raising its costs relative to competitors'. 
 Countries like Israel and the Netherlands provide reimbursement subsidies to managed care plans that enroll a greater number of elderly in their case mix and are devising methods to provide additional reimbursement to plans that enroll a greater number of the chronically ill. The United States should follow their lead.

Such a move, he hopes, would lessen the skepticism some people, especially blacks, feel about the legal system. Indeed, Mr. Hallinan calls the issue of race one of society's most pressing issues, characterizing relations between blacks and whites as being "in terrible condition."
He says much of the fault lies with whites. "The ball's in our court, the white people," he said. "It's in our court to come up with some alternative ways to work toward finding what we have in common."
One of his goals, he said, is to "thoroughly integrate" the criminal justice system. He noted by way of example that across the bay, in Alameda County, about a third of the prosecutors are black.
In San Francisco, he said, "I think there are 7 African-Americans out of 117 prosecutors, and it took years to reach that.
"It's not only a matter of fairness," he said. "You get juries that go to courtroom after courtroom and the only black face they see is sitting behind the defense table, and they don't like that, and sometimes they acquit someone who shouldn't be acquitted because they're just upset about it, so I intend to overcome that."
Mr. Hallinan is also an ardent supporter of affirmative action, a position that pits him squarely against Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, and much of the state's political establishment.
Mr. Hallinan has already angered some in the San Francisco District Attorney's office by suggesting that he may replace many of the higher-paid lawyers with younger less-costly ones. And some lawyers complain that because he has no prosecutorial experience he is not fit to serve as the District Attorney.
"It's a little weird to have someone in that job who's spent his entire career on the other side, as a defense lawyer," said a San Francisco lawyer who characterized himself as an admirer of Mr. Hallinan but who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Mr. Hallinan dismisses those who say he is not qualified to be a prosecutor. "There's no truth in that," he said. "I'm a lawyer, and you aren't trained in law school to be a defense lawyer or a prosecutor, they train you to be a lawyer."
The seminal influence in Mr. Hallinan's life was his father, a legendary figure in San Francisco legal circles who, among other things, represented Harry Bridges, the leader of a longshoremen's union, during his trial in 1950 on charges that he lied when he denied being a Communist. The elder Hallinan later ran for President under the Progressive Party banner, while serving time in jail for contempt. He was twice suspended from the practice of law and spent 18 months in a Federal prison for tax evasion. He died in 1992 at the age of 95.
Terence Hallinan says his father literally taught his sons how to fight.
Mr. Hallinan recalled: "My father said, 'Teach them how to box and they'll stand up for things they believe in.' I got into a lot of fights when I was a kid." Indeed, he fought at the college level while studying at Berkeley and was good enough to make the 1960 Olympic trials.
As for accomplishing his goals, Mr. Hallinan is supremely confident. "We have a real opportunity here," he said.
There is now a clear choice, he added, between "going back to the Republican way of doing things, of squeezing the poor, of getting tough and putting people in prison, helter-skelter, or seeing if we can really come up with some new ways of doing things."
"In other words," Mr. Hallinan said, "if we don't do it now, we've got only ourselves to blame."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 27, 1996, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 18 about the new District Attorney of San Francisco referred incorrectly in some editions to the part of the local population who had undergone sex changes or planned to do so. No precise estimate is available. In a report last year, the San Francisco Human Rights Commission said informal surveys indicated that the city had about 6,000 "transgendered individuals" (not 10,000), a varied group ranging from those who have undergone sex change operations to those who dress as members of the opposite sex.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Fall and Blizzard Is Cited

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
New claims for jobless benefits plunged by 67,000 last week, when the blizzard kept many government offices closed. The drop was the largest in more than two years.
The Labor Department said today that new applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 327,000 in the week that ended last Saturday, down from 394,000 a week earlier. 
 The report was the first since the one that provided data for the week ended Dec. 9. The department had been closed by the partial Government shutdown that began Dec. 16 and then by the blizzard.
The number of new claims last week was the smallest since 321,000 were filed during the week that ended on July 29, 1995.

HEADLINE: BOXING;
Rejuberation! It's a New Vitality

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
This could be the Year of Rejuberation: The teams we love to love, the Cowboys, Bulls and Rangers, are back on track; the sport we love to hate, boxing, may be coming back again, and the Olympics have discovered a new money-making religion, money. Baseball, the sport of the 20th century, may have found its wedge into the 21st, interleague play.
Rejuberation is a great word, not yet in the dictionary although far juicier and more evocative than mere rejuvenation, which contains fresh vitality but not such joyous celebration. The word's author is Terrible Tim Witherspoon, one of the many former heavyweight champions who are still active. Last week, at a Madison Square Garden news conference before the Roy Jones Jr. show, on which he was featured, Witherspoon rose to describe himself as "rejuberated." Finally freed from the clutches of Don King, he said, he felt young again and ready to punch through to his destiny, another title. 
 The pursuit of rejuberation has its risks. In Terrible Tim's case, it meant losing the protection, at 38, of a promoter who has often been accused of being crooked, but never of being unable to get matches for fighters in his stable. But Tim took a chance, ground out a solid victory over Alfred (Ice) Cole to set up Jones's brief, thrilling assault on Merqui Sosa. Had George Foreman actually fought at the Garden next month, completing a trilogy begun by Oscar de la Hoya last month, and should HBO be successful with its late night club fights, all of boxing may have been rejuberated without having to waiting for King and Mike Tyson to call the shots.
In any case, of course, this will happen sooner or later since boxing is to sports what Broadway theater is to the performing arts, the "fabulous invalid" kept alive by the kindness of grifters and romantics.
Basketball has different angels. When the Chicago Bulls added Dennis Rodman, there were predictions he would destabilize the Jordanaires. Wishful thinking. The Bulls now have the best record in the league, and Michael seems rejuvenated, if not rejuberated. Adding Rodman had seemed like a risky move, but the Bulls are an immensely disciplined organization, from the owner, Jerry Reinsdorf, and General Manager Jerry Krause, through Coach Phil Jackson, whose Zen Christianity seems like New Age pragmatism, and on to Jordan and Rodman, who are professionals when treated like professionals. Pros rarely pout when change makes them better or earns them more money. Which is why the Dallas Cowboys' addition of Deion Sanders turned out to make sense, despite the same caveats.
But change has to be bold to work. The Rangers and the Knicks, rival divisions within the same conglomerate, may provide a lesson. Both lost high-maintenance, high-profile coaches in messy endings, which were not totally their own faults. Then the Knicks brought in a coach nice and needy enough to get along with management but didn't bother to buy him a team; they didn't unload John Starks or trade Patrick Ewing in time to stock a future winner with young legs. The Rangers meanwhile promoted a nice guy coach but bought him a gang of toothless old half-names, many with championship rings on their gnarled fingers and a fierce willingness to chop block all those classy young shooters threatening to turn the National Hockey League into the Euro-glide League. You know which ITT team is leading its division.
Meanwhile, NBC Sports' Dick Ebersol reached deep into General Electric's deep pockets and leased the Olympic Games, maybe forever, giving that former festival of amateurism long-term stability to campaign for president Juan Antonio Samaranch's Nobel Peace Prize (shouldn't it be in Economics?) and make the world safe for beach volleyball and ballroom dancing as new medal sports. They could replace biathlon and synchronized swimming, which are, after all, only amateur sports.
Ah, baseball, newly returned from coma, trying to stimulate the healing process with interleague play, a wonderful idea whose time has come. Baseball has never promoted its performers as vigorously as it has licensed its logos and images (fair enough, how much more do we need to know about Cal Ripken's worthiness, Albert Belle's grumpiness?). But it does need to find new ways of promoting a game whose emotional pull has been frayed by years of expansion, player and franchise movement, and labor discord. The old rust-belt rivalries have been rearranged. The distinction between the National and American Leagues may not mean so much to newer fans (Quick, which is the junior circuit?) except for the designated hitter rule (a happy career-saver for older, fat guys). Depending on where you live, wouldn't you like to see Mets-Yankees, Cubs-White Sox, even Dodgers-Angels, in games that would count? Especially if they were well packaged (See the early days of "Monday Night Football.")
Ultimately, doing nothing creative (see Giants, Jets, Mets) may be the only danger these days. Rejuberation may be all in the mind but even if you only think you're happier it often shows up in the standings, not to mention the bottom line. Just ask Terrible Tim.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Prices Advance on Signs That Export Demand Could Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Prices for copper contracts jumped yesterday as investors scrambled to buy amid indications of renewed demand.
On other commodity markets, crude oil futures surged, while grain and soybean futures advanced. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities rose 0.38 point, to 240.59. 
 Chinese trade data released during the day showed that 1995 brought a sharp rise in Chinese copper imports. China imported 107,680 tons last year, up about 37 percent from a year earlier.
The news spurred speculation that China would buy more copper before April to beat an import tax deadline, Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst at Prudential Securities in New York, said.
"Chinese buying gets the market very excited, because the potential is very large," Ms. Raptopoulos said. "They don't buy often, but when they do, they buy a lot."
High-grade copper for March delivery surged 3.15 cents, to $1.148 a pound, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Prices also surged after the Bank of England and the Bank of France cut some interest rates. Copper is sensitive to interest rates since it is used in the rate-sensitive automotive and construction fields.
Crude-oil and heating-oil contracts advanced strongly for a second day on the New York Mercantile Exchange because of forecasts for cold weather and because the market has become more confident that the United Nations will not allow Iraq to resume selling oil. It has been banned from doing so since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
February crude rose 66 cents, to $19.18 a barrel; February heating oil rose 1.24 cents, to 54.37 cents a gallon; February unleaded gasoline rose 0.23 cent, to 55.21 cents a gallon.
Grain and soybean futures prices advanced on the Chicago Board of Trade, in part on renewed hopes about exports.
Corn futures advanced because of a belief that recently plunging prices have spurred export interest. South Korea was an overnight buyer, and other countries were in the market.
Wheat futures rose in step with corn and soybeans and on the possibility of damage to the hard red winter wheat crop in Kansas after a snow and wind storm.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Eleanor and Hillary

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Three years ago this week they were dancing and singing and telling happy jokes at all the balls and parties given for them in Washington.
Now he is campaigning for another term in office as President. She is campaigning too -- desperately, to save what is left of her reputation. 
 The President stands by her, of course. But he seems to cast himself as an observer -- warm and interested, but somehow aside from and beyond what is going on that is eating her up. He may win again, but compared with how she saw herself and her role in government, she cannot.
We do not know exactly what they did in Whitewater. But it is impossible to believe he did not know that she would so tortuously try to talk her way around it -- or that she had pressured for firing the White House travel staff without telling him.
We do know this: The most important decision they took after Bill Clinton became President, the worst and most dangerous, they made together. That was to transform the chivalrously intended position of First Lady into The First Ladyship and make it the second most important political post in the land.
That decision skewed the Government, skirted its law, twisted its Constitution. It was outrageous in concept and practice -- the anointing of an unelected person to dominate a large part of the Government because she wore his wedding ring.
The law provides that a President should not appoint a member of his family to run a Federal agency. He dodged that by appointing his wife to rule over the most important work of a whole batch of agency heads -- writing a new health-care program.
She became not only an equivalent of a cabinet member but the most powerful one. Her influence touched their fears. High officials who are part of her domain lost their ultimate right -- to appeal over the head of a team leader to the President.
The first time you complain about the work of a President's wife he may nod and say thank you. The second time he will ask: Will nobody rid me of this fool? Somebody will.
They transferred power -- part of the power he held by vote of the people, he not she. And incidentally they besmirched feminism. Feminism does not rely on the wedding ring to achieve political power. The Clintons just didn't get it.
When I wrote this two years ago, from her supporters I got a furious argument that we hear more and more now that the hole she is in gets deeper. "Eleanor did it."
No, Eleanor Roosevelt did not do it. The contrary -- she used her influence as a President's wife not to exert executive power inside the Government, but to bring in unheard voices from outside.
Doris Kearns Goodwin details this magnificently in her book about the Roosevelts, "No Ordinary Time." Eleanor traveled the country to talk with people her husband showed no wild desire to meet -- blacks, the unemployed, working women. Then she kept telling him that war or no war, he was the leader of all the people and many were suffering.
She kept nagging him about black rights, day care for working mothers, job training for women. She drove him almost crazy with her notes and memos, but she never stopped. She had influence, as every spouse does -- but she was not Hillary, and Hillary is not Eleanor.
After F.D.R. had been President nine years he appointed her assistant director of civilian defense under Fiorello La Guardia, former Mayor of New York. The two spent their time not getting along. Finally F.D.R. said he didn't want to hear from either of them. She quit and said publicly that it had been a mistake to take an official job.
She went back to her real life's work -- not First Lady but First Gadfly -- after he died. I met her in 1947 in a cafeteria line at the U.N. She was the U.S. human rights delegate and kept biting the Soviet ankle.
Presumably Mrs. Clinton will not try again to be The First Ladyship if her husband is re-elected. Presumably is not enough. Long ago the Clin tons should have said it was a mistake to give her executive power that evaded law and democratic practice.
The longer they wait the less will be the inclination to believe them when they get around to it. Tomorrow would be an excellent time to start.

Separation Anxiety

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The euphemism of choice for the corporate chopping block is downsizing, but variations abound. John Thomas, a 59-year-old AT&T employee, was told on Tuesday that his job was "not going forward." One thinks of a car with transmission trouble, or the New York Jets offense, not the demise of a lengthy career.
Other workers are discontinued, involuntarily severed, surplussed. There are men and women at AT&T who actually talk about living in a "surplus universe." 
 There are special leaves, separations, rebalances, bumpings and, one of my favorites, cascade bumpings. A cascade bumping actually sounds like a joyful experience.
In the old days some snarling ogre would call you into the office and say, "Jack, you're fired!" It would be better if they still did it that way because that might make the downsized, discontinued, surplussed or severed employee mad as hell. And if enough employees got mad they might get together and decide to do something about the ever-increasing waves of corporate greed and irresponsibility that have capsized their lives and will soon overwhelm many more.
Instead, with the niceties scrupulously observed, and with employment alternatives in extremely short supply, the fired workers remain fearful, frustrated, confused, intimidated and far too docile.
Mr. Thomas, who toiled for AT&T for 40 years, was quoted in The Times as saying: "I've had to downsize people myself, and now it's happening to me. It's not pleasant. I tried to accept it with class, but I went through a lot of emotions -- sadness, worry, concern. Now I have a headache."
There is a Presidential election this year but the only prominent issues so far are Hillary Rodham Clinton's veracity, or lack thereof, and a proposed flat tax that would further fatten the portfolio of the man who is already the richest of the candidates.
Meanwhile, the concerns of ordinary working men and women continue to get short shrift. The out placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported this week that more than half of the callers to its annual nationwide job search were employed. In other words, workers are so scared they are already looking for new jobs before getting the word that they have been fired.
"This is an unusually high percentage of employed individuals calling for job assistance," said John A. Challenger, the firm's executive vice president. "It would seem to reflect widespread workplace insecurity and the expectation of more layoffs and workplace upheavals to come."
A poll in New York State, commissioned by The Times Union of Albany and The Syracuse Herald-American, found that one-third of all respondents fear that they or someone in their household will lose a job in the near future. The poll's results were released the same day that AT&T, which reported profits of $4.7 billion in 1994, began notifying the first of the 48,500 workers it has targeted for dismissal.
"Insecurity is what the voters are telling us more than anything," said John Zogby, whose firm conducted the poll. "They are not planning 5, 10 years in the future. They are worried about next month, next week, their next paycheck. It's frightening, is what it is."
A Presidential campaign that made sense would address the tyrannical power of the great corporations and the effect that it is having on the working families that politicians profess to care so much about. Instead we are led to believe that there is something inevitable about this unconscionable assault on the work force, and its steady erosion of the American dream.
The staggering job losses, even at companies that are thriving, are rationalized as necessary sacrifices to the great gods of international competition. Little is said about the corrosive effect of rampant corporate greed, and even less about peculiar notions like corporate responsibility and accountability -- not just to stockholders, but to employees and their families, to the local community, to the social and economic well-being of the country as a whole.

Weak Reports Bolster Prices Of Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities returned close to their two-week highs yesterday. For the third consecutive day, market participants bought on weak economic data that pointed to continued low inflation.
The market began the day with overseas buying as the French and British cut interest rates, making dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bonds fell to 5.98 percent, from 6.01 percent on Wednesday, as the price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose by 13/32 of a point, to 112 11/32. 
 A Philadelphia Fed survey of regional business activity for January showed a weaker economy, with an index compiled from the survey falling to a negative 16.6 from a positive 11.3 in December. That is a big swing, and the survey was taken before the blizzard.
Data about jobless claims for the five weeks ended last Saturday -- delayed by the partial Government shutdown -- were issued yesterday. Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said that "since the claims data were last released, the series has clearly established an ascending trend," with unemployment-benefit claims approaching 400,000. In the latest week, the number of new claims fell by 67,000, to 367,000. But lately the figure has been close to 400,000, a level that has been associated with recessions, she said. Bad weather may have contributed to the drop of 67,000 in new claims last week.
"The jobless claims," said John Burgess, managing director at Bankers Trust Investment Management, "were consistent with what we already knew but still in line with moderate growth."
He said his expectations for today's report on nonfarm jobs were in the area of increases from 100,000 to 150,000.
"My feeling is that the employment number certainly needs to be on weaker side to justify the prices of the shorter maturities along the yield curve," he said.
Mr. Burgess said he believed that the market had decoupled from the Washington budget talks and was now focused on the economy, with jobs and consumer data the keys. But he said he did not think that a clear picture was possible until February or March, when the data would not be clouded by weather-related factors.
Margo Evashevski, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International, San Francisco, agreed that the focus of the market had shifted to fundamentals. She said the market held up in the wake of no-progress comments on the budget yesterday from Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, and President Clinton.
"Sentiment has been underpinned by expectations for a near-term rate cut," Ms. Evashevski said, "either in January or March. Late afternoon rallies have been commonplace this week and a late push could get the March bond through stiff resistance at a price level of 112 20/32."
A Fed governor, Edward G. Kelly Jr., said in the morning that the Federal Open Market Committee, which meets on Jan. 30 and 31, would have enough data for a decision on interest rates. He said monetary policy was in "zone of neutrality" and that inflation was "benign." He also said that fiscal policy was not a big factor in Fed deliberations and that budget negotiations would not "inhibit" a policy move.
While it appeared that prices could have gone higher, anticipation of an important number like today's nonfarm payroll for December kept investors from getting to far ahead of themselves, traders said..

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Cuts in European Interest Rates Spur Broad Gains by the Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against most major currencies, bolstered by interest-rate cuts in Europe.
Rate reductions by Britain, France and the Netherlands spurred speculation that Germany would follow suit with another cut soon in key rates to bolster its flagging economy. The German central bank held rates steady at a policy meeting yesterday, after lowering a money-market rate on Wednesday. Lower rates in Europe often lift the dollar by making American deposits more attractive. 
 "Interest rates in Europe are continuing to come down, and that should help the dollar," said Mark Fitzsimmons, strategist at the Millburn Ridgefield Corporation, a money-management firm. "France and the U.K. today are a good indication."
Late in New York yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.4740 German marks, up from 1.4715 marks late Wednesday, and at 105.60 yen, up from 105.42 yen on Wednesday. The British pound sold for $1.5182, down from $1.5205.
Britain cut its benchmark minimum lending rate by a quarter-point, to 6.25 percent, while France lowered two interest rates and the Dutch central bank cut its special loan rate. On Wednesday, the German Bundesbank reduced its 14-day securities repurchase rate. It is expected to cut its discount rate later this quarter, traders said.
The dollar also drew strength from a rally in United States stock and bond markets. Bonds rose for a third day, driving the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond below 6 percent for the first time in two weeks. Stocks also rallied. Foreign investors need dollars to buy American assets.
"This is the right time to get into the U.S. markets," said Dimitri Balatsos, portfolio manager at Furman Selz Capital Management, which supervises investments of $6.5 billion.
Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin reaffirmed his support yesterday for a strong dollar, in advance of a meeting in Paris this weekend of the finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrial nations. But most analysts doubt that the group will adopt a plan to support the dollar.

HEADLINE: With the G.I.'s in Bosnia: Money Wins Serb Hearts

SERIES: WITH CHARLIE COMPANY: Dollar Diplomacy

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: SEKOVICI, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Vladimir Lazic, 33, a Serbian carpenter who has worked little since the war began, said he and his friends were taken by surprise when Company C set up camp in a cornfield outside town. No one knew they were coming, he said, and there was plenty of suspicion.
"Now," he said in Serbo-Croatian, grinning, "the opinion is better." 
There was a reason behind the smile: A local wood-working company hired him to help build latrines and wooden pallets for the peacekeeping encampment. And as the Americans on this NATO mission look for local workers to bake bread, cut hair, fit pipes, haul trash and clean clothes, the word has spread that there may be more to peace than just an end to fighting.
Mr. Lazic summed it up in one of his few words of English. "Money," he said. "Money."
The economics of peace at camps around the American sector is not a central pillar of American strategy in Bosnia, but a side benefit that officials see as another tool to keep soldiers safe.
"It always makes it easier if you can go in and say: We are here because we have to be but we're going to give a little bit and you are going to benefit," said Lieut. Col. William F. Briscoe, commander of the Fourth Battalion, 12th Infantry. Company C of the Fourth Battalion set up its tents last week in Ninici, about six miles outside Sekovici.
The Muslim industrial city of Tuzla, roughly 50 miles northwest of here, had expected a major economic boom as the center of American operations. But business leaders there have complained that the presence has not been as lucrative as they had hoped.
In this depressed farming town of 11,000 people the expectations are not as high. This is a country town with little to offer: a few dim restaurants, a bar with an antiaircraft gun parked on a camouflaged truck in front, a woodworking and a metal fabricating plant. There are expectations, nonetheless.
"If they don't want trouble, they will put us to work," said Vujadin Celic, 48, a personnel manager, said at a cafe. He did not imply a threat, but rather a horse-sense suggestion.
Radinka Starcevic, 28, a clerk in a chilly store with many bare shelves, said she is the only person in her family who has a job.
"There is no money," she said. "There is nobody working." She would love to see Americans infuse jobs and money into the town and, more to the point, her store.
"We will see," she said. "We will see if they help us to build the things that were destroyed in the war."
Soldiers are banned from shopping, eating or drinking in local towns.
So far, much of the dealing with local residents has centered on money. Military officials began with the premise that they would try to spend as much money on the Serbian side as the Muslim side, and Company C and Army civil affairs negotiators have been working to find nearly all that the soldiers need locally.
Already on the Serbian side, the company that Mr. Lazic works for is supplying nine latrines for $615 each and up to 260 wooden pallets, used as tent floors, for a total of $6,137. Today, Charlie Company picked up its first daily delivery of bread, 200 loaves at about 54 cents each. The civil affairs negotiators are seeking drain pipes, trash haulers, squeegees and spotlights. In total, Colonel Briscoe estimated that $500,000 may be spent on this camp alone, one of perhaps two dozen in the American sector.
In anticipation, a certain entrepreneurial spirit is blooming. In town earlier this week, two Serbian policemen tried to sell their nightsticks, and a soldier, in a hopeful sign for peace, offered to sell his uniform, a snazzy black jumpsuit.
This morning, Capt. Hugo Jackson, the commander of Company C, and Capt. Dennis Greenwood, a civil affairs negotiator, began a meeting with a baker who turned out not to be the one they had agreed to work with. The baker, Milan Markovic, nonetheless offered to undercut the competition by 20 cents a loaf.
Nearly all contracts on the Serbian side have to be made through the Mayor, Veljko Stupar, 34, and members of the town council.
After a meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Stupar said relations with Company C were "so far, so good." He said foremost on his mind was making sure the peace held, but like Mr. Lazic, he cracked a big smile when asked if the financial opportunities for Sekovici were also important.
"Yes," he said, "I think so."

HEADLINE: Rubin Sees the Big Powers Focusing on Effect of Slump

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
With growth slowing in the United States and Europe and anemic in Japan, Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin said today that a meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations this weekend would focus on what to do if economic weakness worsened.
One danger of a softening economy in Europe is the possibility that it could derail a move toward a common European currency, Government officials said. The Clinton Administration is also concerned for reasons closer to home: slowdowns abroad could become a drag on the domestic economy, an unnerving prospect in an election year. 
 Still, Mr. Rubin said the talks in Paris with the finance ministers of Britain, France, German, Italy, Canada and Japan, would be low key, centering on how "to respond to slower growth if that proves necessary."
Even so, recent signs that Europe's economic growth is fading will lend some urgency to the talks, particularly because the slowdown could keep Germany and France from reaching economic goals crucial to a European single currency scheduled to start in 1999.
"Perhaps the most important goal for all seven of the countries is growth," said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Paribas Capital Markets in New York.
"It's slipping away in Europe, and they're very concerned about it," he said. "It's falling in the U.S. and Canada. And Japan has been concerned about its growth rate for three years."
As a result, the critical theme at the talks could be a call for a stronger dollar, which might increase exports from European nations and Japan, helping to rekindle their economies, Mr. Fabbri said. He added that he would not be surprised to see some "official jawboning" by some of the finance ministers aimed at increasing the dollar's exchange rate.
Indeed, United States officials might be willing to go along with such a move, given a recent narrowing of the nation's trade deficit, some economists said. Mr. Rubin seemed open to that possibility, saying at a news briefing today that "it has been the view of this Administration that a strong dollar is in the best interest of the United States."
But if pushed too far, any effort to lift the dollar could carry a risk of choking off a surge in American exports at a time when the economy is looking less buoyant.
And to some extent, Mr. Rubin seemed to minimize the seriousness of the problems in Europe. He said at the briefing that economic conditions had "softened a tiny bit" there.
Statistics released earlier this month show that the unemployment rate in Germany had risen to nearly 10 percent. Some economists have slashed their projections for German growth this year to 1 percent from 2 percent.
France endured a wave of public-employee strikes last month. And leaders in both countries are concerned about whether they will be able to meet budget-cutting targets required under the ground rules of European economic union.
Mr. Rubin said the finance ministers also plan to assess progress toward goals set in Canada last year to strengthen the world financial system and improve the effectiveness of agencies like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
He said that in response to a series of resignations of reform-minded ministers in Russia, he also expected the Paris talks "to emphasize how critical it is for Russia to stick firmly" to its transition to a market economy.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
4th-Quarter Comeback For I.B.M.

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Delivering some welcome news to edgy technology investors, I.B.M. reported a 39 percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, surpassing Wall Street forecasts and sparking a rally in its stock price.
The results seemed to allay concerns about the International Business Machines Corporation's future that had been growing since last summer. Its stock price had been depressed by disappointing earnings, product delays, and fears that its $3.5 billion purchase of the Lotus Development Corporation was a mistake. 
 "It was a very solid quarter, and the fact that there was no surprise was the surprise," said Steven Milunovich, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York.
Investors responded enthusiastically sending I.B.M. shares soaring 10.2 percent, or $8.625, to close at $96.25 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The sharp rise also contributed 25.65 points to the 57.45-point rise in the Dow Jones industrial average and appeared to lift other technology stocks as well. The Nasdaq index, heavily weighted in the technology sector, rose nearly 1 percent, ending the day at 1,007.24, up 8.94.
The Microsoft Corporation, which reported its results after the markets closed yesterday, also exceeded analysts' expectations, cheering investors who were disappointed by weaker-than-expected earnings from the Intel Corporation earlier in the week. [Page D2]
I.B.M., which is the world's largest computer company, saw its highest growth come from its services and software businesses; sales of its mainstay hardware products, which include mainframe, midrange and personal computers, were also strong, rising nearly 8 percent in the final quarter.
The company's total gross profit margin was 41.9 percent in the quarter, up from 40.6 percent in the comparable 1994 period. But Richard Thoman, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer, warned that profit margins may decline because I.B.M.'s fastest-growing businesses, like services, have lower margins than its slower growing operations.
I.B.M.'s net earnings for the quarter, including a previously announced one-time charge of $663 million and a one-time gain of $175 million related to the 1994 sale of its Federal Systems Company, were $1.7 billion, or $3.09 a share.
Excluding the two special items, earnings rose 65 percent, to $2 billion, or $3.66 a share, from $1.2 billion, or $2.06 a share, a year earlier. The average earnings forecast of analysts polled by First Call had been $3.45 a share.
Some analysts suggested that the results were actually closer to their estimates after accounting for an earnings increase of about 20 cents a share because of a plunge in the company's effective tax rate to about 34 percent from nearly 41 percent (largely a result of a surprise reduction in the company's tax rate in Brazil). An additional 10 cents a share in earnings came from favorable foreign currency rates.
The company continued to see strong demand for new, lower-cost versions of its traditional mainframe computers, a business that only a few years ago many connected with the industry predicted would disappear. But by recasting its mainframes as computer "servers" and drastically lowering the total cost of buying and operating them, I.B.M. has convinced many customers to trade in their old, water-cooled models.
The company's troubled personal computer business, which had heavy losses in 1994, saw double-digit revenue growth in the quarter and was one of the largest contributors to I.B.M.'s profit improvement this year, Mr. Thoman said in a telephone interview. Nevertheless, he still rated the business "a B- or C+."
Sales of software grew 9 percent, largely because of the acquisition of Lotus. Revenue from I.B.M.'s mainframe software was flat, but Lotus sold 1.2 million copies of its Notes software, which allows businesses to share data among far-flung offices over networks. The sales were a surprise because a long-awaited new version of Notes was released earlier this month. But Mr. Thoman said that many corporate customers decided to buy the old version rather than wait six months to begin setting up their networks with the new version.
Revenues from the company's fast-growing services business grew 25 percent in the quarter, to $4.1 billion. At $12.7 billion in sales for 1995, Big Blue's services revenues surpassed software as the second-largest source of income for I.B.M. after hardware sales.
As a result of the huge job reductions it made in the early 1990's, Big Blue continued to generate a large amount of cash, ending the year with $7.7 billion, despite the $3.5 billion it spent on Lotus and $4.9 billion buying 51 million shares of its own stock.
Mr. Thoman declined to comment on specific acquisition targets, but he said that the company would look to acquire services and software companies that would add immediate value to I.B.M.'s existing businesses and not dilute its stock.
One attractive buy, he said, at least before yesterday's rally, was I.B.M. stock.
Mr. Thoman made a special effort to convince analysts at a meeting yesterday that I.B.M., which has been trading at a low price-earning ratio, was on a solid growth track. "Nearly all our businesses have been transformed for leadership," he told the analysts. "If you go down our product categories, we are pretty competitive."
But some analysts worry about 1996, when the global economy is set to slow down and I.B.M. won't be able to command premium prices for its products.
"They had a very good quarter, but frankly that is really of zero interest at this point," said David Wu, an analyst at the Chicago Corporation. "The real interest is: What are they going to do for me tomorrow?"

HEADLINE: Clinton and 7 G.O.P. Candidates Make Their Appeals to Elderly

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
President Clinton and seven of the Republicans who want his job outlined starkly different proposals today on Medicare, Social Security and other issues of particular concern to elderly people.
In written responses to questionnaires from the American Association of Retired Persons, six of those Republican candidates for President -- Lamar Alexander, Patrick J. Buchanan, Robert K. Dornan, Steve Forbes, Phil Gramm and Richard G. Lugar -- said the Government should let the elderly obtain health insurance through medical savings accounts. 
 Such accounts, a feature of Republican budget legislation vetoed by Mr. Clinton, would be an alternative to the standard Medicare program. Beneficiaries would receive a lump sum from the Government each year, buy private health insurance policies with high deductibles and deposit the remainder in savings accounts that could be used to pay medical expenses that the policies did not cover.
Supporters of medical savings accounts say they would encourage elderly people to be more conscious of costs, since beneficiaries would be permitted to keep some of the unspent money.
Mr. Clinton, whose responses to the questionnaire restated positions he has taken during the three years of his Administration, opposes such accounts, saying they would appeal mainly to healthier, wealthier people and would leave the sick, poor elderly in the standard Medicare program.
At a news conference today where a voters' guide with the candidates' responses was issued, Eugene I. Lehrmann, president of the A.A.R.P., said, "We see medical savings accounts as a real threat to the safety net" provided to the elderly by Medicare.
Senator Bob Dole, the front-running candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, voted for the legislation that would have created such savings accounts. But he did not mention them when asked by the association what changes he proposed for Medicare. Aides said he generally supported the idea of the accounts but had raised some questions about them and wanted to make sure they would not undercut the standard Medicare program. In his response to the A.A.R.P., he said he would slow the growth of Medicare, but he did not say how.
Medicare's future and health policy in general are expected to figure prominently in this year's elections. Under current law, Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which pays hospital bills, is expected to run out of money in 2002.
Senator Gramm boasted that he "led the effort to defeat" Mr. Clinton's ambitious plan for universal health insurance coverage in 1994. "The American people," he said, "do not want greater government involvement in issues like health care."
Democrats, on the other hand, say Mr. Clinton has made political gains by attacking the Republicans on the ground that they would undermine Medicare and so jeopardize the coverage now provided to 37 million people who are elderly or disabled.
Most of the Presidential candidates were predictably reluctant to suggest any changes in Social Security. But Mr. Forbes recommended a major change, which would increase the use of private savings and investments as a source of retirement income. He proposed creating "a new system for younger people, whereby a portion of their payroll taxes would go directly into their own retirement accounts, along the lines of individual retirement accounts."
Under current law, the payroll taxes of active workers are used mainly to pay Social Security benefits for people who have already retired.
Senator Lugar expressed concern about what might happen in 15 years, when baby boomers start to retire. "The aging of the baby boom generation," he said, "requires that changes be made to insure that the Social Security trust fund will remain solvent in the long run."
Specifically, Mr. Lugar said, "it will be necessary to continue the very gradual increase" in the age of eligibility for Social Security benefits, to reflect increases in life expectancy.
Mr. Alexander, Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Dole, Mr. Forbes and Mr. Gramm all supported a simpler tax system, with fewer rates. Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Forbes and Mr. Gramm said they supported a flat tax. Senator Dole and Mr. Alexander said they favored a flatter, fairer, simpler tax system.
In contrast, Senator Lugar said, as he had before, that he would scrap income taxes entirely, in favor of a national retail sales tax of 17 percent. Such an approach, he said, would increase savings, productivity and economic growth.
Several Republicans, including Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Dole and Mr. Gramm, said they would reduce Federal estate taxes. Mr. Buchanan said, "We should abolish the inheritance tax on family farms and small businesses by increasing the standard exemption on estates to $5 million."
Under current law, estates valued at $600,000 or less are exempt from Federal tax. The budget bill passed last year by Congress and vetoed by Mr. Clinton would have gradually increased the exemption to $750,000. The Administration contends that this proposal would have benefited a small number of wealthy people at a high cost to other taxpayers.

HEADLINE: In Uneasy Time, Saudi Prince Provides a Hope of Stability

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Every Tuesday they come, petitioners by the hundreds -- bearded sheiks, tribal elders, impoverished Saudis and some of the country's elite -- to seek out the man who is poised to become the next king.
With burning incense, vast carpets and crystal chandeliers, the nighttime gathering is unquestionably a royal affair. But as even the humblest visitors step forward, each is allowed a moment to make his case face to face. 
 At a time when living standards are falling and religious militancy is on the rise, these are uneasy days for Saudi Arabia, whose 74-year-old ruler, King Fahd, suffered a stroke in November and has transferred power to his half-brother.
But tribal traditions like the weekly councils remain an important cohesive force in the conservative kingdom. And many Saudis have come to regard the heir, Crown Prince Abdullah, as a leader whose careful attention to the rite and to public concerns may be a sign of his capacity to head off trouble.
In a Government portrayed by critics as corrupt, the ascetic-looking Crown Prince, 72, carries a reputation for probity. And while relations between the royal family and the powerful Islamic religious establishment remain strained, the Crown Prince's standing is enhanced by the fact that he has played no part in a crackdown on suspected militants that remains a source of tension.
"Abdullah is more a Bedouin than a city dweller," a leading Saudi businessman said. "Since he was a child he has liked to sit with the people, and he has been used as a conduit to the religious leaders. By background and by temperament, he will at least be better able to deflect some of the criticism."
For now, Saudi officials have minimized the seriousness of King Fahd's illness, saying he suffers only from overwork. Even since being handed power on Jan. 1, Crown Prince Abdullah has emphasized that he is acting only on his brother's behalf.
"He's in good health, and now he's convalescing," the Saudi Information Minister, Fouad Farsi, said of King Fahd in an interview last week. "But it was thought advisable that he should delegate his power to the Crown Prince while he is convalescing because, after all, running a country is not a trivial affair."
The West, with its heavy reliance on Saudi Arabia for oil and as a bulwark against regional antagonists like Iran and Iraq, has nevertheless already focused on what many diplomats here expect to be a permanent transfer of power.
And after the shock of a bombing in the Saudi capital in November that killed five Americans and two Indians, many Saudis also admit to paying closer heed to the implications of a handover that would make the Crown Prince the fifth son of King Abdel Aziz to succeed his father to the throne, which was established 64 years ago.
Despite the discomfort expressed by many here about Saudi Arabia's reliance on Western security guarantees, Western diplomats and many Saudis have expressed confidence that Abdullah will not cut back the ties that his family has long described as a necessary evil.
But while these experts said they believed that the 200 American, British and French warplanes and several thousand American military personnel now in Saudi Arabia will remain, they said the prince might prove more resistant to future American requests for Saudi help.
Describing the Crown Prince as even more attuned than King Fahd to domestic public opinion, the experts say they see no chance that he would approve a long-frustrated American quest to place an armored brigade's worth of military equipment in Saudi Arabia as a contingency against new Iraqi aggression.
"I don't expect somersaults, and I don't expect any unraveling," a Western ambassador said. "But I do expect some questioning of certain aspects of American policy that have tended to take Saudi Arabia for granted."
At a time when the ruling Saud family is being portrayed by dissidents outside the kingdom as increasingly remote, the prospect of such hiccups is not seen as alarming by those who believe that the most important priority for the Saudi Government is to find a way to quell domestic dissent.
"Everyone knows that Fahd had an ill-spent youth," a Western diplomat said of the King, who had a reputation as a playboy before he took power in 1982. "The same cannot be said about Abdullah. That makes it almost impossible to accuse him of hypocrisy, and it makes it possible that he will look less kindly on royal overindulgence."
It remains an open question how far any Saudi leader can or will go to address the country's underlying problems. While Saudi Arabia remains the world's largest oil producer and exporter, declining oil revenues and a fast-growing population have seen the country's per-capita income plunge from $21,000 in 1981 to just $6,800 today. And with half the population under 15, unemployment looms as the next big crisis.
In one important response, the royal family moved last June to shuffle the Cabinet, replacing several long-serving ministers with younger, better educated successors in the most extensive shake-up in 20 years. Austerity measures that increased the cost of electricity and other basic services have been introduced in an attempt to close the country's yawning budget deficit.
But this year's budget included no new cost-cutting, an apparent concession to growing social discontent that opposition figures led by Mohammed al-Massari, a , London-based Saudi dissident, have sought to exploit.
In a country accustomed to oil wealth, the new financial pressures have complicated the royal family's task of maintaining public support. But Saudis and Western diplomats have expressed hope that Crown Prince Abdullah, by background and instincts, may be well equipped to ease some of the tensions.
A committed horseman who has commanded the Saudi National Guard since 1962, the Crown Prince, who vacations in Morocco and has a stutter, would bring a very different image to the Saudi throne than the glib King Fahd, who has long favored European escapes and is seriously overweight.
The son of a Bedouin mother, the Crown Prince is not part of the Sudeiri clan that bonds King Fahd and his full brothers, including Prince Sultan, 68, the Defense Minister, who is second in line for the throne; Prince Salman, the Governor of Riyadh, and Prince Nayef, the Interior Minister.
Because the Crown Prince is already well into his 70's, the long-term relationship between the Saud family and the Saudi people may not be determined until the mantle passes from the sons of King Abdel Aziz to the grandsons, a shift that is not expected for at least a decade.
Abdullah has been spared attacks from critics like Mr. Massari, whose broadsides against the Saud family have found an avid audience among Saudis who read them via fax and electronic mail.
The dissident, who has been ordered to leave Britain, said last week that he remained determined to topple the Saudi Government no matter who headed it. But Mr. Massari has also gone out of his way to describe Abdullah as "less corrupt" than other members of the royal family, including Prince Sultan, whom the dissident has made his favorite target.
Since King Fahd was hospitalized in late November, there has been no sign of a jockeying for position among his surviving sons, continuing an orderly tradition that has withstood crisis and assassination.
From King Abdel Aziz al-Saud, who took power in 1932, the crown has been handed to his sons Saud in 1954, Faisal in 1962, Khalid in 1975 and Fahd in 1982, and Saudi officials say it has long been clear that it would be passed in turn to Crown Prince Abdullah, who holds the title of First Deputy Prime Minister.
In a country whose leaders draw legitimacy from their role as protectors of the Islamic holy sites in Mecca and Medina, the Crown Prince has maintained good relations with the religious establishment, whose traditional alliance with the Saud family was strained by the arrests last year.
At least 100 people remain behind bars, including the suspected leaders of the Muslim militants, Salman bin Fahd al-Audeh and Safar bin Abdel Rahman al-Hawali, and some Islamic activists say they believe that anger over the crackdown may have given rise to the Nov. 13 bombing here, for which three Saudi opposition groups have claimed responsibility.
Many Saudis who hold strong Islamic views believe that the militants are being unfairly punished for criticizing the Government. Because Crown Prince Abdullah did not play a public part in the roundup, some of these Saudis say he may be in a position to mend fences with the critics and with religious leaders sympathetic to their complaints, some of whom he has made a habit of visiting at times of Islamic feasts.
For now, the most visible evidence of those skills is on display at the weekly council, or majlis, in which the Crown Prince opens his palace gates virtually to all comers.
Other members of the royal family also play host to the traditional gatherings, to which citizens carry crumpled written appeals for intervention and assistance, but none are on the scale of Abdullah's and none carry so common a touch. With no visible sign of security -- although King Faisal was shot dead by a nephew during a similar reception in 1975 -- as many as 500 men took turns before him last week, each stepping forward to perch atop a stool and explain face to face why he had come.
Some bent to kiss the Crown Prince's right shoulder in a gesture of respect, but in a response that is unusual here, a court chamberlain tried to quash such signs of deference.
"Shake hands only," he directed, over and over again.

HEADLINE: REPUBLICANS LACK CONSENSUS ON HOW TO BAR SHUTDOWN

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
United in disdain for President Clinton's latest budget proposals and convinced that no deal is in sight, Congressional Republicans acknowledged today that they had not agreed on how to keep the Government open and avoid defaulting on its bonds.
The current stopgap spending authority will expire next Friday, and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, pleaded ignorance of House plans at a news conference. 
 "I don't know precisely what they have in mind," Mr. Dole said.
Representative Robert L. Livingston, the Louisiana Republican who heads the House Appropriations Committee, said he was having his staff prepare a bill that would provide money only for programs that Republicans favor. But he might not put it forward, Mr. Livingston said, because the Senate might reject it or the President might veto it.
"The situation is rather dynamic and fluid right now," he said. "It's changing every minute.
At the White House, President Clinton insisted that an overall budget deal was "clearly within our grasp right now." [Page B7.]
But Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee, said, "It appears as though we have some irreconcilable differences."
The Republicans seemed content to forget further negotiations and make the budget their chief election issue in the fall. The party's Congressional leaders, who have had at least three desultory discussions by telephone conference call since their last session with Mr. Clinton on Jan. 9, plan several face-to-face meetings beginning Monday to develop a spending strategy. They also intend to consider how to deal with raising the ceiling on the national debt, whose statutory limit of $4.9 trillion was reached on Nov. 15.
Since the limit was reached, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has met Government financial obligations by juggling pension accounts, angering Republicans who thought they had a fool-proof weapon to force capitulation from a President who would not risk default.
Republican leaders have pledged not to shut down the Government again, and some of them, like Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Mr. Kasich, have promised action to raise the debt limit. Mr. Dole clearly favors such action, too, as does a big majority of senators.
In the House, however, Republicans disagree sharply about how to get that done, particularly since most of them feel revulsion about voting to allow a bigger debt.
"I don't think we can pass a clean-debt limit," Representative Robert S. Walker of Pennsylvania, a longtime Gingrich ally, said today. But Mr. Walker said that a bill raising the limit, while prohibiting Mr. Rubin from any more creative trust-fund borrowing, could pass.
Such a restriction might prompt Mr. Clinton to reject the bill, said Representative Steve Gunderson, Republican of Wisconsin, but in that case "we can say, 'Don't blame us. Clinton vetoed it.' "
That is almost certainly the sentiment among a majority of House Republicans, although it also has some sharp critics in the party.
"I don't believe it works politically," said Representative Marge Roukema of New Jersey, "and it certainly doesn't work as a responsible financial tactic. A fiscally responsible Republican Party should never be associated with that kind of a tactic. It's not a question of blame; it's a question of responsibility."
Mr. Dole said he had discussed the debt issue on Wednesday with Mr. Gingrich and other Republican leaders, "but we reached no final resolution." House leaders had not decided what conditions to attach to an increase in the debt ceiling, he said, adding, "They are going to have to attach something to it."
The majority leader was reported by aides to be considering asking the Senate to pass both a bill increasing the debt limit without conditions and a straight one- or two-month stopgap spending bill for all Government programs for which regular appropriations have not been passed, rather than picking and choosing among them. Mr. Dole might do so as early as Tuesday to blunt anticipated complaints in Mr. Clinton's State of the Union Message, which will be delivered that night.
Mr. Dole's press secretary, Clarkson Hine, declined to discuss those reports by aides.
The President remained the most publicly enthusiastic about prospects for resuming negotiations on the budget, and his attitude prompted Republicans, as it has before, to speculate that he wants an agreement but is held back by his Democratic allies.
Representative David L. Hobson, Republican of Ohio, said, "A number of people feel the President's in a box, that he really wants to make a deal. Our guys want to make a deal, but they can't get him removed from his handlers."
Referring to Vice President Al Gore and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, Mr. Hobson said: "Nobody believes Gore wants to make a deal or Gephardt wants to make a deal. They want capitulation."
Whatever their true estimates of the prospects, neither side wants to be in the position of proclaiming all prospects dead for reaching agreement on balancing the budget in seven years.
Even Mr. Kasich later hedged his "irreconcilable" phrase to say, "I have never in my mind ever written off the possibility that one day they will march in a room and lay down something that really will balance the budget and save the next generation and guarantee the children an opportunity."
Not only would proclaiming failure hurt in the polls by suggesting a lack of purpose, but it could carry economic risks, too, and neither side wants to be blamed for a decline in the markets.
For the past few weeks, Secretary Rubin has been repeating the same message to all participants in White House meetings: If the talks collapse, let the news out gently.
"We just need to soften the effects on the market," he warned a week ago after a 160-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average in two days.
Mr. Rubin's strategy seems to have worked. Day by day, the prospects for a deal have receded. But the gradations of warnings have been so subtle that the breakdown on Wednesday came as no surprise; today the market climbed substantially.
Republicans also continued to say that even if they did not succeed in negotiating a balanced budget or legislating one, their hopes would not die.
"If we can't override a veto, we'll go to the country in November," Mr. Gingrich said today while raising money for Republicans in Goldsboro, N.C. The party's message, he said, would be, "Give us a Republican President with a signature pen instead of a veto pen in the White House, and we'll finish the job."
Later, in Raleigh, N.C., Mr. Gingrich said he might bring the President's last budget proposal up for a vote in the House next week to show that it could not pass. That would also measure how much Democratic discontent the proposal engendered; it might well not get a majority even of House Democrats.
House leaders will confer among themselves on Monday and with the entire Republican membership on Tuesday. The spending question is likely to be central, rather than budget talks, which are in limbo, or even the debt limit, because the real deadline on that remains uncertain.
Mr. Livingston, the Appropriations Committee chairman, said that there was no way the President could get more money in any spending bill without a budget deal, and that there was strong sentiment to tighten already restrictive temporary spending levels.
But, he said, "in order to avoid a shutdown, we've got to find something that will pass," not only in the House, but also in the Senate, and then be signed by the President.

Caterpillar Earnings, in a Surprise, Rise by 7.5%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., Jan. 18

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc. said today that earnings rose 7.5 percent in the fourth quarter, surprising analysts, who had expected a decline, and sending the company's stock up 10 percent.
At the same time, however, the maker of heavy equipment warned that growth may slow this year. 
 Caterpillar said net income rose to $300 million, or $1.53 a share, in the quarter from $279 million, or $1.38 a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. Analysts had expected the company to report a decline in per-share earnings to $1.26, according to a survey by First Call, and Caterpillar's stock rose $5.375, to close at $59.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was about 4.9 million shares, more than six times the stock's average daily volume.
Caterpillar's strength helped pull up the stock market over all.
Revenue rose 7.3 percent, to $4.21 billion from $3.93 billion. Caterpillar said that revenue in the latest quarter matched the highest level for any quarter in its history and that the sales increase was the biggest reason for the profit gain.
While sales in the United States fell 2 percent in the quarter, sales abroad rose 15 percent.
This year, Caterpillar said, a weaker economy in the United States, combined with a drop in demand for replacement equipment, is expected to result in a lower appetite for the machines and engines the company makes. In particular, Caterpillar said, demand for heavy-duty trucks is expected to drop sharply from its 1995 peak.
Caterpillar added, though, that sales could increase if moderate economic growth continued in the United States throughout the year, rather than weaker growth and a mild recession.
Gary McManus, an analyst at J. P. Morgan, said: "It was a good quarter, but we still believe that going forward it's going to be difficult. We're looking for construction equipment to be down domestically."
Mr. McManus said that Caterpillar was aided by the dollar's weakness last year. A weaker dollar makes Caterpillar's exports less expensive in terms of other currencies. "I'm not willing to bet the dollar goes down from here," Mr. McManus said.
In reporting earnings, Caterpillar said that almost all its striking employees had returned to work. A 17-month strike was called off in December.

HEADLINE: On Trade, Buchanan Strikes a Chord

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Patrick J. Buchanan (Op-Ed, Jan. 17) writes that the true measure of economic success is "whether the standard of living of America's middle class is steadily rising." 
 Many middle-class families have two homes and two cars and far better than adequate food. Is their increased well-being really the standard of our economic success rather than the increased well-being of our neediest people, who lack adequate housing and nutrition?
The poor don't vote and finance politicians, as does the middle class. The poor aren't where the money or the votes are.
Mr. Buchanan suggests that if a flat tax is adopted, it should incorporate a deduction for mortgage interest, which he says is "rooted in middle-class values." But the deductibility of interest on mortgages imposes an unfair burden on those who pay rent, which is not tax deductible.
I've rented an apartment for 38 years and am unlikely ever to own a home. Are my values any less wholesome or worthy of support?
My point here is the hypocrisy of Mr. Buchanan and other flat-taxers, who would have us believe that theirs is an equitable plan devoid of politics.

HEADLINE: A 'Living Wage' Law Would Benefit New York

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re " 'Living Wages,' Fewer Jobs" (Op-Ed, Jan. 12) by Heather Mac Donald: 
 I am the prime sponsor of New York City's "living wage" bill, which would require companies with city contracts to pay their workers $12.10 an hour, including benefits. When Ms. Mac Donald refers to Baltimore's living wage law, she says the hourly wage is $6.60. She omits that it will be raised to $7.70 in two years and also guarantees health benefits, bringing the hourly wage to above $10 an hour.
Contrary to Ms. Mac Donald's assertions, the cost to Baltimore has been negligible, and there is no evidence that it has led to fewer jobs or has harmed the poor.
Ms. Mac Donald asserts that New York's living wage law would cost taxpayers at least $500 million. This is an inflated estimated provided by City Hall, which opposes the legislation. Actually, it would save the city millions because many of the workers would receive health benefits and would not wind up in our emergency rooms when they get sick.
There are tangible benefits of the law: Workers would have more money to recycle in their communities and more time to spend with their families and to contribute to the civic life of their communities.
Ms. Mac Donald implies that the city's use of private contractors is efficient and cost effective. However, she ignores that Constance Cushman, former executive director of the city's Procurement Policy Board, estimates that abuses in the city's contract budget cost taxpayers about $2 billion a year.
Ms. Mac Donald is correct in saying there is no legislative short cut to creating good jobs at decent wages. However, government does have an obligation to insure that people who work full time are not mired in poverty.

HEADLINE: Egypt Downplays News Of Sheik's Sentencing

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Jan. 19

 BODY:
After years in which Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman was a symbol of this country's turbulence, the apparent end of the militant cleric's career has been met here with a satisfaction that is reflected in official silence.
In not gloating at the life sentence given to the sheik in a New York courtroom on Wednesday for his role in an assassination and bombing plot, the Government may have been reluctant to inflame those who may sympathize with Mr. Abdel Rahman's view that the trial against him was part of a Western war against Islam. 
 But the low profile given to the case here has also displayed the determination of the Egyptian Government to show it has put the worst of the country's instability behind it. Although Mr. Abdel Rahman's fiery preachings had for more than a decade given inspiration to those trying to overthrow the secular Government and replace it with Islamic rule, the Government believes that they have become increasingly isolated.
While the charges on which Mr. Abdel Rahman was convicted in New York included plotting a 1993 assassination attempt against President Hosni Mubarak, the country's main Government-controlled newspaper, Al Ahram, carried the news of his sentencing today on an inside page devoted to crime.
"We do not want to comment on this issue," a senior Government official said. "We want to concentrate on more important things: foreign investment, development and our economy."
After failing five times to convict the sheik for crimes he allegedly committed in Egypt, including conspiring in the 1981 assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat, Egyptian officials are plainly relieved that a court has finally put Mr. Abdel Rahman behind bars. That it was an American court has also simplified matters for Egyptian authorities, who by imprisoning Mr. Abdel Rahman here might have handed the militants a kind of living martyr.
But while Mr. Abdel Rahman's use of the United States as a platform for his views was infuriating to Egyptian authorities, the threat that he and his followers pose has clearly faded in Egyptian eyes as the Government has scored major successes in suppressing the militants' four-year-old campaign of violence.
Under the leadership of the Islamic Group, the most violent of the anti-Government organizations, the militants remain a dangerous force and have recently demonstrated a capacity to carry out attacks abroad. Among the operations for which the Islamic Group has claimed responsibility were an assassination attempt against President Mubarak in Ethiopia last June and the bombing in November of the Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan, which left 16 dead.
But in Egypt itself, the militants have continued to pose a major challenge to the authorities only in the country's south. And while the Government still imposes strict emergency powers, a Government that has been preoccupied with internal security has begun to turn some of its attention to spurring the country's slow-growing economy.
Since the trial of Mr. Abdel Rahman and his followers began, the official line has been that the United States gave undue notoriety to the sheik and his followers, and playing down his sentencing was clearly intended to convey the impression that the Government has been successful in putting down the terrorist threat.
"It is the American media that made another Ayatollah Khomeini out of Omar Abdel Rahman," a senior Egyptian official said. "The issue is of no direct concern to us."
The extent of the Government's crackdown on militants and their backers has made ordinary Egyptians wary of expressing views that might be interpreted as endorsing the militants. Since Mr. Abdel Rahman's sentencing, a spokesman for Egypt's largest and most popular Islamic group, the Muslim Brotherhood, has declined to comment except to question whether the defendants received a fair trial.
Independent analysts here have said they believe that the current weakness of the militant groups in Egypt makes it unlikely that either the Islamic Group or its smaller shadow, known as Jihad or Holy War, will retaliate for the sentencing.
"Here we have a state throwing its whole weight behind the fight against these groups," said Negad al-Borai, the secretary general of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, who said the groups' capacity to wage violence had been "severely reduced."
But a lawyer who led the legal team that defended Mr. Abdel Rahman in each of his five trials in Egypt said he believed the outcome of the American trial would ultimately strengthen the hand of the Islamic movement here.
"Let the Americans know that exterminating Omar Abdel Rahman will not put an end to the Islamic revival," said the lawyer, Abdel Halim Mandur. "The numbers of people joining the Islamic reawakening is multiplying whether America likes it or not. It is a matter of faith."

HEADLINE: A New Kind of Party Animal

BYLINE: By Michele Mitchell; Michele Mitchell writes a political column for the Transom, an on-line service for 18- to 35-year-olds.

DATELINE: Washington

 BODY:
To Dick Morris and the rest of the Presidential packagers taking over the country in the coming months, 27-year-old Matt Myers is a nightmare.
 In 1986, the college student from Orange County, California, registered as a Republican; in 1992, he registered as a Democrat. By the 1994 midterm elections, Mr. Myers had become so disgusted with both parties that he signed up as a member of California's newly formed Green Party.
 
 Mr. Myers exemplifies the under-35 voter. They have no pparty loyalty, but they can make a difference in an election. In 1992, 37 percent of those registered voted, the highest turnout for that age group in any election since 1972. Bill Clinton, who chatted with Tabitha Soren on MTV during the campaign, won more than 40 percent of that vote. Ross Perot, running strongly with the older half of this bloc, won 19 percent.
 But President Clinton cannot necessarily count on the same level of support this year. Although he has fulfilled some of his campaign promises, like establishing a national service program, he has failed young voters on bread-and-butter issues.
 For instance, according to the latest numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, people under 25 have the highest unemployment rate, 11.3 percent, of any group. And the President's health-care plan drew protests in 1993 from many groups representing young voters because they felt that the economic burden would fall disproportionately on young workers.
 But the under-35's have not become Republicans. In the 1994 Congressional elections, many stayed home (only 16 percent voted), or, like Mr. Myers, they registered with an independent or alternative party.
 After 1994, membership in the Libertarian Party increased by 20 percent; as many as 40 percent of the newcomers are under 35. The Green Party, established in California in 1990, has a membership of more than 100,000 made up almost entirely of people between the ages of 18 and 35. Most of them, the party's organizers admit, joined not because they believed in the party's environmentalist agenda, but because they wanted political change.
 This could spell trouble for President Clinton. He need only look to political arithmetic in the Republican stronghold of Orange County. In 1988, Vice President Bush took the county by more than 500,000 votes. But four years later, the returns were mixed: 427,000 voted for Mr. Bush, 307,000 for Mr. Clinton and 232,000 for Mr. Perot. Thanks to strong support for Mr. Clinton in Northern California and Los Angeles, the state went Democratic.
 The critical factor, says Kim Alexander, executive director of the California Voter Foundation, was the under-35 vote. This group voted in record numbers in California (23 percent went to the polls, a turnout higher than that of senior citizens) to support Mr. Clinton and Mr. Perot.
 No one knows what this group will do in 1996, says Curtis Gans, director of the Center for the American Electorate, which researches voting behavior. "They have no party affiliation or loyalty," he explains, "and they don't see voting for someone other than a Democrat or a Republican as throwing away their vote. They see it as an investment in change."
 A recent Field poll asked Californians whom they would vote for in a three-way Presidential election: President Clinton, Senator Bob Dole or the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader. Eleven percent of Californians said they would vote for Mr. Nader. Even if he ended up with 3 percent to 5 percent of the vote, that might be enough to cost President Clinton the state.
 Meanwhile, Matt Myers of Orange County says he is listening to the Republican Presidential candidates. "None of the candidates are very good," he told me. "I don't know what I'm going to do in November." The Republicans and Democrats should be forewarned. If Mr. Myers and sizable numbers of voters under 35 do turn out at the polls, they are not likely to waste their opportunity.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises as Europeans Move to Cut Interest Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most major currencies yesterday amid expectations of further interest rate cuts in Europe and speculation that leading industrial nations will endorse a stronger dollar at a weekend meeting.
The dollar surpassed 1.48 German marks for the first time in four months. It also rose to four-month highs against the Swiss and French francs and a 19-month high against the British pound.
Britain, France and the Netherlands trimmed official interest rates yesterday and many investors are betting that Germany will soon follow suit. The Bundesbank left its discount rate unchanged yesterday, after lowering a key money-market rate Wednesday. Lower rates in Europe often help the dollar by making United States deposit more attractive. 
 "Interest rates in Europe have been coming down even faster than here," said Ray Goodner, who helps manage $1 billion in international bonds at American Express Financial Advisers in Minneapolis. "There's widespread concern about the European economies."
Ricardo Gomes, head of foreign exchange at Republic National Bank in New York, said the dollar could rise to 1.55 marks during the next month, a level not seen in a year. "The mark is not quite the star it was, especially with the German economy so weak," he said.
So far this year the dollar has gained 3 percent against the mark, after falling 7.2 percent last year. Yesterday, it rose as high as 1.4845 marks, its highest since Sept. 20, when it reached 1.4897 marks.
It was last quoted at 1.4802 marks, up from 1.4750 late Thursday in New York, and 105.32 yen, little changed from 105.63 yen late Thursday. Against the French franc, the dollar rose to 5.0536 francs from 5.0370 francs Thursday. The pound fell to $1.5120 from $1.5163.
The dollar also drew strength from speculation that finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven industrial nations would discuss ways to push it higher when they met this weekend in Paris. The mark's chronic strength against the dollar has hurt Germany's economy by making the country's exports less competitive.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin reiterated yesrterday that the Clinton Administration favored a strong dollar, fueling talk that the ministers might endorse a further rise in the dollar. On Thursday, he said the Group of Seven would "examine what policies are appropriate to reinforce the recovery" in Germany and Japan. The group is made up of the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada.
The dollar rose against most other major currencies, rising to 1.1933 Swiss francs from 1.1896 francs. It held steady at 1,583.5 Italian lira. The Canadian dollar rose to 73.19 United States cents from 73.31 cents.

HEADLINE: Jobs Data Send Most Bond Prices Down

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of all Treasury securities except the 30-year bond were down yesterday, as many investors sold on what is considered negative economic news for the bond market, although it is good for most everyone else.
A batch of Government reports painted the jobs situation as healthy, showed improvement in the troubled manufacturing sector and suggested moderating overall growth. For market participants the stronger-than-expected data suggested that a rate cut at this month's Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Jan. 30-31 was not automatic.
The price of the 30-year benchmark bond gained 4/32 , after being down as much as 17/32 in morning trading, to finish the New York session at 11215/32 , sending its yield down to 5.97 percent from 5.98 percent on Thursday. 
 The Labor Department's report on the number of jobs added to the economy -- 151,000 in December -- was called conservative by Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich on CNBC yesterday.
Mr. Reich said seasonal adjustments more than compensated for striking Boeing employees, depressing the December estimate of nonfarm payrolls. "Because of seasonal factors, this is a four-week reporting period as opposed to the usual five-week reporting period," he said. "It actually may be higher than 151,000." Analysts also note that because of surges in employment over the holiday period, seasonal adjustments tend to hold down December's payroll numbers.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said the market had been looking for about 125,000. So while the economy is slowing, he said, it is not slowing as much as many thought.
"Year-over-year payroll growth in the fourth quarter dropped to a level of 1.6 percent as compared to 2 percent in the third quarter, and 3.1 percent at this time a year ago," Mr. Fine said.
In similar fashion the revision of the gross domestic product figures also displayed a slowing of economic growth, but with virtually no signs of recession.
"After all these revisions year- over-year G.D.P. growth is 1.9 percent, which is less than previously estimated by the Commerce Department and very much in line with the slowdown we saw in payroll growth," Mr. Fine said.
"I think it is important," he continued, "for people to distinguish between an economy that is slowing as opposed to one that has stopped in its tracks. At the same time with numbers such as these this morning, the Fed is still likely to lean toward ease. But at this juncture it seems more likely that any further easing move would come at the March F.O.M.C. as opposed to the upcoming meeting this month."
And as for consumer and inflation numbers, Mr. Fine said, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index and the Columbia University leading inflation index, both out late in the morning, had little impact on the market.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said, "One has to remember that while the market consensus viewed the economy as being in critical condition prior to the release of this morning's payroll numbers, the actual results of the employment report suggested that the economy was in fact in stable condition."
He added that that was a surprise that "was generally not well received by the bond markets."
The market did manage to experience a small short-lived rally in the afternoon, as buyers were encouraged by lower oil prices, thanks to expectations of a resumption of Iraqi oil sales. With prices down there is less fear of inflation accelerating.
Volume was thinner in the afternoon and price changes were exaggerated. There were reports of a few large hedge funds in the market buying maturities of 10 years and higher, and that led to some short-cover buying by those wanting either to protect profits or cut their losses.
Next week the Treasury will be selling $30.25 billion of new two- and five-year notes in addition to $23 billion of new three- and six-month bills at its regular weekly Monday auction.

HEADLINE: Pataki and Legislative Leaders Agree on Interstate Banking Bill

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders have agreed on a bill that would open up banking in New York by bringing the state into line with new Federal regulations.
Under the bill, banks chartered in New York would be able to operate in states that have also agreed to the Federal regulations, while banks from these states would be able to buy banks in New York.
The Federal regulations, part of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, are intended to increase competition in the banking industry. They automatically go into effect for the entire country in 1997, unless states specifically choose not to take part. 
 By adopting the provisions before then, officials said they hoped to give New York banks a jump on those in the states that have not done so.
The bill now goes to the Senate and the Assembly, where passage is assured.
Twenty states, including Connecticut, have agreed to the provisions of the Riegle-Neal Act, according to the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. The New Jersey Legislature is considering a bill similar to the one in New York.
New York officials, including Governor Pataki, Speaker Sheldon Silver of the Assembly and Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, said the bill announced on Thursday would prepare the state's banks for an era of fewer regulations.
"Passage of the interstate banking and branching provisions contained in my legislation will help New York maintain its worldwide pre-eminence in the banking field," Mr. Pataki said.
Federally chartered banks can already operate in New York. Under the bill, banks from other states could do business in New York only by buying existing state-chartered banks, not by opening up their own branches.
The bill would also require surveillance cameras, reflective mirrors, adequate lighting and other security measures at most automatic teller machines in the state. The legislation would set fines of $2,500 for violations of these new security rules, which were developed with Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco. They do not apply to teller machines in places like supermarkets or airports.
The security provisions in the bill would not take effect in New York City, which already has stricter security rules for teller machines.
"A.T.M.'s are a convenient source for cash and unfortunately a growing target for crime," Mr. Silver said. "This bill seeks to increase the safety and security of consumers who rely more and more on A.T.M.'s for banking services."

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Agrees to Hear S.& L. Case

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
The Supreme Court agreed today to hear the Federal Government's appeal in a case that could add billions of dollars to the cost of cleaning up the residue of the savings and loan disaster of the 1980's.
In a closely watched case, the Government is appealing the finding of a Federal appeals court here that a Congressional change of heart over how to value the liabilities of failed savings and loans amounted to a monumental breach of the Government's contracts with those healthy institutions that Federal regulators had invited to take over the ailing ones.
The accounting changes, included in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, turned healthy balance sheets overnight into ones that could not meet minimum capital requirements. 
 Some savings and loans failed as a result and others, like Glendale Federal Bank, the only survivor of the three savings and loans involved in the case before the Court, managed to raise money in the private markets and emerged weakened and in debt.
Glendale, which is owned by GlenFed Inc., based in Glendale, Calif., is seeking $1.5 billion from the Government for losses involved in its acquisition of an insolvent institution, First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Broward County, Fla. If the Supreme Court upholds the lower court's decision, after an argument to be held in April, the case will return to the Court of Federal Claims for a trial on damages. There are some 100 similar cases in the pipeline, leading Solicitor General Drew S. Days 3d to tell the Justices in the Government's appeal that its ultimate liability would be approximately $10 billion.
The two other savings and loans in the case are Statesman Savings Holding Corporation and Winstar Corporation. Both no longer exist. Statesman, based in Iowa, had acquired a failing savings and loan in West Palm Beach, Fla. and three in Waterloo, Iowa. Winstar was an investment partnership formed in 1984 to acquire the Windom Federal Savings and Loan Association in Minnesota.
Glendale stock fell today on the prospect that the Supreme Court might reject the appeals court ruling that favored the company. The stock fell more than 6 percent, losing $1.125, to $16.875, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange..
In one respect, this is a straightforward breach-of-contract case, albeit one with high stakes. The legal issues, as framed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in its 9-to-2 decision last August, are not particularly complex. But the case also raises interesting questions about how much discretion the Government should have in its role as a regulator to change course and leave the private sector to pay the bills.
The case, United States v. Winstar, No. 95-865, has its roots in the savings and loan crisis of the 1980's, when high interest rates and bad management caused hundreds of institutions to fail. Two regulatory agencies, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, sought out healthy savings and loans that could acquire the insolvent ones and relieve the agencies of the staggering cost of closing them and paying off the depositors' insurance.
Because the huge liabilities of insolvent savings and loans made them unattractive merger candidates, the bank board permitted the acquiring institutions to carry the liabilities as an intangible asset, to be known as "supervisory good will." One of the judges on the Federal Circuit later referred to this phrase as "a euphemism for spinning straw into gold." The liabilities were suddenly deemed to be assets that could be counted as capital and amortized over a period as long as 40 years.
As problems in the industry continued to mount and the regulatory agencies' approach came under increasing criticism, Congress set a new direction by passing the 1989 law. The law increased capital requirements and required the liabilities of the failed institutions to be acknowledged rather than carried as assets.
Glendale, which had capital of only $277 million when it was permitted by Government regulators to count as good will the nearly $750 million of its merger partner's deficits, was required to raise more than $450 million in private capital to stay alive.
The three institutions brought and won lawsuits against the Government in the United States Claims Court here in 1992. Those rulings were overturned the next year by a three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit, a specialized appeals court here that hears financial claims against the Government. The full appeals court then reheard the consolidated case and issued its ruling against the Government last Aug. 31.
In its Supreme Court appeal, the Government is arguing that the appeals court made two basic errors. First, the Government's brief says, the appeals court failed to apply the "unmistakability doctrine," under which the Government should not be contractually bound to exercise its regulatory authority in a particular way unless the contract explicitly promised that a law or regulations would not be changed.
The appeals court said the doctrine did not apply in a case such as this, in which the plaintiffs were not trying to stop the Government from changing its regulations but were seeking monetary damages for their injuries.
In its second argument, the Government said the appeals court failed to apply the "sovereign acts doctrine," under which the Government is immune from liability for enacting a "public and general" policy. The appeals court said the 1989 law was not general policy but rather was intended to "abrogate specific contractual rights."
In another action today, the Court agreed to decide whether suits for injuries from medical devices, in this case a pacemaker, can be brought under state law, or whether such lawsuits are pre-empted once the device has received approval from the Food and Drug Administration and has complied with applicable Federal regulations.
The case, Medtronic Inc. v. Lohr, No. 95-754, is an appeal from a ruling last year by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta. That court permitted a lawsuit contending that a pacemaker that suddenly failed, necessitating emergency surgery, had a defective design.
At the same time, the appeals court ruled that the plaintiff could not challenge the manufacture and labeling of the pacemaker, finding those areas pre-empted. The Justices will also review those aspects of the decision in an appeal brought by the plaintiff, Lohr v. Medtronic, No. 95-886.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Chrysler Reports Strong Earning on Its Mini-Van Sales

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Buoyed by brisk mini-van sales, the Chrysler Corporation announced unexpectedly strong fourth-quarter earnings today, producing a sharp jump in its stock price and strengthening the hand of the auto maker's management in its efforts to retain control of the company.
Chrysler said it earned $1.04 billion, or $2.70 a share, on sales of $15.06 billion in the quarter. Profits were down slightly from the company's best-ever quarter a year earlier, which included a $132 million one-time tax gain. But profits were considerably above the top Wall Street prediction of $2.30 a share. The company's pretax fourth-quarter earnings set a record.
In the fourth quarter of 1994, Chrysler earned $1.17 billion, or $3.20 a share, on sales of $14.27 billion. 
 Investors welcomed the earnings, bidding up Chrysler's shares by as much as $2.50 a share in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock closed at $54.125 a share, up $1.875.
But Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman, warned that the company might not fare as well this year unless politicians and the Federal Reserve act soon to help the American economy. He said that if the Federal Reserve did not act within 90 days to reduce short-term interest rates by at least half a percentage point, auto industry sales this year would fall below last year's levels.
The earnings, and the investor reaction, appeared to bolster Chrysler's executives in dealing with Kirk Kerkorian, the wealthy Las Vegas, Nev., investor whose company, the Tracinda Corporation, has taken a 14 percent stake in Chrysler. Tracinda has sought a seat on Chrysler's board, questioned whether the company is managed aggressively enough and argued that the company should pay out more money in dividends and stock buybacks.
Anna Cordasco, a spokeswoman for Tracinda, said this evening that the company had no specific reaction to Chrysler's profits. "We are evaluating Chrysler's fourth-quarter results to gain a deeper understanding of the longer-term trends that will affect its business," she said.
Another person in Tracinda's camp said that Tracinda was trying to determine whether Chrysler's results may have been unusually strong because of possible changes in pension assumptions, vehicle inventories and accounting for certain costs. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity.
But Wall Street analysts said that they had underestimated Chrysler's earnings because the company sold more of its redesigned mini-vans than they expected. Chrysler has been particularly successful in offering an optional sliding door on the driver's side of most mini-van models -- a feature chosen by 90 percent of its customers, especially those with small children who like the convenience of buckling babies into child seats from either door.
Chrysler sold 123,764 mini-vans in the United States alone during the fourth quarter of 1995, up from 97,930 in the corresponding quarter of 1994. The Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation do not offer a similar door for their mini-vans.
The extra volume of mini-vans reduced the production cost per vehicle, while profits were high because Chrysler was able to sell the mini-vans without rebates or other discounts, said Michael P. Ward, an auto analyst at Paine Webber. "Clearly the biggest impact on earnings in my opinion was the mini-van," he said.
The mini-vans at Chrysler are particularly profitable because they appeal to highly affluent families who can afford to pay the big sticker prices the vans carry, said Maryann N. Keller, an auto analyst at Furman Selz. "This is a life-style vehicle that is an alternative to luxury cars," she said.
Chrysler's fourth-quarter profits were impressive despite the drop from the final quarter of 1994, said David M. Garrity, an auto analyst at Smith Barney. Chrysler shipped an unusually large number of cars and trucks to dealers during the 1994 fourth quarter in the misplaced expectation that showroom sales would be exceptionally brisk in early 1995. Because car companies count a vehicle as sold when it goes to a dealer, the extra shipments improved the results for the fourth quarter of 1994, Mr. Garrity said.
For all of 1995, Chrysler earned $2.03 billion, or $5.30 a share, on sales of $53.195 billion. In 1994, the company earned $3.71 billion, or $10.11 a share, on sales of $52.24 billion.
Late last year, Chrysler said it changed its accounting treatment for certain sales that caused it to restate its earnings for the first quarter of 1995 to show an after-tax charge of $96 million. The full-year 1995 results were also affected by previously announced pretax charges of $263 million for production changes at one assembly plant and $115 million to replace the rear door latches on mini-vans sold from 1984 until 1994.
Mr. Eaton also said today that the economic slowdown in Mexico had cost the company $300 million in lower pretax earnings. The Mexican economy slumped and car sales there collapsed when the Mexican peso plunged a year ago and monetary authorities raised interest rates steeply.

HEADLINE: U.S. Payrolls Expand but Jobless Rate Remains at 5.6%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Easing fears for the moment that the economy is on the verge of sliding into a recession, the Labor Department reported today that employers added a moderate 151,000 jobs to payrolls in December. The unemployment rate remained steady at 5.6 percent.
The first major report on economic performance last month -- delayed two weeks because the Labor Department was closed first by budgetary stalemate and then by a paralyzing blizzard -- was hailed by the Clinton Administration as evidence that the economy continued to expand solidly.
"These numbers show strong and broad-based job growth," contended Joseph E. Stiglitz, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. "The economy continues to operate at full capacity with steady growth and low inflation." 
 Nonetheless, many private analysts pointed to disquieting elements of weakness in the monthly tally that might lead to the economy's stalling in the months ahead. To help avoid that, they said, the Federal Reserve may well make another cut in short-term interest rates at its policy meeting at the end of the month.
"The December employment report confirms other data pointing to sluggish activity," Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch, told clients. The latest soundings, he said, are "weak enough to induce the Fed to ease policy" at its Jan. 30-31 session.
Susan M. Hering of Salomon Brothers also cast a dubious eye on the job figures even though the increase in payrolls surpassed Wall Street's expectations.
"Job growth seems to be losing some oomph," she said. "One has the sense that things are faltering."
Separately, the Commerce Department formally switched to its new method of appraising the economy that was expected to make growth appear weaker than before. Gross domestic product during the July-September period, now calculated under a more accurate methodology, grew at a pace of 3.2 percent over the summer instead of the 4.1 percent first estimated in late October under the old method.
The new way of measuring the economy also prompted a re-examination of the recent past. Some experts suggested that more accurate data at the time of the 1990-91 recession might have improved President George Bush's re-election prospects by prompting the White House and the Federal Reserve to respond more aggressively to the downturn. The labor market in the Northeast appeared especially weak, its jobless rate climbing five-tenths of a point to 6.2 percent. In New York, the rate rose to 6.4 percent from 6, while unemployment in New Jersey surged to 7.3 percent from 6.1 percent.
But figures for individual states are usually erratic, prompting the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- which was denied funds to enlarge its sampling -- to announce today that it would no longer include figures for 11 major industrial states in the monthly employment situation report.
Officials noted that the California unemployment rate gyrated wildly in recent months, registering 7.8 percent in October, 8.8 in November and 7.7 in December. Monthly changes large enough to be statistically meaningful, Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, said ruefully, tend also to defy belief.
A large factor swelling payrolls last month was the jump of 52,000 in factory jobs, but 30,000 of those workers were strikers at the Boeing Company and other companies returning to their jobs. An additional 10,000 worked in automobile assembly plants, offsetting November declines involving temporary furloughs while producers cut inventories.
There were several items that tended to undermine the more upbeat interpretations of the report. Aggregate weekly hours worked declined for a second straight month. The number of temporary jobs failed to increase for a third straight month. And the department's household survey, which sometimes varies widely from the generally more reliable payroll data, showed back-to-back declines in employment.
"These figures send a chill up the spine for anyone with a sense of history," said Kenneth T. Mayland, chief financial economist at KeyCorp in Cleveland. "This is a fragile economy," he added, declaring that both the payroll and household surveys now show 12-month job growth at or below the pace prevailing when the country entered recessions in 1980 and 1990.
The prolonged shutdowns of the Labor Department resulted in fewer household interviews than usual but officials said that the results should not have been appreciably affected. As for the payroll data, the delay provided more time for fuller collection from states and thus greater reliability of the preliminary estimates.
Generally less processing time, however, meant an inability to revise figures for November.
Hourly average earnings advanced 5 cents, to $11.63, in December after no change in November, today's report also showed.
For the year, gains in pay were modest. Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, fretted that paychecks rose only 2.3 percent in 1995, not enough to keep up with consumer inflation that ran at a 2.6 percent pace for the 12 months through November.
For the full year, payroll jobs rose 1.7 million, about half as many as in 1994, the report also showed. The household survey, diverging more than usual, posted a job gain of 335,000, barely enough to keep up with growth of the labor force, which has slowed markedly.
Data included in the gross domestic product for the third quarter of 1995 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. The Commerce Department figures are computed using the new "chain weighted" system, which tries to accurately reflect real changes in the economy by accounting for inflation in a continuous manner. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates.

HEADLINE: No Respite From Murder;
City Decline in Killings Is Not Echoed in Bedford-Stuyvesant

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

 BODY:
From the stoop of Junior's bodega in Bedford-Stuyvesant, New York's falling crime rate seems like nothing more than a mirage to Jose Arapioamnou.
Last July, his father-in-law and brother-in-law were killed by a gunman in a robbery outside the store that his in-laws ran at Stuyvesant Avenue and Madison Street, and several months earlier a store down the block had been robbed by five gunmen. 
 "They talk about crime going down on the television," Mr. Arapioamnou, 32, said as he stood in the store's doorway, his arms crossed and eyes undaunted as if he could ward off criminals by sheer force of will. "But every day, all I hear about is more shooting. Every night, my wife kisses me goodbye, I don't know if I'll be coming home alive."
 Despite a variety of community projects intended to revitalize the area and a citywide trend of sharply falling crime rates, Mr. Arapioamnou's Brooklyn neighborhood had the unenviable distinction of having one of New York City's fastest-growing murder rates in 1995.
While much of New York enjoyed something of a respite from the violence that has plagued the city since crack cocaine appeared a decade ago, the 81st Precinct has been terrorized by drug trafficking, gunfire and a 34 percent rise in homicides, according to police statistics. After registering 26 homicides in 1994, the precinct was the scene of 35 murders last year. A street-corner dice game ended in a fatal gunfight. Inside a stately Victorian brownstone, an 80-year-old woman who weighed less than 90 pounds was beaten to death with her cane during a robbery.
There were 13 drug-related killings -- many near Bedford-Stuyvesant's storefront drug locations -- including that of a 35-year-old woman slain by a stray bullet as she pedaled by on a bicycle.
The police say they are beginning to reverse the neighborhood's surge in homicides.
In the fall, they began using more aggressive crime-fighting techniques and have been coordinating narcotics investigations with the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office and the Drug Enforcement Administration. John Maple, Deputy Police Commissioner for Operations, said he was pleased that the 81st Precinct had no homicides between Nov. 4 and year's end. "We're on the right road," he said.
Moreover, other types of crimes have dropped sharply: Auto thefts have decreased by nearly 50 percent in the last two years, and shootings have declined by about a third in the same period. On the other hand, assaults and rapes were up in 1995 over the previous year. And 1996 has begun on an ominous note. The driver of a livery cab was shot and killed on Jan. 4 during a robbery on Gates Avenue. On Thursday night, an off-duty police officer was shot and killed during a dispute at his former girlfriend's house. Some residents fear the neighborhood's crime problem will not ease anytime soon.
"After a while, it just makes you numb," said one resident, Freddie Hamilton, who began a youth anti-violence group after her son was killed in 1993.
There is no consensus on why the 81st Precinct, a diamond-shaped area that encompasses the eastern half of Bedford-Stuyvesant, has defied New York's stunning statistical drop in murders and other violent crimes.
Lewis Watkins, district manager of Community Board 3, said he had expected the increase in crime because the police have been cracking down on drug dealers in nearby precincts and have not put enough officers on patrol in the 81st.
Lieut. Joseph Pollini, head of the 81st Precinct detective squad, said there has also been a cultural change by some neighborhood drug dealers.
"The dealers used to live in this area and consider it too sacred to deal in," Lieutenant Pollini said. "Now they're bringing their activity here, too."
Others say it is misleading to blame the increase in homicides solely on drug dealers. The Rev. Fred A. Lucas, pastor of the Bridge Street African Methodist Episcopal Church, points out that drug-related killings account for only a third of the homicides. He says the scarcity of jobs, educational opportunities and services in the neighborhood have left some residents so despondent they turn to crime.
"There's a listlessness and despair that's beginning to pervade inner urban America," Mr. Lucas said.
Whatever its causes, the rise in homicides has had a demoralizing effect on this community of about 60,000 residents struggling to renew itself. The 81st Precinct is a predominantly minority community -- 85 percent black and 13 percent Hispanic, according to census figures -- and a neighborhood of extremes. It is home to some of Brooklyn's most prominent African-Americans, yet plagued by an unemployment rate of 30 percent, Mr. Watkins said.
Several blocks contain magnificent homes, and many streets are lined with meticulously kept brownstones. More than 5,000 units of middle-income housing have been built or renovated in the last five years. But more than 40 percent of the population receives some sort of public assistance, according to the community board, and in the neighborhood's northern end, there are blocks pocked by burned-out buildings, vacant lots and waist-high weeds.
Residents of the 1.7-square-mile precinct have had to cope with a high crime rate for decades. Despite last year's increase in homicides, the 35 victims were still fewer than in 1990, when 49 people were killed there, and in 1991, when 48 were killed.
Capt. Michael Gabriel, who became precinct commander last September, said he is optimistic that the community can achieve the same crime reductions felt in the rest of the city. Using the techniques he learned as a Manhattan narcotics detective, Captain Gabriel has stepped up the use of vehicle checkpoints, transit sweeps and warrant sweeps to search for fugitives, drugs and handguns. Narcotics detectives are tracking the drug gangs suspected of many homicides.
In December, 25 cadets were assigned to the neighborhood for street patrol, helping ease the common complaint that the 81st Precinct simply does not put enough officers on the street. To some critics of the department, like Sherri Cox, that is an encouraging start.
"Now we just have to train the police officers to treat the community with more respect," Ms. Cox, president of a block association, said.
The precinct's response to homicides has also become more aggressive, officials say. After a shootout at 1625 Fulton Street on Nov. 4 left one man dead and another wounded, the police descended on the street in force. The victim who survived the attack would not cooperate, but detectives and anti-crime officers saturated the neighborhood and within three days arrested a suspected gunman.
Along the way, they also arrested the brother of the suspect and the brother of the slain man -- both of whom had illegal guns and both of whom were suspected of planning separate retaliatory attacks, Captain Gabriel said.
"I may not be able to stop the first shooting, but I can prevent the payback shootings," Captain Gabriel said.
Perhaps the most visible, if ironic, sign of hope in the neighborhood is the collection of newly shuttered storefronts. Shortly after arriving in the precinct, Captain Gabriel surveyed the neighborhood and determined that as many as 40 bodegas were acting as fronts for crack-cocaine dealers. With the help of the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, the police have used the city's nuisance abatement laws to close down 10 shops that had three or more arrests involving complaints of drug trafficking.
Helen Lauster, who lives with her 7-year-old grandson in the Brevoort housing project, said her block improved dramatically when the police closed two illicit businesses on Fulton Street and Ralph Avenue.
"On the one hand, we need all the businesses and the jobs we can get in this neighborhood," she said. "But those were not businesses. They were disaster areas, and I'm glad they're shut down."
At Junior's bodega on Stuyvesant Avenue, neighbors have managed to do the opposite -- saving a business which was nearly destroyed by crime. In late July, after an armed robber killed Perceo Melo, a store owner, and his son, Julio Antonio, neighbors held a candlelight vigil and walked to the precinct to demand better police protection. They persuaded Mr. Arapioamnou not to sell his in-laws' business, and when the doors reopened three weeks later, neighbors held a tearful reception to welcome him back.
Come closing time, six neighbors were waiting outside to make sure Mr. Arapioamnou got out safely.
"I've worked in a lot of stores, but I've never seen a neighborhood where people are so together," Mr. Arapioamnou said. He said he hopes "we can get the police to come by more often and keep the criminals away." Then, he said, "this will be a beautiful place."

HEADLINE: NEW YORK REGION REGISTERS A SURGE IN UNEMPLOYMENT

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In a sudden downturn that reflects the continuing impact of corporate cutbacks, unemployment in the New York region worsened significantly in December, with New Jersey having the second-worst rate of joblessness of any big industrial state.
Experts said the report was particularly worrisome because its statistics do not account for the impact of last week's blizzard, which cut deeply into sales, construction and other economic activity, nor the recently announced layoffs of 7,000 AT&T workers in New Jersey. 
 Although the monthly data are based on a sampling that some regard as suspect and even the Federal Government describes as volatile, economists said the report clearly reflected a regional economy that is slowing down and performing more poorly than is most of the nation.
"What you are looking at is a broad pattern of corporate downsizing that has not come to an end," said David Hensley, a regional economist for Salomon Brothers. "This region in particular is looking sluggish."
The Government said New Jersey's unemployment rate rose to 7.3 percent in December from 6.1 percent the month before, with the number of unemployed state residents rising by 48,000, to 295,000.
The rate also rose in New York State, to 6.4 percent from 6 percent the previous month. In New York City, where recent gains in tourism and retail sales have produced a more robust economy than in most of the region, unemployment also rose, to 8.1 percent from 7.8 percent.
Although the Federal report did not specify which industries or companies had made job cuts, it came as deep-seated problems that have faced the region for more than a decade appear to be intensifying.
In New York and New Jersey -- as in Connecticut, whose December employment numbers have not been released -- growth has been slowed by the states' high concentration of headquarters for banks, insurance companies and large corporations.
Although the headquarters have historically endowed the region with great wealth and continue to employ many highly paid executives, they have recently borne the brunt of the mergers and management downsizing in corporate America.
The region has also been hurt because its largest manufacturers, including the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries of New Jersey, have faced intense global competition, cut workers sharply and shifted production to other states and other countries where labor costs are lower.
Although those problems have plagued the region for years, particularly since it sank into a four-year recession in 1988, economists said the December figures show the troubles have not abated.
"The December numbers show a very large negative shift in the New Jersey labor market," said John L. Wieting, the New York regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which prepared yesterday's report. "There certainly has been a softening, the dimensions of which remain to be seen."
However severe or long lasting, the downturn in the region stands out because it comes as unemployment has stabilized or improved in most of the nation. The only state that had higher unemployment than New Jersey in December was California, where the rate was 7.7 percent.
Yesterday's report comes at a sensitive time for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who has built a reputation as a supporter of business expansion. On Jan. 27, she is scheduled to announce her state's 1996 budget, including fiscal projections that could be affected by a downturn in employment.
"We feel that the December numbers are an anomaly, perhaps just a blip," said Gene Herman, a spokesman for Ms. Whitman. Nonetheless, he said her advisers would consider what impact the December data might have on the projections before the budget is announced.
Joseph Seneca, an economist at Rutgers University and one of Governor Whitman's advisers, said yesterday that he also thought the December data exaggerated the problem, but that the state's economy was clearly slowing.
"We are at the center of the storm of corporate downsizing," he said, adding that December data "reflects a need to work even harder at business retention and expansion."
The Federal report was based on a survey of households, conducted by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. New York, in which 4,200 homes were surveyed, and New Jersey, where 2,400 homes were surveyed, are among the 11 largest industrial states.
Economists say the monthly report on the 11 states is of limited value because the survey is too small to prevent distortions. Mr. Wieting said he usually avoided concluding that a trend in employment patterns had occurred in any state until the monthly data moved in the same direction for three consecutive months.
But by that measure, the December numbers for New Jersey are part of a trend, since the state's unemployment rate rose, albeit slightly, from 5.8 percent, to 6.1 percent, in November; in October, it rose to 5.8 percent from 5.7 percent.
Many experts also criticize the attention paid by Government officials and the news media to unemployment rates because they only measure the number of people who are actively looking for jobs and unable to find them. Huge numbers of people who have simply stopped looking for work are not counted.
A more reliable measure of economic performance, many say, is the total of people employed. By that accounting, New York and New Jersey also suffered a downturn.
The report yesterday said New York State employment in December was down 48,000, to 7,903,000. In New Jersey, it said, employment dropped 73,000, to 3,732,000.

HEADLINE: Labor Dept. Agrees to Aid Voter Efforts

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 19

 BODY:
The State Department of Labor agreed in a court settlement today to begin providing voter registration services to people who use its offices, ending a yearlong debate over whether the department should comply with legislation designed to expand the state's voter rolls.
Plaintiffs in the case said the agreement would set an important precedent for groups trying to enforce compliance with the National Voter Registration Act, known as the Motor Voter Law. It requires states to help people to register while obtaining driver's licenses or conducting other business in state offices.
"Now all state agencies are on notice to live up to their voter registration obligations," said Jonathan Feldman, associate counsel for the Community Service Society of New York, the nonprofit antipoverty group that brought the suit against the Labor Department. 
 Under New York State's version of the law, about a dozen state agencies, including the Labor Department, must provide voter registration forms and assistance to anyone who comes into their offices. The other major state agencies required to dispense voter services are Health, Social Services and Motor Vehicles.
More than 307,000 people have been registered under the law since it took effect in New York a year ago, most of them at Motor Vehicles or Social Services offices.
But the Labor Department refused to provide any of the voter registration services, arguing that it had not been given enough state money to administer the program and was barred under Federal laws from using Federal grants for those purposes.
Under today's agreement, the Department of Labor must begin in February to give voter registration forms to anyone who applies for unemployment insurance, job training or other services -- unless he or she refuses to be registered.
Department of Labor employees will have to help people register and then send their completed forms to the Board of Elections. The department will also be required to pay for 20 full-time positions to administer the registration services.
About 180,000 people visit Department of Labor offices each month.
Even with the agreement, the State Labor Commissioner, John E. Sweeney, still argued today that Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed budget calls for exempting the Labor Department from the requirements. "I want my agency and staff to focus on job services," he said, "and I believe there are state and local agencies that already provide voter registration services."
Mr. Sweeney said that unless the legislature exempted his agency from the program or gave him the money to administer it -- about $1 million a year, he said -- he might ask the court for relief from today's settlement. "There may be a time or place where we have to go back to the court and say, 'We don't have the money,' " he said.
Mr. Feldman said that although the Department of Labor was the only state agency to disregard the law completely, some other agencies had been spotty in their compliance. He said his group was planning to file suit against the Health Department and several other agencies unless they improved their voter registration services.

Job Growth in December Quiets Fears of Recession
 
The economy added a moderate 151,000 jobs in December, stilling for the moment fears that the economy was on the verge of sliding into recession. The unemployment rate remained at 5.6 percent. The first major report on economic performance last month was hailed by the Clinton Administration as evidence that the economy continues to expand solidly. 
 But many analysts pointed to disquieting elements and said the Fed may well cut interest rates again this month. [Page 36]
 
The regional economy worsened significantly, with New Jersey having the second-worst jobless rate of any big industrial state. And the report did not even take into account the blizzard and the AT&T job cuts. [1.]
 
I.B.M. Jump Lifts Market
 
I.B.M. again led the stock market much higher. I.B.M. itself was up 5 3/4, to 102, still benefiting from Thursday's report of strong earnings, and the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 60.33 points, to 5,184.68. Over a billion shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. For the whole week, the Dow rose 123.56 points, making up for its plunge last week. [39.]
 
Impressive Profit at Chrysler
 
Chrysler earnings were unexpectedly high in the quarter, strengthening the hand of management in its efforts to retain control of the company. Profits of $1.04 billion, or $2.67 a share, were well above the top Wall Street prediction of $2.30 a share. Chrysler's stock jumped $1.875, to $54.125. [37.]
 
Time Warner Drops Satellite Bidding
 
Tele-Communications and Time Warner dropped plans to bid together in an F.C.C. auction next Wednesday of two valuable satellite licenses. Instead, Tele-Communications will bid on its own against MCI and perhaps others. Time Warner dropped out, apparently concluding that it would be cheaper and more practical to use a less ambitious technology. [37.]
 
Rohatyn Mentioned for Fed Post
 
Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker, has been mentioned at the White House as a possible nominee to be vice chairman of the Fed, Administration officials said. [39.]
 
Technologist Leaves Novell
 
Novell's chief technology officer quit, just months after joining the company. Novell is struggling to define a new strategy as attention on the Internet has put pressure on its flagship product, Netware software for personal-computer networks. [37.]
 
Copyright Issue on Internet
 
A Federal judge ruled that a Virginia man violated the copyrights of the Church of Scientology by posting confidential church documents on the Internet, even though the material came from public court records. [37.]
 
Mexican Energy Market Opens Up
 
Tenneco is competing with a West Coast group to sell natural gas to Mexico, and thus to profit from the opening of Mexico's energy market. U.S. companies including electric utilities and power plant builders are striving to capitalize on new Mexican rules inviting them to enter businesses that for decades were restricted to Mexican Government agencies. [49.]
 
Robert Maxwell's Sons Acquitted
 
Robert Maxwell's sons Kevin, shown at left, and Ian were acquitted in London of fraud charges, as was one of his former executives, Larry Trachtenberg. The jury rejected the prosecution's contention that the men had deliberately looted pension funds in 1991, after Robert Maxwell's mysterious drowning, in a desperate attempt to save the heavily indebted Maxwell media empire. [38.]
 
Dollar at Highest Levels in Months
 
The dollar surpassed 1.48 German marks for the first time in four months and rose to four-month highs against the Swiss and French francs and a 19-month high against the British pound. The gains reflected expectations of further interest rate cuts in Europe and speculation that leading industrial nations will endorse a stronger dollar this weekend. [45.]
 
Grain prices surged on indications of vibrant export demand and on a forecast that farmers will plant relatively few acres of corn. [45.]

HEADLINE: Maybe It Wasn't the Economy in the '92 Election After All

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Could inaccurate Federal data have cost President George Bush a second term? Have they led some economists to proclaim a surge in worker output that may well be a statistical illusion?
The comprehensive revisions in the numbers that track the economy's performance, released today by the Commerce Department, are sure to be welcomed by professionals. But unlike earlier efforts to refine the Government's analysis of economic data, this one offers an intriguing new view of recent history that is bound to spark doubts, if not stir controversy.
For one thing, the revisions suggest that the downturn of 1990-91 was nearly twice as deep as Washington knew at the time, raising the possibility that the Federal Reserve and the White House would have reacted more aggressively to dig the economy out of a recession. Such a response, coming much earlier than it actually did, might have changed the impression among many voters that President Bush did not care. 
 Michael Boskin, the chief economic adviser to President Bush, argues that "evidence of a steeper recession would have moved the center of gravity toward those who wanted the President to engage more aggressively on the economy." In the end, President Bush was insisting that a sluggish recovery was under way until an about-face in December 1991, when his press secretary acknowledged: "People are unemployed. People are hurting." And his effort to bolster the economy did not come until just before the 1992 election.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, also acknowledged to Congress at the end of 1991 that he had underestimated the weakness of the economy.
The new figures also show that economic growth in 1993 and 1994 was considerably slower than previously reported, casting grave doubt on the view that the wrenching process of corporate downsizing has been paying off in big gains in efficiency. Although there are economists who dispute this conclusion based on the revised data, plenty of others are pointing to it as proof of the need for a new look at recent history. "Anybody who thinks there was a resurgence in productivity in the 1990's has to think again," argues John B. Taylor, an economist at Stanford University.
The accounting revisions change the way the components of national output are measured in a dozen ways. Some are straightforward -- for example, applying more realistic measures of depreciation to business equipment. But the most important is a shift in the way the statisticians compensate for changes in the prices of individual goods and services in making year-to-year comparisons in the value of output.
Under the old method of indexing, the prices from a single base year (most recently, 1987) were used to add up total value. With the new indexing system, the price weights are changed continuously. This "chain weight" indexing method is more accurate. What's more, says Van Doorn Ooms, director of research at the Committee for Economic Development, it spares those who use the numbers "from rewriting history every five years" -- when the price weights are updated to a new base year.
The data, revised back to 1959, show the annual growth of G.D.P. has averaged 3.2 percent for the last quarter-century, two-tenths of a percentage point faster than previously believed. A closer look, though, shows that the faster growth was confined to the 1959-1987 period. Growth between 1987 and 1994 has been revised down from 2.4 percent to 2.3 percent.
Look still closer, and the results are truly striking. While the revised data do not change the timing of the 1990-91 recession, they do show that the dip in output was greater than previously understood. In the first three months of the recession, the third quarter of 1990, G.D.P. fell at an annual rate of 1.9 percent -- twice the rate reported at the time. The decline was also steeper in the fourth quarter of 1990 (4.1 percent compared with 3.2 percent) and the first quarter of 1991 (2.2 percent compared with 2.1 percent).
Mr. Boskin, the former economic adviser, called for action to stem the recession in late 1990. But he was ignored, in large part because the contemporary numbers were suggesting a mere stumble, one akin to the single flat quarter in the autumn of 1989.
The President might have negotiated a temporary tax cut with the Democratic majority in Congress, Mr. Boskin suggests. At the very least, the White House would have proposed a fiscal-stimulation package in 1991 rather than a few months before the 1992 election. And it would have given the Federal Reserve a strong incentive to cut interest rates more rapidly in 1991, producing a shallower recession and a faster recovery in 1992.
Whether that would have changed the 1992 election is anybody's guess. But it would have quieted criticism that President Bush was the "foreign policy president" who couldn't be bothered with the travails of ordinary Americans until his re-election prospects seemed in jeopardy -- criticism that probably led some Republicans to vote for Ross Perot.
The remaining irony is that when Mr. Bush in December 1991 finally switched his stance and said the economy was still in trouble, the economy was actually growing again.
The big news for today's policy makers, though, is the distressing message about productivity growth. Business economists, notably Allen Sinai of Lehman Brothers and Steve Roach of Morgan Stanley, have been celebrating a surge in productivity -- output per worker -- which they view as the gain from the pain of corporate downsizing in the 1990's. Using the old numbers, annual productivity growth has been running 2.2 percent a year, double the rate of the 1970's and 1980's.
But the numbers released today show that output per worker was growing considerably slower in 1993 and 1994 than previously known. And that chops the productivity growth rate for the 1990's to about 1.4 percent, hardly better than the 1980's when rapid economic expansion was largely driven by rapid increases in employment.
William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale University, is not surprised. "It always looks like productivity is turning up before a revision in the fixed-weight index," he notes. And while the transition to chain weighting will eliminate this distortion in the future, it was bound to show up this one last time.
But Mr. Sinai is unconvinced. He suggests that the revisions are misleading because they fail to account for a major offsetting factor -- the unmeasured, and thus undervalued, improvements in the quality of computers and other electronic business equipment. "When I look at markets and prices -- the combination of low inflation and exploding corporate profits -- I see productivity growth," Mr. Sinai says.
This controversy will simmer until the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis improves measurements of quality changes in assessing output -- notably in electronics, medical care and financial services, where it is widely suspected that output is systematically undervalued. But that end is not in sight: Everett Ehrlich, Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, acknowledged this week that anticipated budget cuts would hobble the bureau's efforts.

Startling Rise in Jobless Rate

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
In a sudden downturn that reflects the continuing impact of corporate cutbacks, unemployment in the New York region worsened significantly in December, with New Jersey having the second worst rate of joblessness of any major industrial state.
Experts said the report was particularly worrisome since its statistics do not account for the impact of last week's blizzard, which cut deeply into sales, construction and other economic activity, nor the recently announced layoffs of 7,000 AT&T workers in New Jersey. [Page 1.]

NEW YORK CITY
 
Job-Creation Plan in Place
 After months of debate, officials kicked off a program intended to create jobs and business opportunities in depressed areas of Harlem, the South Bronx and Washington Heights. Because the Pataki administration had failed to put up its share, New York will be the last zone nationwide to get under way. [Page 25.]
 
Here, Murder Rate Stays High
 New York's falling crime rate seems like a mirage to Jose Arapioamnou. His Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood had the unenviable distinction of having New York City's fastest-growing murder rate in 1995, despite community projects designed to revitalize the area. "Every night, my wife kisses me goodbye," Mr. Arapioamnou said. "I don't know if I'll be coming home alive."[25.] 

Delicacies a la Russe
 A caviar and dilled salmon tart. Vodka bottles sheathed in ice studded with tiny yellow flowers. A quail egg pie. "There are wonderful Russian cookbooks with all sorts of delicacies," said Archduke Dr. Geza von Habsburg, guest curator for a "Faberge in America" exhibit that opens next month. About New York by David Gonzalez. [25.]
 
Demand for Better Readers
 Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew said that he wants all third graders to read at grade level because academic failure becomes harder to reverse as children grow older. Last spring, two-thirds of the third graders scored below grade level. Dr. Crew provided no details about how he would accomplish his goal. [26.]
 
Negotiations in Strike
 With the strike by 30,000 New York City building maintenance workers more than two weeks old, face-to-face negotiations resumed. At issue is not just the two sides' strength, but increasingly a debate over what wage level is fair. [27.]
 
Background of a Shootout
 Moments before he was sentenced to prison for a fatal stabbing in 1991, Charles Jenkins, 16, apologized to his victim's family and pledged that he would shun violence and crime in the future. But just five months after he was paroled, he was again charged with a crime of violence, the shooting of two Bronx police officers. [27.]
 
Giuliani Attends Muslim Service
 On a visit to a mosque, his first and the first by a sitting New York City Mayor, Mr. Giuliani carried a message of unity and tolerance. The congregation of the Malcolm Shabazz Mosque responded in kind. [28.]
 
Union Leader Resigning
 The president of the union local representing most New York City transit workers has agreed to resign after failing to tell members about a contract change that increased health insurance costs for many, union officials said. [27.]
 
Egypt's Silent Satisfaction
 After years in which Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman was a symbol of Egypt's turbulence, Cairo greeted his sentencing to life in prison with a satisfaction reflected in official silence. Foreign News. [2.]
 
The Power of the Spoken Word
 For an example of how durable a good sermon can be, consider one preached from the pulpit of First Presbyterian Church in New York 74 years ago, during a bitter struggle between theologically liberal and conservative factions within Protestant denominations. Religion Journal by Gustav Niebuhr. [11.]
 
REGION
 
Sudden Downturn in Jobs
 In a sudden downturn that reflects corporate cutbacks, unemployment in the New York region worsened significantly in December, with New Jersey having the second worst rate of joblessness of any major industrial state. [Page 1.]
 
New Jersey Takes Over Jail
The State of New Jersey temporarily seized the Hudson County jail, saying that local officials had lost control of the overcrowded jail and that state officials suspected drugs and weapons were prevalent. [1.]
 
Insurance Glitch Hits 1,000
 About 1,000 of New York State's sickest residents, whose medical expenses run into tens of thousands of dollars a year, are on the verge of losing their private health insurance because of a legal glitch. [25.]
 
Bad Weather Comes Back
 "Mother Nature doesn't love us," said Josephine Schneider, knocked flat as she neared the Staten Island Ferry building. "We are in bad with her." Heavy rain and winds clocked at 52 miles an hour meant haphazard transportation, flooding and power failures. [29.]
 
Banking Bill on Fast Track
Governor Pataki and legislative leaders have agreed on a bill that would help New York State's banks prepare for an era of fewer Federal regulations. [28.]
 
Motor Voter Settlement
 The State Department of Labor agreed in a court settlement to begin providing voter registration services to people who use its offices. [29.]

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS; How a Flat Tax Would Work, For You and for Them 

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
The big issue in these first weeks of the 1996 Presidential campaign has been how Americans should tax themselves. And most of the talk is about a flat tax on incomes, with a large deduction for individuals so that lower-income people would pay no income tax.
There are about as many flat tax variants floating around as there are would-be occupants of the White House. But all derive from "The Flat Tax" (Hoover Institition Press, 1995), by Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka, both economists at the Hoover Institution, who devised the concept in 1981 and have been refining it ever since. 
 The two economists say their proposed tax, which would be 19 percent, would spur investment and growth by taxing income only once, eliminating taxes on capital gains and taxing individuals only on wages, salaries and pensions. Interest and dividends would not be taxed directly, but would be affected by a business tax, also at 19 percent. (Businesses would no longer be able to deduct the cost of fringe benefits, except pensions, for their employees, however.) 
 So how would a flat tax affect the typical family? And how would it affect the tax bills of the Presidential candidates who have pushed the issue to center stage? 
 The New York Times recalculated the taxes that some of the major candidates would have owed in 1994 had a flat tax been in effect that year, consulting with the Republican candidates' advisers and making minor adjustments to eliminate anomalies in the complex tax returns that are irrelevant to a flat tax. 
 The two candidates most closely identified with the flat tax -- Steve Forbes, the magazine owner, and Patrick J. Buchanan, the television commentator -- would not make their tax returns available. Mr. Forbes said he would never disclose his returns; Mr. Buchanan said he would make his public if he wins the Republican nomination. 
 President Clinton and three prominent Republican candidates -- Senators Bob Dole and Phil Gramm and Lamar Alexander, the former Education Secretary -- made available copies of their 1994 Federal income tax returns. (Mr. Clinton opposes the flat tax, as does Mr. Alexander. Mr. Dole has said he would go along with a flat tax. Mr. Gramm favors a 16 percent flat tax.) 
 All four candidates, whose incomes place them among the top 1 percent of Americans in terms of personal income, would enjoy considerable savings in personal income taxes under the Hall-Rabushka flat tax. A comparison also requires calculating the effect of the Hall-Rabushka business tax on business income, but even with both taxes, all four candidates would see their tax bills decline -- although probably none would save as much as Mr. Forbes, a fervent flat-tax advocate who is one of the wealthiest men in the United States. 
 Senator Dole and his wife, who had $607,000 in income in 1994, would save about $49,000, and the Clintons, whose income was $267,000, would save about $21,000. 
 Senator Gramm, who with his wife reported $305,000 in income, would save about $40,000; his aides acknowledged that under his own proposal, which differs considerably from the others, the Senator's taxes would decline even more sharply. 
 Mr. Alexander's savings would be about $184,000 on an income of about $1 million. The savings would presumably be significantly greater for Mr. Forbes, who has an income of $1.4 million as chief executive officer of Forbes Inc. and a net worth that Fortune magazine last week estimated at $439 million. 
 The picture is not so bright for the Smiths, a hypothetical family of four used by the Tax Foundation in its analyses of the various flat-tax plans floating around Washington. The Smiths, who have $50,000 in total income, nearly all from wages, would see no change in their individual tax bill if the Hall-Rabushka proposal were put into effect. And if interest rates decline as predicted, the Smiths, who collected $1,425 in interest in 1994, would come out a few dollars behind.

HEADLINE: SUNSHINE STATES;
Markers of Arizona History

BYLINE: By JUDITH ANDERSON; JUDITH ANDERSON lives in Tucson.

 BODY:
IN the Santa Cruz River Valley of southern Arizona, history worked its way north in the wake of European colonization, leaving two important markers at the foot of the Santa Rita Mountains: a mission at Tumacacori and a presidio at Tubac, the latter now reconstructed and surrounded by a thriving artists' colony. In a day trip from Tucson a visitor can mix 300 years of the past with the crafts and designs of tomorrow, side by side there on the frontage road of Interstate 19.
The mission at Tumacacori (toom-a-KAH-kuh-ree), 45 miles south of Tucson, is just a ruin now. The 20-foot walls have been stabilized, but the exterior plaster has fallen away in many places, exposing the tiers of mud adobes beneath. The roof fell in decades ago; the wind and rain blow freely through gaping door and window frames. The bell tower rises raggedly because it was never finished in the first place. But over the ravaged sanctuary walls floats a perfect small white dome, freshly washed with lime plaster and topped with a tiny wooden cross. Glimpsed from the Interstate, gleaming against the intense blue desert sky, it looks as if it belongs on Santorini. 
 This is one of a chain of outposts established by Spanish missionaries. The site was designated a national monument in 1908 and is now administered as a national historic park. Here the policy of the National Park Service has been to preserve but not restore. Visitors can explore the shadowy interior of the stabilized mission church and prowl through the crumbling remains of the convento, the compound containing the workshops and priests' living quarters, as well as through the substantially intact round mortuary chapel and its surrounding campo santo, or holy field, imbued with that peculiar intimacy of all abandoned cemeteries. An adobe visitors' center built in 1937 and a modest museum both house absorbing exhibits that explain the technology and arts of the era under the gaze of five of the original Mexican Baroque statues from the interior of the church.
The mission had three incarnations, each dedicated to a different patron saint. In 1691, Father Eusebio Kino, an Italian-born, German-educated Jesuit, arrived in Tumacacori and founded a mission. He named it for San Cayetano. By the end of the 17th century, the local Pima Indians, attracted by metal tools, new livestock, new crops -- including fruit trees and wheat, which, unlike corn, could be grown in winter -- were converting in substantial numbers.
For 50 years they were impressed for forced labor in mines and on ranches, and in 1751 they rebelled. It took the Spaniards four months to quell the uprising. To control the territory better, they began building a presidio three miles north, at Tubac, and moved the mission to the same side of the river. This second incarnation was dedicated to San Jose.
The mission's third version came after Spain expelled the Jesuits from its New World holdings in 1767. They were replaced the next year by the gray-robed Franciscans, who immediately began to redecorate. At Tumacacori they walled in the mission and spent the 1770's building adobe dwellings for the Pimas. In 1802 Fray Narciso Gutierrez and his Indian laborers began building a permanent church, this time called the Mision de la Purisima Concepcion de Tumacacori. These are the ruins that stand today. The church was originally patterned on San Xavier del Bac in Tucson, one of the finest examples of Spanish colonial architecture in the United States.
Even though plagued by money problems and never finished, the mission must have been a stunning landmark in the flat Santa Cruz valley 150 years ago. Its eroded double columns and pediment still retain a large degree of their dignity. The plaster exterior walls were embedded with crushed red brick and designs were painted on them. Inside were paintings of the Apostles, symbols of the Virgin Mary, carvings depicting the Stations of the Cross, elaborate Mexican wooden statues; visitors must depend on exhibits in the museum, however, to appreciate the black dado on white walls, the band of pendant half-circles near the ceiling, the floral stencils and painted curtains, the dark red plaster on the floor.
In 1828, in a gesture of independence, the Mexicans expelled the last Franciscan friar from Tumacacori. Without a priest, the mission began to deteriorate. When the presidio at Tubac was overwhelmed by Apaches in 1848, survivors helped the two dozen people remaining at Tumacacori to pack up the sacred relics, santos and vestments and transfer them to San Xavier del Bac for safekeeping. Tumacacori was abandoned.
And it is uninhabited still. Yet on any quiet day it is possible to imagine -- almost impossible not to -- those Pimas and their friars in their peaceful daily rounds of cultivation and meditation. You can work out the positions of the grist mill, the granary, leather workers' shops, pottery kilns and the monjeria, the place where young women learned crafts (and the site of the only indoor toilet apart from the one in the priests' quarters). Wandering through the sun-drenched remains of the walled garden east of the convento, touching the bark of gnarled fruit trees, it is easy to imagine the abundance of pomegranates, figs, quinces and peaches from the friars' five-acre orchard. It is a simple place, yet it is one of those unexpectedly evocative spots that project us for a moment into the past and leave us with some respect for hardship and faith.
A trip to Tumacacori almost always leads to Tubac as well, where history can be leavened with gallery-hopping and shopping. Energetic visitors can get there on foot: connecting Tumacacori National Historic Park to the Tubac Presidio State Historic Park is the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail, which marks the route of the expedition that eventually established the first European colony in San Francisco. From the Tumacacori trail head, on the south side of the picnic grounds, to the Tubac trail head near the presidio gate, the distance is four and a half miles. It is not a strenuous outing, but the trail crosses the Santa Cruz River several times and can be dangerous when the water is high.
Anybody worried about wet feet or snakes can drive the three miles north to Tubac, and stop on the way at a little Mexican place called Wisdom's Cafe, easily recognized by the two 10-foot white chickens in the front yard. (When the Wisdom family opened the restaurant in 1944, it was called Chicken Taco and the portly pullets were on the roof.) The decor is very basic -- sports trophies, antique typewriters and notes from happy customers -- and so is the menu (no credit cards, and salsa costs extra). But some green corn tamales and one of their "world famous fruit burros" -- apple, blueberry, cherry or peach -- are enough to fortify anybody for an afternoon in Tubac.
Tubac is a town with energy, though that may not be apparent at first glance. Seven or eight dusty streets are studded with low-slung buildings, and some are still the original unplastered adobe of the 1860's. Later editions, built over the Spanish colonial foundations, kept the same tone, largely because they were constructed of the same materials, recycled from a ruin next door. Today more than 1,000 residents of the town and surrounding ranches make sure Tubac keeps its old adobe character intact.
Originally a small Pima farm that supplied the mission, Tubac became, in 1752, the first European settlement in what is now Arizona, when 50 calvarymen garrisoned the Presidio de San Ignacio de Tubac. The restored presidio in turn anchored Arizona's first state park, dedicated in 1959. A museum displays an array of spurs and spoons and other domestic artifacts that emphasize the homely details of everyday life at a military outpost. Part of it is a glassed-in underground archeological exhibit.
A free brochure offers a history of the presidio and a 25-cent map lays out a self-guided tour that includes the Old Tubac schoolhouse, St. Ann's Church and a dozen historic houses, as well as a visitors' center and a picnic area. Every Sunday afternoon from 1 to 4, October through March, a volunteer group called Los Tubaquenos recreates 17th-century daily life in the plaza.
Tubac was an unpredictable and frequently hellish place to live, what with water problems and political turmoil and relentlessly marauding Apaches. Eight times the citizens decamped. When Tubac became part of the United States through the Gadsden Purchase in 1854, it was a ruin. Five years later it was a boom town, as prospectors and investors responded to reports of gold and silver mines in the Santa Ritas.
But its heyday was brief. When the Civil War began, the troops headed east (most to support the Confederacy), the Apaches descended, and the residents fled. Later, when the Indians had been finally subdued, resettlement was discouraged by legal disputes over Spanish land grants that were not resolved until well into the 20th century.
Tubac was a town in limbo for nearly a hundred years.
In 1948 the painter Dale Nichols chose the village as the site for an art school. The school survived for only a year, but it attracted other artists to the village. The colony flourished, and in 1958 Will Rogers Jr. and his wife, Collier, bought the school building, the old Garrett House, and remodeled it. Other Hollywood personalities modernized adobe buildings as well, or bought ranches nearby, introducing an era of expansion. In the 1960's the golf club and the Tubac Inn were built, the annual Tubac Festival of the Arts and the state park attracted tourists, and the Santa Cruz Valley Art Association built the Tubac Center of the Arts. Somewhere along the way the town invented its motto: Where art and history meet.
AND that's pretty much the spirit of the place now. It's still a one-story town. There are about a hundred businesses tucked into the mellow adobe buildings, and at least half offer arts or crafts of some sort: fine art, folk art, art jewelry, pottery, basketry, sculpture, carved wood, wrought iron, blown glass . . . and of course there's kitsch. Make no mistake, there's some bad art in Tubac. A few years ago, when the economy was so grim, it looked as if the kitsch might prevail, as more and more low-end items appeared to appeal to limited pocketbooks. But art is making a comeback, especially in the rejuvenated Old Tubac area east of Burruel Street, near the presidio.
There's almost always something amusing to be found in the courtyard between Dos Perros and Los Portales, at 8 Burruel. The art in Los Portales tends to be established if not serious (it's set off by an expansive, quirky selection of furniture, tableware, linens and gifts), while the pieces at Dos Perros, one of the newest shops in Tubac, seem to have been selected to make you grin. Sophisticated works by artists with national followings, including Andrew Rush and Fox McGrew, are displayed next to folk art from Mexico and sage angels or gathering pots by local artisans. Rene Siqueiros, grandson of the celebrated Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros, is making his own name with primitive acrylics displayed here. It's a light-hearted space with a humane mark-up policy.
Down the hill past St. Ann's Church -- worth a visit for its dignity and simplicity and the charming figure of the Virgin of Guadalupe mounted over the doors -- La Paloma de Tubac displays a collection of 10,000 items of Latin American folk art. The proprietors have been dealing with the same families of folk artists in Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala and Mexico for years, and snapshots of several generations peer through the counter glass by the cash register. At the other end of the spectrum, and of the village, AuSi Gallery (its name taken from the symbols for gold and silica), at 38 Camino Otero, specializes in art glass. In between, at 18 Plaza Road, Lee Blackwell displays his metalwork in a garden of copper fountains. Hal Empie can almost always be found at his easel creating western paintings at 242 Tubac Road, while Leroy Doyle and Curry Johnson work on modern abstracts in their studio at 12 Placita de Anza.
During the Tubac Festival of the Arts (the 37th annual event begins Feb. 3 and lasts nine days), the wild variety of art gets considerably wilder. About 100 stalls crowd the streets. Artisans are screened for entry, but the kitsch holds its own. Elegant hand-crafted armoires sit in the dust right next to the Navajo tacos and corn on the cob. This isn't Santa Fe. It's not high end or hard sell. This is Tubac, and it's fun.

HEADLINE: Showdown at Yazoo Industries

BYLINE: By Lisa Belkin; Lisa Belkin is a contributing writer for the Magazine. Her last article, "Death on the CNN Curve," appeared in July.

 BODY:
It is the day before the union vote at the auto parts plant in Yazoo City, Miss., and Joanne Bunuan, emblem of the last hope of the labor movement in the United States, looks tired. She paces the length of Suite 122 of the Comfort Inn, which also doubles as her union office, wearing denim shorts, a vivid red T-shirt that says, "Union, Yes!" and a pair of floppy slippers decorated with neon-colored puppies. Exhaustion (or, perhaps, the slippers) has the unlikely effect of making her look even younger than her 23 years. She has slept for 9 hours during the past 48, and her meals today will be, in order, from McDonald's, Burger King and Pizza Hut.
 Marc Panepinto, who at the grizzled age of 30 is a union organizing old-timer and Bunuan's immediate boss, sits on the couch across from her, beneath a wall-size chart filled with hundreds of color-coded Post-It notes. He, too, could use some sleep. He knows, without looking, that the layers of notes show a vote that is too close to call, despite two months of nearly nonstop work to bring a union to Yazoo Industries. He worries that Bunuan (pronounced buh-NEW-in), 17 months out of college, is feeling the pressure of running her first campaign from start to finish. He worries that the company has something up its sleeve at the 11th hour. He worries that the sky is alarmingly blue, with no sign of clouds, a bad omen because he believes that rain brings good luck. He worries that there is something he is forgetting to worry about. 
 Suddenly, the door to the suite is flung open by Cathy Lowenberg and Paula Tusiani, both only six months out of college and both training, under Bunuan's tutelage, to be union organizers, too. They are back from the Sunflower Supermarket, where Bunuan, with determined optimism, had sent them to order a "Union, Yes!" cake for the hoped-for victory party the next day. Out of breath, and trying not to giggle, they explain that while at the market they spotted another cake, one that they assume could only have been ordered for the company. Decorated with two white plastic cowboy boots, it reads: "The Union Is a Game! And a Damned Good Show. Give Them a Boot in the [expletive], and Kick 'Em Out the Door. Vote No."
Bunuan and Panepinto are fairly certain of when the cake is to be served -- at the company's Thanksgiving luncheon, scheduled for this afternoon, the day before the union vote. Although the company describes the luncheon as an annual gesture of appreciation to its workers, the organizers see it as nothing more than bribery with turkey and sweet potatoes, not to mention a potential violation of the rules of the National Labor Relations Board, which prohibit a company from campaigning in the 24 hours before an election. Bunuan looks at Panepinto. Panepinto looks at Bunuan. They don't seem as tired anymore. When they speak, it is almost in unison: "So, go get that cake."
 IF THE AMERICAN LABOR MOVEMENT HAS A future -- and the debate is fevered and fractious over whether it does -- then it is in the young, exuberant, inexperienced hands of people like Joanne Bunuan. Bunuan is a union organizer at a pivotal moment for organized labor. More accurately, she is an organizer because it is a pivotal moment for organized labor. Relegated to bit-player status in a pro-business era, battered by scandals and mismanagement within its leadership, hemorrhaging by an estimated one million members in the past six years, the labor movement in the United States is trying to reinvent itself. In 1970, nearly 30 percent of all American workers in private industry were union members. Today, that figure is just under 11 percent, the lowest since the 1930's.
Finding their membership back at Depression-era levels, union leaders have been adopting Depression-era tactics, specifically the grass-roots formation of new locals. They take inspiration from the fact that it is a terrible time to be a worker. Real wages in the United States have declined 28 percent since 1973, and eight million industrial jobs have been lost since 1980, a reflection of the weakness of unions in a changing economy, but also a spark of hope for their rebirth. In 1994, nearly half of the campaigns overseen by the N.L.R.B. resulted in union victories.
"It's a crossroads," says Stanley Aronowitz, a professor of sociology at the graduate center of the City University of New York and author of several books on work and labor. "They're saying, 'We've been down so long, we might as well fight.' And it will be a fierce fight, because they have nothing left to lose."
To organize, you must have organizers, and that is where Bunuan comes in. John Sweeney, a legend in the annals of organizing, was elected president of the 40-year-old A.F.L.-C.I.O. last October, largely on the promise of a huge organizing push. One of his first acts was to give the equivalent of a blank check to the Organizing Institute, the branch of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. created in 1989 at the earliest signs of this sea change. In 1990, the Organizing Institute spent less than $400,000 to recruit and train 25 organizers. Last year it spent $2.8 million to deploy 150 new organizers, one of whom was Bunuan. This year, it may spend as much as $4 million for some 320 organizers.
Because studies show that white, male organizers have the least success in workplaces, which are increasingly not white and not male, most of these new troops will be women and members of minorities. And because organizing is a life only someone with few other obligations can lead, nearly all of them will be young, often recruited straight out of college, and comfortable with the fact that home is whatever hotel room they are in. Beyond that, they will be a diverse lot, if the group at the Yazoo City Comfort Inn is any gauge. They will include longtime union zealots like Panepinto, who grew up "talking union" with his father, a construction worker, then went on to earn a master's degree in labor relations at the University of Illinois and to graduate from the Organizing Institute's first class. They will also include new converts like Bunuan, who moved to West Roxbury, Mass., from the Philippines when she was a year old; whose parents, a day-care provider and an office worker, distrusted unions; whose only career goal while at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst was to "help people, but not by giving them handouts," and who stumbled on the Organizing Institute near the end of her senior year when she signed up for an interview only because it was required for a career-planning course.
They will be people like Cathy Lowenberg, the daughter of a white father and a mother of Japanese, Spanish and Korean ancestry, who has always identified with the outsiders and the have-nots and who, as a student at the University of Washington, helped organize a protest to make the history of people of color a required part of the curriculum. But there will also be people like Paula Tusiani, the daughter of a business executive, who for most of her life knew only wealth and privilege living on the North Shore of Long Island and whose parents, when she first announced her organizing plans, wondered where they had gone wrong.
They will, more often than not, never have worked in most of the industries they set out to organize. None of the organizers in Yazoo City, for instance, have any experience in an auto parts plant, and they never did come to understand the exact meanings of the station names that the workers used, like Pull to Seat and Regular Engine. But at the same time, they will not care that they do not know. "We are aggressively organizing industries we never organized before," says Bunuan of her employer, the Laborers' International Union of North America, an A.F.L.-C.I.O. group whose 750,000 members work mostly in construction, not the auto industry, and which in the past year has gone after health care workers and poultry processors. "We feel pretty much free to organize anyone who wants to be organized."
They will, more likely than not, do that organizing with only a sketchy knowledge of the historical trends that brought their cause to this nadir in the first place. Bunuan was not yet born in the 1960's, when baby boomers began seeking different types of jobs from the ones their blue-collar, union-proud parents had. She was barely in elementary school during the 1970's, when the United States solidified the trend from an economy based in manufacturing, where unions were strong, to one based in service, where unions were weak, and when manufacturing jobs continued to migrate to the Deep South, where unions were few, and overseas, where unions were irrelevant. She was only 9 years old in 1981, when President Ronald Reagan fired 11,400 striking members of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, a move that management across the country took as permission to play hardball with unions.
And although she has certainly heard of Jimmy Hoffa, the Teamster president who went to prison in 1967 and disappeared in 1975, she sees him as a relic of a long-passed era, not as part of a documented pattern of union corruption, one almost as old as the modern union. She was just entering high school, for instance, in 1986, when the Federal Government indicted Jackie Presser, then president of the Teamsters, on charges of embezzlement and racketeering, a case that would eventually bring to light stories of murders, car bombings and cash taken away in suitcases by couriers for the mob. In short, she had no reason to be paying attention during the decades when unions, to much of the American public, came to stand not for uplifting workers but for strikes, violence, impotence and greed.
Although the young organizers may not fully understand how these forces lined up against them, they will do daily battle with them nonetheless. Union campaigns are brutal affairs, with a veneer of civility over a deep, wide layer of animosity. They do not allow for compromise, because there is no such thing as a little bit of a union, and along the way, workers will find deep-seated beliefs that they did not know they had. The union organizers will tell them that management is abusing them and that their lives would be better if they would stand together and negotiate as a group for their rights. The company bosses will tell them that the union is misleading them and that all a union will bring is membership dues to a bunch of outsiders who will make a lot of new rules.
The union will call management "heartless"; management will portray the union as "outsiders." Family members will stop speaking to one another, as will co-workers and friends. Some of the most unlikely people will become leaders, and some of those people will be fired. When each campaign is over, win or lose, the factory will never be exactly the same again, the workers will be inestimably changed, and the organizers will be altered, too. Everything will be different, including, over time, the whole of the American labor movement.
BUNUAN IS DRIVING HER RENTAL CAR ALONG AN unpaved, unmarked road on the outskirts of Yazoo City, a community of 12,427 people, an hour north of Jackson. She passes acres of cotton fields, which had been lush and white when she arrived back in September, but which now, in late November, are scruffy and gray. Bunuan came to Yazoo in the first place because 80 of the 310 Yazoo Industries workers walked off their jobs to protest wages, and a colleague of Bunuan's, passing through the region, happened to see a report of the walkout on the local news. Bunuan and a scouting team came to town the next morning.
Piecing together what they could on the privately held company, they talked to the workers and learned that labor discontent was not new at the 16-year-old plant, a division of Hood Cable, which annually manufactures a reported $16 million worth of electrical systems for Cadillacs and Corvettes. In 1989 there had been another walkout, and the workers had even elected a person to speak with management on their behalf, but their representative was promoted to supervisor and the effort went nowhere. Wages for line workers, the organizers learned, were between $5.55 and $5.70 an hour, which initially sounded low but which they would gradually discover was a solid wage in this community. The company, one of the area's largest employers, provided no pension and no seniority, the organizers were told, and its work force is mostly black and female, groups that tend to be more sympathetic to unions. So the organizing campaign began.
Bunuan has spent the months since then doing what she is doing now, driving around looking for workers. With her is Beatrice Griffin, herself a worker at the plant, and the kind of companion Bunuan likes best -- an unswayable union supporter. In fact, Griffin says she has already suffered for her cause. When the union first came to town, Griffin was working in the office, close to management, handling paperwork, not electrical wire. One morning, she says, she was told by her supervisor to wear a "Proud to Be Union-Free" T-shirt but she refused. Three days later, she was taken from her $6.40-an-hour office job and given a $5.55-an-hour position on the line. The company says she was demoted because her work was unsatisfactory.
Bunuan and Griffin pass a house as gray as the surrounding fields, and Griffin says: "Stop. I think that's Jo Ann Richardson's car." Organizers never call ahead. They simply show up. Bunuan looks around for growling dogs, her only real fear in this job, then heads toward the worker's door. As she does, her steps lengthen, so she strides rather than walks, and her shoulders square into her ready-to-tackle-all-comers stance. Richardson, a wiry woman in white sweat pants and a pink sweatshirt, answers Bunuan's knock.
When Bunuan starts to speak, she no longer sounds like herself. Instead of her usual Boston-tinged tones, her words take on a down-home Mississippi drawl. "I was hopin' we could talk for a bit about the union," she says. And her grammar slips, too. "If it ain't too much trouble, could we come in?" she asks Richardson. She says she doesn't plan the transformation, it just happens. "I think wherever I go I pick up the accent," she says. "If I'm talking to someone in a very kind of college accent, it just doesn't play right at all."
Most of her job as an organizer is about talking. The talking is done during visits, called "house calls." Research has shown that among campaigns in which workers are not visited in their homes, the win rate is 37 percent, but when they are visited in their homes at least once, the win rate jumps to 61 percent, which is why Bunuan and her team of organizers make visit after visit after visit. They go back to an address again and again, until the object of their search is found. They stop by late at night and early in the morning. They figure out who their target is dating, or where their target's mother lives, and they try those places too. They fight for each vote, face to face, one worker at a time.
One purpose of each house call is to teach workers about unions -- what a union does and what it can do for them. Another is to teach the organizer about the workplace -- who in the plant is related to whom, who is friendly with whom, who talks to whom, who stands where on the factory floor and who stands near them. Bunuan has never been inside the Yazoo Industries building, a squat brick-and-chrome structure that looks like an elementary school. And she has never seen the lines of workers that twist bundles of wires together in ways that will eventually run radios and power windows. Over the weeks, however, she has formed a mental map, and on it Regular Engine is in favor of the union, Bay 6 is against and Pull to Seat is unsure. Day shift in general is strong in its support, while night shift is equally strong in its opposition.
Similarly, Bunuan is a newcomer to Yazoo City itself, never having heard of this place before the campaign. Yet she has mapped the emotional landscape, too, and knows that Denise Boddy's mother and stepfather are both in management at the plant, so Denise is probably a lost cause, and that Deborah Pepper has a relationship with a Gates man and that all the sisters in the Gates family are pro-union.
As she talks, she does so with the knowledge that hers is not the only voice these people are hearing. The company's counterattack began two days after she arrived in Yazoo City, and it came as no surprise. The plant used its longtime labor law firm, Kullman, Inman, Bee, Downing & Banta of New Orleans, as a consultant in its campaign, a common practice in the years since the air-traffic controllers' strike, and the campaign run by that firm was rich with the images and trends that have been the undoing of unions in recent years.
"The union is a third party, an outsider, a big business that exists only because it takes dues money" is how Sid Lewis, the company's lawyer, sums up the message he tries to give to workers at the company's weekly anti-union meetings. "To stay in business they need to get more members. They're salesmen and they're trying to push their product. That's what this is all about."
The company repeated that message in a storm of letters and leaflets mailed to workers' homes. "The union wants one thing," said one version, mailed Oct. 11. "A part of your paycheck every month. For what? Keep them out. Vote No!" Another mailing said: "$ $ $ Money $ $ $. This is what the Laborers is all about -- getting a piece of your paycheck. . . . And with the risk of strikes, you could go without pay, unemployment benefits, food stamps -- and you could have to pay for your own health insurance, which costs a family of four $300 each month. Can you afford to risk paying for your own health insurance? . . . Keep your money. Vote No."
In still another mailing, the financial statement of the Laborers' local in Jackson was enclosed with a letter that said: "The union doesn't want you to know about 1) Union salaries. 2) Union administrative and office expenses. 3) Union money paid to the International union. 4) Union fees. 5) Union fines. 6) Union dues. 7) Union "other receipts." 8) Union $300 initiation fees. 9) Union buildings and cars. 10) Union cash in the bank. Your money pays for their big expenses. Don't be fooled. Vote No!"
Shortly after that, the weekly pay envelope of every worker contained the following message: "One bird in your hand . . . is worth two in the bush. . . . Suppose you had not gotten this paycheck due to a union strike? Be safe instead of sorry! Vote No." Bunuan has seen these mailings and she knows what is said in the meetings, because workers tell her. What she hears worries her. More than one supervisor, she has been told, has warned that the plant will close if the union comes in, that the company was recording workers' pro-union activities and that the union was not to be trusted because it was composed mostly of Mexicans and other foreigners. Bunuan hears that she, in particular, is regularly described as "young," with the implication that she is too inexperienced to be trusted.
Lewis calls nearly all the claims "nonsense." The company never threatened to close the plant, he says, no one was being spied on, "and the only reference to Mexico," he says, was when he told employees that "we need to stay competitive because a lot of jobs are going to Mexico. That's simply a fact." As for the descriptions of Bunuan, he says, she "is very young. And I think something like that is an issue for the workers. In my mind, I'm thinking, if I'm an employee: 'I've got 10 years on this kid. What can this kid do for me?' "
As she goes door to door, Bunuan hears echoes of the company's arguments in workers' questions. She has had practice fielding those questions, first at the role-playing sessions at the Organizing Institute, and the challenge is not to find the answers but to keep them from sounding too pat. "Why does the union require such hefty dues?" Dues are not hefty, she answers, only $16 a month, and they do not start until the first contract is signed. "Why does the union spend so much money paying people to organize?" If asked directly, she will say she makes $28,000 a year (more than twice what the average line worker at Yazoo makes, plus benefits and expenses), and those organizers who are not on staff receive $400 a week, on the theory that the only way to find good people is to pay them. "Can the union promise to pay workers' salaries if there is a strike?" No, but strikes occur in only 2 percent of all contract negotiations. "Can the union guarantee that a union contract will include a raise?" No, the union cannot guarantee anything, but groups have more power than individuals.
It is too simple, however, to say that all workers' concerns about unions are planted by the company, and Bunuan wrestles daily with doubts and hostilities whose roots are far more personal. Over the weeks of this campaign, for instance, she has spent hours talking with Linnie Williams, who has been a station operator on the Corvette line for 13 years and whose two brothers, both union members at other companies, have urged her to vote no. One of her brothers, she says, received a raise of 50 cents an hour, followed by a commensurately large raise in his union dues.
"I know what I do for a job," she says to Bunuan. "I go out and make a product. What do you folks do for a job? Do you go out and make anything? No. You make your living off of hard-working people like me."
Her brothers, she says, tell her that unions bring corruption, and she says she won't give money "to fill union bosses' pockets." Bunuan answers that "like any other organizations, there can be some bad people, and it's the workers' job" to vote carefully for their leaders. "There's corrupt politicians; there's corrupt preachers," she continues by way of example. It turns out to be the wrong example for a Catholic from Massachusetts to use with a Baptist from Mississippi. "The union is not no church," Williams says. "I know when I go to church, I give my tithe and I get my blessings. A union is not going to give me my blessings, my strength, my life."
From conversations like these, Bunuan tries to decipher how each worker will vote and who can be swayed, assigning them a number that will determine their place on the chart on the Comfort Inn wall. Those in the "one" column are actively working for the union, "twos" are people who seem to be in favor, "threes" seem undecided, "fours" are probable "no" votes, and "fives" are actively working to stop the union.
Sometimes, the predictions are easy. Just before her visit to Richardson, for instance, she stops in on Karen Anderson, who is expecting her fourth child in February and lives in an old house with a refrigerator out front and a striking lack of furniture inside. The only decoration is a small plastic radio shaped like a TV set, with a photo of New England foliage inside the faux screen -- the Christmas gift the company sent to its workers last year. While her daughters play nearby, Anderson complains to Bunuan that she has not yet received her disability payment from her maternity leave with her youngest child, who is now 2. She has little hope, she says, that she will be any more successful this time. "Would a union help me with that?" she asks. They would try, Bunuan answers, and feels no need to ask directly what Anderson's vote will be. As Bunuan leaves, she mentally makes Anderson a "two."
Sometimes, however, as with Linnie Williams, the predictions are more challenging. Although Williams's questions are hostile, Bunuan sees a pinhole of promise, mostly because Williams comes to the weekly union meetings and reads the union literature in great detail, sometimes highlighting areas of particular interest, usually about the possibility of strikes. After one 45-minute house call, Williams says to Bunuan, "Maybe the union can be a good thing," and on subsequent visits she even says, "Uh-huh, I'm still with you," leaving the organizer hopeful but uncertain.
And sometimes, predictions are completely impossible. Shondra Garner, for instance. A shy woman, about the same age as Bunuan, she blossomed into a leader during the early weeks of the campaign, under the persistent coaxing of Bunuan and Lowenberg. She came to the weekly union meetings, she passed out leaflets in front of the plant and she even rode along on house calls. To Bunuan's team, she became something rare and risky during an organizing campaign -- she became a friend. Then suddenly, a week before the election, her involvement stopped. She began to miss meetings, she was never home when the organizers came by and she became unwilling to listen when other pro-union workers approached her in the plant. "She's talking against the union," Griffin told Bunuan, and Bunuan became determined to find Garner. "It's my obsession," Bunuan says, as if finding Garner and saying just the right words to bring her around would somehow bring all the other "no" votes around as well.
In fact, it is Garner they are looking for when they spot Jo Ann Richardson's car and knock on her door. With some reluctance, Richardson lets them in. "I'm busy," she says, sweeping her hand over the worn linoleum floor covered with newspapers in places where Richardson is completing a pre-Christmas art project, applying gold spray paint to plain wooden picture frames.
"So how are ya feelin'?" Bunuan asks, stepping around the newspapers and taking a seat in front of the television set so that Richardson is not distracted by the program. "How are ya feelin' about the vote?"
"I'll be glad when the vote comes," Richardson says. "I'll be glad when this is over."
"Why is that?"
"I'm just tired of it, that's all." She fidgets and looks eager to end the conversation.
"Do you think you're worth more than $5.55 or $5.70 an hour?" Bunuan asks, trying to get Richardson to talk.
"Yeah, but just because we get a union doesn't mean we're gonna get no raise."
Bunuan knows that in recent days, the company has been stressing that the union cannot make promises, that all contracts are subject to negotiation and that the workers could possibly end up with less than they have now.
"It's no guarantee," she says.
Griffin, who is sitting next to Bunuan, joins in. "But without a union, ain't nobody gonna give you no raise."
"I don't know that," Richardson says.
Bunuan leans for-ward. "You've been there 10 years, right, Jo Ann? In those 10 years, did they ever guarantee you a raise?" she asks.
"No," Richardson says. "They ain't guaranteed us nothing. They can't guarantee us nothing and you can't guarantee us nothing. I know what I got now. I don't know what I get with you."
Bunuan feels a vote slipping away. "With the union, you're negotiating those raises," she says. "You have a say in that. And they have to negotiate with you. If the union weren't gonna do no good, if they weren't gonna get you those raises, if they weren't gonna get you that contract, the company wouldn't care at this point. They wouldn't spend the money on the 'vote no' buttons, taking you off the line to have meetings for an hour, giving you doughnuts at those meetings."
"We make an O.K. wage," Richardson says. "At least we have a wage. Some people around town don't even have that."
"Some people don't, but some have more. How much do you think you're worth?" Bunuan asks, then she tells Richardson about the last big campaign she worked on, at the Sanderson Farms chicken plant in Hazlehurst, Miss., where the union won and wages increased by 30 cents an hour. What she doesn't tell her is how close that election was -- a vote of 223 to 195, a margin of 28 votes, meaning that 14 votes the other way could have brought defeat. And she certainly doesn't tell her that the memory of that near loss is responsible for today's frantic house-calling pace.
"If the union comes in, it's fine with me, and if it don't come in, it's fine with me," Richardson says, showing Griffin and Bunuan to the door.
Bunuan moves her from a "three" to a "four."
THE AMERICAN LEGION Post No. 201 of Yazoo City was founded in 1961, and the building looks as if it has not been painted since then. There are handwritten signs on the walls, so faded as to be almost unreadable, that say, "Please No Profanity" and "Please Respect Our Ladies." At the front of the room there is another sign, placed there minutes ago by Bunuan, who is setting up for this afternoon's rally. This sign says, "Last Meeting Before Victory."
Around her, the room is filling up with workers arriving straight from the plant and talking about the company's Thanksgiving meal: turkey, ham, stuffing, yams, rolls, apple strudel and, someone says, "a cake that said something about how they'll kick our [expletive]." The original cake, Bunuan knows, is wrapped in packing tape and hidden in the Comfort Inn's refrigerator. Apparently, custom-order cakes are easy to replace at the Sunflower Supermarket.
Linnie Williams is not at this rally; Bunuan had quietly hoped that she would be, that maybe she would truly come around, despite her brothers' warnings. Of the workers who are here, some have not come from the job, because they have no job left to come from. They have been fired since the union campaign began. By Bunuan's count, 11 people have been dismissed and 5 people have been demoted in the two months since she arrived. Yazoo Industries' lawyer, Sid Lewis, says the "actions in question had nothing to do with the union activities of the employees, if any, and were all due to other circumstances," but Bunuan believes otherwise.
Firings are a common event during union drives. Academic studies estimate that they occur in one out of every four campaigns. Federal law prohibits companies from terminating workers in retaliation, but since appeals of such dismissals can take years and the only penalty a company faces is reinstatement of the employee with back pay, it is a law with few teeth. "A few well-placed firings, even if they're illegal, can stop a union campaign in its tracks," says Patricia A. Greenfield, director of the Labor Relations and Research Center at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
It was during the chicken plant campaign in Hazelhurst that Bunuan saw her first workers fired. She was devastated. Her boss, Panepinto, was on that campaign, too, and he offered her his way of coping with the firings. "I feel bad, but I don't feel guilty," he said. "Because I didn't do it. I've never fired a worker in my entire life. Companies fire people. And if you're on an organizing campaign and someone is discharged for trying to exercise their rights and to make something better, that was management that did that.
"If you get distracted on dealing with the terminations, it takes away from the campaign. The best way to get that person's job back is to win the election and then bargain that person's job back."
Bunuan's emotional armor, new and fragile as it was, was tested a year later, here in Yazoo City when the first firings in this campaign began. Organizers advise all their supporters to stick scrupulously to plant rules, to make it difficult for the company to find a pretext on which to fire them, but there are always lapses.
Mary Henderson, for instance, a 28-year-old employee with one year's tenure, was distributing handbills at the gate one Monday morning until 6:50 A.M., then she left the leaflet line and clocked in at the plant. She looked in her handbag for her protective wraparound glasses, she says, and when she saw they were missing, she went out to her car, found them and came back within minutes. Her supervisor, she says, was waiting.
"They said, 'I got you now,' " Henderson says, speaking so quietly she can barely be heard. "They said: 'You're fired. Your work here is done. You clocked in and then left.' But I did the same thing before, many times. Everyone had done it. I wasn't even late. My record is clean. I always bring an excuse, and I have never had a write-up. The only thing I did was be involved with the union."
As the list of dismissals grew, Bunuan turned once again to Panepinto, who told her a story that had been told to him by a friend, an organizer who had been a teacher in El Salvador. Sometimes she would teach rural peasants to read and write, she said, and then government soldiers would come after she had gone and kill some of those newly educated villagers. "She said: 'I felt bad about that, but we had to do it. We had to teach people what their rights were and had to help them to improve their conditions.' That statement crystallized it for me. It's a small price to pay when people are trying to better themselves."
Bunuan took that story and repeated it to Lowenberg and Tusiani when they felt their own levels of guilt at encouraging workers to be visible in their support even if it increased the chances that they would be fired. But although she delivered the same message in many of the same words, she feared they did not have the same impact. She was not even sure she believed them herself. Earlier in this campaign, Lowenberg knocked on the door of a young female worker, but the woman's mother answered and would not let Lowenberg in. "Where will you be when this is all over?" the mother demanded of Lowenberg. "You want her to stick her neck out, but how about you? When this is all over, you'll still have a job. Do you think about that?"
Bunuan certainly does, but she tries not to now, even as she sees some of the fired workers take their seats among the crowd of 75 people in the American Legion hall. Instead, she picks up the microphone and tries to project only confidence.
"Let's ask y'all, are we gonna win tomorrow?" she says.
"Yes."
"I can't hear you."
"Yes."
"Y'all are better people for going through what you have the past few months," she says. "I just want to give y'all a hand for that."
Then she asks if any of the workers have anything to add.
"We all black," says Ben Sims, who has been at Yazoo Industries for two years and who has been so affected by his experience with the union that he has approached Bunuan about becoming a full-time organizer himself. "We all been slaves. Remember Dr. Martin Luther King. Remember Malcolm X. And remember, you are black and you are not a slave."
The rally ends with a prayer, given not by Bunuan but by another worker. "Our heavenly father," she says -- to shouts of "Say it, sister!" and "Amen!" -- "we are here to try to get a union. To try to better ourselves from our hell hole out there. Touch all who are in doubt, Jesus. It's union time. Amen."
BUNUAN FEELS THE collective weight of every historical trend against the union as she and Ben Sims drive around Yazoo City looking for Shondra Garner. It is the night before the vote and they are running out of time.
Bunuan has been hearing secondhand hints of what Garner is thinking, but what she hears does not make her understand. "She says the union lies," Sharon Cole, a friend of Garner's and a union supporter, tells Bunuan. "She says the union said they got a wage increase of $4 an hour at another plant, but it was only 30 cents."
Bunuan does not believe that any union representative ever said anything about a $4-an-hour raise.
"She says she was fooled but now a few people she knows told her about the unions and how they really are," says Sims, who talked to Garner at work earlier in the day, at Bunuan's urging. "She says her friends say the union went and lied."
Bunuan feels helpless in the face of these nameless friends. She has to find Garner and somehow win her back.
They stop first at the public housing project on Woolwine, a collection of drab, unwelcoming single-story bungalows directly across the street from the Yazoo Industries plant. This is where they think Garner's mother lives. But there is no sign of Shondra's maroon '83 Camry, so they drive over to Battle Street, an equally grim neighborhood, where Garner once lived and can sometimes be found. The car is not there, either, but Bunuan and Sims walk to the door of the darkened apartment and pound loudly. "If she's asleep, let's wake her up," Bunuan says. No one answers.
Next is Magnolia, at another housing project. This is the address Garner uses, but she never seems to be there. Bunuan drives slowly past the house. The Camry is parked near the back of the building, in the shadows. She starts to back up, and as she does she sees a face at the window. Bunuan is sure it's Garner, but when she and Sims knock on the door, it is her sister who answers. "She's not here," she says when asked about Garner. "I don't know where she is. She's not coming back here tonight. I can't get her no message."
The mystery of Shondra Garner is the mystery of many workers Bunuan meets on the campaign. Bunuan would never know for certain what changed Garner's mind, just as she would never really know what arguments reached, or failed to reach, each of the hundreds of other workers she has met in Yazoo City. As much talking and listening as the organizers do, they can only guess at what is going on in each worker's head. Even as they calibrate the "twos" and the "fours" they know that some people are lying outright and that others are agreeing with them only for the moment, because it is easier than arguing. Even though they describe the workers as "frightened" or "angry" or "confused," they cannot feel that fear, anger or confusion themselves. With their rental cars and expense accounts, the organizers can't completely understand the details and decisions of the workers' lives.
As if by way of illustration, Bunuan yawns with exhaustion as she drives away from Shondra's sister's house, this campaign's last house call.
"Tired?" Sims asks.
"Tired," Bunuan says, waiting for sympathy. Sims laughs instead.
"You're always laughing at jokes I didn't know I was making," she says.
"You say you're tired," Sims says, kindly but matter-of-factly. "You be tired, and I be the one running behind that line all day."
Later, at the Comfort Inn, Bunuan arrives to find that Panepinto has just done a new tally of the wall, and his estimate is that the union will win by a vote of 153 to 140, meaning that if the house callers guessed wrong, and seven people they ranked as "twos" are really "fours," then the union will lose.
"Our goal was to move five people today," Bunuan says. "If we did that, we'd be very comfortable."
"Very comfortable," Panepinto warns, "is an extreme statement."
"O.K. We'd be comfortable."
"We're never comfortable. If you get comfortable, you get lazy."
"Five votes and we win," Bunuan offers.
"We'd have a shot at winning," Panepinto says.
They leave the hotel at midnight for the night-shift rally, which is very different from the day-shift version earlier in the afternoon. From the first weeks of the campaign, the organizers have met with hostility from the night shift, which was not involved in the walkout and shows little sympathy for the union. It is half the size of the day shift, and more tightly knit, and the organizers feel they never found a way to burrow in and grab hold.
Few workers from the night shift have come to the weekly union meetings held just for them at 12:30 in the morning. As a result, the organizers had few night-shift workers to take along on house calls to smooth the way with other night-shift workers. Their hostility puzzles Bunuan, because Yazoo Industries does not pay night differential, meaning the workers would be very likely to feel underpaid and angry, but house calls have showed they do not. Bunuan has essentially given up on the night shift, but she is still surprised when only seven people come to this last midnight rally, a showing so depressing that Bunuan worries that it will scare off some of those who actually showed up.
She ends things quickly and returns to the hotel to give final instructions to Lowenberg and Tusiani. They are about to drive one hour south to Jackson, to the nearest Kinko's Copy shop, where they will spend the rest of the night producing the leaflet they will hand out at the factory gate the next morning, the last leaflet before the vote. Bunuan stays behind, supposedly to get some rest. She knows she should be sleeping. But she can't stop staring at the Post-Its on the wall.
IT DOES NOT RAIN ON THE morning of the vote, but it is foggy and freezing. Two union organizers crawl across the lawn to sneak a pro-union bumper sticker onto the plant manager's car, and they return soaked with dew. The freshly spray-painted bed sheets that say, "What Are You Worth?" and "You Deserve Better" are fluttering slightly, not from any breeze but because the volunteers who hold them are trembling in the cold.
Despite the fact that her teeth are chattering as she paces outside the plant at 5:50 A.M., Bunuan refuses to put a jacket over her red "Union, Yes!" T-shirt. If she did, then everyone else would, too, and she has spent days pleading with workers to wear those shirts this morning as a final demonstration of support. She clings to the hope that the T-shirts, and the solidarity they stand for, might be the last word in the debate for one or two workers, the thing that sticks in their minds and maybe changes them. She would rather freeze for an hour this morning than kick herself for weeks afterward.
She is losing her voice, but she raises what is left of it to lead the group of organizers and workers in a determined chant: "What time is it?" "Union time." "What time is it?" "Union time." The line of cars, headlights on in the predawn mist, grows longer, and she stops each one to hand out a flier. "Ya gonna come on out and help us leaflet, now?" she asks every driver in a red T-shirt. Many of them do, and soon there are more than 50 people hollering and celebrating at the Yazoo Industries gate.
Linnie Williams drives in, wearing a white T-shirt, and for a moment, Bunuan feels even more of a chill. Williams clearly has not changed her mind after all. What Bunuan could not know is that Williams never came close to changing her mind. "I told them what they wanted to hear," she would say later about her hot-and-cold behavior. "I said, 'Yeah, I'm gonna join the union,' because then I don't have to be bothered by them anymore."
It is the first morning in a long time that there are no counter-chants coming from the steps of the plant. All week, about a dozen workers in anti-union shirts have been in front of the factory when the organizers arrive, dancing and shouting things with a far better beat than the ones favored by the pro-union group: "Pork chop, pork chop, greasy, greasy. We'll beat the union, easy, easy." The day before the vote, they had even worn cheerleader skirts and carried pompons. "Go back," they yelled, "go back. Go back to the woods. We don't need no union and we know you're no good." They drove Bunuan crazy.
But this morning, possibly because of the Federal regulations limiting the company's campaign in the hours before the election, they are not there. The only shouts, the only jolts of energy, all come from the union. There are more red T-shirts than Bunuan had expected, and more people distributing leaflets. For the first time, she truly believes her side will win.
At 6:50, the workers leave the line and walk toward the factory to clock in. It is the moment Bunuan always hates, as she watches them turn from "empowered grown-ups, my equals" into "drones at the whim of some boss." A few workers, including Griffin, have taken the day off and stay with the organizers, but the enthusiasm of moments earlier is gone. They are all about to leave, when at 6:59, Shondra Garner in her Camry comes barreling past, not stopping to take a leaflet, and not looking at Bunuan. She beeps the thinning crowd out of the way and drives on through.
The voting begins at 12:30 P.M., and only the N.L.R.B. representative and two workers chosen as observers are allowed in the room where the ballots are being marked. The organizers fill the hours with superstition and last-minute details. They send an anonymous fax to the company that simply says, "D.O.G.," which stands for "Death or Glory," and which Laborers' International organizers have faxed to companies since there were fax machines, although no one seems to know why. They send Tusiani to the Sunflower market with an intern to tell the bakery that only the intern can pick up the union's victory cake later that day. They field calls from workers inside the plant who tell them which "twos" are absent; they find those workers and drive them in to vote. They also give rides to those fired during the campaign, whose votes will be sealed in separate envelopes and counted only if the union wins an appeal of their dismissal.
At 3:30, they go back to the plant to leaflet the night shift. It is a sobering experience. Almost no one is wearing the union's shirts, and only one worker joins the leaflet line. Bunuan's voice is completely gone, and Griffin takes up the chants. Bunuan is pleased with the symbolism -- the workers taking on the role of leaders -- but there simply aren't enough people to make any significant noise. Things improve a bit as the day-shift workers come out and join the chant, and someone pulls a car onto a grassy area near the leafletters, opens the doors and turns up the volume on the radio so everyone can dance. But almost immediately, an anti-union group forms on the steps and all but drowns out that effort. Few cars, if any, are stopping for leaflets. Panepinto says leadenly: "It's over. We're going to lose. We're going to get beat up on second shift."
At 4 P.M., when the last of the night-shift workers have entered the building, Panepinto calls the group together and begins to prepare them for defeat. "This will be an ugly, ugly loss," he says. "I have never seen a campaign where so many workers have their lives invested in this."
Bunuan refuses to accept his pessimism. "I still think we're going to do it," she says. "This morning's vote is locked in. These night-shift folks don't change that. These people now are people we never counted on. It feels bad, but we knew this was coming. It doesn't change how great it felt this morning."
"There are more highs and lows in a day in this job than most people get in a career," Panepinto says, not convinced but seeing no purpose in a debate.
The vote begins at 4:15 P.M. and ends at 5:30, just after the sun sets. As Bunuan and Panepinto march up the steps and into the plant, a group of pro-union workers prays in the parking lot. "Don't let them come back here in the dark with nothing, Lord," someone says.
The organizers are led by the company's lawyer into the plant's lunchroom, where the N.L.R.B. representative stands behind a table, on top of which is a cardboard box. About two dozen plant managers, in white anti-union shirts, are in a semicircle around the table. Bunuan and Panepinto walk past them, saying nothing, and stand at the front of the group. The representative explains the voting procedure, makes a list of the votes that the union or the company plans to challenge and opens the box. As he reads the votes, the two observers -- one worker chosen by the company, one by the union -- record them on paper. Linnie Williams is the observer chosen to represent the company.
The union is behind from the start and never pulls ahead. The final vote is 160 against, 146 for, a difference of 14 votes. The numbers do not include the 15 challenged votes still sealed in envelopes, meaning that technically, this is still a contested election and not a loss for the union. But since only 13 of those votes, by Bunuan's count, are expected to be pro-union, a union victory is not very likely. Someone runs to the lunchroom door to shout the news to the workers on the line, and moments later there is pandemonium as more than 100 people leave their stations and run, screaming wildly, toward the front of the factory. Bunuan and Panepinto get caught in the crowd and cannot reach their troops who stand on the other side of the parking lot, waiting for news. But the pro-union workers don't really need their leaders to tell them what happened. The realization dawns as dozens of people in white shirts stream onto the factory steps and begin to dance.
Bunuan spends the rest of the evening at the American Legion hall, consoling the workers, taking statements that could be used to challenge the company's conduct and therefore overturn the election, and promising to return to Yazoo City for another vote as soon as N.L.R.B. rules allow. Eventually, the crowd goes home, and Bunuan does, too, or more accurately, to the hotel room that has come to pass for home. "We fought a good fight," Panepinto tells her, "but you can't pull the lever for people. You can't step in the box for folks."
They have planes to catch in the morning (a brief stay at home, then back to Mississippi to organize some chicken plants), and they have a lot to pack, but first, there is one thing left to do. They go to the hotel refrigerator, remove the purloined cake and carry it back to the union office. There, using a plastic knife from a fast-food restaurant, they hack the cake to bits.

A Dark Genius Haunts The Hollywood He Taunted

BYLINE: By ALEX ROSS 

 BODY:
"A GENIUS IN HOLLYWOOD'S dictionary," Orson Welles once said, "is someone who is either unavailable or dead."
Welles died in 1985; he has been a genius for more than 10 years now, and Hollywood pays him tribute. In "Get Shorty," John Travolta recites dialogue from memory as he watches "Touch of Evil," the Welles film noir that bombed in 1958 and has been gaining admirers ever since. In "The Player," Robert Altman mimics the endless tracking shot that opens "Touch of Evil"; Brian De Palma did the same in "The Bonfire of the Vanities." "Ed Wood" goes one better and resurrects Welles himself, in a 50's Hollywood setting. The practice of quoting "Touch of Evil" actually goes back to Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" (1960), which played variations on a scene of Janet Leigh marooned in a spooky roadside motel. 
 And "Touch of Evil" is not even Welles's best-known movie. "Citizen Kane," which Welles directed, produced, co-wrote and performed at the age of 25, haunts Hollywood no end. The latest homage is Oliver Stone's "Nixon," which lifts great chunks of "Kane": a rain-swept mansion glimpsed through an iron gate; a mock newsreel biography; a tyrant regarding his wife down an elongated dinner table; the central motif of Bernard Herrmann's score. Hundreds of films have made similar obeisances, if none quite so brazenly as "Nixon." Welles is what American directors want to become, or overcome.
He has not, however, ascended to an untouchable pantheon. There is still furious debate about the meaning of his career. Biographies appear every few years: the latest is Simon Callow's "Orson Welles: The Road to Xanadu" (Viking), covering the years up to 1941 and "Citizen Kane." A video documentary, "The Battle Over Citizen Kane," is being shown this week at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, and broadcast on Monday, Jan. 29, on PBS; it traces parallels between Welles and William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper tycoon who inspired "Kane," then tried to have it destroyed. Both the documentary and the book paint Welles as a man doomed to artistic failure.
The idea that Welles directed "Kane" and little else of consequence is a myth that refuses to die. "Touch of Evil" alone ought to annul it. In the last few years, other little-known achievements have re-emerged: "It's All True," his aborted Brazilian documentary; restored versions of "Othello" and "Macbeth," shot on shoestring budgets in the late 1940's and early 50's; a video release of "F for Fake," Welles's meditation on the art of forgery; even a reconstruction of his unfinished "Don Quixote." That a nearly complete feature film, "The Other Side of the Wind," remains unreleased means that a final judgment cannot be rendered.
Welles remains elusive for other reasons. For one, he still looms so large as a personality, or a succession of personalities -- arrogant boy wonder, international bon vivant, sad old man -- that it is difficult to appreciate his silent work as a director. Second, he leaves an ambiguous legacy for film itself: he had the aura of a showman, but at the same time his jagged style consistently put off the general moviegoing public. He seemed to delight in building up great expectations and then completely confounding them. Oliver Stone notwithstanding, he is still the most radical filmmaker who has ever worked in Hollywood.
 
The Man
A Thrice-Told Tale Of Rise and Fall
 The story of the young Welles, who came roaring down from Chicago and conquered American theater, radio and film by his mid-20's, is astonishing in itself, although it stands apart from his maverick film career. He made his professional stage debut at the Gate Theater in Dublin, as a 16-year-old on a summer trip. He later claimed that he had lied his way into the job, saying he was a famous New York actor. It is one of the caustic little triumphs of Mr. Callow's entertaining, endlessly carping biography to show that Welles said no such thing; he lied about his lying. That's the churlish way to look at it. You could also say that Welles was a great storyteller.
He established himself in New York by directing mostly classical repertory in startlingly offbeat settings. His first productions all had revolutionary impact: a "voodoo 'Macbeth' " with an all-black cast; "The Cradle Will Rock," Marc Blitzstein's leftist musical; "Julius Caesar" in fascist guise. (Ian McKellen's 1930's-era "Richard III," now in theaters, is another bit of Wellesian legacy.) He was also furiously prolific on radio, mixing melodrama and documentary realism. In the notoriety that resulted from one of his experiments, the panic-inducing "War of the Worlds," he gained a contract at RKO Pictures to make six movies, with total creative control.
Arriving in Hollywood, he instantly aroused rabid dislike and envy. Nearly a year went by without results, despite talk of an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness." Almost in desperation, Welles seized on a pet notion of the screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz, to make a film a clef about Hearst. Less than a year later, "Citizen Kane" was complete. Despite technical excellence in every department, it was notable above all for the headlong force of its storytelling; Welles attacked his subject from all sides and angles, gaining more from the process of the search than from the small secret discovered in the end.
Skeptics insist that Welles did little for the script and therefore did not "author" the movie. John Houseman, who worked with Welles at the Mercury Theater and assisted Mankiewicz on "Kane," first made this claim; the film critic Pauline Kael popularized it in the 1970's, and "The Road to Xanadu" tenuously revives it.
"He added none of his own words," Mr. Callow writes insinuatingly of Welles's work on the first draft; one has to read closely to see the director's galvanic contributions to a later version, which are documented by Houseman's own papers from the period. Mr. Callow also questionably asserts that Welles tried to suppress Mankiewicz's screen credit. The Welles scholar Jonathan Rosenbaum rebuts these long-standing charges in his notes to "This Is Orson Welles," a 1992 collection of interviews by Peter Bogdanovich.
The other issue with "Kane" is its commercial failure. The fact that a film now loved was once disliked sends many people looking for scapegoats. Thomas Lennon and Michael Epstein's "Kane" documentary offers a double explanation: that "Kane" fell victim to Hearst's wrath, and that Welles more or less committed suicide by taking Hearst on. But Hearst was only the film's point of departure; the finished script also drew heavily on personalities Welles knew in Chicago: in particular, the opera patron Harold McCormick and his mediocre soprano lover. From that material came the movie's most astonishing scene, the majestic disaster of Susan Alexander's debut.
The plain reality is that Welles's style baffled most audiences. Several theater chains did ban "Kane" at Hearst's request, but the film also failed in friendly theaters despite heavy marketing. Similar perplexity greeted "The Magnificent Ambersons" a year later; for this film adaptation of a Booth Tarkington novel, Welles wrote his own screenplay, a formidable piece of work blending high drama and a kind of film essay on the mechanization of middle America. The story of the decline of a family was told in an eerily lyrical style, very different from the ruckus of "Kane."
Welles's Hollywood career suffered a permanent setback when "Ambersons" was shown to a legendarily dyspeptic preview audience in Pomona, Calif. Two-thirds of the crowd, fresh from a Dorothy Lamour musical, recoiled from the film's bleak ending: "as bad if not worse than 'Citizen Kane' " was one comment. The other third applauded. Welles was away, filming "It's All True" in Brazil, and could not influence the savage studio re-editing that followed; but the film's fate would probably have been the same if he had stayed. Even in damaged form, "Ambersons" remains Welles's most haunting, heartfelt work.
This is not to say that Welles caused none of his own troubles. He alienated skilled collaborators; he took on too much at once; he cheapened his name with cameo roles and talk-show antics, even while trying to finance his serious work. As his friend and collaborator Charlton Heston observed, he often lost patience with the final stages of post-production, leaving technical imperfections galore. He also made dreadful business decisions and seemed innately accident-prone. Who else could have made a film that became part of the contested estate of the Shah of Iran? Such was the temporary fate of "The Other Side of the Wind," Welles's anarchic Hollywood satire, which has since returned to friendly hands and should eventually find release. (Tantalizing fragments can be seen in the 1975 American Film Institute tribute to Welles.)
When an artist has been dead for a decade, it is time to stop fantasizing about "lost potential." A matchless improviser and solver of problems (even when self-created), Welles made a virtue of substandard conditions. Mr. Heston once noted that Welles spent less money on all his films put together than Mike Nichols spent in overruns on "Catch-22." Despite the sometimes desperate haste of his work, he maintained an astonishing consistency of style and theme. No director ever did so much with so little.
 
The Style
Lively Images, Lightning Speed
What is the Welles style? One thinks first of quirky angles, patterning of light and dark, an active and continually moving camera. Young directors in Hollywood take the influence of Welles as a license to send the camera spinning in all directions. Welles himself used the "Welles style" more judiciously. His visual designs took after the dramatic context: the long tracking shot in "Touch of Evil" rides on the suspense created by the introduction of a ticking bomb in the first frame; the abrupt juxtapositions of "Kane" match the cacophonous voices chasing the title character; the gentle flow of "Ambersons" mirrors the ebbing away of time and value.
Welles had a perfect intuitive sense of how to place the camera in order to obtain painterly compositions on screen. Exhilarating images crop up in all of his work, no matter who is handling cinematography or design. A supreme example is "Othello," which was cobbled together over three years in Italy and Morocco. Despite the demented shooting schedule, Welles maintained an airy, glistening look in every frame. The other side of his visual style is his strictness in editing: images flash with lightning speed, setting up a situation in a few strokes, or casting doubt on it with sidelong glances.
But Welles was more than a manufacturer of style. He was also a thinker: not a great thinker but one who brought his ideas to dramatic life. His one consuming interest was in the mystery of human character, mostly his own, and in the impossibility of ever completely subduing it. He hated all encroachments of authority and institutional power: "Citizen Kane" meticulously destroys its tyrannical, exploitative hero, and "The Trial," a grandly amusing elaboration of Kafka's novel, lashes out at agents of the law. In the flawed but very personal "Chimes at Midnight," an anthology of Falstaff scenes in Shakespeare, Prince Hal's renunciation of Falstaff becomes a demonic moment, the making of a dictator.
A skeptic of the physical realm, Welles loved to introduce telltale objects in relation to individuals and then unmask such evidence as ambiguous, deceptive, oppressive. In "Citizen Kane," Rosebud is a false lead, signifying nothing; in the sleek adaptation of "Othello," everything turns on Desdemona's falsely incriminating handkerchief. But it is "Touch of Evil," the dark little B-movie thriller, that takes this theme the farthest. A bomb explodes; a young Mexican is accused; a bigoted Texas detective named Hank Quinlan thinks the Mexican is guilty and must invent evidence to prove it. The detective, eventually driven to murder, leaves behind an obvious clue of the kind he so often plants at crime scenes.
With pointedly artificial sets and eruptions of surreal comedy, "Touch of Evil" throws layer upon layer of doubt on its tight crime scenario. The setting is a Mexican border town, but ingeniously perverse casting makes nonsense of the border and of Quinlan's prejudiced view of it. (Akim Tamiroff plays a grotesque Mexican stereotype, while Marlene Dietrich and Charlton Heston play themselves.) Quinlan and the camera slowly go mad. But Quinlan is given an ironic redeeming truth: he has arrested the right man. For all its tricks, the movie exists to serve this one ugly character, this corrupt, correct detective. He is an abomination, but as Dietrich says, he is "some kind of a man." To say that this film is timely is the least of it; "Touch of Evil" might be Welles's topsy-turvy masterpiece.
Welles's last complete work, the quasi-documentary "F for Fake," is his most intellectually ambitious. Following in the footsteps of Oscar Wilde and Thomas Mann (briefly a neighbor on North Rockingham Avenue in Los Angeles), Welles argues that the artist is a faker, poser, confidence man. He takes footage from someone else's documentary about the art forger Elmyr de Hory; he interviews Hory's biographer, Clifford Irving; he then describes Irving's own famous act of forgery, the faking of the diaries of the billionaire Howard Hughes; finally, he adds a beautiful hoax of his own. One is left feeling dizzy, looking at empty space and a magician's smile. But the smile is everything: the triumph of character over circumstances.
 
Welles Now
Poor Imitations Of the Inimitable
"I hate homages," Welles said. He also said that he refused to watch movies more than two hours long, because they hurt his back. So he probably would not have enjoyed "Nixon," which learns woefully little from "Citizen Kane" in the art of concision and compression. Tim Burton's homage in "Ed Wood" is affectionate but erroneous: it has Welles complaining that the studio has forced him to cast Charlton Heston as a Mexican, whereas that strange notion was entirely Welles's. The nod to "Touch of Evil" in "The Player" is more apt in its sinuous irony. The studio security guy praises Welles, forgetting that his predecessor at Universal barred the genius from the lot.
Welles is everywhere, but he is poorly understood. There is so much that is not learned from him in movies today: the ability to establish a situation with fast, economical shots; the ability to focus on minimal, significant bits of business rather than overpowering, meaningless decor; the ability to use the camera confidently without calling undue attention to its movement. Above all, Wellesian homages ring hollow because they cannot match Welles's flair for building a story out of style. How he managed to edit images into a rhythm that echoed his own warm, sardonic voice is a mystery that is not easily grasped or duplicated.
If Welles had lived a few more years, he might have profited from the growth of a small industry for independent film. Indeed, some studios are now willing to take on "prestige" film makers even if they fail to make a profit. But Welles was better suited to go his own way. Hollywood movie-making is generally a collaborative art; Welles was no collaborator. Like D. W. Griffith and Erich von Stroheim before him, he was too idiosyncratic to work comfortably within the Hollywood system. Neither did he make "art" films, lampooned in "The Other Side of the Wind"; he was an old-fashioned magician, making grand illusions out of trivial fragments.
The best homage would be to bring "The Other Side of the Wind" to the light of day. No more biographies are needed; the same old story of Welles's rise and fall is told too often. As Peter Bogdanovich pointed out in "This Is Orson Welles," the wonder of this director's career is not that he accomplished so little but that he accomplished so much. After a defeat on the scale of the "Ambersons" episode, anyone else would have given up; Griffith and Stroheim did in their day. But Welles kept on going. He turned out dozens upon dozens of scripts, a few of which might still make good movies. He died alone, at his typewriter, still searching.

Commercial Market: Stability With Robust Sales

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
NEW JERSEY'S commercial marketplace was on something of a roller-coaster ride in 1995. It started out strong, sputtered in mid-year and managed to end up on a fairly even keel.
The market's respectable, if not dazzling, performance disappointed those who had predicted a better year and surprised others who thought it would turn out worse. "The pluses outweighed the minuses," said David T. Houston, president of Colliers Houston & Company, a brokerage in Bloomfield. 
 The lack of construction and the musical-chairs space game tenants played reduced the office vacancy rate and nudged up rents. Big deals were absent, reflecting the shortage of large blocks of space and the "reliance on small-to-mid-size transactions," said Robert J. Rudin, executive director of Edward S. Gordon of New Jersey, a brokerage in Saddle Brook.
But there were large deals in building sales, which remained robust. Among them was the purchase by Lincoln Equities Group, of Garden City, L.I., of three buildings with a total of 816,681 square feet of space in Bergen and Morris Counties.
In the retail and industrial sectors the bankruptcies of some retailers, like Jamesway, Caldor and Bradlees, forced them to give up stores and distribution space. But vacancy rates stayed stable or inched up slightly, partly due to the consolidation of scattered warehouse distribution centers under one roof, a trend expected to continue.
The ride ahead may be bumpier. Corporate restructurings and mergers threaten thousands of jobs in banking, insurance and communications. Key among them is AT&T, which will cut up to 7,000 jobs in the state as it splits into three companies.
Collectively, that could mean, at least for the short term, the return of office space to the market -- CB Commercial says as much as 2.5 million square feet -- and a rise in the vacancy rate. It could also push back the timetable for new construction.
With sales sluggish and bankruptcies by retailers growing, stores are certain to sprout for-lease signs, as will older industrial buildings. "The retail sector will undergo a shakeout in 1996 and there will be some carnage," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Urban Policy and Planning at Rutgers University in New Brunswick.
The state is expected to add 40,000 jobs in 1996, but that figure is down from 57,000 last year, according to the Economic Advisory Service at Rutgers.
How each sector fared in 1995 yields some insight into how each will perform in 1996.
"Excess space was absorbed, stabilizing the office market," said David A. Simson, senior vice president at the Teaneck office of CB Commercial. "But the healing is not complete."
T HE volume, not size of leases, helped fill more space than was left behind. A positive net absorption of 2.7 million square feet reduced the vacancy rate in the 11-county northern New Jersey market by 1.7 percent, to 19.4 percent, according to the East Rutherford office of the Cushman & Wakefield brokerage company.
The space was taken by concerns renewing their leases and expanding, not by new arrivals, brokers said. The biggest was by ABB Lummus Global, an engineering firm that grew by 40,000 square feet to 190,000 square feet at Parkway Technical Center in Bloomfield.
The two most active markets were Morris County, in general, and Parsippany, in particular, and Bergen County's Route 17 north corridor, where large blocks were absorbed and vacancies were reduced. For instance, Medco Containment, a Merck subsidiary, took 164,000 square feet in Parsippany and 142,700 feet in Montvale in Bergen County.
The shortage of big blocks of space has led to build-to-suit deals. One is the 151,000-square-foot headquarters for Bayer Corporation's consumer-health-care-products division in Morris Township scheduled to open in the second quarter of 1996.
The shortage has also led to construction of at least one speculative building. The Bellemead Development Corporation, a subsidiary of Chubb Insurance, broke ground on a 209,000-square-foot office structure in Warren Township. in Somerset County.
In addition, a new office building with "a substantial percentage of speculative space" is being planned at Colgate Center on the Hudson River in Jersey City, said Peter Gilpatric, project executive for Colgate-Palmolive's 20-acre mixed-use site. Leasing will begin this winter, he added.
But AT&T's reorganization and the construction of its 600,000-square-foot office also under way in Warren could pull employees from leased space elsewhere, discouraging other speculative projects.
Brokers say markets like the 78/287 corridor may be strong enough to absorb excess space. Others like Newark could be hurt by the bank mergers, such as North Carolina-based First Union's purchase of First Fidelity Bank in Newark.
With AT&T, Dr. Hughes stressed two points: If the cuts take place over two years, each year the state will lose the equivalent of one month's job growth. And if successful, the restructuring could mean expanding employment in the future.
That could lead to the need for space, as will the growth of telecommunications, medical and service firms, brokers said, adding that the state's skilled work force and intellectual capital will continue to lure new businesses and keep old ones.
"In the first half of 1996 the market will be at a disadvantage trying to figure out what will happen," said Donald P. Eisen, senior managing director at Cushman & Wakefield. "But it will wind up a decent year. While the hits are short-term, the market is in a solid position for the long term."
THE INDUSTRIAL MARKET held its own through 1995, though the second half of the year was not as active as the first. A net gain of 3.9 million square feet of space in existing buildings was made, leaving an inventory of 59.3 million feet, the lowest since 1990, reports Cushman & Wakefield. And the market is expect to hold its own again this year.
"Though the garment trade was hit hard, food companies are still busy," said Steven Pastor, industrial director at CB Commercial. He said the need to consolidate distribution sites will continue to fuel new build-to-suit projects. One such project is the 360,000-square-foot building now under way that Tommy Hilfiger, the Manhattan sportswear manufacturer, will lease at the Forsgate Industrial Center in South Brunswick.
The dwindling supply of large areas of quality space in some markets set the stage for new construction. Witness the million-square-foot speculative office, distribution and warehouse project under construction in Edison by the local Heller Construction Company. "We are not seeing a change in the market for the worse," said Jeffrey J. Milanaik, the company's vice president. "We remain cautiously optimistic."
As for the retail market, new shopping centers cropped up and existing ones were enlarged across the state last year. "The market was driven by the demands of expansion, especially by big-box retailers whose appetite for space was voracious," said William A. Farber, chief operating officer of Levin Management Corporation in North Plainfield, which manages 4.9 million square feet of retail space.
By year's end consolidations and bankruptcies were, making the retail outlook precarious. New projects -- some anchored by Caldor and Bradlees -- are proceeding despite the uncertainty caused by the bankruptcies of their anchors, and bank branches vacated by the mergers will also add to a supply brokers say exceeds demand.
Ted Kraus, who heads a Mercerville-based real-estate advisory firm, added that big-box retailers -- including Target, a newcomer -- though less expansion-hungry, may chip away at the excess space, as will supermarkets. Centers in good locations, like the Mall at Short Hills, will do well, added Mr. Farber.
Scott D. Heller, executive vice president of Heller Enterprises in Englewood Cliffs, agrees. His company is developing a 430,000-square-foot shopping center in Edgewater on the Hudson River -- anchored by Caldor, which is assuming a 113,000-square-foot lease despite its filing for bankruptcy. "I'm not happy about Caldor," Mr. Heller said, referring to the bankruptcy proceedings, "but the market is once again being driven by location."

NOT WITHOUT HONOR
The History of American
Anticommunism.
By Richard Gid Powers.
Illustrated. 554 pp. New York:
The Free Press. $30. 
 History, which is supposed to belong to the victors, has not been kind to the American anti-Communist movement -- not yet, anyway. Numerous influential scholarly and popular books, written in a spirit similar to that of Lillian Hellman's memoir "Scoundrel Time," have left the impression that American anti-Communism was thoroughly irrational, indecent and reactionary. College textbook treatments of the subject commonly highlight the great Red Scare, a wave of indiscriminate arrests, detentions and deportations in 1919 and 1920, and the McCarthyism of the 1950's, and emphasize how anti-Communism threatened the nation's civil liberties. Portions of the intelligentsia still regard "anti-Communist" as a synonym for "extremist," "militarist" and "authoritarian."
In "Not Without Honor," Richard Gid Powers develops a very different view. "There was no one thing that was American anti-Communism," he writes; "there were many American antiCommunisms." Some anti-Communists were certainly scoundrels, he allows; others were hatemongers, and still others were thugs. But Mr. Powers, who is a professor of history at the City University of New York, insists that these people were the exceptions, and that they did far more to harm the anti-Communist cause than to advance it. He would have his readers instead consider -- and honor -- the more typical idealistic Americans who spoke the truth about Communist tyranny and fought the good fight, fiercely but fairly.
Mr. Powers's honorable anti-Communists turn out to be a diverse group, and one of the contributions of his provocative narrative history is to bring to life certain segments of anti-Communist opinion that have largely been forgotten. Socialists and trade unionists march across Mr. Powers's pages, determined to stop the Communists from hijacking labor's cause. There are black anti-Communists, Roman Catholic anti-Communists and Jewish anti-Communists; anti-Communists from the cities and anti-Communists from small towns. The anti-Communists often disliked one another, but they laid aside their differences to fight the common foe.
In the first half of the book, leading up to the McCarthy period, Mr. Powers describes a recurring three-sided story, in which "responsible anti-Communists" found themselves pitted against reckless Red hunters (whom he calls "countersubversives") and also against the Communists and their sympathizers. After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the countersubversives, led by Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer and the young J. Edgar Hoover of the Justice Department's Bureau of Investigation, mounted an all-out attack on American radicals that culminated immediately after World War I in the Red Scare. Fed by the provincial prejudices of the old-stock middle class, and compromised by the lies and exaggerations of Government officials, the crackdown quickly backfired, making anti-Communism look like an assault on constitutional freedoms while casting the Communists as pitiable, innocent victims.
Only in the 1920's, Mr. Powers explains, did a more temperate anti-Communist mainstream emerge, one that was populated largely by the sorts of working-class ethnic people whom the countersubversives distrusted. It was invigorated by knowledgeable leftists like Abraham Cahan, the socialist editor of The Jewish Daily Forward. In political campaigns and trade union struggles, these mainstream anti-Communists tried to wipe away the stigma of the Red Scare and expose the Communists as dissemblers who posed as civil libertarians while upholding a ruthless and despotic political ideology. This pattern persisted during the Great Depression and then during World War II, as anti-Communists fought Communists in the labor movement and rival writers' congresses, only to see their efforts undermined by the countersubversives' mayhem.
The background to these parts of Mr. Powers's book will be familiar to readers of Daniel Aaron's "Writers on the Left," John Patrick Diggins's "Up From Communism" and other works. Various key figures, notably the anti-Communist philosopher Sidney Hook and the trade union leader David Dubinsky, will also be familiar. Unfortunately, Mr. Powers says practically nothing about some of the most interesting anti-Communists of the period, like the Harlem writer and disillusioned Communist sympathizer Claude McKay and the extraordinary Italian-born agitator Carlo Tresca. But Mr. Powers does unearth other important individuals, many of whom eventually wound up on the conservative end of the anti-Communist political spectrum, including the black journalist George Schuyler (who tirelessly attacked the Communists' efforts to manipulate black causes) and the renegade leftist writer Eugene Lyons. (His expos of Stalin's Soviet Union, "Assignment in Utopia," elicited an enthusiastic response from, among others, the anarchist Emma Goldman.)
Mr. Powers is equally informative about the more destructive countersubversives from the Popular Front years of the 1930's, ranging from Representative Hamilton Fish, the gullible isolationist from New York, to the anti-Semite Elizabeth Dilling, whose crackpot opus of 1934, "The Red Network," is still revered and studied in some right-wing circles. And Mr. Powers takes pains to criticize those "responsible" groups, particularly on the Catholic right, whose uncritical anti-Communism contributed to the popularity of demagogues like Father Charles Coughlin, the notorious radio priest.
In the late 1940's, yet another round of jostling between honorable and dishonorable anti-Communists prepared the way for the rise of Joseph McCarthy. After defeating the Communist-influenced Progressive Party, led by the former New Dealer Henry Wallace, liberal Democratic anti-Communists forged a seemingly powerful postwar consensus, based on the containment of Soviet expansion abroad and the enlargement of Keynesian social reform at home. Embittered countersubversives, excluded from the consensus, lashed out with mad conspiracy theories while they quietly built a base for themselves inside the Republican Party.
BY 1950, the liberal consensus had begun to crack under the pressure of events like the Alger Hiss trial, and new credibility flowed, Mr. Powers says, "to some of the most bizarre and irresponsible figures in American politics, the right-wing countersubversive anti-Communists of the prewar isolationist movement." The stage was set for Senator McCarthy to amplify the reactionary hysteria and set in motion the inquisitions that would bear his name -- "the greatest disaster in the disastrous history of American anti-Communism," Mr. Powers writes.
Until he fell in disgrace in 1954, McCarthy lent the dignity of his office to the worst kinds of anti-Communist abuses, destroying careers and fouling political debate. But to Mr. Powers, McCarthyism had some important additional ramifications, and at this point the author's story line and his political sympathies begin to veer dramatically to the right.
The liberals, whom Mr. Powers greatly admired in his coverage of the late 1940's, now turn out to have been snobs, motivated less by patriotism or religious faith than by "the elite values they held most dear," including "constitutional guarantees of due process, limited government and the freedom of the individual." (Mr. Powers is vague about why these values are "elite.") The liberalism that Mr. Powers had earlier praised as a bulwark against the countersubversives' desire "to restore laissez-faire capitalism with all its iniquities" now begins to look ambivalent in its anti-Communism, repelled by the Communists' undemocratic tactics but attracted to many of their goals -- "a planned economy, a social welfare net and the like." Fearful of the benighted masses, Mr. Powers contends, liberals muted their anti-Communism. The anti-Communist movement in turn found fresh leaders among hard-line conservatives, including former supporters of McCarthy like William F. Buckley Jr., who managed to distance themselves from the right-wing lunatic fringe.
According to Mr. Powers, the liberals' loss of ideological nerve became increasingly apparent during the Kennedy Administration. Although John F. Kennedy and his advisers pursued an aggressive foreign policy -- one that, Mr. Powers claims, "far exceeded in its militance anything proposed by avowed anti-Communists" -- they rejected anti-Communist rhetoric and eschewed domestic anti-Communist crusades. With their amoral, rationalist view of world affairs, the Kennedy men casually moved the country into what would soon become the Vietnam disaster, a war fought by Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon against a Communist enemy but without, Mr. Powers asserts, any explicit anti-Communist justification. Whereas other writers have called America's intervention a mindless, reflexive impulse to battle Communism on every front, no matter the cost, Mr. Powers attributes it to a loss of focus among many traditional anti-Communists. (Presumably, he believes that the oft-repeated domino theory and other standard anti-Communist rationales for the war lacked sufficient clarity and fervor.)
As the war dragged on, many Americans -- unfairly, in Mr. Powers's view -- turned against anti-Communism. Liberals, having enlisted in the antiwar movement, virtually abandoned their old anti-Communist commitments. New Left protesters loudly, and sometimes violently, declared their allegiance to the Vietnamese Communists. Other critics viewed the conflict outside of any reference to Communism, as if Ho Chi Minh were at heart a heroic nationalist and not really a dictator at all.
By the time Mr. Powers has reached the Vietnam era and its immediate aftermath, two of the major groups from his earlier chapters -- the American Communists and the right-wing countersubversives -- have virtually fallen apart. (J. Edgar Hoover did, of course, indulge in one last rampage, involving the F.B.I. in political surveillance of civil rights and antiwar leaders.) Instead, Mr. Powers describes a fight to the finish between unyielding anti-Communist conservatives and the spineless, regnant liberals, joined by Nixon and Henry Kissinger, the architects of dtente.
Mr. Powers leaves open the question of how the hard-line anti-Communists would have avoided the Vietnam catastrophe or staved off a Communist victory. He brooks no sympathy with the view that America's support of repressive and corrupt regimes, as counters to Communist expansion, may have compromised democratic ideals and actually played into the Communists' hands. Nor does he say much about how the prospect of nuclear warfare affected the cold war political calculus. Rather, he grimly reports how, amid the revulsion over the war, the anti-Communist movement became scattered and ostracized, and how, by the mid-1970's, all seemed lost.
Then, wondrously, things began to change:
"During those bleakest winter days of American anti-Communism, there was, however, the first faint stirring of new life, of rebirth, a sign of vigor at odds with the uncertainty and pessimism that pervaded the tired veterans of the old cause. One man summoned the will, the strength and the imagination to commence the giant task of rebuilding the anti-Communist coalition. This was Norman Podhoretz, editor of the American Jewish Committee's Commentary."
After the creation in 1976 of the Committee on the Present Danger, with Mr. Podhoretz as its most articulate spokesman, American anti-Communists regained their footing, challenged the defeatist policies of the Carter Administration and helped elevate Ronald Reagan to the White House -- "the culmination of the long history of American anti-Communism," Mr. Powers writes. Influenced by members of the committee, the Reagan Administration reversed the liberals' foreign policy, pushed the Soviets into a costly arms race, equipped anti-Communist insurgents and played a leading role in Communism's eventual destruction.
Mr. Powers has good reasons to credit American anti-Communism's contributions to the overthrow of the Soviet empire, including President Reagan's rhetoric of solidarity with the dissidents in the Soviet bloc. Still, in his enthusiasm for Mr. Podhoretz, the other neoconservatives and their friends in the Reagan White House, Mr. Powers slights some important ironies and overlooks some others.
The events that led to Communism's demise actually raised serious questions about the central neoconservative axiom, advanced most forcefully (in the pages of Commentary) by Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, that Communist regimes, unlike right-wing dictatorships, closed off the possibility of peaceful evolution to democracy. Likewise, the Reagan doctrine, as shaped by the neoconservatives, was deeply flawed. Of the doctrine's three major components, one, the rapid arms buildup, was based on vast exaggerations of Soviet strength and, by draining the treasury, may have done tremendous damage to America's economic strength. A second component, military aid to anti-Communist insurgents, subverted democratic procedures and caused a constitutional crisis, the Iran-contra affair, that could well have led to Mr. Reagan's impeachment.
It was the third and by far the smallest component of the Reagan policy, nonmilitary aid to dissidents in the Communist countries, most famously the leaders of Solidarity in Poland, that proved most effective. This aid was administered chiefly by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the labor wing of the anti-Communist alliance, and, as Mr. Powers notes, grew out of the old liberal anti-Communist idea of fostering the non-Communist left. (Yet another source of anti-Soviet inspiration came, irony of ironies, from the American counterculture, an influence that the Reaganites and the neo-conservatives detested but that, in Central Europe, made Frank Zappa one of the heroes of anti-Communist revolution.)
Mr. Powers's story might have been told in a very different way. That telling would describe how the encouragement of oppositionist workers and intellectuals in Communist countries and international appeals to human rights were at least as important in felling Communism as nuclear saber rattling and guerrilla warfare. It would expand the anti-Communist honor roll to include such organizations as Human Rights Watch, the PEN American Center and Freedom House, among many other groups. It would make larger allowances for the contributions of labor leaders like Walter Reuther and A. Philip Randolph, religious spokesmen like Bishop Bernard J. Sheil and Reinhold Niebuhr, and intellectuals like Mary McCarthy, Dwight Macdonald and Irving Howe. It would examine much more closely how anti-Communism became a pretext for discrediting dissent at home and underwriting sordid covert operations abroad, from Guatemala to Iran. Minimizing these elements, Mr. Powers's book comes perilously close to conflating the triumph of the West with the triumph of Commentary.
Still, these are matters for historians to debate in the years to come. "Not Without Honor" clears the way for such a debate, and especially in the book's early chapters, Mr. Powers starts the job of rescuing the history of American anti-Communism from some lingering stereotypes. What remains to be seen is which kind of American anti-Communism -- and which accounting of history -- will endure.

HEADLINE: The Perils Of Owning A Home In Splitsville

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
IN the rugged give and take of almost every divorce or separation, there is one solid and usually quite valuable asset that cannot be hidden or denied: the couple's house or apartment.
In many divorces, these brick or stone or wood walls that once sheltered a happy couple are disposed of amicably, or, if not amicably, at least definitively, with a clear decision on who will end up living in the house, or whether it should be sold, with who gets what percentage of the proceeds spelled out for all time. 
 But in a substantial number of other divorces, the house or weekend house or co-op or rent-subsidized apartment becomes the major bone of contention -- perhaps because it is the only asset in a cash-poor marriage or because it is a beloved object.
"There is a strong minority of people who are very seriously attached to their house and will not budge," said Gary N. Skoloff, a divorce lawyer in Livingston, N.J. "There are people who say to me -- and they're dead serious -- do you understand my husband, or my wife, whichever, loves this house more than he loves me?
"They know the other one absolutely must have the house and they work around that," he said. In other cases, he said, "they both really put their life and soul into designing and building or renovating the house together; they spent every weekend for three years riding through the countryside picking up antique bricks for the pathways; they planted the trees and watched them grow. Neither will give it up."
The house can also become the pawn of an angry spouse who -- even after the decree -- refuses to sign the necessary papers for selling a co-op, or refuses any offers on a jointly owned house, or otherwise deliberately sabotages deals.
"Here's what happens," said Chris Thomas, who runs William B. May's two Brooklyn real estate offices, discussing the difficulties agents have in showing clients such homes. "The first battle was over the children; now it's over the house. The spouse in custody doesn't want to show it, because chances are, once the house is sold, that spouse will have to give half the money to the other spouse and therefore, will have to live in someplace half as good -- so where's the incentive to sell it?"
So the spouse cancels appointments to show the property, or leaves the place a mess. "One guy called me, frustrated after a couple of years," said Mr. Thomas. "He said: 'The next time that happens, call me, I'm right here on Wall Street; I've got a court order.'
"But listen -- what realtor wants to bother with court orders and breaking the door down when they've got customers sitting right in front of them," Mr. Thomas said. "The place becomes known as trouble, and if it ever does sell, it sells for a lot less than it would've."
In Manhattan, JoAnne Kennedy, a partner in Hunt-Kennedy Real Estate, labels the "absolute worst case" the times when a divorced or separating couple still share the same apartment. "You have a DMZ," she said. "You can feel the intense hostility in the air. I have seen one partner retreat to one wing and stake out a camp." Mrs. Kennedy, who said her office was "never without divorces, or gay couples splitting, or non-gay couples breaking up," said simply: "Divorce creates real estate business."
Mark Zimmerman, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said he was seeing more cases of disputes between legally divorced people whose names still linger jointly on co-op mortgages and proprietary leases -- disputes that can scare away potential buyers.
"Even if one side can produce a divorce settlement showing that he or she has been awarded the apartment," Mr. Zimmerman said, "the co-op boards still demand that both parties still on the lease sign the papers prior to transferring that apartment. We're seeing more cases where -- just for spite -- the one who didn't get the property refuses to cooperate."
In one case, the husband "blackmailed" the wife, who had ended up with the apartment and was trying to sell it, according to Mr. Zimmerman. In return for his signature -- he had been left on the proprietary lease even though she had been awarded the apartment -- he demanded a painting he knew had great sentimental value to the wife -- all this after the decree became final. The deadline for the closing was approaching, the lawyer said, and the woman felt she had no choice but to give it to him.
Lawyers concede that such legal squabbling costs money. The reformed divorce laws, which almost two decades ago introduced the concept of "equitable distribution" of assets in New York -- a concept that mandates that both tangible and intangible contributions of spouses, including such services as child-rearing, be considered by a judge -- can result in a system full of good intentions that occasionally backfires, lawyers say.
The old system, which relied heavily on who actually held title to the disputed property, was less complicated. The new system, while designed to be fairer and more flexible, can result in mountains of depositions and claims and counterclaims.
Sometimes, when the parties are finished establishing their every contribution, they have used up a substantial part of their equity on lawyer's fees.
"Some lawyers, in order to get paid, have taken mortgages on people's residences," said Peter E. Bronstein, a Manhattan divorce lawyer. Jean O'Sullivan, a mother of two grown children who lives in Albany, did exactly that; she says she gave her lawyer both mortgages on her home. "He had to have some security," she said, of her lawyer. "I couldn't pay him."
Before she parted with the mortgages, she estimated she "left $300,000 on the table" in lawyer's fees.
In rare cases, the spouse who has less money can be rendered homeless -- even though he or she wound up in possession of the family home -- because he or she is left without the money to pay for it.
One 61-year-old woman lost the East Side apartment she brought to her short marriage -- her home for almost three decades -- because she gave up her career to please her multimillionaire husband. He left after less than a year.
She said that she pawned her jewelry and sold her paintings but that it wasn't enough to keep paying the mortgage; the apartment was foreclosed. She was evicted from the big house they had rented in the Hamptons; she is currently staying with friends, working on her appeal. She has no more money for a lawyer, she said, and is representing herself.
TONY GILIBERTO is an artist, once a painter of fine-lined abstractions and now, increasingly, large, vaguely organic motifs. When he and the woman with whom he was living, also a painter, came to New York City from Chicago in 1980, they looked for months for a loft they could rent that would be big enough for two studios.
"We looked in the Flower District, in TriBeCa," he recalled. "The prices were ridiculous; then one day we saw an ad for a raw loft with 4,000 square feet."
The landlord was asking $1,000 a month; it seemed like a lot of money.
"Our friends from Chicago who had come here before us told us the price looked too high," Mr. Giliberto said. "I told them, 'O.K., yeah, wait two years.' "
The couple rented the loft, and began turning an empty, vast space -- the whole floor in a brick building near the Public Theater on Lafayette Street -- into a house. They both worked, lugging massive panels of sheetrock, carting in a toilet and shower tiles and kitchen appliances. "It was a black pit," he said.
They built two separate studios -- her 1,000-square-foot studio in front, his 1,200-square-foot one in back -- and designed the living space in the middle. Like many lofts, its strength was its huge open spaces; there were just a few walls, to enclose the bathroom, the one bedroom and some closets.
Now there are more walls. They broke up in 1985, and neither wanted to give up the rent-stabilized apartment. Neither had the money to buy the other out.
"At the time we didn't know what would happen," said Mr. Giliberto. "She talked about moving out, then she decided to stay. We really had no choice. Loft space of this nature has become very precious; you can't find another 4,000-square-foot loft rental -- landlords have made two 2,000-square-foot lofts."
Such lofts are rarely available for purchase, and very expensive; in that location, a raw loft that size might go for $500,000 or more.
After they split up, Mr. Giliberto and his former woman friend lived in the big loft alone, separated by a big new wall they both built to separate them. The division is awkward and completely removes the feeling of spaciousness.
Part of the awkwardness -- both physically and otherwise -- is due to the fact that there is only one bathroom. And, as in most lofts, it is impossible to build another one because of the layout -- the existing bathroom is sandwiched between the elevator and the kitchen -- and because there is only one set of plumbing risers. The big kitchen, with its center island, is also shared.
The division became even more awkward when, several years later, Mr. Giliberto married. The man and the two women lived in the loft, and shared the bathroom and the kitchen.
Now that marriage has broken up, and the loft's two original renters are living there alone again -- in the space that is both shared and separate.
"Is it awkward? Was it awkward?" Mr. Giliberto said. "Yeah, it was; but in New York, after a point you learn to live with those kinds of things."
MONICA GETZ was married to the late Stan Getz, the musician. While she was married, she bought -- with, she said, her own money that was put into a joint account -- a grand house with a gardener's cottage, stables and other outbuildings, overlooking the Hudson River in Irvington, N.Y. Throughout her 32 years of marriage, she raised five children and, she said, managed Mr. Getz's career. After he left, she said, he and his lawyers sought to take the house away from her.
Even though Mr. Getz is dead, she is left with a court order to sell the house and divide the proceeds 50-50 with his heirs. After 16 years of litigation, she said, she has reached a settlement and, she hopes, will continue to live in the house. The musician's widow said the house was once actually placed under contract against her wishes, but, hearing of the controversy, the would-be buyer, a developer, backed out.
"It was a great surprise to me the way the system functions," she said. "It is not a user-friendly system but an abuser-friendly system. When it comes to real estate, the moneyed spouse too often gets his way; the more money to employ lawyers that can thwart the system."
Mrs. Getz, the founder of the Coalition for Family Justice, a lobbying group formed to address these concerns, criticizes the equitable distribution bill that became law in 1980 in the administration of Gov. Hugh L. Carey.
"We have a 'no-fault' attitude even though we supposedly don't have a 'no-fault' system," she said, referring to the fact that New York is one of a dwindling number of states that still relies heavily on establishing "fault" in a divorce. (There is a "no-fault" provision after a waiting period of one year in certain cases.)
"One spouse can walk out and leave the other in the lurch and then hide his assets and stall," Mrs. Getz said. "Judges take a like and dislike to one side, and barracuda attorneys know how to play the judges."
"Without any other assets, the court will order the house sold, and the family living there is put at a disadvantage," she said, "and because the house is sold under duress, you get a lot less. The moneyed spouse can escape with all the assets intact, and the non-moneyed spouse can end up homeless."
"Is the law perfect?" asked Eleanor B. Alter, a well-known Manhattan divorce lawyer. "No, but it works pretty well." She, too, knows of a wall: one spouse built a wall to separate two warring factions. "He left the wife and children with no windows," Mrs. Alter said. "We went to court and got her money to move out."
"Downstate, in cases of long marriages -- over seven years -- we've had relatively equal treatment," Mrs. Alter continued. "Upstate, it varies a little more."
The real problem, she said, "is what the real problem always is: for the very rich, it's great -- there's large amounts of money and property to divide -- but where it gets harder is for the middle class, because people don't have a lot of assets."
"Mortgage payments become a problem," she said, "if the dwelling is given to the non-income-producing spouse and the other has to provide the money. It's hard."
Divorce lawyers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut agree that their divorce laws were reformed precisely to avoid unfairness and economic hardship. New York was the last of the three states to introduce "equitable distribution" of assets.
And although they say their separate and varying systems generally work well, they concede the systems' strongest point -- its flexibility -- depends on impartial judges and honest disclosure of assets. Lawyers themselves say that each judge has different prejudices, and that, according to one lawyer, "you have to pitch the case differently depending on the judge."
"Everybody has to deal with the baggage of different judges," said William T. Fitzmaurice, chairman of the Family Law section of the Connecticut Bar Association, generally applauding his state's flexibility in determining spousal contributions. "You take a case of inherited property to five different judges, and you'll get five different opinions," he said. "It puts a lot of pressure on having a very wise judiciary."
Divorce lawyers freely admit that good representation costs money, sometimes a lot of money. "As a practical matter, equitable distribution has a lot of problems," said Mr. Bronstein, a Manhattan divorce lawyer who represents both men and women. "It's burdensome to litigate; many people have the family home and pension funds and not much money in the bank -- and that's everybody in the world. For those people to have to hire a lawyer -- well, frequently the bills, and I'm not talking about overcharging, just the real amount of work -- can consume a good part of the equity."
To many of the divorced people interviewed, their problems were caused by judges who did not understand the real facts. The emotionally charged atmosphere surrounding many divorces is reflected in charges of corrupt judges, dishonest lawyers and lying spouses. But even in the case of the two artists who bisected their rent-stabilized apartment, all share one condition: their living arrangements have been vastly changed -- arguably for the worse -- by the divorce or separation.
Divorce lawyers argue that it does not have to be that way. Some suggest having prefiling conferences with a lawyer, to plan strategy; the strategy may include establishing residence in a neighboring state because the differing states treat property brought into the marriage or inherited differently. And the laws may vary as to the amount of flexibility a judge can use.
If one spouse does not have the money to buy out the other, a long-term pay-out can be calculated, according to Mrs. Alter. Several lawyers emphasized the importance of a prenuptial agreement laying out who will get the house and other property in case of divorce or break-up. "It may be unromantic," said Mr. Bronstein, "but it certainly pre-empts the judge."
To eliminate wrangles over signatures on jointly held co-ops and houses, Mrs. Alter recommends making sure names are removed from leases and deeds and mortgages at the time of the settlement. (If the non-moneyed spouse is left with the house, and is worried that because his or her income may not be enough to stand scrutiny by a co-op board or mortgage company, Mr. Zimmerman suggests getting the documents signed to accomplish the transfers before the divorce but not submitting them to the board or the bank until necessary -- when the property is to be sold.)
In the most extreme case, Mrs. O'Sullivan, the mother in Albany, said if the house is about to be foreclosed, it may be possible to file for bankruptcy to stop the action.
Mrs. Getz says her organization would like to see spousal support guidelines: mathematical formulas for computing support, just as in child-support cases -- with prison sentences for those who lie about their assets.
Until then, she advises spouses to keep their assets completely separate, although lawyers agree that is not always a guarantee of their protection. With the reforms to divorce laws, judges have more flexibility in distributing assets regardless of title. In Connecticut, even separate property brought into a marriage or inherited during the marriage -- or even after the separation but before the decree -- can be taken away. Even pension funds are vulnerable, lawyers say.
Others counsel couples that, no matter how angry they are, it's better to work out the divisions -- including the house -- themselves before bringing in the lawyers and running up the bills.
Mr. Thomas, the real estate agent, advises the partner with the money to be more generous -- so the other spouse won't have to resort to obstinate and self-destructive behavior like refusing offers and neglecting the property.
But in the end, there probably will always be wrangling over real estate. And Mr. Skoloff, the divorce lawyer from New Jersey, said he thought the fairest way to award the house when the two parties each refuse to give it up was the oldest way.
"They toss a coin," he said. "Really. The judge orders it. Or they have their minister -- someone they trust -- draw a name out of a hat. All or nothing -- although the other one gets reimbursed for his or her share.
"It's funny," he said. "After all that gut-wrenching and struggling, they seem to accept it that way. They walk away, they accept it, knowing they won or lost the house because of dumb luck."

GEORGE BURNS and The HUNDRED-YEAR DASH
By Martin Gottfried.
Illustrated. 327 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $23.
 
100 YEARS, 100 STORIES
By George Burns.
224 pp. New York:
G. P. Putnam's Sons. $15.95. 
 It is a daunting task to write accurately about a man as prone to hyperbole as George Burns is. He tends to give delicate or unpleasant matters his vaudeville shine. He will omit or change facts regarding a previous marriage here or a case of gonorrhea there, but always with a joke and a cigar-puffing change of subject. As a centenarian, and a gregarious one at that, he has provided a host of witnesses to the latter portion of his remarkable life -- but, alas, few to its beginnings.
What Martin Gottfried, the author of several show business biographies, can tell us in "George Burns and the Hundred-Year Dash" is that Mr. Burns, the remaining one of 12 children, appears to have had three lives: pre-Gracie, Gracie and post-Gracie. Born Nathan Birnbaum on Jan. 20, 1896, in New York City, he has managed to live through the entire century so far. He enjoyed success in vaudeville, teamed up with Gracie Allen in 1923 and made intelligent and timely leaps to radio, movies and television. Later, he became a hands-on producer of hit television shows like No Time for Sergeants and Mr. Ed. (One learns in passing here, somewhat distressingly, that Mr. Ed's mouth was manipulated by tugging a nylon mesh cloth, but that is another story.)
Natty, as Gracie called him, could barely read, yet he earned a fortune. Despite his wealth, he kept in touch with his old vaudeville pals. He also had a best friend in Jack Benny, adoring children and a wife and career he loved. The wife and career were one and the same. Still, Mr. Gottfried explains, he lived with a fear that Gracie would retire and he would once again be exposed as a straight man without a comic. She did and he was.
In a Job-like reversal, Gracie's death in 1964 sent George into a prolonged depression. What saved him was the discipline he had learned in vaudeville, especially the importance of routine. Just as the routine of impeccable preparation was the key to performance success, so it would be the key to his life. Go to the office even with nothing to do there. Lunch at the Hillcrest Country Club, lightly, of course, with all the comedians. Play cards. Take a nap. Drink martinis. Visit Gracie's burial place regularly. He carried on a kind of psychotherapeutic monologue with her. One would love to have heard it.
The stuff of George Burns's soul is humor. It is a way of coping, it is a way of life. By all accounts, including Mr. Gottfried's, his best stuff was delivered in the living room rather than on the stage. The opposite was the case with Jack Benny.
Some of the book's funniest moments deal with George Burns's mystical power to make Jack Benny laugh -- any time, anywhere. Jack would physically collapse laughing in response to even an inane Burns remark about ice water or sidewalk grates. The grand irony of both their lives is that Jack's demise was the seminal event in George's remarkable film career in his later years.
Too ill to work, Jack suggested to the director Herbert Ross that George take his place in The Sunshine Boys (1975). George memorized the lines for the audition and was perfect. Here was the ever-dapper straight man, shorn of toupee and flashy vaudeville pretense, giving a brilliant portrayal of an old man. The old man won an Oscar and began several new careers, including movie star and America's beloved gerontology poster boy.
HE was finally a solo hit at 80. His social life, never boring, now took an especially positive turn. Despite a lot of hilarious patter about being feeble and old, he apparently enjoyed a steady sex life with women who were more than half a century younger than he was. This was part of his routine, too -- and nice work if you can get it. As he strode into his 90's several 100th-birthday engagements were set, and the hype was on. He insisted that he couldn't die. "I'm booked," he said.
So why is this well-written, good-natured, admiring book a little depressing? As George would know, timing is everything. On his dash to 100 he stumbled, literally, at 99, injuring his head in a bathroom fall and having to endure brain surgery. Since that event, and despite physical healing, he has begun to fail. He must use a wheelchair and has apparently lost much of his considerable wit to age. A surprise? Hardly. Yet we were hoping he could overcome nature like a talented old athlete beating the odds. It will not be. Especially moving is Mr. Gottfried's report that he sometimes shows his frustration with his memory loss. Enfeeblement is a scary thought for someone whose acuity was a trademark. It turns out that show business, his greatest love, is double-edged. What a pity to contemplate him at 99, tiny and infuriated about having to cancel some gigs.
"100 Years, 100 Stories" will serve as a sort of professional farewell for George Burns. The book is composed of 100 short anecdotes, plus two as a "bonus," none longer than two pages. They are clearly oral in origin, well told and very economical in the manner of George Burns's monologue style. It is easy to hear his cadence in the words, which were presumably spoken into a tape recorder. Many of these stories are funny, and literally history. Some have been heard several times before. A few are broad, like vaudeville routines, while others are more personal, like the ones about his delightful torment of Jack Benny. George Burns has thousands of them but only 100-plus are presented here, for obvious reasons. Happy birthday, George.

SHOCK WAVE
By Clive Cussler.
Simon & Schuster, $25. 
 Ian Fleming used to write books with plots like this: an odd-looking, sinister fellow without redeeming qualities but with unlimited resources threatens to disrupt life as we know it by unleashing a high-tech cataclysm -- and there is only one impossibly competent, impeccably tasteful, finely chiseled man who can possibly stop him, although it's hard to imagine just how. In "Shock Wave," the sinister one is an Australian diamond magnate named Arthur Dorsett, "a troll from Teutonic folklore who'd just crawled from an underworld cave." His scheme is to cause the collapse of the worldwide diamond market and, in passing, to kill every living thing in Honolulu by means of a convergence of ultrapowerful, low-frequency sound waves emitted from four sites around the Pacific rim. On our side is Dirk Pitt, master of derring-do, who (when he's home) lives in an abandoned airplane hangar with his stunning collection of antique machinery and an ample supply of tequila, and who works for the National Underwater and Marine Agency, a vague but well-funded organization headed by Admiral James Sandecker. Pitt (who seems blessed with more lives than several cats) and Dorsett start down the inexorable road toward confrontation when our hero, accompanied by his faithful sidekick, Al Giordino, rescues the villain's estranged daughter Maeve Fletcher from a test run of daddy's "acoustic convergence" off Antarctica. No sooner has she been brought to safety than Maeve realizes she "found Pitt immensely attractive and wanted him, yes, feverishly and shamelessly wanted him." The feeling is mutual, but first there is the matter of saving millions of lives and preserving the world's economic order. Had he cared more about characterization than about his extravagant plot, Mr. Cussler (the author of a dozen previous novels, most recently "Inca Gold") might have had a stronger book, for the relationship between Fletcher and Pitt, beneath its exaggerations, offers possibilities. He might also have spared us some really unique similes -- when, for example, Pitt flashes one of his foes "a smile as hard as the handle on a coffin." JAMES POLK

FRANCO: A Biography
By Paul Preston. Basic Books, $25.
He was a ruthless dictator who profited from luck, but he was also a shrewd strategist who rebuilt Spain's postwar economy, our reviewer, Paul Johnson, said last year. Although Mr. Johnson felt this biography overly emphasized Franco's evil, he found it "full of fascinating details . . . like Boswell on Johnson."
 
A SON AT THE FRONT
By Edith Wharton. Northern Illinois University, $14.
The war at home is the theme of this novel, first published in 1922 and never before available in paperback. Drawing on the author's experiences, it portrays the collision between the aloof sensibilities of American expatriates living in Paris and the ardent desires of the French to defend their land in World War I. John Campton, a divorced American painter, is loath to have George, his French-born son, join the fighting at the front. But George's desires intervene. M. F. Egan, writing in The New York Times in 1923, said of Wharton's novel: "So far she has done nothing that equals it. She sounds the finest depths of sentiment without becoming sentimental."
 
THE BELL CURVE: Intelligence and Class Structure
in American Life
By Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray.
Free Press, $16.
Engendering furious debate when it was first published, this book contends that intelligence can be effectively measured, that it correlates with future success and that its presence among the country's elite is a matter of genetics. It "makes a strong case that America's population is becoming dangerously polarized," Malcolm W. Browne said here in 1994.
 
WONDER BOYS
By Michael Chabon. Picador USA, $13.
Set at a literary festival, this novel stars Grady Tripp, a former prodigy who now faces writer's block, a troubled marriage and a pregnant mistress. "Mr. Chabon is that rare thing, an intelligent lyrical writer," Robert Ward wrote in the Book Review last year.
 
SCHOOLGIRLS: Young Women, Self-Esteem,
and the Confidence Gap
By Peggy Orenstein in association with the American Association of University Women.
Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95.
Spurred by a report on adolescent girls' dwindling self-esteem released in 1991 by the American Association of University Women, the author interviewed and observed students in two middle schools -- one suburban, the other in a low-income area. Ms. Orenstein found both groups of eighth-grade girls less assertive and confident than their male peers. "This important book should be read by parents raising children of all ages and of both sexes," David Halberstam said in these pages in 1994. A more hopeful picture emerges from IN THESE GIRLS, HOPE IS A MUSCLE, by Madeleine Blais (Warner, $11.99). This book chronicles the 1992-93 season of the Lady Hurricanes, a Massachusetts high school team that finally won the state championship that had long eluded them. "Ms. Blais vicariously joins the girls in their joyful discovery of physical and emotional strength," Gail Shister wrote here last year.
 
COCONUTS FOR THE SAINT
By Debra Spark. Avon, $11.
If love is perfect knowledge of another, then Maria Elena, a young Puerto Rican woman, feels shortchanged. Enlisting the help of her fianc's triplet daughters, she struggles to find out the history of the widowed baker she has promised to marry. In 1994 our reviewer, Abby Frucht, found the story "enough to secure Debra Spark's future as a novelist."
 
AGUIRRE: The Re-Creation of a Sixteenth-Century Journey Across South America
By Stephen Minta. Owl/Holt, $11.95.
In 1560 a rebellious Basque murdered the leader of a Spanish expedition on a quest for El Dorado and took over his troops. The author retraces the steps of the adventurer, Lope de Aguirre, using original documents to penetrate the mystery of his mind. "It's a highly dramatic story, and the author tells it well," Rand Richards Cooper said in the Book Review in 1994. Another enigmatic explorer is portrayed in CHARTING THE SEA OF DARKNESS: The Four Voyages of Henry Hudson, by Donald S. Johnson (Kodansha Globe, $14). Drawing on ships' logs and journals, the author reconstructs Hudson's poorly documented life, which ended in 1610 with the mutiny of one of his crews. It offers "fascinating material," Douglas A. Sylva wrote here in 1993.
 
MIZ LIL AND THE CHRONICLES OF GRACE
By Walter Wangerin Jr. Harper Paperbacks, $5.99.
In this autobiographical collection of stories, the author travels between his Midwestern childhood and his years as the white pastor of a mostly black inner-city church. He "seems to have discovered a lot about how people are put together and what satisfies and stirs our hearts," Peggy Payne said here in 1989.
 
DEAD LAGOON
By Michael Dibdin. Black Lizard/Vintage Crime, $12.
The author's detective hero, Aurelio Zen, returns to his native Venice, where he contends with kidnappers, drug smugglers and possibly supernatural forces. Mr. Dibdin "has transcended his own superb craftsmanship," Marilyn Stasio wrote in the Book Review last year. Laurel Graeber

HEADLINE: Why Economic Growth Won't Melt the Iceberg

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Robert Eisner disputes the overwhelming consensus that Social Security and Medicare are facing an imminent demographic crisis ("These Figures Spell Good Times, Not Bad," Viewpoint, Dec. 24). Instead, he argues, economic growth will take care of everything. 
 Mr. Eisner is like an officer on the Titanic, telling us all is well even as the iceberg comes into view. The iron logic of population demographics cannot be evaded, and the old notion that growth will somehow allow us to escape the consequences is plainly wrong. The "growth" we enjoyed over the last 15 years was largely restricted to the highest links in the economic food chain; the majority of workers have seen real wages stagnate or steadily decline.
The coerced rise of two-income households, persistent low savings rates and continued high consumer debt are convincing evidence that most families already live close to the edge. Worse yet, our increasingly regressive tax system has abandoned any effort to tap the beneficiaries of growth to finance Government obligations, preferring instead to impose ever higher indirect and payroll taxes on the disenfranchised working poor. Under these circumstances further growth will continue to enrich people and corporations at the tip of the pyramid, while everyone else loses ground.
Dominated by powerful corporate and financial interests, fearful of angering some voters, our Government lacks the political will to make even the smallest meaningful reform -- even if it might head off the coming calamity. Rather than making our tax code more progressive, compelling those who have benefited most to contribute in kind, our "leaders" now talk about an even more regressive flat tax. It boggles the mind. Franz Kafka would understand, but I don't.
As our ship of state approaches the iceberg, Mr. Eisner shouldn't claim everything is just fine. It may already be too late to avoid the collision.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Into an Income Portfolio Some Risk Should Fall

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
WITH a portfolio of more than $500,000, Johnny Byrd of Norfolk, Va., seems to be the kind of investor who could afford to relax.
Instead, Mr. Byrd, with the help of his financial planner, Robert Tull of Chesapeake, Va., has spent the last three years searching for ways to bolster the small returns from his income investments like certificates of deposit. 
 So far, Mr. Byrd, who used to supply dry cleaning services to the Navy and is now in his late 70's, hasn't fared badly as an income investor.
Last January, for example, he put some of his money into two-year Treasury notes, locking in an impressive coupon rate of 7.5 percent. At the same time, he turned to a local credit union to buy a one-year C.D. that yielded 6.25 percent. This month, he rolled over that certificate into one yielding 6 percent, about one percentage point above the current average for one-year C.D.'s.
Mr. Byrd's investments in bond funds have also done well. Last year, his investment in the Vanguard Fixed-Income Intermediate fund returned more than 20 percent, while his total investments in Vanguard bond funds returned almost 18 percent. By contrast, the average taxable fixed-income bond fund returned 16 percent last year.
"I'm conscious of my investments every day," said Mr. Byrd, who meets with his adviser a few times a month and watches investment programs on television most days. "You always try to learn something."
Income investing does not have to be an oxymoron. Investors can get an adequate return if, as Mr. Byrd does, they shop around. Financial planners also say investors can bolster returns by trying investments that are a bit riskier than certificates of deposit, like preferred stock, bond funds, real estate investment trusts and even junk bonds.
Tim Kochis, a financial planner in San Francisco, urges income investors holding longer-maturity products to move "down the maturity curve," probably to the three- to five-year range, especially now that short- and intermediate-term investments have unusually high yields relative to longer-term ones.
And Harold Evensky, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla., says income investors should not ignore the stock market. Investors should focus on total portfolio returns, he said, instead of immediate interest and dividend payments. And that might mean putting a significant part of their money into stocks, even if the risk makes some income investors uncomfortable.
If an investor put $100,000 into the Fidelity Intermediate Bond fund in December 1985, the portfolio would have grown to $113,000 by December 1994, Mr. Evensky said. If the investor had split the money equally between Fidelity's bond fund and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the portfolio's value would have reached $169,000. "Over time, equities simply have better returns," Mr. Evensky said.
To encourage his clients, two-thirds of whom are retired, to focus on total return, Mr. Evensky recommends establishing two accounts. One would be highly liquid, holding about two years of cash flow in a combination of money market and bond funds. The other would be for more growth-oriented investments, like stocks. To build in a second tier of liquidity, Mr. Evensky advises his clients to put perhaps 20 percent of the money in the second account into bonds of under five years' maturity, so that even if stocks made up 50 to 60 percent of their total assets, his clients would be able to sleep comfortably at night.
When it comes to bonds, Mr. Evensky recommends that income investors stick to high-quality products and diversify them. He advises investors not to buy individual bonds, but to stick to bond funds.
"In order to diversify adequately, you need to diversify by issuer, and here you need at least 10 different positions, which takes a lot of money to do adequately," he said.
Stephen Janachowski, an investment adviser in San Francisco, also urges caution on bonds, especially when investors buy them to hedge an equity-laden portfolio, rather than to provide a steady stream of income. "With the former investors, I typically see them become too opportunistic, often trying to pump up their returns with an aggressive junk or foreign bond, even though the yield difference may be just 1 percent," Mr. Janachowski said.
"Don't try to get cute with a bond portfolio," he added. "If you need more income than you're getting right now, that probably means you either have to reduce your expenses, or go for a growth investment like stocks."
For a income investor who wants a well-diversified bond fund, Mr. Janachowski's current top pick is an intermediate-term fund, the Harbor Bond fund. Mr. Tull likes the Vanguard Wellesley Income Fund, which had a 26.3 percent return last year, as well as the Sogen International fund from Charles Schwab, where investors pay no sales charge.
Benefits may also be found in municipal bonds, which offer tax advantages -- especially for investors in higher tax brackets.
"Municipals are priced pretty attractively," said Marilyn Gunther a financial planner in Southfield, Mich. "If a good-quality one were paying 5 percent, and if a taxpayer were in the 28 percent tax bracket, the effective yield would be 6.95 percent."
Ms. Gunther has also been telling her income clients to invest in preferred stocks, because many yield more than 7 percent. She is recommending Morgan Stanley preferred and also the trust-originated preferred securities offered by the Ford Motor Company.
What about junk bonds, many of which are yielding a relatively staggering 10 percent?
Despite the possibility that a stable economy could bring even higher yields for junk bonds, Mr. Tull said they remained too volatile for many investors. Ms. Gunther, however, suggested including junk bonds in a portfolio through higher-quality funds like Kemper High Yield or Fidelity Advisor High Yield.
To reduce the volatility of the investment, she recommends that investors withdraw no more than 80 percent of their annual interest every year.
Financial advisers seem less divided on the potential benefits of real estate investment trusts, or REIT's, which buy property and return most of the income to shareholders. They yield far more than most stocks, averaging 7.7 percent. But when real estate prices collapsed in the 1980's, investors in these trusts lost millions of dollars.
Ms. Gunther is convinced that the underlying value of the trusts will keep climbing as the real estate market improves. She recommends that investors look at REIT's like Walden Residential Properties, with a yield of 8.7 percent, and BRE Properties, at more than 8 percent.
Mr. Janachowski called REIT's "an interesting play for people who want an inflation hedge." As inflation increases, he said, so should the value of a REIT's property. But despite the popular assumption that REIT's are conservative investments, he cautioned that they "really act like equities."
Mr. Janachowski said investors should stick to REIT mutual funds, like Cohen & Steers Realty Shares. Mr. Tull adds that in order to endure any unpleasant surprises, like another collapse of the real estate market, most investors probably should not commit more than 5 to 7 percent of their portfolios to the trusts.

Imploding Windows, Rent Increase and Exploding Tempers

BYLINE: By JANET ALLON 

 BODY:
Like hundreds of his neighbors at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, Harold Levine was frightened and furious when newly installed windows in his apartment began shattering two years ago. Because of a defect, nearly 2,000 windows, each with argon gas between their two panes, imploded soon after installation in the two complexes.
The landlord, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, had all 147,000 windows fitted with capillary tubes to equalize the pressure on each side of the glass. Now, the sound of breaking glass has been replaced by the hue and cry of tenants furious about a rent increase to pay for the windows, including a lump sum each is charged for the period between installation and repair. 
 Last month, the commissioner of the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, Joseph Holland, granted Met Life a rent increase to cover the windows' $30 million cost. And he ruled the increase could be retroactive to the installation date, which varies by apartment. The permanent increase will be about $36 a month per apartment and the retroactive payment about $800.
The ruling by Mr. Holland, an appointee of Gov. George E. Pataki, reversed a decision by his Cuomo-appointed predecessor, Donald M. Halperin, who had rejected Met Life's request for a rent increase to pay for the windows. Residents of the complexes, with a total of 10,000 units, vowed to fight Mr. Holland's decision in court. "They installed a lemon at a Cadillac price," said Mr. Levine, 79, who has lived in Stuyvesant Town since it opened in 1947. "We're getting bamboozled."
Like many elderly tenants in the middle-income complexes, Mr. Levine, a retired zipper salesman who lives on Social Security, says the rent increase will be a burden. The $700 rent for his two-bedroom apartment will rise to about $790 for two years, to cover the retroactive charge, then go to $736 a month. He and many other residents also insist the new windows do not protect against noise and cold air because the argon gas once sandwiched between the panes has been released. "I get drafts and more noise than I had with the old windows," he said.
But a spokeswoman for Met Life, Nancy Peskin, said the windows function as intended. "We've been assured by two independent consultants that the capillary tubes haven't reduced the windows' thermal qualities," she said.
Jack Lester, a lawyer representing the tenants, says that Mr. Holland's ruling "is contrary to law, logic and fairness," and that he will file a lawsuit in State Supreme Court arguing that Met Life should get far less than the $36 monthly increase because the repaired windows are defective and that any increase should not be retroactive.
Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a lifelong Stuyvesant Town resident, agrees. "Who ever heard of collecting money for defective merchandise?" he asked. "If these were cars, they would have been recalled."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
A Way to Cash In as Insurers Get the Urge to Merge

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
THE life insurance industry, its growth sputtering, has not been a big player in the recent surge in mergers and acquisitions. Investment bankers aren't breaking their spears on the shields of opposing investment bankers. There are no rapacious raiders, no blustery moguls. No barbarians. No Gates.
Even so, insurance-industry analysts say, there are opportunities for investors who are willing to be patient and a bit nontraditional. Instead of hoping for huge gains by trying to figure out which companies may be acquired, the experts say, it may be smarter to buy the acquiring companies, like SunAmerica, which bought three life insurance companies last year. 
 And although a few publicly traded companies, like the U.S. Life Corporation in New York, could become tempting takeover targets, most deals are likely years away.
For now, however, investors can participate in only a limited way in any deals brewing in the life and health insurance business, whose 1994 assets totaled $1.9 trillion, or roughly the gross domestic product of Spain and Germany combined. Industry assets probably reached $2.1 trillion last year, according to A. M. Best, an insurance rating service in Oldwick, N.J.
Publicly traded insurance companies making aggressive, even hostile, bids for other insurance companies is a little distant, so there is little for investors to buy.
Of the 20 or more life insurance deals in 1995, most involved companies selling their noncore insurance businesses, said John A. Hall, a senior insurance analyst at Northington Partners in Avon, Conn. Ford Motor, for example, sold its life insurance unit to SunAmerica last November for $172.5 million.
The insurance companies that bought the units got a good, even cheap, price. "They bought from motivated sellers," Mr. Hall said. "The next phase is insurance companies selling specialized units to other insurance companies for better fits, like a life insurance company that wants only life insurance or a property and casualty company that wants only property and casualty. The price goes up for that group.
"But the highest price of all," Mr. Hall continued, "is when a public company goes after another public company, and that won't happen in earnest until all the other cheaper subsidiaries are bought up."
Analysts say that as many as 20 percent of the more than 1,500 public and privately owned life and health insurance companies face consolidation. Many of these merging companies will be mutual companies, which are owned by the policyholders, rather than shareholders. Eventually, public companies will also join the fray.
Several forces compel the consolidation. The insurance business has been slow to computerize, so operating costs have grown and profit margins have narrowed. Industry return on equity was 16 percent in 1990, 11.5 percent in 1994, and is expected to have dropped as low as 11 percent last year.
About a third of all life insurance is still sold through the old-fashioned -- meaning expensive -- way of distribution known as the door-to-door sales agent. An agent's commission can total as much as the first year's premiums on a policy.
And with overall interest rates low, the return on investment for insurance policies is 8 percent or less. With mutual funds posting double-digit returns, insurance policies lack allure. The industry has therefore expanded its sale of investment products with tax advantages, like tax-deferred annuities that yield as much as 1.25 percent above certificates of deposit.
Perhaps the biggest force behind consolidation is that Americans are simply living longer and see less need for life insurance.
"When you buy life insurance, you are trying to protect certain assets," said Lawrence G. Mayewski, senior vice president for Best's life-health division. "But there is less compelling need to purchase, or if you have purchased, retain a policy once the kids have left school."
Health care has become a far more important issue for a graying population, and life insurance companies have responded by selling long-term disability insurance to provide for nursing-home and home health care coverage. 'You're really looking at the risks of living too long," Mr. Mayewski said.
Despite the innovations, the industry is growing slowly and some companies are stagnating. Best says the amount of new insurance premiums written has risen between 1 percent and 3 percent annually for the last five years, compared with 4.5 percent to 8 percent annually between 1980 and 1987, the last period of robust growth.
For investors, it is difficult to figure out which life insurance companies are likely to become acquisition targets, especially because many of these will probably be privately owned mutuals whose transactions differ in accounting procedures from those of publicly owned companies.
Andrew Kligerman, an insurance analyst at Schroder Wertheim, said an exception is U.S. Life, which has a strong balance sheet with some $7 billion in assets in 1994.
Mr. Kligerman has a buy recommendation for U.S. Life based on its potential attractiveness as a takeover target. While U.S. Life's earnings have been flat in recent years, its earnings potential appears sustainable over the next five years. At 11 times earnings, Mr. Kligerman thinks its stock is cheap. It closed Friday at $32.375, off 62.5 cents.
Whether an investor will see a big run-up in the price of a stock that looks like a takeover target is unclear because few public insurance companies are taken over. Mr. Kligerman said he thought a takeover premium of 15 percent was reasonable. That compares with 10 percent to 20 percent for banking, according to George A. Bicher, a banking analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons.
It is far easier to look at insurance companies likely to do the acquiring, because of the efficiencies a round of consolidations will probably bring to the industry over all. Mr. Hall of Northington Partners likes five companies -- American Bankers Insurance, American General, Jefferson-Pilot, Penncorp Financial and SunAmerica -- that bought insurance companies in 1995 and, he says, are likely to buy more in the near future.
But he notes that even these companies have been only making smaller acquisitions of a few hundred million dollars each. The big acquisitions will probably come in an industry shakeout that may last five to seven years.
Washington is part of the reason. A revamping of the health care system will affect profit margins at life and health insurance companies as well as hospitals and H.M.O.'s. A cut in the capital-gains tax would make mutual funds even more attractive, hurting the insurance business even more.
"Nobody wants to pull the trigger on a deal with that hanging over your head," said Mr. Mayewski of Best.

Contrary to the market's usual reaction when a company makes an acquisition, Wall Street has generally bid up the stock of the listed insurance companies when they have bought other insurers.

HEADLINE: All You Need to Know About All You Need to Know

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
New York has always been a place where people will tell you where to go. What's remarkable is what a business it has turned into.
The first guidebook to New York City dates from 1807. Its author was Dr. Samuel L. Mitchill, and its title was "The Picture of New-York: or, The Traveller's Guide through the Commercial Metropolis of the United States. By a Gentleman Residing in this City." A compendium of municipal data (it notes eight daily newspapers, five semi-weeklies and six weeklies), descriptions of the urban landscape (the park in front of City Hall, then under construction, was planted "with elms, planes, willows and catalpas"), annotated journeys on foot and by boat along the Hudson, and the occasional review (Mechanic Hall, on Broadway, was "one of the most genteel Hotels in the city"), the city's initial guidebook was, in short, a worthy and recognizable progenitor of the genre. 
 Still and all, Dr. Mitchill would probably be astounded at what he eventually wrought, a veritable flood of published instruction, reflection, direction and suggestion aimed at both visitors to and residents of "the Commercial Metropolis of the United States." At this point, whole bookstore sections devote themselves to city guides, both of the comprehensive and the specialized varieties. Books in Print, under the headings "New York City: Description," and "New York City: Description-Guidebooks," lists more than 300 titles. In October 1994, City and Company, a brand-new publishing house devoted to city guides, offered the first four specialty volumes (including "How to Meet a Mensch in New York" and "The New York Dog Owner's Guide") of a list that has now grown to 16.
For a browser, even a dedicated one, the sheer variety is daunting, much in the manner of the city itself. (A guide to guides would be helpful.) And for many specific purposes, there is little choice -- I could find only one dog lover's book: take it or leave it. But many of these books overlap in their territory, so what do you do then?
The reasons for the proliferation are manifold, but together they speak to the traditional appeal of New York: the variety of cultural and intellectual life keeps the people living here and creates curiosity everywhere else.
"First of all, there are just so many people in New York, intelligent, curious people who know enough about New York to know there's a lot about new York they don't know," said Karen Cure, editorial director of Fodor's Travel Publications, which published two New York City guides in 1989, and this year will publish eight different volumes, aimed at both visitors and residents. "And these are people who know there is a lot they can learn from a book. Society's getting more complicated, and people are feeling overwhelmed and guidebooks do organize and systematize the world for them."
She continued: "There are a lot of niche markets in New York; in Atlanta, there may be people interested in pet cemeteries but not enough pet cemeteries to do a book about. There are in New York, and there are also enough people who'll go out and buy the book."
Actually, the marketplace had taken over enough by the turn of the 20th century that niches in the guidebook market had sprouted. You could find information about city rail and steamboat schedules, the locations of churches, banks and insurance offices, and cursory descriptions of restaurants, museums and hotels. By the 1880's, Appleton's Dictionary of Greater New York included a section on slumming, explaining to the bourgeoisie how to arrange a tour of the city's seamier side.
The mid-century even featured guides to brothels, some straightforward, some rather sneakily offered with a veil of disapproval.
"It was a genre," said Barbara Cohen, a co-owner of New York Bound, a bookshop in Rockefeller Center specializing in historical and contemporary works about the city. One 1839 volume was titled "Prostitution Exposed, Or, A Moral Reform Directory: Laying Bare the Lives, Histories, Residences, Seductions, Etc., of the Most Celebrated Courtezans and Ladies of Pleasure of the City of New York." A typical entry: "Jane P. Williams . . . resides at 148 Leonard Street . . . Rather well-formed and about 35 years of age . . . Keeps a good house and some very handsome girls . . . Prices moderate."
But 150 years ago there were no guides specifically aimed at cat owners, architecture appreciators, Jews, women, newcomers, crime aficionados, Francophiles, dance enthusiasts, children, peregrine falcon lovers, antiquers or apartment hunters. The arts scene may have been flourishing, but it had no comprehensive directory of performance spaces and repertory companies like the estimable "Applause: New York's Guide to the Performing Arts" (Applause Theatre Book Publisher, 1992) by Ruth Leon. The city may have been a grueling place to live even then, but there was no guide to coping like "The Intrepid New Yorker: How to Turn New York City Into a Manageable Small Town" (Villard Books, 1993) by Kathy Mayer Braddock and Tory Baker Masters. It offers voluminous advice (some of which is mere common sense) for consumers on things like how get better service from your butcher or avoid long lines at the bank.
There were no tours of ethnic enclaves, no lists of the best nightspots, coffeehouses, beauty services, places to find peace and quiet, public artworks, things to do on a Sunday or adult education courses. There was no published advice on how to get your child into private school, how to get a divorce, how to find a public toilet or how to live and die (a guide to negotiating the maze of New York probate court). Certainly there was no need for a book called "How to Beat a Parking Ticket" (J. F. Caroll Publishing, 1994). As diverse as they are, what all guidebooks have in common is that they are books; they are for reading, and to treat them as reading material is a way of choosing the ones that will best serve you.
Take the example of restaurant guides, of which there are dozens, many of them by well-known critics, like John F. Mariani and Peter D. Meltzer ("Passport to New York Restaurants 1995," Passport Press, Ltd., 1994) or Sylvia Carter and the Newsday staff ("Eats NYC," Andrews & McMeel, 1995) , to name a couple of the more prominent. Each has its own opinions, rating system, writerly style. How to choose? Isn't it a question of whom you trust?
But this is true even for the books that are mostly charts and ratings and straightforward information, like the Zagat's restaurant guide, the city's biggest seller.
An annual survey of diners, it uses the Zagat formula, which is to collect opinions, collate them and give them back to us as ratings and capsule commentaries. Now the publisher of more than 30 guides to restaurants, retailers and hotels, Zagat is among the leaders in the guide expansion derby, and the success of the line is largely formulated on the voice that emanates from its pages. Without actual words, we know whom we're listening to: us. That's both comforting and trustworthy. It is no wonder that the formula has spawned many imitators.
The restaurant guide is, of course, the prime example of the guidebook as before-the-fact reference: you consult it for a pragmatic purpose, to choose a place to eat, and consult it before you go.
There are, however, whole other categories that raise the question of what a guidebook is for. Do you read it at home or take it with you?
For example, consider guides to the city's architecture and social topography. The most comprehensive remains the AIA Guide to New York City, (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1988) by Elliot Willensky and Norval White. A neighborhood-by-neighborhood, block-by-block, building-by-building assessment of the city's notable structures, it is written, not without attitude and opinion, but almost in notes form, so that it isn't so much a reading experience or a prescription for how to see the city, but an on-the-spot reference.
On the other hand, Gerard R. Wolfe's "New York: A Guide to the Metropolis" (McGraw-Hill, 1993) is a text-heavy tome organized in 20 well-informed walking tours, and thus falls between the practical extremes. It's reasonably well-written but not a particularly good read; from an armchair you can appreciate the ample history it includes, but not the visual sense of what's being described, and there is a distinct disadvantage in not having the physical orientation the text carefully provides. On the other hand, this is a pretty dense piece of work to be grappling with as you walk.
"Seeing New York," (Temple University Press, 1995) by Hope Cooke, has some of the same problems, acknowledged in the subtitle: "History Walks for Armchair and Footloose Travelers." The book is essentially a collection of essays, organized in the form of walks through neighborhoods, and all written according to personal theory and consistent theme: that one gets rooted in a place by tracing its history. It is, I think, a reader's book first. If Ms. Cooke's voice is to your liking (the writing is authoritative but occasionally precious), you'll want to follow her out the door.
Next month, Citadel Press will publish "Infamous Manhattan," a book-length walking tour of the sites of the borough's most famous, grisly or interesting crimes, by Andrew Roth. Better researched and more elegantly written than a previous volume on the same theme, "New York Notorious," (Crown Publishers, Inc., 1992) by Paul Schwartzman and Rob Polner, which was nonetheless notable for its wisenheimer, tabloidlike prose, "Infamous Manhattan" is a perfect example of a guidebook that is better reading than it is service. It is full of wonderful historic tidbits -- it says New York's first murder victim, one Gerrit Slomp, was stabbed in a brawl outside a tavern near Broadway and Beaver Street on July 22, 1648.
It is written with wry, deliberate mischief."The great quantity of bad behavior in New York has given this city not only a fearful reputation," Mr. Roth writes, "but also a deep and fascinating criminal heritage."
There's much for a reader's pleasure, but what would you see at the corner of Broadway and Beaver? A bloodstain?
The comprehensive guides, those big monsters ostensibly full of everything, can be divided into two types: those that are group written and researched, and those, like Dr. Mitchill's original, that are the product of a single, monumentally obsessed individual.
Of the former, the first was the mammoth "King's Handbook of New York City," edited by Moses King and published in 1892, and perhaps the best known is "The W.P.A. Guide to New York City," a 1939 volume produced by the Federal Writers Project staff, a Works Progress Administration agency established to provide work relief for writers and artists during the Depression.
Both books are in print, and both make glorious reading, giving period glimpses of the city that, through the care of research and skill of writing, seem if not entirely accurate today then nonetheless valuable for their perspective. Among other things, what is apparent is the geometric inflation of the last half-century: "Prices in the better American-plan hotels range from $3 to $6 a day for a single room with board," the King informed its readers; by 1939, a room at the Sherry Netherland with a private bath had risen to $7.
The King is full of vintage photographs that make the city edifices look like stand-alones, and there is frequently a Margaret Mead tone to the writing, as though the author were a visitor to a previously unexplored territory:
"Novelty in restaurants is abundant variety. In the Chinese district are several Chinese restaurants, dirty, foul-smelling and cheaply furnished. National viands of a mysterious character and national drinks are served at reasonable prices."
The W.P.A. Guide begins with a section on general information, which includes listings, but not descriptions of, hotels, restaurants, theaters and the like, and is followed by descriptive, historical tours of the boroughs. It is full of writerly gems, like the following straightforward and graceful description of how the Bronx got its name:
"The area that is now called the Bronx, called Keskeskeck by the Indians, was purchased from them in 1639 by the Dutch West India Company. Two years later, Jonas Bronk, a Scandinavian, became the first white settler of the region when he bought 500 acres between the Harlem River and the Aquahung. The latter stream soon lost its Indian designation and became known as Bronk's River."
Among the more current crop of team-written, corporation-sponsored comprehensive guides, the main distinctions are of organization and orientation. There are the budget guides, notably Frommer's "New York '94-'95 on $70 a Day," (Prentice Hall Travel, 1994) by Joan Hamburg and Norma Ketay, which is aimed at the middle-class, middle-American visitor looking for a rather middle-of-the-road New York experience. And there's "Let's Go New York," (Let's Go, Inc., 1996) an annual guide produced by Harvard students for travelers who would probably just as soon sleep on someone's floor if they could (probably after finishing the night at Save the Robots, the nightclub) and is notable for its helpfully voluminous listing of cheap eats. (It should be noted that almost all of these current guides devote the lion's share of their pages to Manhattan, with cursory -- sometimes more than cursory -- ventures into the other boroughs.)
The slim Michelin Guide, elegantly designed and crammed with no-nonesense information, is probably the most convenient to carry around. Fodor's gold guide, the flagship volume of an expanding line (the company is planning to release a new guide next fall to compete with "Let's Go"), is the easiest of these guides to read, with uncluttered pages, reasonably eclectic restaurant and hotel listings, excellent, simple maps and generally clear prose, though every now and then, it tries for atmosphere, and New York begins to sound like Damon Runyon would have it:
"Delicate little ladies tottering about in their pillbox hats are really theatrical grande dames with fast answers to the flashers on 8th Avenue," it says, describing the populace of the theater district. "Shifty-looking guys toting battered briefcases turn out to be famous directors; and the girls and boys scuttling through stage doors are chorus members rushing to exchange their Nikes for tap shoes."
"NYC Access," (Access Press, 1994) by Richard Saul Wurman, is neither convenient for carrying -- it's too bulky -- nor, with an organizing principle that lumps restaurants, shops, hotels and notable sights in a particular neighborhood into one long list -- easy to follow.
Two relatively new entrants in this category, from Eyewitness Travel Guides (Dorlin Kindersley, 1993) and Knopf Guide (Alfred A. Knopf, 1994), stand out from the others for their stunning graphics, photos and map overlays; the Knopf, for instance, has a marvelous spread on the birds of Central Park. The Eyewitness book, which skews a little younger, clearly draws on the fragmented video style of MTV and the vivid collages familiar to those fluent in computers.
Anyway, much more enjoyable are the personally written guides that attempt to be as comprehensive as one person's experience can be. The idiosyncrasies are worth the price, quite aside from whether the information is any good. There's a longstanding tradition of such guides: Kate Simon's 1959 volume, "New York Places and Pleasures: An Uncommon Guidebook," remains a classic of the genre, for its arch explanation of city life to the uninitiated.
Herewith, Ms. Simon's description of a New York City saleswoman: "The saleswoman is not rude because her feet hurt -- everyone's feet hurt -- nor from the usual wounds of love and money. Having dealt with women who have the leisure and facade she envies, she has come to imitate the most rarefied of them, borrows in reasonable facsimile their tricks of style, reads the same magazines, and assumes the aloof expression and languid response suitable to the fantasy. . . . When you ask this goddess to wait on you, you have smashed the glass slipper and thrown her into the cinders, Quite reasonably, Cinderella is angry with you."
Of the current guides of this type, four are worth mentioning: "Blue Guide" (W. W. Norton & Company, Inc., 1991), a hugely authoritative text written with an easy formality by Carol von Pressentin Wright, a literature scholar and native Staten Islander, devotes an unusual amount of attention to boroughs other than Manhattan.
"Gerry Frank's Where to Find It, Buy It, Eat It in New York" (Gerry Frank, 1993) has remarkable listings, particularly since Mr. Frank lives in Salem, Ore. Its main irritations are that he shows he is an outsider in enthusiastic commonplace observations delivered as revelations. He tends to write with exclamation points, as in "The fact that most New Yorkers don't own cars ought to tell you something!" There's also, under safety tips, a long list of things not to do in New York, which has the tone of a chaperone on a school outing. And when he claims that his book is comprehensive, there's reason to be suspicious, especially if you happen to be needing a place to eat after a performance at the Public Theater: none of the more popular or well known restaurants in the neighborhood -- among them Time Cafe, Noho Star, Acme Bar and Grill, Great Jones Cafe and Indochine -- are listed.
Finally, a word about two guides written by the English, which are available here but probably meant for fellow countrymen. Michael Leapman's "A Companion Guide" (Harper Collins, 1991) speaks of New York as though it were the moon and New Yorkers strange aliens: "Not everybody on the subway is demented, or after your money," he writes at one point. At another: "New Yorkers love ice cream and have invested it with passionate sensuousness that shows through as they caress a cone and lick the last vestiges of the creamy confection from around their mouths."
Equally nutty but more entertaining is the Cadogan City Guides (Cadogan Books Ltd., 1991) by Vanessa Letts, a poor woman's Kate Simon: "In private, New Yorkers are spectacularly polite; they open doors for women, shake hands at the slightest opportunity, light your cigarettes and insist on paying for meals. They hardly ever swear in front of ladies, and if they do they apologize."
The specific lesson here is applicable to guidebooks in general: Look who's talking.

Despite New Curb, The Trend in China Points to Openness

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
IN the bad old days, an ordinary person in China could be jailed for listening to a radio broadcast that told the news straight, rather than with a jagged, left-leaning tilt. That was 20 years ago.
After fanatical politics receded and China became a more ordinary police state, listening to foreign news broadcasts became as common as dinner-table discussions of politics: it was fine as long as it stayed home, behind closed doors. That was 10 years ago. 
 Today, people openly curse the Government in restaurants, on the street, over the phone, just as in other countries. Even Communist Party officials talk about the vast corruption within their ranks, about the unnecessary brutality of the 1989 crackdown on the student protest movement, about how the police may be biggest traffickers in pornography.
Nonetheless, there is a line that cannot be crossed. While you can curse President Jiang Zemin as you walk down the street, try standing up on a street corner to draw a crowd and you won't last very long. Like the economy, which is half market-oriented, access to information in China is half open.
In this half world, where nothing is allowed but everything is possible, financial information services were on the "allowed" list until one day last week, when they were abruptly shifted to the "not allowed" list. In typical fashion, the New China News Agency announced that the Government had issued a decree on a new way of supervising foreign financial news agencies, but kept the decree itself secret. So the affected news agencies, Reuters and Dow Jones, were left to puzzle over what it means.
 
Showing Who's in Charge
 In approving the move, the Chinese Government seemed to be concerned more with exerting control over news organizations than with preventing news from reaching the eyes and ears of ordinary people.
In fact, the Chinese have many sources of information to choose from. A lot of people still listen to foreign radio broadcasts for news, but now they have other choices. Instead of the single, deadly dull television station that reigned a decade ago, multiple stations, and even cable TV, in cities like Shanghai and Beijing offer news features and foreign movies. Talk radio includes steamy discussions of sex and personal relationships, while music stations no longer shy away from rock-and-roll.
Shops full of pirated videos, though not officially allowed, offer almost everything you can find at a Blockbuster outlet in New York, though they endure periodic crackdowns when a round of talks with the United States on intellectual property rights is coming up. Official newspapers are still dull, but newsstands also sell semi-official magazines and books with racy stories about crime, prostitution and drugs, as well as books with scurrilous history about well-known political figures, including Mao Zedong and his wife, Jiang Qing.
Until now, the Government had not seemed threatened by the financial news services.
"If they were really worried about what flickered on a Reuters screen, they would have shut them down long ago," said an executive of an American news organization based in Beijing.
Instead, the executive pointed out, financial news services began in China at such a small level that control was not deemed necessary. Before 1990, only a few Chinese banks bought financial news terminals to enable them to trade on world currency and commodity markets.
At least two things will change for the financial news services. First, the New China News Agency will eat seriously into the profits of agencies like Reuters and Dow Jones's Telerate, which have each been making tens of millions of dollars a year from customers in China. It has been trying to set up a competing financial service, and since it hasn't yet, it will simply charge the foreign agencies fees for doing business.
 
Vetting the News
 Second, the New China News Agency will also decide who can get financial wire services, how much they pay, and what they can read on the terminal. It won't be clear how the process of vetting news will delay up-to-the-minute market information until the decree is publicized and the new regime actually begins.
Putting them under tighter supervision is a belated recognition of how large financial services have grown in China. The boom began in 1991, as China's own commodity and stock markets began trading real money, peaked in 1993, and has eased since, after a series of financial scandals led to the closing of some commodity markets and to sharper regulation of others.
"In a way, it's amazing it took them so long," said an executive of a news agency in Shanghai.
After all, the New China News Agency is gaining the same control over financial news services that it has long exercised over Reuters's and the Associated Press's regular news wires, which the New China News Agency distributes to Chinese newspapers. Doing the same with financial news services is only more painful for the freedom that has been enjoyed until now.
The incident is a replay of what occurred in 1993 with satellite TV dishes. After looking the other way for two years while thousands of Chinese bought satellite dishes to receive foreign broadcasts, the Government suddenly announced that no more dishes could be sold to individuals.
Then, as now, the Government didn't mind when there were just a few buyers. But once the few became many, and the buyers less easily identifiable, the bureaucracy began its slow process of making a decision to assert authority, delayed in part because the danger was not deemed critical and in part because those making money off the permissiveness lobbied against any restrictions.
Then, as now, new restrictions are step backward for access to information in China, but they comes after several steps forward. The overall trend is unmistakable.

HEADLINE: Seeing Green;
The Red Menace Is Gone. But Here's Islam.

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN Americans consider the safety of the world these days, many still seem conditioned to look for end-of-the-world threats that must be confronted. The end of the cold war sparked a kind of intellectual contest to identify the biggest and most credible new enemy. There was unfair trade. Global warming. Computer terrorism. The spread of weapons of mass destruction. Drugs. But none of these caught fire. Even ethnic hatred did not capture Americans' imaginations, as illustrated by the lack of enthusiasm for sending G.I.'s to Bosnia.
But one threat has resonated in the public mind: Islamic holy war. Just last week, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman was sent to Federal prison for life in a conspiracy to follow the World Trade Center bombing with a string of bombings in New York that could have killed thousands of people. The Sheik played the role perfectly; even as he proclaimed his innocence and called himself a martyr of God, he portrayed his prosecution as part of a new cold war against Islam. 
 Exactly what does he represent, though? Is he the emissary of a global threat to America and its allies, or just another opportunist with a claim to God's truth, a band of followers and not much of a future?
Certainly, powerful Islamic movements have sprung up to emulate Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's victory in Iran as they challenge Western allies in Algeria, Egypt, Kuwait, Bahrain, Pakistan. The greatest danger to peace between Israel and the Palestinians remains the Islamic radicals of Hamas. And Iran has tried repeatedly to export its revolution.
So there are many respected intellectuals who see the acts of terrorism and the ubiquitous Muslim diatribes against the West as part of a deepening conflict between an aggressive Islam and a defensive Western civilization. Take Bernard Lewis, the eminent historian from Princeton University, who wrote more than five years ago: "The struggle between Islam and the West has now lasted 14 centuries. It has consisted of a long series of attacks and counterattacks, jihads and crusades, conquests and reconquests. Today much of the Muslim world is again seized by an intense -- and violent -- resentment of the West. Suddenly, America had become the archenemy, the incarnation of evil, the diabolic opponent of all that is good, and specifically, for Muslims, of Islam."
But a number of other experts on Islam think it is a big mistake to see politicized Islam as a unified threat, rather than as a way of thinking that inspires local bids for power. Their argument goes something like this: Overstating the threat, and misunderstanding the role of religion in it, risks playing into the hands of the extremists by portraying Islam itself as the enemy. Algeria's Muslims don't answer to Iran, and there are inherent divisions between the Sunni and Shiite branches of Islam. What's more, the extremists represent only one part of Islamic theology -- those who would mobilize the religion to foment social revolutions, often against repressive, corrupt governments.
"Explosive headline events and acts of violence make it tempting to view Islam through the prism of religious extremism and terrorism," said John Esposito, director of the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown University and author of a book titled "The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality?" "But the demonization of a great religious tradition because of the perverted actions of a minority of dissident voices remains the real threat."
In fact, political Islam has become one of the hottest, nastiest debates in academic circles today, mirroring the old debate on how well-organized and monolithic the Communist menace was. Supporters of the notion of fundamentalism as a global threat label their opponents simplistic and naive; opponents label the supporters simplistic and bigoted.
The Council on Foreign Relations, hardly a hotbed of radical thinking, has come under fire for its new monthly newsletter, Muslim Politics Report, a forum for a broad range of thought on Islam. "It's a front for radical Islamic extremists attempting to legitimize their agenda and to put on a friendly face in the United States," said Steven Emerson, a writer who believes the extremists represent a global Islamic conspiracy against America. The council has denied his accusations, with Leslie Gelb, its president, saying: "We consider the report a major contribution to let people know about a range of thinking by Islamic experts and leaders. It will stay. Period."
In Europe, the debate is even more virulent. America's European allies have been skittish about supporting the Muslim-dominated Government in Bosnia in part because of fears about their own Muslim populations. The presence of up to 15 million Muslims in Europe, many of whom are poor and have refused to embrace the ways of the West, has fueled prejudices and fears. Some French schools prohibit girls from wearing head scarves, and Germany has refused to give Turks citizenship.
So it was not surprising that last year Willy Claes, the Belgian who was then NATO's Secretary General, said offhandedly that "Islamic fundamentalism is at least as dangerous as Communism was." The remark prompted King Hassan of Morocco, one of North Africa's most pragmatic and Western-oriented leaders, to retort: "I don't think NATO was created to fight fundamentalism, but to fight Soviet guns and missiles. Anyway, if fundamentalism has to be engaged in battle, it would not be done with tanks."
Several incidents in recent weeks show just how complex the issue is.
Bahrain's ruling family has put down demonstrations by the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, blaming them on Iran. But American intelligence has found no evidence that the opposition is anything but locally organized -- spawned by economic discontent, an uneven distribution of wealth and the absence of any political freedom.
The Islamic Welfare Party won a stunning 21 percent of the vote in Turkish elections last month. But a pro-Islamic vote -- for a party that has not been associated with violence -- was the only vehicle for protesting the Government's failure to tackle poverty and inflation.
 
A Handy Explanation
 Under pressure from Saudi Arabia this month, Britain ordered the expulsion of Mohammed al-Massari, an opponent of the regime, to the Caribbean island of Dominica. But the Kingdom itself is an Islamic state that rules by strict Islamic law; what Mr. Masari accuses the royal family of is corruption (which, he says, is un-Islamic).
And consider this: the "green menace" (the new catch-phrase in the debate, after the color associated with Islam) is a convenient way for a leader to explain away opposition based on a country's economic, social and political inequities. In visits to Washington seeking American support last year, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and then-Prime Minister Tansu Ciller of Turkey all told President Clinton that the greatest threat to their governments came from globally linked fundamentalism. While they clearly believe that, they risked sounding like one-time American friends, such as President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi of Iran, who resisted reform to the very end, while presenting themselves as bulwarks against Communism.
Israel's reconciliation with the Palestine Liberation Organization has also helped cast Islam as a larger-than-life enemy. "After the fall of Communism, fundamentalism has become the greatest danger of our time," Shimon Peres, now Israel's Prime Minister, has said. The American Jewish Congress has replaced its "Boycott Report" on the Arab economic boycott of Israel with a newsletter titled "Radical Islamic Fundamentalist Update."
In the absence of other compelling threats to the United States, Islamic radicalism has also seized the imagination of some in Congress. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has warned about "totalitarian Islam," led Congress last month to approve $20 million in covert aid to moderate Iran's behavior. No matter that there is no viable opposition to Iran's Government; that the Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that despite severe economic problems the regime is not going to collapse any time soon, and that the policy is likely only to fuel paranoia in Teheran that the United States is determined to destroy Iran's Islamic republic. The initiative was so odd that the Administration (which calls Iran an "outlaw state") found itself in the bizarre position of weakening the covert program so its mandate did not include overthrowing Iran's Government.
In fact, Iran, the only country that has tried in a serious way to export an Islamic revolution, provides a case study of how "global, radical Islam" can fail miserably. In 1991, the mullahs failed to respond when Saddam Hussein's army attacked two of the holiest shrines of Shiite Islam, in the Iraqi cities of Najaf and Kerbala. And this year, Iran has shown no inclination to take on Moscow by supporting the Muslim rebels of Chechnya. In its 17 years, in short, the Islamic Republic of Iran may have spread a lot of money around, armed assorted guerrillas and terrorized Salman Rushdie. But its society is far from content and its brand of revolution has simply not caught on.
"The last 17 years has shown that however attractive or influential they may be, no individual or state has enjoyed any kind of unitary leadership in the Islamic world," said Mr. Esposito. "There are religious extremist leaders and organizations, but there is no global Islamic threat."

HEADLINE: A Six-Lane Test Case for a Turnaround on Carpool Lanes

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Twice every weekday, one side of the six-lane Cross Westchester Expressway, better known as Interstate 287, becomes a stop-and-go stream of glowing red brake lights as tens of thousands of drivers commute to and from work. The result has been air pollution, frayed tempers, accidents and countless hours of lost work and leisure time.
Now, after more than a decade of study, state transportation planners have settled on a $365 million fix: a high-occupancy vehicle lane -- or H.O.V. lane, in the parlance of officialdom -- down the middle of the highway, reserved for buses, vans and cars with two or more occupants. 
 In its proposal, the state Department of Transportation predicts that as many as 2,500 commuters an hour will shift from the clogged existing lanes, lured by the prospect of a quicker trip. "It only takes a fraction of people to decide to ride-share or use a bus to make a difference," said Wayne R. Ugolik, a director of travel-demand management on Long Island, where the state plans to spend almost $500 million to extend 12 miles of new car-pool lanes on the Long Island Expressway to 42 miles.
But environmentalists, urban planners and some local politicians say that in the long run, these proposals are no fix at all. In particular, the battle over the future of the Cross Westchester Expressway is becoming a highly visible example of a turnaround in environmental thinking on highways.
Clean-air advocates, who played a major role in the push for car pools and the creation of the lanes two decades ago, now say the concept is failing, largely because states are content to label a car with two people "high occupancy" and because lanes are being added to roads instead of converted from existing lanes.
Studies by transportation engineers have concluded that adding car-pool lanes does not ease congestion in the long run and rarely results in reduced air pollution because they draw more traffic.
The critics say that, in effect, without simultaneous programs to discourage people from driving, high-occupancy vehicle lanes are little more than a new way for highway departments to do what they have always done: solve traffic problems by laying more blacktop.
Environmentalists have focused their criticism on the Cross Westchester Expressway partly because it has not yet moved from design to construction, while the Long Island lanes are almost a forgone conclusion.
Critics say state transportation officials have latched on to the H.O.V. solution for I-287 not because it will work, but because it can be paid for with the help of more than $200 million in Federal funds.
But that money comes from a program that is meant to shunt gasoline-tax revenue into transportation projects that cut pollution and single-occupant-vehicle travel, environmentalists say. Critics contend that the Westchester lane -- which they say would ultimately cost closer to $500 million -- would constitute a waste of taxpayers' money.
Today, the Cross Westchester Expressway is chronically clogged, particularly at choke points like the spot two miles east of the Tappan Zee Bridge, where the New York State Thruway curves south toward New York City and slender ramps link it to the Cross Westchester's western end.
At such points, and in spots where exit and entry ramps come one right after the other, cars weave from lane to lane, slowing traffic to a crawl, according to state highway engineers.
With the number of vehicles on the road expected to rise from an average of about 100,000 a day now to 170,000 a day in 2021, state planners predict the peak periods of morning and evening congestion will grow from one hour to three hours if nothing is done.
Supporters of the Westchester car-pool lanes and similar projects say highway capacity must increase or economic growth will be stifled along with mobility.
In New York's environmental impact statement for the Westchester project, computer-modified photographs of the once and future I-287 show today's congestion alongside a neat vision of trucks and cars smoothly flowing in three lanes, with a scattering of buses and car pools speeding by in the car-pool lane.
Supporters of such projects are quick to point to other H.O.V. lanes around the region and the nation that have turned solo drivers into passengers.
They cite the bus lane leading from Route 495 in Union City, N.J., into the Lincoln Tunnel. Each morning, buses in the 25-year-old lane carry more than 34,000 commuters into Manhattan, more people than all 12 adjacent general-purpose lanes combined.
But those are exceptions to the rule, according to some transportation analysts. The reserved Lincoln Tunnel lane is the ideal H.O.V. lane, restricted only to buses, the highest-occupancy vehicles of all. If all such lanes were operated this way, car-pool lanes would work wonders, said Lee Epstein, director of land programs for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, which did a widely cited study of H.O.V. lanes in 1994.
But few new lanes today resemble the bus-only lane to the tunnel, Mr. Epstein said. Instead, most require only two people per car, which he termed low occupancy. "A date is not a car pool," he said.
All the car-pool lanes in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut require a minimum of only two riders. Several transportation studies have pointed out that many of these lanes, including those leading to Hartford on Interstate 91 and Interstate 84, started with a three-person minimum, but standards softened quickly as commuters stuck in traffic complained about the empty lane a few feet away, Mr. Epstein said.
Environmentalists also point to many examples of H.O.V. lanes that have been abandoned completely and turned over to general traffic. In New Jersey, the region's first car-pool lane, created in 1980 on a 12-mile stretch of the Garden State Parkway, was opened to general traffic two years later. In another form of backsliding, environmentalists say that lanes once reserved for car pools are increasingly reverting to general use outside of peak periods. And the peak periods themselves are shrinking; earlier this month, for example, the Long Island Expressway increased the hours that its H.O.V. lanes are open to general traffic.
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation undertook its study to assess the impact of highway design on suburban sprawl, a major source of pollution. Indeed, the overriding concern of many environmental groups is the potential for added highway capacity to encourage suburban sprawl, with more commuters willing to drive greater distances. The growth eats open space and creates widespread pollution of water and air, environmentalists say.
Transportation planners, more focused on traffic than on pollution, conclude that newly-built lanes do not ease congestion in the long run. A 1995 study of highway options by the Transportation Research Board, a branch of the National Research Council, stated that where a car-pool lane is added to a highway instead of converted from an existing lane, the process "usually results in decreased average auto occupancy."
"Although politically popular in the short run, it is extremely costly and counterproductive in the long run" to add H.O.V lanes, wrote the authors of the study, engineers at the Universities of Pennsylvania and Delaware.
And the goal of cleaner air is also rarely met, according to several analyses. In a 1994 study, Jon Kessler and Will Schroeer, two economists at the Federal Environmental Protection Agency calculated projected changes in air quality in the Washington region if H.O.V. lanes there were expanded from the current 75 miles to 334 miles of roadway. Car pools would increase, the economists said, but the overall number of miles traveled by vehicles would hardly shrink at all, and air quality would not be measurably improved.
The Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a coalition of environmental and urban planning groups from New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, has submitted an alternative proposal to New York State that would shift the focus from lane construction on Interstate 287 to rebuilding the existing highway so it works better.
By smoothing out choke points and introducing measures to encourage commuters to leave their cars behind or shift work patterns, congestion and construction delays could be reduced and at least $100 million saved, the group said.
But even with novel programs to change commuter behavior, state highway planners said, the region around New York City will need added highway capacity.
Mr. Ugolik said that without it, economic growth on Long Island and in other areas cannot be sustained.
"You've got to have freedom of movement to have economic growth," he said. "And the best way to keep things moving is with H.O.V. lanes."
But Maureen M. Morgan, the president of Federated Conservationists of Westchester County and a member of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, said such lanes are simply business as usual dressed up with a new environmental-sounding name. "It's just the latest version of the old highway building philosophy that got us where we are today," she said.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Everybody's Asking The Question: Whither Gretzky?

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
A couple of weeks ago, in an interview with Wayne Gretzky, a Toronto reporter told the Great One how strange it seemed that he might be traded not once but twice in his marvelous career.
The first time was in 1988, a multiplayer, multimillion dollar deal that sent Gretzky from Edmonton to Los Angeles. 
 "I wasn't traded," Gretzky responded. "I was sold."
The man who bought his contract, the former Kings owner Bruce McNall, is headed to jail for financial fraud unrelated to Gretzky. But the economics lessons seem to have left an impression on hockey's most famous, and highest-paid, player as he begins the second half of his 17th National Hockey League season.
As he took the ice for the Western Conference in tonight's All-Star game in the Fleet Center, most of the talk was of Gretzky's demand that the new owners of the Kings either improve their team immediately or trade Gretzky to a Stanley Cup contender. If they don't, he can leave, as a free agent, next summer. He turns 35 years old on Friday; he is in the autumn of his career.
The Gretzky chatter superseded discussion of Mario Lemieux's brilliant comeback after a year off to recover from Hodgkin's disease and a sore back, and about the new, little lump on Lemieux's neck that is believed to be benign.
It minimized conversation about Mark Messier's leadership of the surging Rangers, or about the problems the Devils are having defending the Stanley Cup.
Instead, the whispers and murmurs were mostly of Gretzky! Gretzky! Gretzky! Should the leading goal scorer of all time stay, or should he go? Which teams will bid for him? Is he hurting his current teammates by telling them, in effect, they are not good enough for him? And, is he hurting his image by appearing to be manipulative as his skills gradually recede from extraordinary to merely superb?
"I don't back down from what I said," Gretzky said at a news conference here. "I have come forward and said my piece. I wanted what was best for myself and what was best for the L.A. Kings. And if what was best for the L.A. Kings was to get some new guys, some young guys for Wayne Gretzky, then all the more power to them. I don't think that is self-serving."
He made his points clearly, often speaking of himself in the third person. Other stars came through during the day, talking to groups of reporters. But only Gretzky needed a big podium and a speaker system. This even though his public visibility has lessened as the Kings' success has diminished.
Sometimes, playing in the southwest corner of the country before increasing gaps of empty seats, he seems like yesterday's fashion, a sports hero from the era of Larry Bird and Bo Jackson.
But apparently, he doesn't wish to just fade away with four championship rings from his Edmonton period. In recent days, the well-oiled rumor mill has had him on the way to St. Louis, with a few other teams listed as faint possibilities. Gretzky predicted that things would be settled last week after a meeting between his agent, Mike Barnett, and the new owners of the Kings.
But the new owners, Ed Roski and Philip Anschutz, didn't even attend the session. Instead, they sent lower-ranking front-office executives.
"The immediate answer that I thought we would probably get didn't really materialize," Gretzky said. "We're still kind of in limbo."
If the Kings wish to trade Gretzky, they have until the deadline of March 20, two months from today and a month before the playoffs. Most players here, at least in their public comments, seem firmly in support of Gretzky, who has scored 827 goals and 1,746 assists in the 1,219 regular-season games.
This season, he has 67 points, fourth in the league behind Lemieux's 100. Fifty-four of them are assists; he still has the feathery passing touch and uncanny creativity to make average linemates look good and good linemates look great. Many would still love to play alongside him.
Craig MacTavish, the Flyer veteran who played with Gretzky in Edmonton, said Philadelphia would be "the best fit in the league for Wayne Gretzky."
St. Louis fans can imagine him setting up Brett Hull; Devils fans can envision him filling their need for an attacking, veteran center; Ranger fans can wonder about a reunion with Messier and other former Oilers now skating in Manhattan.
Barry Melrose, the former coach of the Kings and now a television commentator for ESPN, said Gretzky had told him he would play for less than the $6.5 million he now earns, if it's with a good team. If so, that could undermine the N.H.L. Players Association, which won free agency for veterans in the hope of increasing their wages.
Melrose said Kings players have told him they don't resent Gretzky's comments because some of them want out too, and that most understand Gretzky's desire to play on another championship team.
"I'm hearing everyone say Wayne is doing this as a ploy to get more money and it's not true," said Melrose, who coached the Kings when they made it to the N.H.L finals in 1993. "He's been honest and up front. He's telling the Kings, 'Why not deal from a position of strength?' If they wait, they get nothing." Some around hockey, Melrose included, feel Gretzky would best fit with the Maple Leafs. He grew up near Toronto, and they are a veteran team.
For now, he's still dressed in the black and silver of the Kings, a 16-19-11 team that will appear at Madison Square Garden on Monday night against the Rangers and in Continental Airlines Arena on Tuesday night against the Devils.
Of his team, Gretzky said, "I don't want the thoughts of the organization to be that, 'Well, our plan is to win three years from now.' Because that doesn't do a whole lot of good for Wayne Gretzky. I'd like to have a chance to win now, simple as that."

HEADLINE: Many in Haiti Are Troubled By Marriage Of Aristide

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
At City College in the early 1980's, Mildred Trouillot was a reserved, winsome bookworm, one of a coterie of American-born students whose Haitian roots had been transplanted to New York City.
Last night, Ms. Trouillot, the youngest child of a steelworker and a hospital technician, became the First Lady of Haiti, the wife of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, at their wedding in Haiti. 
 But the couple's romance troubles many Haitians who remember when Mr. Aristide was a Roman Catholic priest, and still consider him a saint-like figure who was somehow above such things.
Mr. Aristide's choice of a light-skinned wife also angers some followers. For much of Haiti's nearly 200-year history as a republic, a rigid social and economic caste system has been based largely on the lightness of one's skin. To some, the marriage of the dark-skinned Mr. Aristide to the light-skinned Ms. Trouillot comes as a disappointment, almost a betrayal, for light skin was once considered to be too patrician.
"Aristide was already married to the Haitian people," said Olrich Charles, a sports instructor in Port-au-Prince, the capital. "This is like a divorce, only three times: first from his supporters, then from his class and finally from the church."
But others applaud the match.
"He's not a priest anymore, so he has every right to get married," said Pe Mack, 30, a musician. "I think he's also made a good choice for a wife: she's smart, she's a lawyer."
Mr. Aristide, 42, won a landslide victory in the presidential elections in December 1990. In September 1991 he was overthrown by Haiti's generals and sent into exile. He returned to power in October 1994, after an American-led invasion, but is to leave office on Feb. 7, when his successor and close friend, Rene Preval, is inaugurated.
The timing of the wedding was closely tied to Mr. Aristide's departure from office because it was feared the union could take attention away from Mr. Preval, a Haitian Government official said.
Although Ms. Trouillot, known as "Minouche," comes from a strong Haitian heritage, counting several judges and lawyers, her family was not among in the economic elite. Her father, Emile, left Haiti in 1958 and two years later his wife, Carmelle, followed. They settled in New York, where Mr. Trouillot worked grueling hours in a steel factory and his wife was a laboratory technician.
Ms. Trouillot, 33, grew up in the Bronx, where she attended St. Barnabas High School. She graduated from City College and from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and became an associate at Robinson, Silverman, Pearce, Aronsohn & Berman, in Manhattan.
She met Mr. Aristide in 1992 at a lecture he gave at City College. Two years later, Ms. Trouillot was recruited to work as a legal adviser to Mr. Aristide in Washington.
And there a romance blossomed.
After he returned to power, Mr. Aristide officially asked the Vatican to release him from his vows. The Vatican, which had a stormy relationship with Mr. Aristide, largely because of his political activities, has never said whether it granted the request. But the marriage was blessed by Msgr. Willy Romelus, and Archbishop Joseph Lafontant of Port-au-Prince had a role in the ceremony, The Associated Press repoorted from Tabarre, on the outskirts of the capital.
Ms. Trouillot has said she will dedicate her efforts to working with Haiti's homeless and street children housed at an orphanage founded by Mr. Aristide.
The couple were married at Mr. Aristide's modest home -- he has refused to live in the presidential palace -- in a ceremony attended by about 500 family members, friends and foreign dignitaries, including American military officers and Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser.
The couple exchanged vows at a table in the garden, the A.P. reported. The bride wore a simple coral-colored suit, the groom a dark blue one. The simplicity was reflected by the lack of a bridal gown or a bouquet; there was not even a wedding cake.

HEADLINE: DEADLY TURNING POINT: A special report.;
AIDS Epidemic, Late to Arrive, Now Explodes in Populous Asia

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: LOPBURI, Thailand

 BODY:
A ribbon of acrid yellow smoke rose from the crematory as a Buddhist monk approached, clutching his saffron robe in a bony, withered hand. His skin was mottled, his body wasting away from the disease that would soon take his life, just as it had killed two others whose bodies had been committed to the fire only hours before.
"I know that my body will end up here," said the AIDS-stricken monk, Phra Kamthorn Kitisalo, as he entered the crematory, the still-warm ovens at one end of a high-ceilinged room. "I accept that." 
 In one corner, set beneath a gilded statue of the Buddha, was a pile of fist-sized white cotton bags, each containing ashes from an earlier cremation. "These people died of AIDS, and the ashes stay here because the families are afraid to claim them," said the 38-year-old monk, gently lifting one of the dozens of sacks. "They are afraid that they will get sick if they hold the ashes."
Thailand was among the first countries in Asia to fall victim to AIDS, which is now beginning to ravage the world's most populous continent. And nowhere is the devastation more jarring than in this Buddhist temple set among parched hills in central Thailand.
The temple, Wat Phrabat Nampo, is the nation's largest AIDS hospice. Nearly 80 victims are gathered here, waiting to die; about a dozen are monks, some abandoned by their monasteries.
Now the daily scenes of misery and death at Wat Phrabat are becoming commonplace across Asia, where the epidemic is entering a new, visible phase.
AIDS arrived late in Asia, with the virus beginning to spread here in earnest in the late 1980's, more than a decade after it took hold in the United States and Africa. Until now, AIDS in Asia has been mostly a silent, unseen epidemic. The virus has a long incubation period, often lingering in a human body for more than a decade before making itself known in a serious illness.
But for millions of Asians, time is about to run out. The incubation period is ending, and across this continent, the dying has begun.
Asians infected in the 1980's are now falling sick, and they have begun to die in such huge numbers that the epidemic now threatens to dent some of the world's fastest-growing economies, overwhelm hospitals and health-care systems and undermine traditional ways of life. Few Asian Governments are prepared for the health emergency that is nearly upon them.
 
The Disease
Infection Rates Still Exploding
Asian epidemiologists are optimistic that they can avert the sort of devastation unleashed in Africa, where some sub-Saharan countries, including Botswana, Uganda and Zimbabwe, could lose a quarter of their adult population to the disease.
But in absolute terms, AIDS will almost certainly claim more victims in Asia, home to two-thirds of the world's population, than in Africa. Without a cure, an estimated 10 million Asians will die of AIDS before 2015. Last year, nearly 50,000 people died of AIDS in Thailand alone.
Even as the infection rate has peaked in other parts of the world, it is still exploding in Asia, with the virus spreading mostly through heterosexual intercourse. Epidemiologists working with the World Health Organization have predicted that the number of infected Asians will rise from 3.5 million this year to as many as 12 million by 2000.
Last year, for the first time, estimates suggest that the number of people infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, was larger in Asia than in Africa. By the turn of the century, more people will be infected each year in Asia than in the rest of the world combined.
And while most of Asia should be able to avoid an Africa-scale disaster, a handful of countries, including Cambodia and Myanmar, and areas of Thailand and Vietnam could face the level of devastation seen in Africa. In Cambodia, an estimated 4 percent of pregnant women are already infected with H.I.V., as well as 40 percent of the prostitutes in some Cambodian provinces.
Asia's most populous countries -- China, India and Indonesia -- do relatively little blood screening, so health care workers cannot say for sure how far the virus has spread, but the available evidence suggests that they face severe epidemics.
The epidemic is in its infancy in China, but the virus is reported to be spreading quickly. Health officials estimate that close to 100,000 Chinese are infected. While the virus is thought to be nonexistent in large stretches of the Chinese countryside, it is spreading wildly in border areas where intravenous drug use is common.
Many epidemiologists believe that AIDS will ultimately claim the lives of more people in India than in any other country. United Nations estimates suggest that 1.75 million Indians are already infected with H.I.V., and that 4 million will be infected by the end of the decade.
Indian victims are mostly in the cities, especially Bombay, the financial capital, and along major national roadways. The roadways are lined with brothels serving truckers, who are thought to offer a transmission route for the virus.
In Indonesia, which has a population of 190 million and is the world's fourth most populous nation, the Government has suggested that as many as two million people could be H.I.V.-positive by 2000. City dwellers are the principal victims, although Indonesian sailors traveling across the vast archipelago country have carried the virus to remote islands.
Asia's other archipelago country, the Philippines, has been relatively lucky so far, with the World Health Organization estimating that only about 18,000 Filipinos are infected with H.I.V., a fifth of the infection rate of Thailand.
Yet some epidemiologists think that the estimate must be too low, given the number of brothels and massage parlors in Manila and other Philippine cities. Whatever the accurate figure today for the spread of the virus, health workers believe the Philippines is headed for disaster because of rampant prostitution -- and because of the opposition of the Roman Catholic Church to anti-AIDS educational programs.
In Asia, like Africa, the virus often spreads through families, with an unfaithful husband infecting his wife and their unborn children. AIDS is killing Asians from all walks of life -- peasant farmers as well as royalty, prostitutes as well as religious men and women. In Thailand, the Public Health Ministry has said that it knows of at least 170 infected Buddhist monks.
"Everybody is dying of AIDS, even the monks," said Phra Kamthorn, the AIDS-stricken monk, who says he was infected with the virus during his days as a prostitute-loving "playboy" before entering a monastery six years ago. "I would see prostitutes every day."
 
The Denial
Populations Pay For State Inaction
To a degree that health experts find startling, many Asian governments are refusing to deal with the AIDS crisis, or even to acknowledge that the disease is a problem.
Their inaction reflects an unwillingness by Asian leaders to accept an uncomfortable truth: that prostitution is a way of life across most of this continent, and that millions of Asian men visit brothels.
In confronting the problem, the notable exception is the Government of Thailand, the Asian country most closely associated with AIDS because of its notorious commercial sex industry. To their credit, the Thais have developed Asia's most effective AIDS-prevention program, arguably the best prevention program in the developing world.
However bad things may get in Thailand, it might have been far worse.
"In Thailand, we've bitten the bullet." said Mechai Viravaidya, a Thai public-health crusader who is considered the father of the AIDS-prevention program.
"But in much of the rest of Asia, the fuse has been lit. You'd think that other Asian nations would learn from our experience, but most of their governments are still in the denial stage -- they've blinded themselves to this problem -- and sadly they will pay for it."
They will pay for it out of their pocketbooks. Just as they were beginning to pull themselves out of poverty and enjoy the fruits of an economic boom that is transforming the continent, millions of Asians are facing an epidemic that threatens to kill them and pauperize their families.
A study by DRI/McGraw Hill, an American research organization, found that by the end of the decade, AIDS could cost Asian economies as much as $52 billion, much of it through the loss of a generation of laborers struck down in the prime of their working lives.
AIDS could condemn some of Asia's poorest countries, notably Cambodia and Myanmar, to more years of misery as they are forced to spend their paltry resources to care for the dying.
"Asia has the fastest growing epidemic in the world, and people there don't seem to realize it yet," said Peter Piot, a Geneva-based epidemiologist who is the director of AIDS-prevention programs for the United Nations. "Thailand is the exception, unfortunately."
 
The Defense
Prevention Efforts Slow the Spread
It was only a few years ago that Thailand was seen by its complacent Asian neighbors as an exception of an entirely different sort -- the only Asian country likely to be decimated by AIDS. From a handful of cases detected in 1988, AIDS swept through this country of 58 million people, its transmission made easy by the availability of commercial sex.
Brothel visits have long been considered a rite of passage for young Thai men. In Bangkok, brothels are found in virtually every neighborhood -- and in some neon-lit neighborhoods, on every corner. A survey in 1990 found that more than 20 percent of Thai men admitted that they had paid for sex in the previous year.
It was a military coup that turned things around. A 1991 army uprising brought to power a transitional Government led by a former diplomat, Anand Panyarachun, who instituted a far-reaching AIDS-education program.
Condoms were widely distributed to brothels and massage parlors, and brothels that refused to insist on condom use were shut down. A public education program required radio stations to run explicit AIDS-prevention commercials at least once every hour.
The results are seen today, with Thailand recording a drop in the number of new H.I.V. infections each year since 1991. According to Government estimates supported by independent researchers, the number of people infected in 1990 was about 215,000, a figure that is expected to fall to 90,000 in 2000.
Researchers say Thai men and the prostitutes appear to have made significant changes in their behavior, with fewer men visiting brothels and more prostitutes demanding that customers use condoms.
By 1994, the Government estimated that only 10 percent of Thai males between 15 and 49 were paying for sex, half the figure from several years earlier. Surveys of brothels showed that condom use has increased to 60 percent, double the rate in 1990. The incidence of other sexually transmitted diseases has dropped during the same period by more than half, additional proof of condom use.
But the Government has no time for self-congratulation. Thousands of Thais are dying of AIDS each month, and Thailand remains a harbinger of the struggles in store for its neighbors. An estimated 860,000 Thais are already infected with H.I.V., a number that is expected to rise to 1.8 million within a decade.
The World Health Organization has estimated that 2 percent of all Thais from 15 to 49 are already infected. AIDS is expected to be Thailand's leading cause of death by 2000, with life expectancy plunging to only 40 years of age by 2010.
Families are being torn apart as parents fall ill and die, leaving children as orphans who often must fend for themselves. A recent study showed that 205,000 Thai children under 15 had mothers infected with H.I.V.
In Thailand's main Klong Prem prison, an average of five inmates die of AIDS each week. About 400 of the 5,300 inmates at the prison are infected with the virus, and the prison hospital has built a 500-bed ward specifically for inmates dying of AIDS.
 
The Devastation
Victims and Survivors Are Left Abandoned
"We have to accept the fact that this is a disaster," said Dr. Sampant Kahintapongs, director of Nokornping Hospital in Chiang Mai, Thailand's second-largest city. "We cannot keep up."
The 320-bed public hospital, one of the city's largest, is being swamped with AIDS patients, with at least one patient dying of AIDS -- and often two or three -- each day.
The overcrowding is so serious that beginning this year, the hospital will routinely turn away AIDS patients who have already been admitted once before for a so-called opportunistic infection, caused by the collapse of a patient's immune system. "We do not have the space to admit them a second or a third time," Dr. Sampant said.
Unrelated to their work, the hospital's own staff members are also being devastated by the disease, with an employee dying of AIDS every two or three months.
At lunchtime, dozens of frail AIDS patients struggled to sit up in their beds to eat, the lucky ones attended by parents or husbands. The others, not as fortunate, are abandoned by fearful relatives, a rare situation in a country that traditionally places high value on closely knit families.
"Sometimes after an AIDS death, the families will not come back to claim the body," Dr. Sampant said. As a result, the hospital is often forced to pay to cremate the bodies and dispose of the ashes.
Poon, a 29-year-old AIDS patient and former prostitute in a beer hall, looked warily at the bowl of dried beef and sticky rice her mother had brought to the hospital. "I know I am lucky that my mother will be here with me," she said. A doctor nearby whispered that she was only days from death.
"I cannot eat the hospital food," Poon explained with a feeble smile, her discolored lips drawing back against sunken cheeks, her hospital gown ballooning around her emaciated body.
"I feel so sick that it is difficult for me even to eat this delicious food from my mother," she said as she slowly lifted a spoonful of rice to her mouth, chewing it with an expression of muffled pain.
Her mother, Aeh, fished into the plastic bag that served as her purse to find a photograph of her once beautiful daughter. Aeh, 67, runs a vegetable stall in a open-air market several miles outside Chiang Mai, and with the $25 she earns each week, she will be left to care for Poon's 8-year-old son when her daughter dies.
"All of my daughter's friends are already dead," Aeh explained in a small voice, trying not to be overheard by Poon. "I love my daughter, but I am angry that she would allow this to happen. She never should have worked at that bar. She knew this could happen. We Thais know about AIDS."
 
The Destitute
Poverty and Piety Leave Many Ignorant
In their understanding of AIDS, Thais are in a distinct minority among Asians. In neighboring countries, there is simply no money or expertise for prevention programs.
After a generation of civil war, Cambodia has been left one of the poorest nations in the world, with most adults earning little more than the equivalent of a dollar a day. The Government is unable to provide most Cambodians with clean water and electricity, let alone an effective AIDS program.
Ignorance is widespread even among Cambodian doctors and nurses. A recent poll showed that most hospital nurses believed that AIDS was a disease of foreigners, and that it could not be passed between Cambodians. Only 5 percent knew that the virus could be transmitted through a shared needle between drug addicts.
Their ignorance may help explain why Cambodia, which had no recorded AIDS cases five years ago, is now confronted with an estimated 90,000 infections.
In other, less destitute Asian countries, ignorance about the disease is tied to the opposition of powerful religious and political leaders who disapprove of sex education of any sort.
In the Philippines, where 90 percent of the population is Catholic, the Government has tried to organize a national AIDS program, but it has been blocked at almost every turn by Jaime Cardinal Sin, the impassioned Catholic leader of Manila, who has described the Government's anti-AIDS program as "intrinsically evil." Church leaders have been known to set boxes of condoms on fire at anti-Government demonstrations.
In Muslim countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, religious fundamentalists denounce anti-AIDS campaigns as an effort to encourage promiscuity. In Indonesia, the country's highest Muslim authority has demanded that the Government limit the sale of condoms only to married couples.
Malaysia is led by a physician-turned-politician, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, but his Government has been reluctant to offer the kind of vast anti-AIDS program that health experts say is vital to curtailing the spread of the virus. The number of H.I.V. infections in Malaysia has jumped from an estimated 2,400 to nearly 30,000 in the last three years.
The president of the Malaysian Aids Council is Marina Mahathir, the Prime Minister's 38-year-old daughter, and she is bluntly critical of Asian governments, including her father's, for doing too little to avert a health disaster.
"I think there's a fear of having to deal with some really sticky issues," she said. "You have to talk about sex, and all the conservative elements of this society don't want to talk about it."
She said that she recently telephoned her father to ask which of his health advisers was briefing him on AIDS. The answer startled her.
"He said nobody was giving him any AIDS briefings at all," Miss Mahathir said. "He said that he'd never had a briefing. Nobody ever wanted to talk to the Prime Minister about AIDS."

HEADLINE: Rich Nations See Slowdown In Economies As Temporary

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Top financial officials of the world's seven richest industrial democracies decided today that a slowdown in economic growth in Europe and the United States was probably only temporary and that existing policies were enough to insure continued recovery.
"We concluded that despite a temporary slowdown of activity in most of our countries in recent months, the underlying conditions for sustained recovery are in place," the French Finance Minister, Jean Arthuis, said in words that were substantially repeated by his American, German and other counterparts. 
 The Deputy Secretary of the United States Treasury, Lawrence H. Summers, said, "There certainly has been some slowing on the European continent that was recognized in the meeting as a matter of some concern." He said American economic growth was expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, but added, "We continue to expect solid growth going forward."
The participants also urged Russia not to reverse the policies of economic liberalization partly repudiated by last month's elections, and by President Boris N. Yeltsin's dismissal last week of Anatoly B. Chubais, an architect of change.
"It is very important for our relations with Russia that progress in economic reform go forward," Mr. Summers said.
European officials welcomed recent gains made by the dollar because a stronger dollar would make it harder for American exports to undercut European prices on world markets.
But the president of the German central bank, Dr. Hans Tietmeyer, said, "I am not of the opinion that the dollar has yet exhausted its upward potential."
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who returned to Washington for more negotiations on balancing the budget, said on Friday that a stronger dollar was in the best interest of the United States.
In Europe, there has been considerable fear that deflationary policies required in all the key European economies by the terms of a treaty to establish a common currency by 2000 could drag Europe into recession after barely three years of modest recovery.
France, which suffered a crippling three-week national transport strike in December, has revised expected growth this year downward to around 1.6 percent, from 2.8 percent. It could be even lower if Germany, its main trading partner, slumps. But some economists predict only 1 to 1.5 percent growth there this year, down from 3 percent in 1994.
Without stronger growth, unemployment will rise, and with the jobless rate already close to 10 percent in Germany and 12 percent in France, the both Governments are under increasing pressure to bring unemployment down.
When the dollar was at its weakest a few months ago -- 6 to 8 percent below last week's values against the mark and the franc -- there was a tendency to blame it for some of Europe's economic and monetary troubles.
But after Germany, France, Britain and Belgium all lowered interest rates this week to encourage consumer demand, the dollar strengthened against the franc and the mark.
This surprised some experts, because of the unsettling effects on currency markets of the impasse between Congress and President Clinton over the budget. The current United States budget deficit, as a percentage of gross national product, is by far the lowest of the seven countries.
Driven by their treaty on monetary union, the big European countries are all trying to cut their deficits too, and with less government borrowing, interest rates have been coming down.
Since October, average three-month money market rates in Germany have dropped to 3.40 percent, from 4.10 percent, and France has been able to lower them to 3.20 percent, from 7.40 percent, in the same period without provoking the kind of run on the franc against the mark that was set off when the dollar was falling earlier last year.

HEADLINE: Maine Voters' Eclecticism Easily Bests Party Spirit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: SKOWHEGAN, Me., Jan. 18

 BODY:
In elections over the last four years, Ginny Foster helped a Democrat (Bill Clinton) win the White House, a Republican (Olympia J. Snowe) win a seat in the Senate and an independent (Angus King) become Governor.
"I'm pretty much just a Maine person," said Mrs. Foster, a 70-year-old retired special education teacher and a registered Democrat, surprised that anyone would find her voting pattern all that unusual. 
 In Maine, it is not. For years, voters here have resisted party loyalty by exercising a spirited streak of independence rarely seen in other states. This is, after all, where more voters are registered as independent than Democrat or Republican; where Ross Perot made his best showing in 1992, with 30.4 percent of the vote, to nip George Bush for second place behind Mr. Clinton, and where Mr. King in 1994 became the nation's only independent governor.
"Each side thinks I'm too much of the other," Mrs. Foster said today at a center for the elderly.
But few election years in recent memory have offered Maine voters so many possibilities as 1996. The surprise announcement this week by Senator William S. Cohen, a moderate Republican, that he would not seek a fourth term has scrambled state politics top to bottom, much in the way George J. Mitchell did two years ago when he decided to quit the Senate after 14 years, the last 4 as majority leader.
Mr. Cohen's decision has set off a chain reaction of unexpected opportunities, starting with a chance for the state's two members of Congress -- James B. Longley Jr., a freshman Republican who represents the southern district around Portland, and John E. Baldacci, a freshman Democrat who represents the rest of the state -- to abandon the House and join a Senate race that had already attracted a handful of Democrats.
Both Congressmen said this week that they are considering making the Senate race and would reach a decision soon. The possibility that they will enter it has led a wide spectrum of state lawmakers, business executives and former officeholders to consider running for their House seats and, beyond that, has led scores of county and local officials to consider a run for the State Legislature.
"The ground is shaking all over," said Thomas H. Andrews, a former Democratic Congressman from Mr. Longley's district who, having been defeated by Ms. Snowe for Mr. Mitchell's seat, has decided to sit this year out. "No one is sure where it's going to end, maybe all the way down at the school board level."
Prof. Christian P. Potholm, who teaches government and legal studies at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Me., said, "The state tends to be moderate, but people here are personality-driven, not ideology- or party-driven."
But Senator Cohen's decision to leave Congress comes at a time that Maine voters appear particularly restless, even as Governor King says the state's economy, battered by the last recession, is improving. In 1994, Ms. Snowe and Mr. Longley succeeded Democrats; Mr. Baldacci won Ms. Snowe's House seat for the Democrats for first time in 24 years, and Mr. King succeeded a two-term Republican Governor, John R. McKernan Jr., who is Ms. Snowe's husband.
The 1994 results, and the voting record of people like Mrs. Foster, also reflect Mainers' general tendency to elect candidates they feel will not stray far from the center.
"There's a powerful middle in the state, and people like to exercise a kind of self-correcting mechanism," said Professor Potholm, adding that as many as 50 people have said they are considering a run for the three seats in Congress in the aftermath of Mr. Cohen's decision.
For now, many voters say the two Congressmen would become the instant front-runners for the Senate seat. But if centrist preferences continue, Mr. Baldacci might be better positioned to win.
As a moderate Democrat, he has supported the compromise budget proposed by the "Blue Dog" Democrats, term limits and tighter controls on lobbying. Mr. Longley, whose father was the state's first independent Governor in 1974, has become more of a partisan -- to the surprise of some state Republicans -- as a strong supporter of Speaker Newt Gingrich on most issues.
Even before Mr. Cohen's announcement, Democrats in the state had begun an aggressive campaign to unseat Mr. Longley with attack commercials and bumper stickers that read, "Longley Votes Wrongly."
With the election 10 months away, many voters say they will wait until the field is set before they decide whom to support for the various offices. Until then, little is certain, except, as Governor King said with a laugh: "This is going to be a great year for political consultants. I'm looking for a big boost in the state economy."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Address to Take Broad Tack

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
White House aides say President Clinton will use his State of the Union Message on Tuesday night to try to rise far above the bitter partisanship of the budget battle and summon the nation to meet the challenges of an "age of possibility" as it approaches the 21st century.
The White House acknowledges that the Republican-controlled Congress would not be sympathetic to a full legislative agenda from the Democratic President. And so, although Mr. Clinton is expected to renew his calls for a budget agreement, an increase in the minimum wage and campaign reform, much of his address at the start of this election year will be a philosophical one aimed largely at an audience beyond the halls of Congress. 
 Offering a taste of likely campaign themes, aides say, Mr. Clinton plans to emphasize that the economy is strong and that the nation has added nearly eight million jobs during his Presidency. But, mindful that many workers remain besieged by job insecurity and stagnant wages, he will call for broadening the base of America's economic well-being.
"The President will argue it's not always a government response that's required, it's not always a response that requires spending of taxpayers' money," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary. Instead, Mr. McCurry said, the President will speak of "challenges that must summon forth the best from the American people as we work together in our communities and our churches and our schools and our neighborhoods to improve the quality of life of all Americans."
Political analysts will be watching to see what kind of vision Mr. Clinton offers for a second term in office and what tone of leadership he adopts before a Congress intensely divided by the unresolved budget dispute.
"The State of the Union Message in an election year," said Stephen J. Wayne, a professor of government at Georgetown University, "should enhance the image the President is trying to project: an image of moderation, an image of reaching out, a very Presidential image. The best thing that could happen for Clinton would be for House Republicans to behave like kindergarteners."
Equally aware of the importance of image in this election year, the Republicans asked the major television networks to allow them a distinctly separate forum in which to offer their 30-minute response. Rather than replying immediately after the President's address, as has become the norm, the Republicans want television time on the following evening, Wednesday.
The networks said they would decide on the request by Monday, but by this afternoon one of them had already done so. ABC said it would provide time to the Republicans only on Tuesday night, because, said Eileen Murphy, a network spokeswoman, "that's where we feel the audience is best served."
Aides say that in addition to the economy, Mr. Clinton will most likely touch on social issues like crime, for instance sketching out aggressive new measures to drive drug dealers and gangs out of housing projects. And, building on steps taken by Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich to keep employers from dipping into their workers' assets in 401(k) plans, he is expected to announce new measures to protect pensions. He will also make several proposals intended to enhance the ability of individuals and communities to help themselves, and he may renew a campaign against teen pregnancy that was sidetracked last year with the failure of Dr. Henry Foster's nomination to be Surgeon General.
But much of the address is expected to take a broader, philosophical approach. Mr. Clinton himself has said that he spent his first two years in office behaving too much like a prime minister, too consumed with the details of policy-making and legislation and too little consumed with the Presidential tasks of addressing public values and helping to chart a moral course for the nation.
Now, with his role limited by the Republican ascendancy in Congress, he has been exploring many of the themes -- like the nation's need for the "common ground" that he has often cited of late -- to which he will turn in his State of the Union Message.
To prepare him for the speech, Mr. Clinton's aides solicited work from a vast array of thinkers ranging from the humorist Garrison Keillor to the scholar David Herbert Donald, who recently published a biography of Lincoln. The writing was gathered into a binder that was presented to Mr. Clinton to study before Christmas.
Earlier this month, the President had two White House dinners with political scientists, law professors and historians. Among them were intellectuals who have studied racial polarization, including Henry Louis Gates Jr. Other writers in the group have focused on the lack of civic participation in today's America: Alan Ehrenhalt, the author of "Discovering the Forgotten Virtues of Community in the Chicago of the 1950's," and Robert D. Putnam, a Harvard professor who has explored why Americans now bowl alone instead of in leagues.
"I think the subject of our discussion was whether it's possible to find in the real world a place where citizens' groups can work with government to solve problems," said Benjamin R. Barber, the Walt Whitman Professor of political science at Rutgers University, who attended one of the dinners. "What I liked best about it is I felt a genuine commitment to trying to envision a somewhat long-term horizon and what difference government can make in shaping the kind of country our children will live in."
After last year's address, Mr. Clinton was mocked by Republicans for its length: 81 minutes, a record for a State of the Union Message. Aides have vowed that he will be more concise in this year's speech, which begins at 9 P.M. "The White House," Mr. McCurry said, "fully expects him to be concluded by the time 'Nightline' is on."

HEADLINE: Winning by Losing on Trade

 BODY:
The newly created World Trade Organization issued its first major ruling last week, rendering a judgment against the United States. A judicial panel ruled that a provision in the Clean Air Act discriminates against foreign oil producers, violating trade rules. Contrary to a reflexive denunciation by Pat Buchanan, the Republican Presidential candidate who charged that the ruling threatens American sovereignty, the action shows that the trade organization is off to a good start. In the long run, the W.T.O. will greatly benefit Americans.
It is important to note that the W.T.O. ruled against only one part of the act and affirmed the right of the United States to protect its environment to any extent it wants, as long as the law does not favor domestic producers over foreign producers. The United States has fought hard for that principle because it protects American exporters. The panel ruled that a provision of the Clean Air Act forced foreign oil producers to temporarily meet higher pollution standards than their American counterparts. That judgment was reasonable. 
 The ruling does not force the United States to change its law. If it does not, Venezuela and Brazil, the complainants, would be free to retaliate with, for example, higher tariffs against United States exports. Americans have little to fear. No country relishes a fight with the biggest trading power in the world. Besides, the discriminatory provision expires in 1998, and it will take nearly that long to settle the case if the Administration decides to appeal the ruling, making the whole matter moot.
The ruling helps establish W.T.O. panels as deliberative judicial bodies willing and able to enforce rules of fair trade. That is beneficial to the United States, which brings more complaints to trade-dispute panels than any other country. Washington will win more than its share of cases in the years ahead. The W.T.O. has shown it can keep trading honest. That is a welcome development.

HEADLINE: 'Make No Little Plans'

 BODY:
In an era of shrinking resources and denigration of government, New Yorkers often forget that they enjoy some of the greatest transportation projects in American history, built at public expense. A defeatist attitude prevails about whether government will ever again try to construct anything like the great bridges, tunnels, canals and highways that have long supported the economies of the city and state. It turns out, however, that the resources for one more attempt to think big are there, if the will and imagination are there as well.
New York State is the beneficiary of a little-known $5 billion windfall from the Federal Government, payable in installments over a 15-year period. The money is to reimburse New York for construction of the New York State Thruway under Gov. Thomas Dewey. Back in the 1950's, Washington committed itself to the principle of reimbursement because the state's highway became a part of the Federal highway system. But not until 1992 did Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, get Congress to pass a measure redeeming the earlier commitment. 
 The first payment of about $300 million is coming this year, but it will be dribbled away without notice. Gov. George Pataki has folded the money into the state's overall program for routine maintenance of its bridges and highways. What a waste! These are substantial, uncommitted funds that New York may not see the likes of anytime soon. They should be set aside to build something worthy of past projects that could revitalize the state's economy.
Any number of projects come to mind. The long-discussed rail link to Kennedy Airport from midtown Manhattan is still being studied by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which could put up part of the money. Widening the highway accesses to the airport would increase its value as a hub for freight and passengers. Other projects might include two long pushed by Senator Moynihan: restoring Penn Station to its Beaux-Arts glory by relocating it in the old post office across the street, or reconstructing the Erie Canal and other upstate canals for tourism and recreation.
None of these projects will be realized if Albany continues its constricted view of the role of government. The Pataki administration argues that Mr. Moynihan's windfall is less than it seems, since overall Federal support for highway maintenance is declining. To be fair to the current Governor, it was actually Gov. Mario Cuomo and the Legislature that first determined in 1993 that initial installments of the $5 billion Thruway reimbursement should be used for routine upkeep of the existing system.
But it is Mr. Pataki's huge tax cuts that are now forcing the state to grab the Thruway reimbursement to cover routine expenses. He and the Legislature would do better to think more broadly about the concept of economic growth and realize that government can serve as a stimulus in ways other than cutting taxes.
Nearly a century ago, the great Chicago architect Daniel Burnham was quoted as saying: "Make no little plans! They have no magic to stir men's blood." His was an optimistic era that seems almost foreign today. But there is no reason for New Yorkers to feel that the days of imaginative and useful development ideas are behind them, especially when the money is there to bring them to life.

Heart Of Darkness

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia

 BODY:
I've been following America's U.N. Ambassador, Madeleine Albright, on a tour of the four major civil wars in Africa -- Liberia, Angola, Burundi and Rwanda. This column begins a diary of the trip.
I knew it was going to be a long day when the pilots of the tiny prop plane flying us from Abidjan to Liberia asked me to sign a form releasing the U.S. Government of any responsibility if we crashed. The main airport in once charming Monrovia has been closed by civil war, the pilot explained, and "there is no navigational equipment where we're landing so we may have to orbit for a while to find it." 
 The makeshift Monrovian airstrip was still littered with the carcasses of aircraft from a civil war that began in 1989 and has since left 150,000 Liberians dead and 1.2 million displaced -- out of a population of only 2.5 million people. The first tall building you see driving into town is the Foreign Ministry. It's completely gutted and squatters now occupy every floor, their laundry flapping in the morning breeze.
Liberia, which was founded by American slaves in 1847, is a country in meltdown. It is in the grip of a clique of evil warlords and teen-age gunmen, who rampage the countryside, high on drugs or drunk on moonshine made from sugar cane, where they routinely murder civilians with machetes. It is an African "Clockwork Orange" in which militias don't even pretend to stand for anything other than looting villagers of all they own. Indeed, the militias rarely fight each other. They fight the people. The six-man ruling council, which supposedly runs the country, is made up of three warlords, two political figures and one powerless man whose title is "Representative of the Civilians." Each of the warlords has his own floor in the executive palace, and each also controls ministries and is in private business. Prince Johnson, the warlord who is said to have killed the country's last president, Samuel Doe, by slicing off his ears, used to pass out a business card that said: "Prince Johnson, Building, Construction and Home Repairs."
On the day before we arrived, the Minister of Rural Affairs, Roosevelt Johnson, launched his militia on a terror campaign in northern Liberia. He was allegedly running a scam stealing diamonds there, with the help of a Nigerian peacekeeping unit. The Nigerians, though, changed units and their new commander wouldn't play along, so the "Minister of Rural Affairs" started ransacking rural Liberia, upsetting the African-brokered peace plan, which was supposed to begin Jan. 15 with the militias turning in weapons.
Ms. Albright came to shore up the Nigerian peacekeepers and to browbeat the militia leaders into getting back to the peace plan. Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah, two of the ruling warlords, are eager to be interviewed by CNN and myself. While children with distended bellies haunt the streets, these two look as if they have not missed a meal. Their watches are gold, their shoes brightly polished, their offices cool with air-conditioning. They are peacocks strutting through the graveyard, killers with fax machines. Sitting on his pink divan, Mr. Kromah waxes optimistic: "A new Liberia is being born," he says. "We are developing a Renaissance." I leave thinking he is out of his mind.
There is Bosnia envy here. Gen. J. M. Inieger, commander of the Nigerian peacekeepers, says the only way to heal Liberia is for Nigerian forces to occupy the whole country. (Right now large areas outside the cities remain under militia control.)
But that would mean Nigeria increasing its force from 7,000 to 18,000 men, which would require $135 million. "It is what NATO spends in a few days in Bosnia," complains General Inieger. But no one wants to pay for peacekeeping in Liberia. "It is because we are Africans, not Europeans," says Liberian newspaper publisher Sando Moore. "People say, 'They are Africans; let them just kill each other.' "
No, Liberia is a country that will have to liberate itself. We can apply the Band-Aids to reduce the suffering, and we should. But as long as the innocent civilians have only one seat in the ruling council, any major funds poured in here will never get to the people who truly need them. As one U.S. relief worker whispered to me as we left: "I never hear any patriotism here. It's always: 'What are you going to do for me?' The people here have to reclaim their country. They just have to start all over."

HEADLINE: Gay Images, Once Kept Out, Are Out Big Time

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
WITH nearly 32 million acquaintances in attendance, Carol and Susan, two lesbian characters, were married on Thursday on the NBC comedy "Friends." The presiding minister was played by Candace Gingrich, whose brother presides over the House of Representatives.
During any other television season, it would have been the same-sex wedding of the year. This season, it was more like the same-sex wedding of the month. 
 In December, the gay characters Leon and Scott were married on "Roseanne" on ABC. And only two weeks ago, on the NBC comedy "Mad About You," the main character's sister, Debbie, professed her love for Joan. So it is not hard to imagine more commitment-ceremony bells in the future.
A same-sex wedding might have provoked rebellion among network affiliates not too many years ago, but NBC reported that only two -- KJAC in Port Arthur, Tex., and WLIO in Lima, Ohio -- had decided that the "Friends" episode was "not appropriate" for their viewers. On the other hand, 212 affiliates chose to broadcast the segment.
In other words, the biggest news about the wedding on "Friends" was that it was almost not news at all. Lesbian and gay figures are becoming commonplace in mainstream media. And established institutions are growing less timid in courting gay and lesbian audiences.
"This has created discussions in families during prime-time viewing that families weren't having in the 1980's," said Grant Lukenbill, author of "Untold Millions: Positioning Your Business for the Gay and Lesbian Consumer Revolution" (Harper Business, 1995). "It's breaking down stereotypes. The more people are forced to look at what gay and lesbian culture is like, the more they see what we have in common."
The increase in gay and lesbian images may have resulted more from the canny recognition that homosexuals are a powerful part of the marketplace than from a growing belief that they are integral members of the American family.
But the phenomenon itself is beyond dispute.
"We're in the golden era of gay and lesbian visibility," Mr. Lukenbill said. "There's never been a time in history that gay and lesbian people have had this level of exposure in mainstream society. It's reverberating through the Western world."
His assertion is not as hyperbolic as it may sound. After all, it was not a gay magazine that proclaimed, "Let them wed," in mid-January, emphasizing its editorial support of same-sex unions with a cover picture of a tiered white cake topped by two plastic grooms, hand in hand. It was the 152-year-old Economist of London.
Bill Emmott, the magazine's editor, said in a telephone interview that the letters and E-mail received had run roughly 3 to 1 against the magazine, matching both in volume and proportion the negative response to a cover story urging abolition of the monarchy.
"If there was a surprise," Mr. Emmott said, "it was that the hostile letters were quite reasonable. They were not abusive or offensive. And small mercy though that may sound, actually I think it represents something of a change."
Even the Los Angeles Police Department, which was famously antagonistic toward homosexuals, has used a deeply tanned, chisel-faced model in a wet suit to convey its recruitment message to readers of a gay magazine called Urban Fitness. "Not All Our Officers Wear the Same Uniform," the full-color advertisement proclaimed.
Numerous candidates have responded, said Lisa Phillips, whose title at the department is liaison to the gay and lesbian community. There is no way to say exactly how many, since it would be illegal to ask recruits about their sexual orientation, but Officer Phillips said the campaign was "very successful."
Macy's seemed to invite the attention of gay customers in a holiday catalogue of men's wear. It included a picture of two men, one bare-chested, exchanging presents and affectionate smiles. They could have been brothers. But they could just as easily have been companions sharing their Christmas morning.
Nothing explicitly gay was intended, but neither did the store object to conveying a sense that gay shoppers were as welcome as anyone else. "If that's the way you're interpreting it, I can say, 'Thank you and continue to shop at Macy's,' " said Ronnie Taffet, vice president for public relations for Macy's East Coast stores.
Abercrombie & Fitch, another venerable name in retailing, borrowed a fig leaf from Calvin Klein with a two-page advertisment in the December issue of Vanity Fair. It depicted eight football players in a locker-room tableau, three clad in nothing but Abercrombie briefs. The store, a division of the Limited, has also advertised in Out, a gay and lesbian magazine, with shirtless, sinewy fellows wrestling over a basketball.
"We don't segment our thinking about the universe of our customers," the company said in a statement. "Each and every Abercrombie customer is an individual, and our strategy is to provoke a personal reaction in him or her that will lead to greater awareness of our brand."
Or as Mr. Lukenbill put it, "Capitalism thrives off the shrewd use of attractive imagery."
And it is capitalism that may explain growing visibility in a hostile political climate. "While we've got a Congress that does not seem to embrace who we are, the megamillions of the gay market are not being ignored," said Joseph Cohen, author of "You Know You're Gay When . . ." (Contemporary Books, 1995).
Searching for that market, Tanqueray's "Mr. Jenkins" has ventured into a gay bar and sent a gin and tonic over to a "glamour girl," although he "admits she is rather burly for a glamour girl." More daringly, Diesel Jeans and Workwear has recently shown two luminously pretty nurses with their lips only inches away from a kiss.
Physical intimacy is where most television shows draw the line. "There is still a failure to capture the wholeness of what it means to be gay or lesbian," said Lorri L. Jean, executive director of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center.
Yet, she noted that the range of characters on television had grown appreciably wider. "You don't just have the ice-pick lesbian murderer," Ms. Jean said. "You have the lesbian lovers on 'Friends,' one of whom is the ex-wife of a primary character."
The ex-wife, Carol (Jane Sibbett), was married on Thursday to her new partner, Susan (Jessica Hecht). Performing as the minister was Ms. Gingrich, who heads the voter mobilization project of the Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian and gay political organization in Washington.
Appearances by homosexual characters on network television used to be the topic of conversation for weeks in advance. Now, they turn up so often that even well-informed advocates can lose track. For instance, Ms. Gingrich did not know until she saw the show that Debbie Buchman (Robin Bartlett) of "Mad About You" was about to come out to her television family.
"It's not an event anymore," Ms. Gingrich said. "It's commonplace. It's supposed to be something you could see anywhere. Gays and lesbians are part of the work force. We have relationships. We have commitment ceremonies. When you watch television, you want to see America reflected back. Having gay characters is an accurate way to do that."
As the minister, Ms. Gingrich declared that "nothing makes God happier than when two people -- any two people -- come together in love." But she was not heard to say, "You may kiss the bride." To either one.

THE MARKET
Sponginess in Technology Gets Wrung Out
"Past performance is no guarantee of future results" is a caveat to investors that ripples through mutual-fund advertisements and prospectuses. It seemed to carry less weight on Wall Street last week, as strong earnings -- a backward indicator -- from I.B.M., Microsoft and Caterpillar sparked another rally in the stock market. The rally came despite some skepticism that I.B.M. could continue its growth and amid reports that sales of Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system were lagging -- and even though Intel, the dominant chip maker for personal computers, and Apple Computer reported disappointing earnings and a loss, respectively.
 
THE FED
Vice Chairman Stands Down
Scarcely a day has passed recently without some indicator showing the economy is slowing. Now, his advice to cut interest rates in order to stimulate growth largely resisted, Alan S. Blinder, has resigned after 19 months as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Blinder was President Clinton's first appointee at the Fed, and until the Republicans gained control of Congress he had been regarded as a possible successor to the chairman, Alan Greenspan. He plans to return to Princeton.
 
JUNK BONDS
Fidelity Bails Out
After dominating high-profile bankruptcies like those of Federated Department Stores and R. H. Macy, Fidelity Investments abruptly announced that it was "discontinuing its aggressive style" of investing in insolvent companies. It also said three key members of its bankruptcy investing team had resigned. A Fidelity spokesman said the funds did not want to play a governance role in reorganizations.
 
TAXES
The Kemp Panel Punts
A private commission, created by Republican leaders and headed by Jack Kemp, recommended that the wages and salaries of all Americans be taxed at a single low rate. But the flat-tax proposal made no mention of the key issues: what the rate would be, whose taxes would change how much, and whether home-mortgage interest deductions would be preserved. Republican Presidential candidates continue to offer competing flat-tax plans, denying the party a unified point it can rally around.
 
DEPARTURES
Viacom Ousts Chief
In 1994, Viacom gave Frank J. Biondi Jr., its chief executive, a $3 million bonus for his role in the acquisition of Paramount Communications. Last week, it gave him a pink slip. Sumner M. Redstone, the 72-year-old billionaire chairman, said he would add the chief executive's duties. Mr. Biondi's dismissal was necessary, Mr. Redstone said, because Viacom needed more aggressive leadership after its acquisition of Paramount and Blockbuster Entertainment.
 
TRADE
Fuel for the Republicans
In a decision that will resound through the election year, the World Trade Organization found that the Clean Air Act discriminates against foreign oil companies and ordered the United States to change its rules. Bob Dole, Pat Buchanan and many other Republicans have been warning that American participation in the W.T.O. would allow foreign judges to rule on the validity of American laws.
 
OVERHAULS
An Agribusiness Giant Adjusts
The directors of Archer-Daniels-Midland unanimously approved a series of measures that would turn majority control of the board over to a group of outside directors -- but no sooner than October. For more than a year, the company has been criticized by some investors, who said it was dominated by insiders even as it was being investigated after accusations of price-fixing and corruption. Some large investors promptly said the changes did not go far enough.
 
COMPROMISES
Pataki Finds a Path
In a rare arrangement that pleased environmentalists, landowners and paper and timber companies, Gov. George E. Pataki of New York found a way for people whose land in the Adirondack Park was damaged by a windstorm in July to clear their land without making enemies. Under his compromise, state foresters will inspect proposed salvage sites in the wetlands, and clear-cutting is forbidden on steep slopes.
 
CRISIS MANAGEMENT
Responding to the Storms
Some employers forced workers to use vacation days if the snow kept them away from work; others knee-jerked away a day's pay. Not so the New York Stock Exchange, which decided to open for three hours on Monday, Jan. 8, despite the blizzard and the snow emergency declared by the Government. Every worker who slogged through the drifts to the Big Board has been rewarded with a choice of an extra day's pay or an extra day off. Those who did not make it in simply missed out on the bonus.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
How a Flat Tax Would Work, For You and for Them

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
The big issue in these first weeks of the 1996 Presidential campaign has been how Americans should tax themselves. And most of the talk is about a flat tax on incomes, with a large deduction for individuals so that lower-income people would pay no income tax.
There are about as many flat tax variants floating around as there are would-be occupants of the White House. But all derive from "The Flat Tax" (Hoover Institition Press, 1995), by Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka, both economists at the Hoover Institution, who devised the concept in 1981 and have been refining it ever since. 
 The two economists say their proposed tax, which would be 19 percent, would spur investment and growth by taxing income only once, eliminating taxes on capital gains and taxing individuals only on wages, salaries and pensions. Interest and dividends would not be taxed directly, but would be affected by a business tax, also at 19 percent. (Businesses would no longer be able to deduct the cost of fringe benefits, except pensions, for their employees, however.)
So how would a flat tax affect the typical family? And how would it affect the tax bills of the Presidential candidates who have pushed the issue to center stage?
The New York Times recalculated the taxes that some of the major candidates would have owed in 1994 had a flat tax been in effect that year, consulting with the Republican candidates' advisers and making minor adjustments to eliminate anomalies in the complex tax returns that are irrelevant to a flat tax.
The two candidates most closely identified with the flat tax -- Steve Forbes, the magazine owner, and Patrick J. Buchanan, the television commentator -- would not make their tax returns available. Mr. Forbes said he would never disclose his returns; Mr. Buchanan said he would make his public if he wins the Republican nomination.
President Clinton and three prominent Republican candidates -- Senators Bob Dole and Phil Gramm and Lamar Alexander, the former Education Secretary -- made available copies of their 1994 Federal income tax returns. (Mr. Clinton opposes the flat tax, as does Mr. Alexander. Mr. Dole has said he would go along with a flat tax. Mr. Gramm favors a 16 percent flat tax.)
All four candidates, whose incomes place them among the top 1 percent of Americans in terms of personal income, would enjoy considerable savings in personal income taxes under the Hall-Rabushka flat tax. A comparison also requires calculating the effect of the Hall-Rabushka business tax on business income, but even with both taxes, all four candidates would see their tax bills decline -- although probably none would save as much as Mr. Forbes, a fervent flat-tax advocate who is one of the wealthiest men in the United States.
Senator Dole and his wife, who had $607,000 in income in 1994, would save about $49,000, and the Clintons, whose income was $267,000, would save about $21,000.
Senator Gramm, who with his wife reported $305,000 in income, would save about $40,000; his aides acknowledged that under his own proposal, which differs considerably from the others, the Senator's taxes would decline even more sharply.
Mr. Alexander's savings would be about $184,000 on an income of about $1 million. The savings would presumably be significantly greater for Mr. Forbes, who has an income of $1.4 million as chief executive officer of Forbes Inc. and a net worth that Fortune magazine last week estimated at $439 million.
The picture is not so bright for the Smiths, a hypothetical family of four used by the Tax Foundation in its analyses of the various flat-tax plans floating around Washington. The Smiths, who have $50,000 in total income, nearly all from wages, would see no change in their individual tax bill if the Hall-Rabushka proposal were put into effect. And if interest rates decline as predicted, the Smiths, who collected $1,425 in interest in 1994, would come out a few dollars behind.

Community Consensus for the Navy Yard: Yes on Housing, No on Trash

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
The Brooklyn Navy Yard has long dominated life in Northern Brooklyn, from the days when thousands built warships to the recent battles over a city plan to build a huge incinerator there. The Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation recently received $739,000 from the Mayor's Office to assess the state of the 260-acre plot and figure out how to attract more jobs and businesses to the industrial park. Last week, community leaders discussed what they think should be done with the Navy Yard. SOMINI SENGUPTA
 
Luis Garden Acosta, president of El Puente, a community organization in Williamsburg:
"We have always had a dream of building a bridge between the Latino and Hasidic communities by founding a unity housing community in the Brooklyn Navy Yard so that Latinos, the Hasidim, African-Americans and others in the Williamsburg community could live equally and in peace. At one point there were officers' quarters in the Navy Yard. All that could be razed to create a wonderful landscape for affordable residential housing."
 
 City Councilman Kenneth K. Fisher, who represents Williamsburg and surrounding communities.
"First of all, they shouldn't build an incinerator there. Secondly, there's the industrial park portion of the Navy Yard, and that is today a wonderful resource for the city that's been neglected in past. Today, it successfully houses many small businesses and employs a lot of people. It's an example of how to re-use obsolete military facilities. The third component is what I call the campus -- the officers' quarters, the hospital building, the surgeon general's house and a lot of open space. It's 40-some odd acres. I feel strongly that the campus should be part of an overall development strategy for the adjacent neighborhoods. Maybe you could move something from Williamsburg and make room for housing."
 
The Rev. Mark V. C. Taylor, Church of the Open Door in Fort Greene.
"Some of the money should definitely go into a study of a recycling alternative, to build a recycling plant as an alternative to an incinerator and something that leads to job development. After we talk about cleaning up the Navy Yard and looking at recycling, we need to talk about economic development. I think the city has to look at the opportunity and the responsibility of providing jobs for residents of the surrounding public housing."
 
 Rabbi David Niederman, executive director of United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg and a member of the board of directors of the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation.
"The community's foremost interest, of course, is housing. The question is, is that suitable or not? We know it has been a dump site for so many toxic elements that part of it had to be put on the Superfund list. As for institutional use, it might be health care, might be education, it could be training and vocational programs that are very much needed in the community. We are also looking for small businesses. One thing we don't want to do is to relocate something that won't bring jobs to the community. If a major manufacturer comes and just relocates his crew, that's not beneficial to the community."

HEADLINE: The 104th Congress at Midpoint: Where Its Major Legislation Stands;
AGRICULTURE

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

 BODY:
The elections of 1994 transformed the Congress, giving Republicans control of both House and Senate for the first time since 1955. As the second session of the 104th Congress begins, here is a look at the progress of major legislative initiatives.
Republicans promised drastic cuts in farm subsidies under the complex programs dating to the Depression. Economists deride as inefficient these subsidies that pay farmers not to plant some fields, lend money to plant other fields and underwrite farmers when crop prices are low. But the payments are popular among farmers and the Congressmen who represent them -- a third of the Republican Party's House and Senate members. 
 Republicans radically revised farm subsidies to make American agriculture more sensitive to consumers' needs while continuing the flow of Government checks to large-scale private and corporate farms in the next seven years.
The plan, which is part of the budget bill, would replace most existing subsidies with an annual payment to farmers equal to most of the money they are receiving under various programs now. The payments would be made regardless of what crops the farmers planted or whether they left their fields fallow.
Clinton Administration officials and prairie populists in Congress criticized the plan because it would not limit the size of payments to large farms and would not provide any increase in payments if prices were low. KEITH BRADSHER

HEADLINE: Of Renters, Artists and Plumbers;
Don't Pick On Us Renters; We Make the City Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Robert Lipsyte's Jan. 14 Coping column, "My Neighbor and His Renter's Sensibility," implies that tenants are lazy freeloaders who don't have a "sense of community" equal to that of owners like him. 
 This reminds me of the bitter battle during the late 1970's and early 80's in Boerum Hill when gentrification was displacing thousands of working-poor tenants who had lived there for decades. A group of tenants, including me, were trying to get approval to build a small low- and moderate-income housing project on an urban renewal site so that some of us could afford to stay. The new homeowners opposed us, worried that the project would depress their property values.
At one heated meeting, I -- then a 14-year Boerum Hill tenant -- stood up to speak. I was shouted down by a neighbor. "What do you care about the community?" she said. "You don't own a house."
Before the real estate boom of the 1980's, New York was a city of renters. We who can't afford to buy have always nurtured and protected New York's communities. For this we get no tax breaks, no equity, no rental income. Neither as citizens nor as consumers do tenants "take and run," as Mr. Lipsyte puts it. In fact, as he might remember from his own pre-ownership years, for services such as snow shoveling and hall sweeping we pay rent.

HEADLINE: China's Dam Project Must Go Forward

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Woe to Those Displaced by China Dam Project" (letter, Jan. 19) and your Jan. 15 front-page article on the Three Gorges Dam project: 
 The two photographs of construction activities that you published on Jan. 15 indicate that excellent progress has been made in only a year's time.
All such projects face large problems, and those you cite -- resettlement and waste disposal -- should not kill the project.
Resettlement of a million people means that complaints are to be expected. And the problem of waste disposal must be solved regardless of whether or not the project is completed.
The idea for the Three Gorges Dam project originated in 1919 with Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Chinese Republic. Many feasibility studies have been made with participation of foreign experts.
In 1946 the United States Government showed great interest by allowing 50 Chinese engineers to visit the United States Bureau of Reclamation to study technology for project implementation.
For the United States to decline assistance to the project because of environmental and human rights concerns would put our Government at odds with the private sector of contractors and manufacturers and would serve to discourage them from competing with the Europeans and Japanese in China's fast-growing market.
China needs this project to provide a large block of energy to sustain rapid economic development, and to control the floods that have killed thousands of people and displaced millions.
Project costs may well reach $30 billion, but stretched over 15 years the cost and challenge will not cause a crack in the dam.

HEADLINE: Flat Tax Won't Make Us a Nation of Savers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "A Flawed Flat Tax and the Way Out" (Op-Ed, Jan. 17): 
 Ordinarily, I would let pass Patrick J. Buchanan's implication that I favor a flat tax. I am sorry to disappoint him and to remove an arrow from his quiver of populist proposals, but I also have strong reservations about the various flat tax proposals, at least as they are currently structured.
Actually, I agree with some, although not all, of Mr. Buchanan's points of opposition to the flat tax. My principal reservations derive from concerns about a basic issue he ignores completely.
All Americans face a common problem.
Our national savings rates is remarkably -- some would say disastrously -- low, and our economic productivity has suffered as a consequence.
To rectify this condition, we need a tax system that, in addition to operating in a fair manner, will both reward savings and stimulate growth in productivity.
A national value-added tax would deal with this fundamental economic problem most effectively by bringing into better balance the imperative to save with the compulsion to spend. A value added tax would also relieve many of us from the exceptionally high burdens now borne exclusively by the income tax. Combined with other reforms of the tax system, a value added tax would offer a more efficient and equitable way out of our dilemma than the hodgepodge of proposals advanced by Mr. Buchanan.

HEADLINE: Flat Tax Won't Make Us a Nation of Savers;
Penalties Abound

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Republican flat tax proposals would have inequitable consequences. 
 Elimination of the residential property tax deduction would affect every homeowner by reducing the market value of property as well as frequently raising taxable income. In many instances property taxes are higher than mortgage interest, and mortgage interest declines as the loan is repaid, while property taxes almost always rise.
The elimination of the tax deduction of state and local income taxes would have a penalizing effect. Residents of states like Texas pay no income taxes, and those living in low-tax states would suffer little. Others in places like New York City who pay substantial state and local income taxes would be punished more.
The proposal to make interest income nontaxable is a time bomb that would neutralize the tax advantage now enjoyed by municipal bond holders. It would force state and local governments to increase the interest rates paid to attract investors.
All taxpayers would have to pay even higher state and local taxes to make up for the additional interest to be paid.

HEADLINE: The View From: Hamden;
Does a Green or a Golf Course Better Suit the Middle of Town?

BYLINE: By MELINDA TUHUS 

 BODY:
LILLIAN CLAYMAN, the Mayor of Hamden, has found a solution to what she and other residents describe as a problem: the lack of a town green. She has proposed converting the centrally situated Meadowbrook golf course into one.
Hamden is almost the only town in south central Connecticut, and probably one of the few in all of New England, that has no green to serve as the focus of community life. Mayor Clayman would like to see the 67-acre town-owned golf course, across from Town Hall and adjacent to Hamden's main library and auditorium and the Miller Senior Center, become that focus. 
 To that end, she decided not to renew the contract for the lease on the golf course when it expires on March 31. She has enlisted the Hamden Arts Commission and the town's Parks and Recreation Commission, along with the head of the Department of Parks and Recreation, to come up with a plan for the space. They, along with the Hamden Historical Society and the Hamden Farmington Canal Commission, called a meeting early this month to get public input.
At that meeting, as well as at a previous meeting of the town's Legislative Council in December, golfers voiced their extreme displeasure with recent developments.
They invoked economic, esthetic, athletic and democratic arguments to make their case: namely, that Meadowbrook, as administered by an outside vendor for 30 years, has been a revenue producer for the town; that the town already does a poor job of upkeep on the other parks it administers; that the humble nine-hole golf course provided many Hamden residents -- particularly elderly people and youngsters -- with healthful and very affordable exercise, and that the decision to convert the course into a green was made without a formal public hearing.
To these arguments the Mayor has responded that the $15,000 a year the contract contributed to town coffers until 1992, and the $30,000 a year it has brought in since then, represent an "insignificant" part of the $104 million annual town budget.
She added that the investment required to upgrade the course enough to justify doubling lease revenue again would be economically unfeasible. She disagreed with the claim that existing town parks are not maintained.
Even though she is a golfer herself, the Mayor believes the town residents who have used Meadowbrook as a golf course represent "a select few" compared to the numbers who would make use of it as a public green. Ms. Clayman said it's the Mayor's prerogative not to renew such leases, and that people have had plenty of opportunities to make their views known. There will be more opportunities to do so as plans go along, she said.
Meadowbrook was a dairy farm owned by H. Irving Todd; it was bought in 1920 by the Meadowbrook Realty Corporation for a golf course, according to a 1962 report quoted by the town's director of Parks and Recreation, Stephen J. Humes. The old cow barn became the first clubhouse. The land was bought by the town in 1962 with a $375,000 bond issue.
The report says that "during the period of the development of Meadowbrook, active effort should be made by the town officials to obtain a new location, while open spaces are available at reasonable cost, to begin construction of a golf course in anticipation of the day when Meadowbrook is given over as a Civic Center of Hamden." Subsequently, the town's full-scale golf course at Laurel View was built.
Mr. Humes said interested parties are beginning to consider the possibilities for the Meadowbrook land. One is to shift a portion of the Farmington Canal Greenway to the east, so that it runs along the border of Meadowbrook rather than through the middle of a shopping center parking lot.
Mr. Humes said such a route would save significant money on the Greenway project, which is scheduled to run the length of Hamden into neighboring New Haven and Cheshire, and result in a more scenic trail.
Another idea is to move a 150-year-old barn from the lot of a nearby hardware store to Meadowbrook property for use as an arts and recreational space. The hardware store wants the land for expansion, and the Hamden Historical Society is interested in acquiring the barn for the price of moving it.
Future golfing options at Meadowbrook include a Par Three executive course, a nine-hole Chip 'n' Putt, or miniature golf, Mr. Humes said.
Once the lease expires, the golf course land will revert to town management. Mr. Humes said his department will then fill in the nine holes, secure the clubhouse and maintain the property. He added that the town may set up temporary soccer fields on the site.
At this month's meeting, Daniel Kops, the town planner, explained that a permit from the Planning and Zoning Commission would be needed to make any changes to Meadowbrook once it ceases to be a golf course. Approval is also required from the town's Conservation Commission, since there are wetlands on the property. Finally, any changes must be approved by the town's Legislative Council. Public comment would be invited at all stages.
Golfers have made specific suggestions to try to save Meadowbrook. Michael Albis said, "If the main purpose of a green is to provide space for concerts and other special events, that could still happen while leaving the golf course intact," he said. Furthermore, he noted, "Many towns have a central green, but how many have a centrally located golf course?"
Another golfer, John McGlynn, asked if people were aware of the heritage of Meadowbrook. "Sam Snead even played here at one time," he said. He urged the town to create a "modified green" around the veterans' monument at one end of Meadowbrook.
Several golfers felt that creating a green in the middle of town would lead to an increase in crime or the creation of a wasteland no one would use.
To these objections, the Mayor responded that the land around the veterans' monument is much too small, and that not everyone loves a central golf course.
"Over the four years I've been Mayor," says Ms. Clayman, "people have asked me, 'Why don't we have a green?' I agree with them. I think we should have one." She also said that people who live at Meadowbrook -- a housing development that occupies what used to be the back 9 holes of the formerly 18-hole golf course -- "are sick and tired of having a golf course out their window."
"I told them to be patient," she said, "that I wouldn't renew the contract this year."
Tom Duffy, chairman of the Hamden Arts Commission, solicited volunteers for a task force to explore ideas for the future use of the land. About 40 people signed up.
"I hope this will be a fun process," said Mr. Duffy. "It's a tremendous opportunity; anything could go in that space. Nothing has been decided except that the contract to run Meadowbrook ends on March 31. This is so complicated and will take so long that I'm not sure anybody can say what will happen. No person, regardless of position, could say today with absolute certainty what will be there" when the process is completed.

HEADLINE: ART;
No Simple Innocence, Childhood Now Invoked Has More in Tow

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

 BODY:
MANY who track the shifting enthusiasms of the contemporary art world have noted that childhood is now much in vogue. It's not unalloyed innocence, but rather a convenient area in which to channel the discomfort and anxiety that have marked contemporary art for the last several seasons. Sometimes there is irony, but frequently the art in this vein is more childish than childlike.
These conflicts are present in the exhibition "Playtime: Artists and Toys" at the Whitney Museum in Stamford. But it turns out to be a strong show, in part because the curators -- Jennifer Gauthier, Angela Kramer Murphy and Cynthia Roznoy, all members of the satellite museum's staff -- have buttressed the latest work with relevant pieces that stretch back in art history. 
 The immediate impetus for the show was Alexander Calder's "Circus" (from 1926-31) being temporarily dismantled at the Whitney Museum in Manhattan. The show includes parts of it accompanied by a fetching videotape of Calder taking about his creation.
Other venerable works in the exhibition are photographs for "The First Picture Book: Everyday Things for Babies" by Edward Steichen (1930), and a bronze model from the 1960's for the Riverside Drive Playground by the sculptor Isamu Noguchi.
Part and parcel of the Surrealist movement was the impulse to play games, and the show has good representation by American Surrealists, including Joseph Cornell whose "Memoires inedits de Madame la Comtesse de G." is a small tin filled with strips on which are random words. Putting disparate words together was a favorite Surrealist pastime.
Man Ray, Ruth Bernhard and Val Telberg are other early Surrealist contributors.
The best of the contemporary work has its roots in Surrealism. Vija Celmins's small house is decorated with Magritte-like clouds on its facade, but a blazing fire is painted on its roof.
Some of the new work has an apparitional quality. Michael Ballou's enormous "Big Hand Puppet," for example, lies supine in the middle of the gallery. Jane Hammond's "Clown Suit" has the usual pointy hat and pom-poms for buttons, but it is decorated half with familiar cartoon characters and half with esoteric symbols that might come from tarot cards.
One of the most intriguing new artists is Tony Oursler, because his sculptures are at once obvious and mysteriously absorbing. He makes rag dolls with featureless heads and puts them in compromising situations. His small "Crying Doll" is hung on a pole. On the head is projected a videotape, a human face going through histrionics. Part of the torment of the "Crying Doll" is that the small video projector is as big as he is, very visible, and it never lets him escape surveillance. This work encapsulates the dark undercurrents ubiquitous in "Playtime."
Of course some of the art world's best-known enfants terribles populate the exhibition. Much critical ink has been spilled on Mike Kelley, claiming to find deep existential and psychological depth, as well as a pointed critique of contemporary art in general, in his massings of stuffed toys on blankets. Such meaning doesn't come through in "More Love Hours Than Can Ever Be Repaid," hung like a tapestry on the wall, or "The Wages of Sin," a tower of melting wax candles shaped like childhood icons like Frosty the Snowman.
Nicole Eisenman is another provocateur, but her work in the show -- race cars made from commercial packaging -- is rather tame. Some are economy models, including one made from a box that once held Glad bags, but there is also one fashioned from a blue Tiffany box.
Kim Dingle's work is always horrific: Her dolls are preternaturally adult-like. Her "Priss," exhibited in a crib filled with worn-out toys and empty tuna fish cans, is like the feared substitute teacher of cliche. Ms. Dingle also paints over wallpaper, mixing some of her looming, fat babies with innocent vignettes from an idealized childhood.
One of the healthiest pieces in the show is Chris MacDonald's train of oak, pine, cedar and steel that runs the length of one of the gallery's side corridors.
Complementing the photographs from the Surrealist era is contemporary photography with childhood as a subject. David Levinthal and Laurie Simmons are both expert at photographing toys to resemble altered versions of reality. Sally Mann is sometimes accused of manipulating her own children as if they were dolls. In some non-controversial images, including "The New Mothers," the children lampoon grown-ups. Bleary watercolors by Ellen Phelan have the look of nostalgic photographs. The best of the photographers is the redoubtable Cindy Sherman with her chilling illustrations for a tale by the Brothers Grimm.
This is a big show; bite-size contributions by Chris Burden, Red Grooms and Claes Oldenburg seem extraneous. But a CD-ROM game that viewers are invited to play, devised by Laurie Anderson and Hsin-Chien Huang, is right on the money. Such games are today's form of play, disquieting as that can sometimes be. Any exhibition running from Alexander Calder to Laurie Anderson has, at the very least, the potential for recapitulating the cultural history of this century.
"Playtime: Artists and Toys" is at the Whitney Museum of American Art in Stamford through March 20.

Scenes From Photojournalism's Post-Golden Age

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR 

DATELINE: SOMERS

 BODY:
HAVING begun with a storm that was nothing if not a photo opportunity, the year turns out to be the 60th anniversary of Black Star Agency and Life Magazine. The first represents photographers who seize such opportunities, the second made its name by publishing the results, week after week.
Together, these organizations presided over the golden age of photojournalism in the United States, which ended a quarter of a century ago with the metamorphosis of Life into a monthly, the death of its rival, Look, the transcendence of television and other manifestations of progress. 
 A show celebrating the dual anniversary would properly cover the period, but "Cycle of Voices," a roundup of photojournalists at Nardin Galleries here, does no such thing. And the reason soon becomes obvious: the show is an advertisement for Black Star as a going concern and, as such, looks forward rather than back. Besides, the guest curator, Richard Falco, is a Black Star photographer and, as explained in his introduction, he means to showcase a profession that for various reasons -- most of them economic -- grows increasingly difficult to practice.
Mr. Falco acknowledges Eugene Smith as the perceived "Father of Photojournalism" by including his early 1970's picture of a Japanese woman bathing a deformed child. This comes from the "Minimata" series documenting the effect of mercury poisoning in the Japanese town of Minimata -- the photographer's last assignment for Life.
The curator also incorporates shots by Charles Moore of the civil rights struggle in Alabama, notably one that features an immaculate Martin Luther King Jr. getting his comeuppance in a police station as his wife looks on. The scene is so stiff as to seem like a re-enactment. Otherwise, the miscellany consists of pictures taken during the last decade by a new generation of photojournalists.
The Berlin wall, South Africa, Haiti, Rwanda, the Kurds on the Turkish-Iraqi border, the Palestinian uprising in Israel, the civil war in the Republic of Georgia: The period has lacked neither disasters nor the photographers to document them. There are more than 65 prints on view, all of them serviceable but few of them unforgettable.
This could have to do with the prettifying effect of photographic color, but it may also be that the great shots of these subjects have already been circulated. One example of an act impossible to follow was the picture of a waterfall clogged with bodies, which, taken by a photographer whose name I have forgotten, said all there was to be said about the horror in Rwanda.
Another was Librado Romero's shot of the devastated Federal Building in Oklahoma City under a half moon, a composition worthy of the great Surrealist Max Ernst. Though it has nothing to equal these pictures, the show is not without memorable works, chief among which is Malcolm Linton's color print of a soldier, alone in a Georgian museum that has been sacked. He stands on a floor sprinkled with rubble, surveying the presumed remains of the museum's painting collection, which is stacked against the wall, neatly but sometimes upside down.
More affecting, though, is Christopher Morris's rendering of a summary execution performed in Haiti during the riots of 1994. The victim lies in an empty room, back against a door and hands up to his face as the executioner takes aim from a window on the side. Mr. Morris is also responsible for the scene of a soldier standing over the prone body of a Haitian in the street. This is a tricky picture, for while no handcuffs are visible, the angle of the victim's arms implies their presence, and there is no telling if the photographer took the picture at a dramatic angle or merely mounted it that way.
Photojournalism is a medium fraught with ambiguities, and Joseph Rodriguez provides a classic example in his view of a Harlem interior, furnished by a bookcase stuffed with record albums and, on one wall, a poster advertising the art collections at Amherst College. There is a child yelling in the foreground and, behind, a man on the telephone. The caption, however, says that the child is crying as his uncle "makes drug deals on the phone," thus hinting at a connection between the two activities.
Mr. Rodriguez also covers the domestic side of gang life in Los Angeles by portraying in black and white a man, woman and infant contemplating a dismembered gun. Having gained the confidence of his subjects, the photographer notes in the caption, somewhat priggishly, that "a father teaches his baby daughter how to use a gun," when, -- who knows? -- he may well look forward to her becoming a photographer.
As one of the growing band of curators who include their own work in anthologies, Mr. Falco contributes 10 shots in color, one of them a study of hands poking through an opening in a blue cell door. Though not the first photographer to represent a prisoner by his hands, Mr. Falco does it as scrupulously as a Renaissance painter, locating the opening dead center and providing a glimpse of the man's face through a metal grille.
Predictably, the show is heaviest on violence and its effects, but the scene of a Russian midwife listening by way of a little horn to a baby stirring in the belly of its mother is nonetheless one of the best shots. This is a case where color is indispensable, for the figure of the mother is much enhanced by the wall behind her bed, which is covered by a red cloth riotously patterned with yellow flowers. The scene is set in Bokhara, a town in Uzbekistan, which is famed for its carpets; the photographer is Peter Turnley, whose contributions also include a graphic scene of a man with a rifle bearing down on a looter in South Africa.
Photojournalism may have a short shelf life, but its impact lasts longer than that of television and, for all its flaws, "Cycle of Voices" proves the point. The show continues through Feb. 20. The information number is 276-8485.

VOICES '96 CONCERT
A chance to dance in the aisles or on the stage, not only without censure but with enthusiastic encouragement, will be offered to the audience at the Voices '96 dance concert next Saturday at 2 P.M. in the Neuberger Museum at Purchase College. 
 Performed by Forces of Nature, a nine-member troupe, the concert is the museum's yearly observance of Martin Luther King Day and Black History Month, and it is appropriate for families. Forces of Nature was founded in 1981 by Olabemidele Husbands and Abdel R. Salaam. Ms. Husbands is the executive director and leader of many master classes and workshops on the history and dance of West Africa and black America. She also serves on the faculty of the Alvin Ailey Dance Center and the Ruth Williams Dance Center in Manhattan.
Mr. Salaam, the company's choreographer and artistic director, has performed with several dance companies including those of Chuck Davis and Fred Benjamin. In 1987 he received the Dance Africa Award from the Brooklyn Academy of Music; in 1988 he won the Morani Shujaa Alumni Award and in 1989 the Carla Sayre Dance Award, both presented by the Department of Black Studies at Lehman College in the Bronx.
Voice '96 is a meld of music, movement and folk lore, incorporating the dance of West Africa with contemporary urban dance in America. After the performance the audience will be invited to a hands-on drum-making workshop. Tickets at $8 are available by calling 251-6110.
 
EARLY PAINTING STYLES
Painting in the style of late Gothic Flemish and Early Renaissance Florentine masters will be taught by Sally Randall, a Manhattan artist, tomorrow and the subsequent eight Mondays at the Rye Arts Center.
Fresco and tempera painting, glazing and other techniques culminating in an original work on wood or slate will be embellished by discussion of artists' writings from 1550 to the present.
Students should have some knowledge of art history and oil painting to benefit from the course, but whether they are abstract, contemporary, figurative or representational painters makes no difference.
Classes will meet from 7 to 10 P.M. through March 25, except on Feb. 19. The fee is $150 plus a $60 materials fee. Limited scholarships are available from the New York State Council on the Arts. Call the center at 51 Milton Road, 967-0700, for more information.
 
'NIXON' DISCUSSION
New York Film Salons will hold a Westchester discussion on the film "Nixon" today at 2:30 P.M. at Happiness Is . . . Cafe, 255 North Bedford Road in Mount Kisco. The salons, held in various spots in New York City and on Long Island as well as in Westchester, give attendees a forum in which to unload their opinions. "Nixon," already critiqued in Manhattan and Brooklyn sessions, has generated lively conversation.
The fee of $20 includes a light lunch, capuccino and dessert. Call 242-0919 for reservations or more information.
 
ARTISTS' WORKSHOPS
A series of workshops devoted to artists' skills is in progess at the Katonah Museum of Art through Feb. 22, offering participants a list of useful outlets for creativity.
On Thursday from 9 A.M. to noon Toni Mahr, a Greenwich-based floral designer, will conduct a class in dried topiaries, using lemon leaves, flowers and ribbons. The fee of $75 covers all materials, but students who have them are asked to bring low-temperature glue guns.
Three Easy Pieces Pottery Design with Jurg Lanzrein, a professional potter formerly with Tiffany & Company, will design dishes and bowls in colored clay. Mr. Lanzrein's work has been featured in Architectural Digest and other publications. The fee of $110 covers all materials. The workshop will be held on Jan. 30 from 9 A.M. to noon.
A two-session workshop on fantasy furniture finishes will be taught on Wednesday and Jan. 31 from 9 A.M. to noon by Ruben Teles, whose work is in the permanent collection of the Museum of American Folk Art. The fee of $110 covers all materials.
Decorative furniture painting in four sessions, mosaic-decorated pottery in two sessions and painted floor cloths in three sessions are on the February schedule. Fees are $150, $85 and $95, respectively, but there may be an additional charge for extra furniture or floor-cloth paints.
The museum is on Route 22 at Jay Street, and the phone number is 232-9555.
 
MEDIEVAL MUSIC
Istampita, a program of medieval music, will be performed by Hesperus, a period-instrument ensemble, next Saturday at 8 P.M. in Sommer Center at Concordia College in Bronxville.
Hesperus is made up of several overlapping ensembles specializing in Baroque, American Colonial, Spanish and American Indian music, and it has developed a conglomerate style.
Formed in 1979 and based in Washington, Hesperus performs with various combinations of recorders, vielle, viol, rebec, lute and dulcimer. Each member plays at least two instruments and sings.
Now in its sixth year as ensemble in residence at the Smithsonian Institution and visiting ensemble at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Hesperus also performs on National Public Radio and gives 30 concerts a year in the United States, Europe and Southeast Asia.
Some members will give a lecture-demonstration for children 8 and older at 4 P.M. in the center. They will talk about early music play their medieval and Renaissance instruments. Tickets to the concert are $10, $8 for students and people 62 and older. Admission to the children's program is free.
The college is at 171 White Plains Road. Call 337-9300, extension 2431, for reservations.
 
ROCK CLUB'S DEMISE
"Times have changed: Generation X seems less interested in live music," said George Russ, owner of Fore and Aft, a 35-year-old rock 'n' roll club in White Plains. "Closing the club at the end of January comes down to economics."
Before that happens, however, Fore and Aft will have a last hurrah this week with musicians, former staff members and patrons stopping by to listen to their favorite music and say their farewells from 10 P.M. to 4 A.M.
The Machine will perform its Pink Floyd Show on Thursday; the Subterraneans will head an all-star show on Friday featuring a jam session with musicians who have played at the club during the last 15 years, and on Saturday, the establishment will close with the classic rock of Hog Wild.
Fore and Aft is on Route 22, and the phone number, answerable after 9 P.M., is 761-2417.
 
INDOOR ROLLER SKATING
Indoor Rollerblading and roller skating will be in progress today from 2 to 3 P.M. for ages 4 and 5, and from 3:15 to 4:15 for ages 6 through 8 at the Jewish Community Center, 371 South Broadway in Tarrytown. Only rubber or plastic wheels will be allowed.
Admission is $3, and the center is just north of the Tarrytown Hilton. Call 366-7898 for more information.

The Tax That's Tearing Clifton Apart

BYLINE: By MATTHEW J. WARD; Matthew J. Ward is the president of the Clifton Taxpayers Association.

DATELINE: CLIFTON

 BODY:
THE task of financing our children's education is tearing this city apart, and we are not alone. The headlines go to the "special needs" districts like our neighbors Paterson and Passaic -- or to wealthy ones, some of which have come under fire for top-heavy administrative budgets. But for the sandwich towns, the hundreds of middle-class communities like Clifton, the property-tax way of paying for our schools has become an unacceptable burden.
It's true, as Governor Whitman said in her State of the State address, that the educational focus should not be simply on adding money to school budgets. "We must stop chasing dollars and start creating scholars," she said. But education costs money, and the Governor had nothing to say about redressing the unfairness of the existing property tax system. 
 The school budget in Clifton is now $64.6 million. In just two years the budget has grown $6.6 million as the student population has soared, from 6,800 in 1991 to 8,450 today. We spend only about $6,400 per student, one of the two or three lowest rates in the state for a kindergarten-through-12th-grade district of our size.
Our schools are still strong, but there are serious doubts as to how long that can last. Property taxes pay 84 percent of school costs, and the people who pay those taxes have run out of patience. Since 1988, only one budget has been passed by voters. Last year's defeated budget called for an increase of only 3.1 percent -- the smallest since '88. A kind of intergenerational conflict has broken out between residents with children in the schools and those at or near retirement.
Forty percent of our residents are 55 or older. Many are house-rich but cash-poor, living on a fixed income of $15,000 to $20,000 or so a year. Some have to pay out as much as a quarter of their income in property taxes. They express their bitterness each year when the school budget comes up for the voters' approval. That bitterness is directed not at the schools but against a tax system that takes what they do not have to give.
There is a widespread perception that the financial squeeze on the schools will affect the quality of education, sooner rather than later. Families interested in moving to Clifton can see the writing on the wall: school budget defeats, growing enrollment, aging buildings, less spending on computers and the like. Already, we have seen an exodus of young families and older residents.
Sadly, a number of school districts seem to see themselves as self-sustaining fiefs; their attitude is, "As long as we educate our own children, who cares about our neighbors?" We will all pay dearly because of this narrow-minded, insular focus. Students emerging from failing districts have few marketable skills in today's highly technical world. "Out of sight, out of mind" thinking means that the companion ills of homelessness, drug addiction, crime, teen-age pregnancy and illiteracy will grow and grow. I live in Clifton, but I care if kids in Passaic and Paterson do not receive a thorough education.
We must eliminate the property tax as the major source of financing for local education and replace it with a statewide source that is uniform and equitable in its application and centered on the notion of the ability to pay.
The only real answer is to rely on the income tax, alone or in combination with additional taxes on alcohol, cigarettes or gambling. That would replace an inequitable and onerous tax with one that finally is fair to the overwhelming number of residents.
Over the years, the property tax burden has multiplied; we now pay higher rates than any other state, except for one that does not have an income tax. Decade after decade, our political leaders kowtow to special interest groups, call for new studies or propose an amendment to the Constitution -- anything to sweep the problem under the rug.
Too often, the political talk focuses on the extremes, school districts at the top of the economic ladder and those at the bottom. For cities like Clifton, that's just not good enough.

An Experiment in Single-Sex Education Comes to An End

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: IRVINGTON

 BODY:
When Anthony Pilone took charge of the Myrtle Avenue Middle School three years ago, he did not like what he saw in the classrooms. Discipline problems were rampant, he said, and test scores were abysmal. Fights broke out regularly, and students paid scant attention to teachers.
"It was like bedlam," he said. "The whole business of horsing around was out of control, and there was no focus on learning." 
 From the start, Mr. Pilone blamed what he called "he-said, she-said antics" between girls and boys. Students were constantly trying to impress the opposite sex, he said, and few seemed interested in learning. So in September 1994, the principal took a radical step. Without consulting the district superintendent or state education officials, he separated the boys from the girls, segregating every classroom by sex.
For more than a year, boys attended classes on one side of the hallway and girls on the other. They ate lunch together, but for most of the day they did not interact. Mr. Pilone divided his teachers into teams, each working with one group of boys or girls throughout the year.
By the year's end, he said, there were obvious improvements at the school, where most of the students are black and many are poor. Attendance rates and grades had crept up, he said, and both teachers and students seemed more motivated. Scores on the Early Warning Test, which the state administers to eighth graders each March, improved by about 7 percentage points during the experiment, Mr. Pilone said. In 1994, for example, nearly 82 percent of his students scored at the lowest level in mathematics. In 1995, the number decreased to 75 percent.
Parents did not fight the program, Mr. Pilone said, and although teachers were skeptical at first, they warmed to it.
"It was the only thing I've ever done as a principal that I felt touched all the bases," he said. "I had the support of parents, students and teachers, and at least tacit approval from the district."
That changed last fall, when a new superintendent took charge of the 9,000-student district. The superintendent, Peter Carter, told Mr. Pilone that his experiment violated Title IX of the Federal Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibit sex discrimination in public schools. Moreover, Mr. Carter said, the New Jersey administrative code states that no course "shall be offered separately on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex, ancestry, national origin, or social or economic status."
In an interview last week, Mr. Carter said the State Department of Education had investigated the Myrtle Avenue program during the 1994-95 school year and had warned the previous superintendent that it could not continue. When he took charge of the district in October and discovered the program was still in place, he said, he had to stop it.
"I'm not saying it was good or bad," Mr. Carter said. "It was simply illegal."
Iliana Okum, who directs the Department of Education's Office of Bilingual Education and Equity Issues, said her office had indeed informed the district that the program could not continue, and Mr. Carter was correct to stop it.
"We could not allow the district to run single-sex classes," Ms. Okum said. "We have to insure that districts are following law and code, both state and Federal."
Apparently Mr. Pilone was not the first educator to challenge the Title IX rules with single-sex classrooms. Public schools in several other states, including California, Maryland, Florida and Michigan, have experimented with single-sex education in recent years. And in New Jersey, three public schools in Camden have segregated some classrooms by sex, said John Khanlian of the Camden County Department of Education.
Ms. Okum said she had not been aware that Camden schools were experimenting with single-sex classrooms. "They will probably be informed by the county superintendent that they will have to terminate those classes,"she said.
Several Myrtle Avenue teachers interviewed last week said they were disappointed when their classrooms returned to normal. Michael Dixon, a teacher who attended the Myrtle Avenue school in the early 1980's, said the experiment helped his male students gain confidence. Without girls to distract them, they became close friends and helped each other learn, he said.
"They didn't have to worry about that girl sitting next to them with the pretty-smelling perfume," he said. "It came to the point where they were like family. Discipline problems dropped off because you don't want your family fighting."
Wanda Warren, a teacher who worked with girls last year, said the experiment was even more beneficial for them. Girls who were used to getting F's started getting B's and C's, she said, and they became more comfortable in classroom discussions.
"With the boys around, they were afraid to raise their hand and call out an answer," said Ms. Warren, who has taught at Myrtle Avenue for nine years.
Mr. Pilone said he believed that Early Warning Test scores would have improved more dramatically this March, since the current eighth graders would have had almost two years of single-sex education. He had planned to take the program even further this year, with a dress code and separate floors of the building for boys and girls. Although he does not plan to challenge the superintendent's decision, he said he did not regret his course of action.
"My belief is that I have to act instead of react," he said. "You don't get permission to do anything risky."
Since the experiment ended, Ms. Warren said, many girls have resumed their old habits, dressing to impress the boys and rarely speaking out in class. And although some students were happy to return to coed classrooms, Ms. Warren said most are nostalgic for the single-sex days.
"These kids would go back to it in a heartbeat," she said. "They're missing that sense of pride."

HEADLINE: What's in a Name? Old Industrial Fame

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
NICKNAMES of cities are like nicknames of people. Once they're acquired, they're awfully hard, if not impossible, to shake.
On the people level, a man nicknamed Slim as a child will invariably still be Slim decades later, even though he might now weigh 248 pounds and be shaped like a pear. 
 On the city level, nicknames are most often associated with industries that once brought fame, sometimes worldwide fame, to town. When the industries declined, went out of business altogether, or simply went South for cheaper labor and more sun, the nicknames lived on.
Consequently, Manchester is still known as the Silk City for the sprawling Cheney mill empire, which no longer exists. Waterbury is still the Brass City even though the huge Scovill plant has been vacant for years. Naugatuck is the Rubber City although rubber is no longer processed there.
Bristol is the Clock City but that industry has long since ticked away. New Britain is the Hardware City but only the Stanley Works remains of a one-time battery of industrial hardware giants, including North & Judd and the American Hardware Corporation, that made the city not only the hardware capital of Connecticut but of the world.
Among bigger cities, New Haven is still the Elm City but a visitor might have some trouble finding elms. Pat Rubano, the deputy director for maintenance for the Parks Department, said that when he went to work half a century ago, "The elms made arches over whole streets." But Dutch elm disease put an end to that. Some new trees, immune from the disease, have been planted. But you have to look hard for them, even on Elm Street.
Bridgeport is still known as the Park City, for its 19 parks, but is much better known now for its economic troubles, including nearly going into bankruptcy several years ago, and this year's failed attempt at bailout-by-casino.
And in Hartford, the Insurance City, the insurance industry is in decline and one of the biggest companies, the Travelers, now has headquarters in Manhattan. The nickname of the city will survive, however. Bank on it.
In a few cities, community nicknames have been used, and still are, for sports teams.
The Hatters, for instance. When football and basketball players suit up for games at Danbury High, that's the name on their uniforms, which sometimes surprises newcomers who wonder why the athletes are hatters or, indeed, what a hatter is.
A hatter, of course, is a person who makes hats, and Danbury had an abundance of them when it was the hat capital of the world. But no hats have been produced in Danbury, the Hat City, for 10 years, since the last of the manufacturers, the Mallory Company, closed up.
Never mind, said Michael R. Seri, Danbury's veteran town clerk. "Danbury will never lose its identity for hats," said Mr. Seri who is 72 years old and who worked at hat companies before World War II. Hats were so important to the city's economy for more than two centuries -- the first hat factory in America was established in Danbury in 1780 by one Zadoc Benedict -- that a workman couldn't get inside a factory unless he was wearing a hat, Mr. Seri said.
He, like many others, credits the demise of the hat as everyday apparel to John F. Kennedy. Before Mr. Kennedy, every President of the United States had worn a hat to his swearing-in ceremony. Mr. Kennedy showed up hatless for his Inauguration in 1961 and the hat business was never the same again.
If Hatters seem obsolete, Whalers might seem more so. But all sports teams at New London High School are still known as Whalers, and the school's logo includes a harpoon, in deference to the city's main claim to fame in the last century: hunting down whales. The state's only National Hockey League team is the Hartford Whalers and the sperm whale was designated the state's animal by the General Assembly in 1975. That was in recognition not only of its contribution to the state's history but also of its present status as an endangered species. It is still hunted by -- of course -- whalers, but none from Connecticut.
In two cities, Meriden and Willimantic, efforts have been made over the last few years to create museums about the products that once made them famous.
Meriden is the Silver City, the largest manufacturer of silver tableware in the world in the 1930's and 1940's. The silver industry had long since departed when a group decided to establish a silver museum, backed by city and state money, to tell the story of Meriden's glory days. After years of planning, it opened in 1994. It closed a few months ago, badly in debt and with little public support.
Willimantic was known as the Thread City for the American Thread Company, which dominated the economic life of the community for most of this century. It moved South 10 years ago, leaving several fortress-like mills of brick and granite that dominate one end of Main Street.
A textile and history museum was opened in 1989 in a three-story Victorian mansion near the old mills. But last spring its founder declared the museum insolvent and gave the keys to a bank that held a mortgage on the property. The museum has since been reopened under new management but its future is still in doubt.
Perhaps the saddest aspect of the tale is that Willimantic itself, the city the mills made famous, the Thread City, technically doesn't even exist anymore. Willimantic was established within the rural town of Windham in 1893 when the thread company was booming. It was where people lived and worked, shopped, went to school. Then in 1983, with the thread mills almost silent, 90 years after it was conceived, Willimantic ceased to exist. It was consolidated into Windham, legally and officially.
But not in the minds of people who live there. If anyone asks where they live, the answer is not Windham. It is Willimantic. The streets are the streets of Willimantic. Those old thread mills are in Willimantic. It is the Thread City. Remember that.

HEADLINE: A LA CARTE;
A Quality Bill of Fare in a Bare-Knuckles Pub

BYLINE: By RICHARD JAY SCHOLEM 

 BODY:
THE Ritz in Northport is Cheers with a heavyweight chef. The cast of the TV sitcom would feel at home at this convivial cafe, which has the spirit of a club even more than a pub.
There are as many ties and jackets as jeans and baseball caps at the old polished-wood L-shape bar that dominates this waterfront spot at 42 Woodbine Avenue (754-6348). 
 The dishes emerging from the postage-stamp-size kitchen are a mixture of typical bar-and-grill fare like hamburgers, clam strips and shrimp in a basket (all $6.95) as well as potato-crusted sea bass, lobster tails with cashew-beurre blanc sauce, sea scallop Napoleon with a Pernod sauce, lamb chops with tomato-red wine risotto and suckling pig in a natural juice with rice, black beans and corn.
The pig, so popular in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries, no doubt springs from the chef's Latin American background. The chef, Alberto Andia, originally from Peru, arrived at the Ritz a year and a half ago. He had worked as executive chef at the Stork Club and Park Lane Hotel in Manhattan and chef and owner of Savories in Port Jefferson and Sempre Vivolo in Hauppauge.
It is possible to spend as much as $23.95 for an a la carte entree with vegetables, potato and salad at dinner, but there is no need to. That is because the Ritz offers an opportunity to eat for much less, with meals like the $12.95 four-course Sunday sunset supper; the 18-ounce steak with vegetables, potatoes and salad for $14.95 on Tuesdays, and the $10.95 Sunday brunch that includes an appetizer and cocktail.
There were no duds one night. The double green-pea soup ($2.50 a cup and $3.50 a bowl) came with fresh peas that bobbed in the tasty broth. A starter of four tender puffy sea scallops ($7.50), crowned with wispy leeks on a lush black-butter sauce, surrounded by circles of beet vinaigrette and garnished with ripe avocado, was satisfying and notable for its striking black, red, white, green presentation. Warm rare slices of soft duck breast radiate out from a medium-size pillbox of fancy greens like frisee and red-tipped and oak-leaf lettuces in the duck salad ($11.95), which is topped with terrific shoestring potatoes and dressed in saffron vinaigrette.
A boat-shape piece of medium-rare peppercorn-crusted swordfish ($15.95), covered with a thatch of julienned fried vegetables, in a sea of sun-dried tomato sauce and accompanied by broad brown steak fries and a fresh green salad with Dijon vinaigrette, was a triumph.
Perhaps the least economical course is dessert ($4.95). But the all-homemade delights should be sampled.
A note or two of caution is in order. Service is always sweet, but rarely swift. And although the Ritz, with its green tablecloths, vases of red carnations and baby's breath on each table, hardwood floors and hanging artificial plants has a certain charm, the dinner-time din can be deafening, and cold air sometimes sweeps in when the front door opens.
 
Festival Cooking
The second edition of "Food Festival," a guidebook to regional food celebrations, features down-home recipes from small-town festivals. Alice Geffen and Carole Berglie of Sea Cliff, came up with the idea for the book while devouring peach pie made from Wickham's peaches at the fund-raising chicken barbecue for the Cutchogue Fire Department. Shortly afterward, Ms. Geffen and Ms. Berglie began traveling and tasting throughout the country. They visited the Okra Strut in South Carolina; the Black-Eyed Pea Jamboree in Texas; the Pork, Peanut and Pine Festival in Virginia, and Yambilee in Louisiana, took the prize-winning and best-loved recipes from each and put them in the 295-page book. "Food Festival," a $16 soft cover published by Countryman Press, is at bookstores or can be requested from 10 Highland Avenue, Sea Cliff 11579.
 
Openings
Inaka, a 10-year-old Japanese restaurant on Court Street in Brooklyn Heights, opened a branch in Manhasset, Inaka East, at 411 Plandome Road (869-8080), last month. The 60-seat wood-paneled restaurant with a private tatami room offers entrees in the $8.95-to-$16.50 range. Eileen Wu, who along with her husband, Willis, owns the restaurant, said the average main course cost $12.
Guo Hong, from the Brooklyn Heights restaurant, will be executive chef in Manhasset until he trains a permanent kitchen commander.
Bassets, on the water at 2849 Ocean Avenue in Seaford (826-2710), which bills itself as "a cozy eating and dining establishment," also opened last month. The restaurant offers a selection of pastas, steaks, chops and poultry. Bassets replaces the Seal's Cove at that location. Main courses are $9.95 to $16.95.
Bassets is on a canal and seats 70 indoors and 50 on an outdoor deck in warm weather. Two sisters, Joan and Irene McElligott, who have worked at various restaurants in Nassau County, own Bassets, and Andrew De Gregorio is head cook. Mr. De Gregorio has worked as a manager, an expediter and a cook at a number of restaurants in Manhattan, including the Tavern on the Green, Ruth's Chris, the Post House and Smith & Wollensky.
 
Wine Tasting
The first of three winter wine tastings at the Inn at the Harbor in Cold Spring Harbor is scheduled for Jan. 31. The four-course $50 dinner will feature wines from California and Oregon. Among the wines to be poured are two sparkling-wine Champagne-style selections from Oregon, Gloria Ferrer Royal Cuvee and Argyle Brut.
The chef, Guy Peuch, plans to prepare his celebrated crab cakes, Southwestern lamb-and-white bean chili and rachers, an almond-and-chocolate truffle with a Grand Marnier-and-chocolate sauce.
 
Potpourri
An evening of fine food, a benefit for United Cerebral Palsy of Queens (718-380-3000, ext. 279), at the Terrace on the Park in Flushing Meadows, will be held at 6:30 P.M. on Feb. 7. Among the participants at the $50 tasting are Ben's Restaurants and Cooking With Jazz.
Restaurants, bakeries, wineries and food purveyors will be offering samples at the third annual Evening of Good Taste at the Huntington Town House from 6 to 9 P.M. on March 11.
The benefit, which is sponsored by South Nassau Communities Hospital (763-3919), costs $30 in advance and $40 at the door. Among the 50 participating restaurants are 107 Forest in Locust Valley, Route 66 in Merrick, Del Fina of Seaford and the Metropolitan in Glen Cove.

HEADLINE: Mohicans Denounce Retailer in Land Fight

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER KINCADE JR. 

DATELINE: LEEDS, N.Y.

 BODY:
WITH a tribal drum reverberating in the December wind, a small fire sending sparks into the pristine winter sky and a group of reporters surrounding his fellow Mohican tribesmen, Steve Comer drew the curtain for his take on the great American morality play.
In the shadow of the Catskill Mountains, Mr. Comer, the Mohican's soft-spoken Northeastern representative, referred to the 14-hour journey that seven of his tribe had taken from their reservation in Wisconsin as a historic occasion, a chance to salve centuries-old wounds. 
 "This is the first time since our holocaust, the first time in nearly 500 years, that we as a people have come back and said we are here," Mr. Comer told the crowd of 30 outside the town of Leeds. "Despite James Fenimore Cooper's book, we are not the last of the Mohicans."
Ostensibly protesting a Wal-Mart planned for a Mohican archeological dig, Mr. Comer's words echoed those sounded two weeks earlier at a public hearing in Dobbs Ferry. Attempts to build a town house complex on another archeological site there, an Onondaga chief said, could turn the Westchester County village into a pan-Indian battleground.
In development disputes that have splintered the quiet hamlets and divided archeologists and Government agencies, the Indians have brought a politically loaded issue to the fore: desecration of sacred Indian sites. Their entrance has reshaped the political landscape for developers and local administrators, who tout the economic boon the projects would be to the villages.
As public forums on both projects have become cathartic filibusters of sorts, geared toward delaying or derailing development, the Mohicans and their allies have transformed the Hudson Valley conflicts into debates on the value of Indian heritage.
One resident in Dobbs Ferry even delivered an emotional speech at follow-up hearings comparing Indian removal to ethnical cleansing in Bosnia, a notion that has forced developers and administrators to shift their mindset from complying with the environmental review process to addressing a contentious historical record. Dr. Robert Kuhn, program coordinator for the State Historic Preservation Office, which oversees the 10,000 archeological sites in the state, said the Hudson Valley was a particularly fertile ground for such disputes.
Once the homeland of the Mohican and Delaware tribes, the area from Manhattan to Lake Champlain has also been one of the most heavily developed regions in the Northeast. Those two competing interests, Dr. Kuhn said, combine to create combustible battles pitting expensive excavations against economic growth.
"In each of these projects, we have to balance that," Dr. Kuhn said. "Our goal is to find a way that the project can go forward and still protect the resource. In many instances, there are ways to do both."
He did concede, however, that the Indians have become powerful land advocates, largely by virtue of their ability to attract news organizations. In Leeds, where the Mohicans, also known as Munsee Indians, occupied a small hunting camp through five archeological eras, the Dec. 2 peace conference focused attention on a site that has undergone only preliminary excavations.
After the Mohicans had paid homage, one by one, to their ancestors, Dr. Christopher Lindner, a professor of archeology at Bard College, turned the discussion toward science. "Out there in nine feet of flood plain deposit," he said, "there are layers upon layers of archeological artifacts."
Citing fireplace remnants, storage pits, post-hole structures and other earmarks of settlement discovered in a dig last summer, Dr. Lindner said that the site could be one of the greatest archeological finds in the Northeast. In a later interview, he advocated long-term excavations and a research center at the site.
While Dr. Kuhn said he agrees with his colleague's assessment of the site's significance, the Green County Legislature voiced its support for Wal-Mart. With the Mohicans threatening to sue for inadequate excavations, the battle may just be starting in Leeds.

HEADLINE: Patrol Program Credited With Drop in Crime

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON

 BODY:
IT was in a neighborhood now considered one of the toughest police beats in this teeming 4.2-square-mile city that Sgt. Terrance Raynor was raised. He walks the same sidewalks today as he did growing up, and he sees many of the same faces -- only now he watches over the neighborhood and keeps pace with the news on the street.
"What's up man?" Sergeant Raynor said on a recent afternoon, greeting a citizen along the East Third Street corridor, as the busy, crime-ridden shopping area is known. "Where you been?" 
 That afternoon Sergeant Raynor was not only surprised but also happy to encounter Richard Morales, which had not always been the case. In the past, Mr. Morales, 27, an admitted drug dealer, had been one of the less-welcome denizens of the neighborhood.
"I've changed my life around," Mr. Morales told the sergeant, as they talked about jobs, apartments and people they knew in common. "No more jail time for me."
That type of social exchange between a law-enforcement officer and a member of the community is becoming more common in municipalities throughout the country under a Federal program that takes more police officers out of patrol cars and from behind desks and puts them on the beat.
The program, known as Community-Oriented Policing or by its acronym COPS, appears to be paying off and is increasingly cited as one of several factors contributing to a pattern of lower crime across the country. Its goal is to put 100,000 officers on the street; to date, about 26,000 police officers have been hired under the program.
In Westchester, where many municipalities have redeployed officers to neighborhood beats, statistics show that for the first 10 months of 1995 -- the latest period for which figures were available -- the number of offenses known to the police dropped by 11 percent to 23,186, from 26,040 for the corresponding period in 1994.
The numbers, which are part of the state's Uniform Crime Report, indicate trends for murders, negligent manslaughters, rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults, burglaries, larcenies and motor vehicle thefts. Last year appears to continue a downward trend in most crime categories that began early in the decade, although not all jurisdictions had filed their statistics at the time of the report.
Most notably, the number of automobile thefts in Westchester dropped 21 percent from 3,916 in the first 10 months of 1994 to 3,096 in the corresponding period last year. The county, which is striped with north-south highways, affords quick access to auto thieves from the suburbs to chop shops in Manhattan and other boroughs of New York City.
Here in Mount Vernon, for example, motor vehicle thefts alone were down almost 18 percent, but other crimes also showed decreases. Burglaries, for example, dropped by 13 percent, and Chief Michael J. Craparo credited the successes in part to a three-year, $750,000 Federal grant, which is paying the salaries of six community police officers like Sergeant Raynor.
But Chief Craparo also observed that some offenses -- particularly crimes like robberies and aggravated assaults -- remained resistant to police efforts, and he said the statistics indicated "there is still much work to be done." Robberies were up by 12 percent and aggravated assaults by 2 percent. Overall, crime in Mount Vernon dropped by 3 percent in 1995 compared with 1994.
In Yonkers, crime was down 6 percent for the first 10 months of last year, and the city was ranked the ninth safest of the 100 largest cities in the country, according to Federal Bureau of Investigations statistics for 1994 in a book called "City Crime Rankings," published by Morgan Quitno Press of Lawrence, Kan. The safest city, according to the rankings, was Huntington Beach, Calif.
Motor vehicle thefts in Yonkers were down by 13 percent, burglaries by 14 percent and robberies by 18 percent. But the gains were in part offset by a 6 percent increase in larcenies.
New Rochelle also noted a significant decrease in crime last year. Its latest figures for all of 1995, which showed a 14 percent drop overall, revealed decreases in every category except murder. Commissioner Patrick J. Carroll credited much of his city's success to the Federal anti-crime effort, which two years ago put 12 community police officers on foot and bicycles throughout the city.
White Plains saw a 4 percent decrease in crime during the first 10 months of last year. Rye City had not filed its statistics with the state at the time of this report.
Of all of Westchester's cities, only Peekskill reported an increase -- a hefty 18 percent -- and Chief Eugene S. Tumolo could offer little explanation.
"It's too sterile to just examine the statistics," he said, suggesting that Peekskill's community policing efforts and other new law-enforcement strategies there would need more time to bear fruit.
In other cities in the state, the crime rate also dropped. In New York City, crime was down 16 percent for the first six months of 1995, and in Buffalo it dropped 7 percent. In Albany, though, crime was up by 4 percent for the period, and in Rochester it increased by 1 percent.
Many of the smaller villages and towns in Westchester reported increases in crime for the 10-month period last year. For example, Briarcliff Manor reported a 25 percent increase -- from 64 crimes committed for the period in 1994 to 80 last year. And Bronxville reported a 39 percent increase -- from 54 crimes overall in 1994 to 75 crimes in 1995.
But Robert M. Maccarone, Westchester's Deputy Commissioner of Corrections and Director of Criminal Justice, urged caution in drawing conclusions, because the numbers were so small and skewed the percentages.
He also suggested that the cities fared better because they had earlier access to the Federal community policing grants and that in time the numbers in the smaller municipalities would follow suit.
Meanwhile, social scientists and law-enforcement experts are trying to pinpoint the reasons for the decrease in crime.
Mr. Maccarone cited two major contributing factors: shifting demographics and a get-tough policy toward criminals at the state and local level.
He said that in Westchester there are only 20,000 people, or about 2 percent of the population, in the 16-to-30-year-old category, which is the group considered largely responsible for crime.
Throughout the country, too, that group represents only a small percentage of the general population.
Mr. Maccarone also said that stiffer sentencing policies overall and Gov. George E. Pataki's elimination of parole for second-time violent offenders has kept more criminals locked up for longer periods and "out of the loop."
In Manhattan at the John Jay School of Criminal Justice, Professor Andrew Karmen, a sociologist, said that everyone from the Governor to local police chiefs was taking credit for the latest statistics.
Dr. Karmen is part of a team of researchers -- including an economist, police officials, criminologists and computer experts -- studying the reasons that crime in New York City is down.
Unfortunately, the decrease in crime "might just be a pause until the next baby boom comes of age," because it appears to be related to demographic trends, he said.
Westchester's District Attorney, Jeanine Pirro, said that the lower crime statistics notwithstanding, arrests of juveniles for violent offenses rose 70 percent in the county from 1984 to 1994. Specifically, almost half of the robbery indictments in Westchester for the period were filed against suspects who were 19 or younger, she said.
Those local statistics also appear to be following a national trend: throughout the country, there was a 68 percent increase in arrests of juveniles for in connection with killings between 1989 and 1993.
But even though the incidence of violent crime has been on the decrease for five years, the perception among the populace is that criminal behavior overall is on the upswing, Dr. Karmen said. In part, the fear that things are getting worse, not better, is generated by a few spectacular crimes that get front-page headlines and, according to many police chiefs, alter the public's perception of reality.
In Greenburgh, where a former auto-parts worker was charged with the gunshot killing of his former boss earlier this month and the wounding of two other workers, Chief John A. Kapica said many people now think of his town "as a real shoot-em-up community -- even though that's not the routine here."
At a nearby shopping mall, Seihui Lee, owner of Century Art Gallery, said: "Everyone is very nervous. We used to think Westchester was safe, not like the Bronx, but now we believe that crime can happen anywhere."
Merchants along the shopping strip said they were worried about making bank deposits of the day's receipts after dark and that some muggings and car thefts had also contributed to their anxieties.
"We don't care what the statistics say; it seems like things are getting worse," said Thomas J. Vassilio, a manager at Petland Discounts.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 4, 1996, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 21 about crime in the county misstated the percentage increase of all reported crimes in Bronxville. It was 3.6 percent for 1995 -- not 39 percent, which was the increase in larcenies there for the first 10 months of the year.

HEADLINE: The New York Times Introduces a Web Site

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS

 BODY:
The New York Times begins publishing daily on the World Wide Web today, offering readers around the world immediate access to most of the daily newspaper's contents. 
 The New York Times on the Web, as the electronic publication is known, contains most of the news and feature articles from the current day's printed newspaper, classified advertising, reporting that does not appear in the newspaper, and interactive features including the newspaper's crossword puzzle. 
 The electronic newspaper (address: http:/www.nytimes.com) is part of a strategy to extend the readership of The Times and to create opportunities for the company in the electronic media industry, said Martin Nisenholtz, president of The New York Times Electronic Media Company. 
 The company, formed in 1995 to develop products for the rapidly growing field of digital publishing, is a wholly owned subsidiary of The New York Times Company, and also produces the times service on America Online Inc.
 Mr. Nisenholtz reports to Russell T. Lewis, the president and general manager of The New York Times, and to Joseph Lelyveld, the newspaper's executive editor. 
 The Web-based Times is the newest of dozens of papers available to a global audience on the Internet's fastest-growing service, which lets computer users see electronic publications consisting of text, pictures and, in some cases, video and sound. 
 A selection of the day's news, discussion forums and other material from The Times has been available through the @times service since the spring of 1994 on America Online. 
 The Web site's global audience means a larger potential readership than that of @times, which is limited to America Online's subscribers, currently more than four million. The new site also offers new products and services. 
 "Our site is designed to take full advantage of the evolving capabilities offered by the Internet," said Arthur Sulzberger Jr., publisher of The Times. "We see our role on the Web as being similar to our traditional print role -- to act as a thoughtful, unbiased filter and to provide our customers with information they need and can trust." 
 The Web site will also offer access to much of what the newspaper has published the previous week and access to feature articles from as far back as 1980. 
 Mr. Nisenholtz said that initially, at least, no subscription or access fee would be charged for readers in the United States and that the electronic paper would generate revenue from advertising. Readers who connect to the electronic paper from outside the country will be offered a 30-day trial without charge, but will eventually face a subscription fee. 
 Advertisers that have already announced participation on the Web site include Toyota Motor Corporate Services, Chemical Bank and the Northeast real estate concern Douglas Elliman. 
 Subscribers will have limited access to archives of Times articles and features dating to 1980, and will be able to copy articles to their own computers for $1.95 each, Mr. Nisenholtz said. 
 The new service will also offer, for a fee, a customized clipping service that delivers to a subscriber's electronic mailbox articles gleaned from each day's editions of the newspaper, based on key words the subscriber selects. 
 With its entry on the Web, The Times is hoping to become a primary information provider in the computer age and to cut costs for newsprint, delivery and labor. Companies that have established Web-based information sites include television networks, computer companies, on-line information services, magazines and even individuals creating electronic newspapers of their own. 
 "The New York Times name will get people to look at the product once or maybe twice, and the fact that The New York Times has the kind of reach and credibility it does may persuade people to look three or four times," said John F. Kelsey 3d, president of the Kelsey Group, a consultancy running a conference on interactive newspapers next month. 
 "The market is booming for newspapers on the World Wide Web," Mr. Kelsey said.

HEADLINE: Bringing Advanced Medical Expertise to the World's Poorest Regions

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN 

 BODY:
The patient was getting the best care the local doctors could provide. But this case needed outside expertise, and a long-distance phone call was not an option.
There was a low-cost communications alternative, however, thanks to Satellife, a Boston-based nonprofit organization helping bring the information age to parts of Africa and Asia where up-to-date medical information can be scarce. 
 As Dr. Fred Bukachi, a Kenyan internist, recalls the episode, he and a team of renal surgeons in Nairobi were treating a first-year medical student who had sickle-cell anemia, an incurable blood condition that had been under control. Now, however, the condition had suddenly worsened. As the student's kidneys failed, his doctors knew he had to have blood-cleansing dialysis treatments.
No one on the team had experience putting such a patient on a dialysis machine, which typically requires use of blood-thinning drugs that could be deadly to someone with sickle-cell anemia. There was no good nearby medical library. Even an overseas phone call would cost $12 a minute -- an unaffordable luxury in an economy where hospitals can afford to spend an average of only $1 a day on patients.
But turning to the keyboard of his specially outfitted personal computer, Dr. Bukachi typed an urgent call for advice that was sent via radio signals to a nearby satellite earth station. A few hours later the earth station's dish antenna beamed the message to the small Satellife satellite that passes over Africa four times each day.
Several hours later, when the satellite swung into electronic view of Boston, Dr. Bukachi's missive was downloaded to a Satellife ground station, where the organization's staff broadcast it over the global Internet computer web.
Half a day later came an Internet reply to Boston from a physician at St. Mary's Hospital in London who had successfully handled a similar case. The prescribed treatment: small doses of the blood thinner Heperin. A Satellife staff member telephoned Dr. Bukachi with the information. The treatment saved the Kenyan medical student's life.
"In this case, there was no other alternative -- there was no other place to turn for help," said Dr. Bukachi, who serves as Satellife's Africa region director.
Since its founding in 1989 by the renowned cardiologist, inventor and promoter of social causes Bernard Lown, Satellife has helped save many lives. Its Healthnet medical network now serves thousands of physicians and health care workers in 15 African nations and parts of Asia.
Healthnet subscribers receive the electronic Healthnet News, a weekly summary of the latest medical research from more than 20 major medical journals. They also get medical information from a growing list of health organizations like the World Health Organization and numerous AIDS research projects.
During last year's outbreak of the dreaded ebola virus in Zaire, Dr. Paul Fountain, an American Baptist missionary and chief physician at Vanga Hospital in Kikwit, the epicenter of the outbreak, used Healthnet to communicate about the disease with other physicians in Africa and elsewhere.
Within African nations, Healthnet gives physicians in even the most remote hospitals access to up-to-date knowledge.
Last year, for example, a doctor in the village of Kafue Gorge in southern Zambia was treating a 12-year-old girl who had severe lesions in her mouth and could barely swallow. Unable to treat the child and cut off by roads washed out in the rainy season, the physician asked for help via Healthnet. Before nightfall he had received instructions from doctors at the University of Zambia, in Lusaka, on how to surgically remove the lesions. After the surgery, the child recovered.
Satellife's founder, Dr. Lown, 74, is as well known for his medical innovations as he is for his political and social causes. He is credited with conceiving the modern cardiac-care unit and founded International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, an organization that won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985.
And when he set up Satellife with multimillion-dollar grants from corporations including NEC and AT&T, since supplemented by donors including the actor Hume Cronyn and the media entrepreneur Ted Turner, it was out of recognition that technology and social concerns might be combined.
"Ignorance fosters chaos," said Dr. Lown, who in the case of most of sub-Saharan Africa realized that medical professionals were hampered by an appallingly inadequate communications system. Voice, fax and video-conference transmissions were either unavailable or made unaffordable by government-run telecommunications agencies.
What was required was some sort of "off line" or "store and forward" communications system that did not require connections to the real-time telephone network.
So Dr. Lown and his advisers settled on so-called low-earth-orbit satellite technology. The approach is a stark contrast to the giant geostationary satellites, which are commonly used for telephone and television transmissions in the United States. These complex spacecraft, costing several hundred million dollars to build and up to $20 million more to launch, are positioned over the equator at an altitude of more than 22,000 miles, where they orbit in unison with the earth's rotation, seeming to hang in a fixed position.
A low-earth satellite, which would be the size of a television set and would zip around the globe at an altitude of only 550 miles, could be built and launched for $1 million. Satellife bought and launched Healthsat 1 in 1991 and three years later sent up a more sophisticated replacement, Healthsat 2, which cost $2.2 million. Both were paid for with private donations.
Taking 100 minutes for each pole-to-pole orbit of the earth, the satellite makes 14 circumnavigations a day. Every 24 hours, any given spot on earth is within electronic range of the satellite at least four times.
Each time the satellite comes into view, an earth station has approximately 13 minutes to exchange data with Healthsat 2 via radio signal. The network's software allows the spacecraft to poll each earth station in turn, collecting any stored messages and downloading any information collected elsewhere on the globe and addressed to that particular station.
The equipment for each ground station costs less than $15,000. And as telephone service is gradually improving in some African cities, a Healthnet subscriber can use a modem to transmit messages via local phone line to a centrally located earth station, rather than requiring a satellite antenna at each site.
"We've devised a system that can easily be replicated within a country for free," said John Mullaney, executive director of Satellife. "It is a medical information system that can be run by Africans for Africans and can be sustained internally."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Faces Another Deficit Despite Cutting

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
For the last two years, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has wrestled down huge gaps in New York City's budgets, slashing spending, cutting municipal jobs and trimming welfare rolls. And yet, as he begins his third year in office, the Mayor faces another gaping hole in his spending plan and a new round of cuts that could further erode the city's services.
The new shortfall, which has more than doubled in size in just seven months, is forcing the Mayor and his aides to scramble once again for ways to keep the budget balanced for the coming fiscal year, either by making more cuts or taking other actions like refinancing debt or selling assets. 
 Only this time the task has become all the more complicated and the consequences more painful, according to budget experts, city officials and privately even some of the Mayor's aides. For now, they say, the Mayor has less room to maneuver. Fewer options remain. And any new cuts will come in the wake of earlier ones that have already strapped many of the city's agencies.
"Where there was fat in the budget," the city's Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, said. "There's a lot less fat now."
Neither the Mayor nor his aides have disclosed the full extent of the gap projected for the fiscal year that begins on July 1. But the city's fiscal monitors -- Mr. Hevesi, the state's Financial Control Board and the State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall -- estimate it to be at least $2 billion, or more than 6 percent of the current $32 billion budget.
That is roughly the amount spent each year on the Police Department, with its force of 38,000 officers and 6,000 civilians. The gap is fast approaching the scale of the first two Mr. Giuliani had to face: $2.3 billion in his first year and $3.1 billion in the second.
The Mayor and his aides are now drafting a preliminary budget for the new fiscal year and plan to unveil it on Jan. 31. At the same time, they are trying to close a widening shortfall in this fiscal year, estimated to be at least $600 million and probably more.
First Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers declined to discuss what proposals the Mayor would offer to close the gap. He did say, however, that Mr. Giuliani remained committed to controlling spending, and he disputed the notion that there were fewer and fewer places to cut.
"In some areas, you've probably hit your maximum cutting," Mr. Powers said, "but in other areas there are other opportunities."
The reasons for the new gap -- despite two years of cuts under the Republican Mayor who came into office vowing once and for all to tackle the city's chronic budget woes -- are varied and complex. Some fall within the Mayor's control. Others do not, leaving Mr. Giuliani susceptible to larger political and economic forces like mayors before him.
Simply put, the city continues to spend more money than it can hope to receive in revenues, a trend that has dogged three mayors since the end of the economic boon of the 1980's.
In the coming fiscal year, the city's revenues -- primarily from taxes but also from state and Federal aid -- are not going to grow by as much as forecast by Mr. Giuliani's budget aides. In fact, the Mayor's office announced last week that the city's largest source of revenue, the property tax, would fall as much as $180 million short of what was estimated only two months ago.
And while Wall Street had a boisterous year, the Comptroller's office has tracked an unexpected shortfall in personal income taxes and some other business taxes in the last few months of 1995. On Friday, the Federal Government reported a jump in the city's unemployment rate despite recent gains in the tourism and retail industries, possibly signaling an economic slowdown that could reduce revenues even more.
What's more, the Mayor has proposed $340 million in new tax cuts for the new fiscal year, including a reduction in the personal income tax, which have added to the size of the gap.
At the same time, the city's spending is projected to continue its rampant growth, outpacing the reductions made by Mr. Giuliani in his first two years.
For example, the largest part of the city's budget -- personnel costs -- is projected to grow by more than $500 million in the next year despite a reduction of 19,000 workers from the city-financed payroll of 223,000 from the time Mr. Giuliani took office two years ago. The reason for the increase: salaries, pensions and health care costs of the remaining workers have continued to grow.
That, in part, explains why some fiscal monitors and budget experts have criticized Mr. Giuliani for not extracting more concessions in his recent settlements with the city's labor unions.
"Until he faces up to the challenge of getting big labor savings on a recurring basis, he's going to be in the same bind year after year," said Raymond D. Horton, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private nonprofit group financed by businesses.
The growth in spending also reflects the mounting costs of paying interest and principal on the city's debt, which has skyrocketed in part because of the refinancings that saved the city money in the past at a cost in the future.
Mr. Hevesi's office has found that the price of the refinancings, which began in 1987, came home to roost for the first time this year and will add $145 million to the city's spending in the next fiscal year.
The Mayor's first two budgets also assumed savings from new initiatives that have not yet materialized or have little chance of doing so, adding to the projected shortfalls in the coming budget. The savings from his agreements with labor unions, for example, have proved less than first touted, while the strict screening of welfare recipients has reduced costs considerably, though not by as much as first estimated.
Beyond what he has little control over, Mr. Giuliani, the fiscal monitors say, has also contributed to the new gap through budget gimmicks -- known as "one shots" because they provide only temporary relief. They include relying on refinancings, tapping pension reserves and selling assets, like the city-owned United Nations Plaza Hotel.
Using a one shot to balance the budget is like selling your television set to pay the rent: it gets you through this month, but next month the rent comes due again and then there is no television left to sell.
Mr. McCall, the State Comptroller, said the continued use of one shots left unresolved the underlying problem of spending growing faster than revenues. "You've got this structural problem that just keeps repeating itself," he said.
Mr. Powers, the Mayor's senior aide, said the gaps were the lingering consequences of the city's tradition of generous spending and high taxes. The latter, he argued, caused the erosion of the city's tax base to the point that the city can no longer pay for the former.
"We're suffering from the sins of the past," he said. "The city simply spends too much money."
The Mayor's new budget could be as important politically as the first two were, particularly since it will carry over into the election year. The recurring gaps pose risks that could cut both ways.
"I think Giuliani is in an impossible situation," said Fred Siegel, a history professor at Cooper Union and a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute, a research group in Washington associated with centrist Democrats. "If he makes the cuts he has to make, it might be political suicide. If he doesn't make the cuts, the city continues to limp along, hoping for an economic recovery that never arrives."

HEADLINE: Cadillac-Sized Hits by the VW of Producers;
Carsey-Werner Keeps Its Independence and Still Picks Television's Winners

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 19

 BODY:
It has been 12 years since the weekly listings of television's 10 most popular programs did not include a comedy from Carsey-Werner Productions -- and that string of success now looks secure at least through the end of the century.
Last week, the latest Carsey-Werner effort, "Third Rock From the Sun," a comedy about a family of aliens-disguised-as-earthlings adapting to the often inscrutable behavior of humans, firmly established itself as the first undeniable new hit show of the 1995-96 season; by its second week it was NBC's highest-rated show on Tuesday night. It is also Carsey-Werner's first breakthrough hit on NBC since "The Cosby Show" in the mid-1980's. 
 But the producers are not choosy about the network company they keep. They have put hits on ABC ("Roseanne" and "Grace Under Fire") and CBS ("Cybill") as well. In fact, Carsey-Werner is almost surely the only television production company capable of pulling off a network hat trick like that because they are the last of the true independents, steering a small self-propelled vehicle among the big rigs that dominate the network highways.
Years ago there were many independents -- production companies that are not aligned with networks or studios -- including MTM, which produced "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and "Hill Street Blues," or Garry Marshall, which produced "Happy Days" and "Laverne and Shirley." But today most have found that the costs of producing shows make the backing of big studios highly desirable, if not necessary.
"No one else in series television is doing this," said Tom Werner, the co-chief executive of the company along with his career-long partner, Marcy Carsey. "You do feel a little like you're in the VW bug on the New Jersey Turnpike."
"We're doing very well," Ms. Carsey said, "but in this environment, with mega-companies being built and everyone merging with everyone else, we are a little lonely. We're feeling either very smart or very stupid."
There is no question how the rest of the television industry would answer that equation. "Tom and Marcy get the game," said Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Entertainment, to whom Carsey-Werner will deliver the much-anticipated new Bill Cosby comedy in the fall. "They're great producers; they know programming and they know scheduling. They're also very good business people. And right now, they are very, very hot."
Carsey-Werner, which only a couple of years ago was down to "Roseanne" as its only running hit, now has more successful shows on the air -- four -- than ever before. With the new Cosby show in the wings and, it says, another comedy pilot called "Men Behaving Badly" likely to be picked up by a network next fall, the tiny company, with only about 100 employees, will surpass all other production companies and most Hollywood studios in the total number of shows on network prime-time television.
And now they are thinking of taking on the movie business.
"We see an opportunity in movies," Ms. Carsey said in an interview conducted with the company's executives in their brightly lit, comfortably furnished offices on the old MTM studio lot (now owned by CBS).
"It's a great opportunity," Mr. Werner added. "There's a kind of comedy the studios are not making." Putting it simply, he called it "smart comedy."
"We all have families," said Caryn Mandabach, president of Carsey-Werner. "We found we couldn't take them to any movie. It's irritating to have to go to a movie and not laugh."
But just as they did when they started their television production company in 1981, Carsey-Werner is avoiding rushing into movie production with 20 deals in various stages of development, with exclusive distribution contracts being negotiated, or with big-money stars in tow.
"We feel there must be some way to maneuver" to avoid all that, Mr. Werner said. "We feel if we get the right material we'll get it made. And we won't spend $20 million on an actor. We'll try to find our own Jim Carrey."
At the moment, Carsey-Werner Moving Pictures has a staff of one and there is exactly one script in development. For Carsey-Werner that amounts to a strength, not a limitation.
"They are very discriminating," said Warren Littlefield, president of NBC Entertainment. "They won't do something they don't believe in. That can be maddening at times when you want them for a project. But it gives them a lot of freedom."
Freedom was the big reason that Ms. Carsey and Mr. Werner left ABC in 1981. Even then it was conventional for former network executives to tie themselves to a studio or network, simply because it was the best way to insure that a new company could survive the fearsome start-up economics of television production.
All series are produced at a deficit because networks do not pay enough in license fees to cover the costs of making a show. A typical episode of a half-hour comedy costs between $500,000 and $600,000 to produce and runs a deficit of $100,000 to $200,000. Without a big bankroll, it is almost impossible to absorb those deficits while waiting for the payoff that a big hit brings: the hundreds of millions of dollars that can be made in syndication.
But in 1981, when the pair left their jobs as programmers at ABC, Ms. Carsey was adamant about remaining independent. She wanted no strings attached.
The company's first comedy, "Oh Madeline," was a miss. Still, Carsey-Werner resisted all entreaties from networks and studios.
"One of the things we think is very important is not only did we not make a studio deal, but we never made a network deal," Mr. Werner said. "Some shows are just served better by one network but not by another."
Carsey-Werner has proved that several times over. "If we had been exclusive to ABC when we did 'The Cosby Show,' it wouldn't have gotten on the air because ABC rejected it," Ms. Carsey said. "Then when we were at NBC, that was sort of our home network for the time being, but they passed on 'Roseanne.' So if we had had an exclusive arrangement with them, that show might not have seen the light of day."
The same pattern has held with "Cybill," which was rejected by ABC and picked up by CBS, and now "Third Rock from the Sun," which ABC executives did not believe could be a hit and so delivered it into the waiting arms of NBC.
As with many Carsey-Werner shows, "Third Rock" began with the producers musing about subjects not currently being done on network television. (The pair, coincidentally, helped give birth to another alien-comes-to-town series, "Mork and Mindy," in the 1970's.)
This time, they came up with the notion of "aliens on a field trip," as Ms. Mandabach put it, then took the concept to Bonnie and Terry Turner, a husband-wife writing team, who fleshed out the idea into a series that dealt with observations about the variety and silliness of human behavior. John Lithgow, an actor the company loved from his film work, was brought in to star. After two pilots, the show finally took shape.
Both Mr. Lithgow and the Turners have ownership stakes in the series, another formula usually followed at Carsey-Werner. The results have been to make some stars and producers high-multiple millionaires. "The Cosby Show," for example, has made the most money in television syndication history, a figure that is approaching $1 billion.
The cash has supplied Carsey-Werner with the cushion it needs to stay independent and go in other directions. "What we've used some of the money for is to expand our business," said Stuart Glickman, the chief operating officer and the principal deal maker for Carsey-Werner.
Beyond that, the company's profits are managed carefully. All the principals have steered clear of the religion of conspicuous consumption practiced so widely in Hollywood.
In one flight of extravagance, Mr. Werner took a bit of his "Cosby" stash and fulfilled a lifelong dream by buying the San Diego Padres. His ownership of the baseball team was a disaster that he says he is thrilled to have put behind him.
Among other things, it reminded him too much of the excesses now plaguing Hollywood. "One of the things that troubles us is studios paying exorbitant amounts of money for writers. It's very much like these baseball players who aren't worth that kind of money.
"We are focusing on growing our writers," Mr. Werner said. "We try to get them when they're babies and we try to keep them as long as possible."
Ms. Carsey and Mr. Werner work as what they call "line producers," which means they are down on the stage when episodes of their shows are put on tape or film. They also cast and supervise scripts and everything else down to the construction of the sets.
"Television is an adventure for us," Mr. Werner said.
"It's opening night every night on every show," Ms. Carsey said.
In the late 1980's Carsey-Werner almost accepted an offer from CBS to run all of the network's programming.
Stepping up to something much bigger still has some appeal.
"We would consider something odd and different. We look at what Michael Eisner has done with Disney and it's very exciting to have that sort of major impact on American culture," Mr. Werner said.
For the networks that employ them now, the impact Carsey-Werner already has is impressive. As Mr. Moonves of CBS noted, next season the company may have two hit comedies at each of the three established networks.
"They are like holding the key to three different networks at the same time," Mr. Moonves said. "That is very, very unusual."

HEADLINE: Goldman, Sachs Partners Decide Not to Sell, After All

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Goldman, Sachs & Company, Wall Street's last big private partnership, has decided after weeks of deliberation that it will not put itself up for sale, people who attended the firm's annual partners' meeting over the weekend said yesterday.
The decision, which was not put to a vote of the Goldman partners, is expected to put aside for at least several years the issue of whether to remain private, to sell the firm or to offer stock in it to the public. 
 The buoyant stock market; a recent successful public stock offering by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, and Goldman's large profit -- $1.37 billion before taxes for the fiscal year that ended on Nov. 30 -- had made the question of whether the firm would go public one of Wall Street's favorite topics of speculation over the last several months. All of Goldman's big competitors have, one by one, decided to sell stock in their businesses.
The Goldman partners reached their decision after a panel of them had spent several weeks studying the firm's capital structure. Almost all of the 174 partners were gathered on Friday and Saturday at the Doral Arrowwood conference center in Rye Brook, N.Y., north of New York City, for the meeting.
There have always been formidable obstacles to Goldman's going public. In particular, there would be complex tax and accounting questions, people familiar with the firm's accounts and with Goldman's recent study of its capital structure said yesterday.
In addition, prices for the shares of brokerage firms have declined recently, taking the shine off any possible Goldman offering in the near future. In recent weeks, Goldman partners had speculated that they might be able to sell the firm for twice its book value, but the recent slide in brokerage stocks might have lowered the multiple to around 1.5 times book value.
"The bottom line is we came out enthusiastic believers and supporters that we should go forward with our business plans in a private partnership format," a person who attended the meetings said. "I think the sense of the partners is this is the best motivational and organizational structure for us and for our business plans. There's tremendous allure to stimulate people" in the partnership, he added, referring to the financial attractiveness of senior status in Goldman, Sachs.
Partnership usually brings compensation of millions of dollars a year, and has been the brass ring the firm used to draw in talent and keep its ambitious employees working long hours.
Nevertheless, the idea of selling Goldman has come up every few years. It was an issue in 1986, when the firm's management committee, which included Jon S. Corzine, the current chairman and senior partner, voted for a sale. But dissent over the details among the younger partners -- who usually have smaller shares in the partnership and therefore stand to make less money from a sale -- derailed that initiative.
This time, Mr. Corzine and his colleagues preferred the partnership format, apparently convinced that Goldman's ability in recent years to gain access to capital from outsiders like the Sumitomo Bank of Japan and the Kamehameha Schools/Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate, an educational trust in Hawaii, more than met its needs.
In an interview last month, Mr. Corzine and Henry M. Paulson Jr., the firm's vice chairman and chief operating officer, emphasized that Goldman had always had access to the capital it needed. Finding and training the right people, Mr. Paulson said, was a bigger challenge than securing capital.
Nevertheless, Mr. Corzine and Mr. Paulson, who took over the running of the partnership in September 1994, when Goldman was experiencing one of its most difficult years, said that they wanted to review the firm's capital structure.
At the meetings this weekend, Mr. Corzine also reportedly talked to partners about Goldman's strategy for 1996, and there was a special focus on Asian business. Goldman is apparently optimistic about prospects for the coming months, and its leaders believe that the strong momentum the firm built up in 1995, when profit rebounded, is continuing.
Goldman's leaders apparently also believe that there is a good prospect of lower interest rates and do not expect a recession soon in the United States.

HEADLINE: THE FLOODING AFTER THE STORM: THE OVERVIEW;
Flooding Called Worst in Decades

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Swollen rivers and streams across the New York and mid-Atlantic regions receded yesterday as tens of thousands of evacuated residents returned to flood-ravaged homes and businesses in eight states, and public officials began to assess the costs of the worst flooding in decades.
But the danger had not passed everywhere. Some 10,000 residents were still being evacuated yesterday from West Virginia towns along the surging Ohio River. About 1,100 homes on Wheeling Island, at Wheeling, were under six feet of water, their 3,000 occupants still refugees. So were the 700 residents of Port Deposit, Md., in the shadow of an overflowing river dam. 
 From Virginia to New York, there were tales of tragedy, survival, oddity and hardship: five members of a New York family were killed when a road washed away and their car plunged into a reservoir; a Maryland mud slide, like lava, engulfed six car dealerships; driftwood decorated a bridge in upstate New York, and the Governor of Pennsylvania was forced to evacuate his mansion.
And the new Mayor in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., who has seen two huge snowstorms and a flood since his inauguration three weeks ago, was marveling at the wonders of public service. "I don't know what to expect next, maybe a volcano eruption," said Mayor Tom McGroarty, whose town narrowly escaped inundation after almost all its 90,000 residents were evacuated over the weekend.
No immediate estimate of the mid-Atlantic's flood damage was available, but experts said it would probably add tens of millions of dollars to the burden that states, cities and families are bearing for the Blizzard of '96, which shut down much of the East under two to three feet of snow earlier this month.
Deep into a winter that has brought heavy snows, bitter cold, pounding rains and a January thaw that suddenly melted the mountainous snowpack across eight states, weekend floods added another misery for thousands along the great tree of eastern waterways: the Susquehanna, the Delaware, the Monongahela, the Ohio, the Allegheny, the Potomac and other rivers and their latticework tributaries.
As the engorged rivers crested and fell, the toll of death and damage began to emerge, and emergency officials in many areas called it the worst flooding since Tropical Storm Agnes in 1972, which killed 48 people and left 220,000 homeless in Pennsylvania alone, or Hurricane Eloise, which caused 44 deaths and hundreds of millions in damage from the Caribbean to New England in 1975.
Since Friday's heavy rains and unseasonal warmth, which unleashed the melting and flooding, at least 35 weather-related deaths have been reported in the East, 10 of them in New York State. Five people are missing.
While many rivers and streams crested above flood stage, all did not overflow their banks and many areas were spared. But flood damage was heavy in dozens of locales, including Pittsburgh; Wilkes-Barre; Cumberland, Md.; Wheeling, W.Va., and the devastated little village of Walton, N.Y., where almost every home and business was severely damaged.
Lesser damage was reported in Trenton, where the Delaware flowed into a newly renovated State House Annex and parking garage; in Washington; Harrisburg, Pa.; Port Jervis, N.Y.; Wayne, N.J.; Bucks County, Pa., and scores of small towns and rural areas from Virginia to upstate New York.
In the most severely flooded areas, refugees from the surging water returned to find homes and businesses partly submerged or caked in mud. Many roads and bridges were out. Power was off in many areas, telephone lines were down, some sewage plants had failed and debris littered streets that had run like rivers.
Pennsylvania appeared to have been hit hardest, and President Clinton yesterday declared the state a Federal disaster area, making available temporary housing, individual family and home repair grants, disaster unemployment benefits and low-interest loans for affected businesses and homeowners.
"It was very clear that the need was there," James Le Witt, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said after members of his staff made a flying survey of the state. He immediately designated six counties eligible for relief and said more would be added as damage assessments were made. "With the amount of homes that were flooded, businesses and communities affected, it was absolutely clear that some Federal help was needed," Mr. Le Witt added.
Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who had asked that 58 of the 67 counties be included in the disaster declaration, called the aid inadequate and said he would seek more. Mr. Ridge, who fled the Governor's mansion with his family Saturday night as floods in Harrisburg closed in, ordered state offices under his jurisdiction closed today in Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. The Legislature canceled sessions for the week as many roads were closed and Amtrak service between Philadelphia and Harrisburg was suspended.
Downtown Pittsburgh was inundated by its worst flooding in two decades. A park and many streets became vast lakes, and hundreds of homes and businesses were damaged by the overflowing Ohio, Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers. The sewage system in Allegheny County was shut down. Water also spilled into Three Rivers Stadium, but the Steelers' Super Bowl gear for next Sunday was saved.
At the other end of the state, nearly all of the 100,000 evacuted residents of flood-plain areas of the Susquehanna, including most of the 90,000 people of Wilkes-Barre, went home yesterday. For almost 24 hours, Wilkes-Barre had lived in fear that the river would breach its dikes, but it overflowed in only a few areas.
Still, hundreds of returning evacuees yesterday found damaged homes and businesses, and many spent the day pumping water, scraping away mud and surveying ruined furniture and wrecked premises. Utilities had been turned off in most areas of the city, and many homes were still without power or heat.
In Washington, the Potomac poured over its banks in some areas, causing what was expected to be the worst flooding in the nation's capital in a decade. Some streets in historic Georgetown and other sections of the city were under water. City officials rerouted buses, closed a bridge to Virginia and peppered the citizenry with warnings.
In New York, Gov. George E. Pataki declared a state of emergency in 22 upstate counties as widespread flooding and mud slides were reported. Ten weather-related deaths were reported across the state -- two people trapped in a flooded Schoharie County house died of exposure, a Schenectady man was caught in a mud slide that engulfed a gas station and the rest died in traffic accidents.
In Delaware County, 40 miles east of Binghamton, a roadway collapsed and four cars plunged into the Cannonsville Reservoir in the Town of Tompkins. A family of five was killed and another man was missing. But several people were rescued in the incident, including a police officer who spent 20 minutes trapped in an air pocket in his car before getting out.
In the nearby village of Walton, hundreds of homes and businesses -- virtually every structure in town -- were five feet deep in floodwaters over the weekend. Yesterday, as the three Delaware River tributaries that run through the village receded, residents pumped out cellars and surveyed the damage. "The heart of the village is in really bad shape," Mayor Jack Kelly said.
He recalled how firefighters, at the height of the flooding, stood waist-deep in water on the main street and battled flames that eventually destroyed clothing and hardware stores. Old-timers recalled that the village had been deluged in 1935 but said this weekend's flooding was worse.
Thousands of residents were evacuated in other upstate New York communities, including Campbell and Erwin on the Cohocton River; Addison, Cameron and Canisteo on the Canisteo River; Schoharie on Schoharie Creek, and Wellsville on the Genesee. In Port Jervis, six feet of water flooded low-lying homes.
In New Jersey, thousands who had been evacuated, some by boat, returned to their homes yesterday in Warren and Mercer Counties, and smaller numbers to homes they had left in Bergen, Burlington, Passaic and Somerset Counties. The most serious flooding was along the Delaware north of New Hope, near Frenchtown on the New Jersey side and Tinicum Township on the Pennsylvania side, and in Manville, N.J., where 400 homes were flooded in the worst deluge since Tropical Strom Doria in 1971.
In Trenton, floodwaters entered the garage of the State House Annex, apparently bubbling up through a storm drain. Three feet of water submerged the garage's lower level and threatened heating, electrical and air-conditioning systems of the annex, which might have been shut down for weeks without power. Firefighters and the National Guard used pumps and sandbags to save the day.
Perils continued yesterday in parts of West Virginia and Maryland. On Wheeling Island, an enclave of Wheeling where all 1,100 homes were flooded by the Ohio River and many residents were still staying in shelters or the homes of friends or relatives, Carl Bradford, director of the West Virginia Office of Emergency Services, said:
"This is a miserable time to flood. We've had temperatures in the 20's and teens. The water goes down and the house is full of ice."
Some 10,000 residents were still being evacuated from towns along the flooding Ohio on West Virginia's western edge. The river crested at 10 feet above flood stage at Wheeling, but the crest still had to traverse hundreds of miles and was not expected to reach the state's southern border until tomorrow.
Rains and runoff pushed a thick mud slide through a commercial district of Cumberland, Md., burying a series of car dealerships. "Every car on every lot of six car dealerships was destroyed," said Cpl. Steve Winiger of the state police.

HEADLINE: Mexico City Journal;
Mariachis of Mexico Are Living the Blues

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Though it was still early in the night, the temperature was 38 degrees and dropping. The trumpeter's lips were blue and the fiddler could barely bend his fingers. One stumbling patron ordered up a string of songs and then got so drunk he could not be coaxed to pay. The musicians were tempted to roll him and seize their fee. Glumly, they let him go.
They had reached the depths of mariachi misery. 
 These are bitter times for the street-corner musicians-for-hire known as mariachis, whose trumpet choruses and silver-buttoned suits are trademarks of Mexican nationalism. An unsparing year-old economic crisis has left Mexicans with precious little extra cash to buy a sweetheart's serenade or a musical Mother's Day homage.
At the same time, mariachi groups are besieged with competition from other styles, especially tropical dance rhythms and norteno music from the United States border region with its boisterous sagas of bumbling cops and heroic cocaine traffickers.
If that was not enough, for more than a month the nighttime cold here in the capital, site of the Plaza Garibaldi, the main place in Mexico where mariachis congregate to wait for customers, has been cruelly biting.
Both the music and uniform of the mariachi are symbols of a stubbornly independent and macho but also sentimental Mexican identity. Their suits, inspired by rural rodeos, are bolero jackets, silk bow-ties, tight pants with silver buttons down the sides and often a flashy pistol. For fancy occasions they don huge velvet-lined sombreros. They play ranchera music, sometimes plaintive and sometimes spirited hymns to the romantic conquests and humiliations of everyday Mexicans.
The tradition of mariachi music, which originated in west-central Mexico in the 1850's, is an intimate part of Mexican family life. (The word mariachi, whose origins are in dispute, is a 19th-century term referring to a party.) While most other Latin countries have adopted some version of the American "Happy Birthday," Mexicans sing a mariachi song. Many Mexican men still bring along a mariachi band when making a marriage proposal. Baptisms, weddings and other rites of passage are accompanied by mariachi brass and the thump of the big acoustic bass guitar.
"Mexicans have a deep need for music to be present in their emotional moments, to vent either a great joy or a great sorrow," said Jesus Jauregui of the National Institute of Anthropology and History, who has written a book about mariachis. "The mariachi is there to play in person to satisfy the urgent needs of the soul of the customer."
Mariachi music thrived in periods when nationalist fervor surged. During the revolutionary turmoil after 1910, Mexican insurgents brought rural mariachi bands with them to the capital to demonstrate their commitment to local culture. In the 1960's and 70's, when anti-Americanism ran high, mariachis prospered.
Today, most Mexicans are too beleaguered by financial hardship and uncertain about their future to celebrate their nationality. So the nights in the Plaza Garibaldi can get very long.
"There are nights when we earn something and nights when we earn exactly nothing," said Javier Solis Junior, a soulful singer in a maroon sombrero who has worked in Garibaldi for 12 years. Some musicians confessed they had stooped to the ultimate indignity for a professional mariachi: a day job.
Many bars ringing the plaza have switched from mariachis to electric bands that play Caribbean dance music, leaving the mariachis quite literally out in the cold. Last week, a bar called the Mariachi Corner featured a salsa band, blaring its music into the plaza.
"It's an abomination," said Jonathan Clark, an American from California whose love of the music led him to play with mariachi groups in the Plaza Garibaldi for more than a decade. "Before, no one ever put a loudspeaker out. It ruins the plaza and makes it impossible for the mariachis to work."
In the 1980's the zone around Garibaldi descended into disrepute as muggers worked over tourists and brothels spread. To clean things up, the Government almost killed the mariachis with kindness by sponsoring a project to dig up the plaza for an underground garage, recently completed after a three-year ordeal.
Authentic musicians are battling pirate mariachis who peddle cut-rate services by accosting cars on the avenues that lead to Garibaldi. "They're lousy musicians and they don't wear the costume with dignity," grumbled Ismael Gutierrez, a singer with a handlebar moustache.
Mariachis have been forced to adapt their music to modern tastes without sacrificing their sound. They have purloined spicy tropical dance beats, norteno ballads, weeping romantic trio songs, even rock tunes if customers ask.
"We can play anything," said Jose Serafin Ruiz, leader of a band called the Mariachi Zihualteco. "We are here to please the people who listen to us, not to satisfy ourselves."
Paradoxically, Mexican mariachis are at a low point just as their music has become popular internationally. Mariachi groups have been formed in 40 countries, including Aruba and Japan.
Even in Mexico, the desire for mariachis is depressed but hardly defunct. Last year Mexican television networks, which were ignoring the mariachis, were shamed by the success of a nighttime soap opera produced in Colombia with mariachi theme music and characters.
"If someone really feels Mexican music, all it takes is a tequila or two to bring it back," Roberto Lopez Olvera, a guitar player, said confidently.
In fact, just when the plaza seemed unbearable to the musicians, a group of jubilant elderly women appeared. They had come to Mexico City from the provinces to visit the shrine of Mexico's patron Virgin of Guadalupe. Their husbands were at home and they had cash to burn.
"Mariachis can never die!" proclaimed Esperanza Mora Navarro, 63, as she stepped into the ring of musicians for a fast-kicking dance. She ordered up obscure songs from her home state and Mr. Gutierrez knew them all. He took off with a yodeling croon and, under his mustache, a big, satisfied smile.

HEADLINE: A DEFAULT THREAT IS HINTED AS WAY TO SETTLE BUDGET

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
In the latest Republican effort to revive the party's stymied economic and social agendas, the House majority leader, Dick Armey, said today that Congress would refuse to extend the nation's ability to borrow money to meet its bills unless President Clinton yields to the party's budget-cutting initiatives to decrease "the size and intrusiveness of government."
The position outlined by Mr. Armey of Texas, a close ally of Speaker Newt Gingrich, signaled that the Republicans might be willing to use the threat of national default to force Mr. Clinton to give more ground. Mr. Armey's comments on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" came just a day before Congress goes back into session. 
 His position directly contradicted assurances given the past week by other Republican leaders -- including Mr. Gingrich and Representative John R. Kasich, the chairman of the House Budget Committee -- that a way would be found to make sure the Government paid its obligations, from interest on the debt to Social Security to veteran's benefits.
Mr. Gingrich could not be reached for comment on Mr. Armey's statement. And it was not known what kind of conditions the Speaker or Mr. Kasich of Ohio or other Republican leaders might be willing to place on an increase in the debt limit. But there are signs of sharp disagreement in the Republican ranks, and Mr. Armey is known for having an accurate reading of where the most conservative members stand.
For Mr. Clinton, any delay or prolonged debate over raising the nation's borrowing authority would have the same effect as no increase at all: It would force the Treasury Department to find new techniques -- including some that the Clinton Administration itself has said may be of uncertain legality -- to raise cash to keep paying its bondholders. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has said that the country would run out of money around Feb. 15.
Mr. Rubin's fear -- but, in a way, his greatest weapon against the Republicans -- is that the bond markets would suddenly conclude that the threat of default is quite real. That would likely result in a surge in the interest rates that the world markets charge the United States to borrow money -- an increase that would ripple through the economy, sending mortgage rates and other major interest rates higher.
Already, the nation's two biggest credit rating agencies, Moody's and Standard and Poor's, have warned that the United States's AAA credit rating could be at risk. Traditionally, American Treasury securities have been regarded as the world's least-risky investment, but that judgment, and the cost of borrowing, could change dramatically if investors concluded that gridlock in Washington could delay the Government's ability to pay them on time.
Mr. Rubin has made clear that he has a plan to evade the $4.9 trillion debt limit. But he has refused to discuss the details publicly, in part because lawyers for the Treasury and Justice Departments are still working on legal justifications for such steps. "Clearly, we're in terra nova," Mr. Rubin said recently, "and this is not something we can do indefinitely."
So Mr. Rubin's challenge is to simultaneously reassure the markets and scare the Republicans, convincing them they will be blamed for undermining America's credit rating. But the big question is how long Mr. Rubin can maintain this approach, and whether evading the debt limit would begin to exact a political cost on Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Rubin said through a spokesman that he did not want to respond to Mr. Armey's comments today. But appearing on the same television show, Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said that it was "disturbing" that "the Republicans are going to hold the debt ceiling hostage to their agenda."
The Texas Republican said that Congress would not shut the Government down again, as it did twice last year. Instead, he suggested that a "continuing resolution" would be passed to keep Government operations running for 30 days or so, though with considerably less money for many agencies.
He made it clear that, in his view, no effort to get a "clean debt limit increase" through Congress -- that is, one with no conditions -- would succeed.
"John Kasich's willingness to vote for it to the contrary," said Mr. Armey, "it's not coming through the House unless it carries with it something that is a substantial share of our agenda of decreasing the size and the intrusiveness of government."
"We have a House that is committed to getting this job done, and we're going to use every instrument we can to move the ball forward," he said.
For several months now, Mr. Rubin has stymied Republican efforts to use the debt limit as a weapon to force the President to accede on the budget. He has accomplished that by "disinvesting" two Government pension funds -- in essence, selling the securities held in those funds and replacing them with i.o.u.'s to repay the principal and interest. The i.o.u.'s do not count against the debt limit, though they are essentially a Government obligation. Congress gave the Treasury Secretary that power in the 1980's when Democrats were using the debt limit to force action by President Ronald Reagan, and it guaranteed the Government would restore lost principle or interest.
Despite that legislative guarantee, Republican leaders have already accused Mr. Rubin of "raiding" Government pension funds, a term Mr. Armey used again today. "Secretary Rubin has been extremely ingenious at how he's been able to get into people's retirement funds and grab up that money to keep the Government running," he said.
But Mr. Rubin has now used as much of the pension money as he legally can. Other options -- making use of other Government money, selling or leasing the Government's gold supplies, calling in more Government deposits held in commercial banks or kept in foreign currencies -- have substantial legal impediments.
By forcing Mr. Rubin to take extraordinary steps, the Republicans hope to make considerable political gains. If they could convince the public that Mr. Rubin is manipulating public money, they could prompt a backlash against the Administration. Some conservative Republicans have even suggested beginning impeachment hearings against the Treasury Secretary for exceeding his authority, but the Republican leadership fears that could backfire.
The Republicans also could load up a debt limit increase with conditions they know President Clinton would find unacceptable. If he vetoes that increase, Republican strategists figure, he would bear the blame for whatever financial chaos follows.
Today, Mr. Armey said he would support linking the debt limit increase to a commitment to eliminate the Commerce Department, a periodic priority of the Republican Congress, and preventing the Treasury secretary from "ever again raiding the trust funds of Federal workers' retirement programs."
In other words, in order to get a temporary debt increase, Mr. Clinton would have to agree to tie Mr. Rubin's hands in the future. That is a deal the White House has said repeatedly it would not accept.

HEADLINE: Michigan Welfare Plan Draws Unlikely Support

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Gov. John Engler of Michigan is known in Washington as a zealous lobbyist for overhauling welfare who has turned up there 21 times in the last year and is sometimes mentioned as a Republican Vice-Presidential prospect.
But in his home state, Governor Engler is pursuing changes in welfare policy that are pleasing the Clinton Administration more than his Republican allies on Capitol Hill. 
 The Democrats' unlikely and somewhat unwilling hero announced an ambitious pilot project on Wednesday that seeks to cut welfare costs by providing generous social services so that poor people can go to work. Democrats call his plan enlightened. Republicans have been caught off guard.
Mr. Engler's plan may change the shape of the welfare debate because many governors, increasingly expected to design their own programs, are looking for guidance. Michigan, Wisconsin and Massachusetts are at the forefront of the search to make welfare programs less costly by finding jobs for those without work.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said the plan showed that "sanity may be returning to this debate." He praised Mr. Engler for breaking with Congressional Republicans by using child care and transportation subsidies and fashioning a more active role for social workers in an effort to turn welfare recipients into workers.
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich was delighted with the Michigan plan.
"The Engler approach appears to be fundamentally different than the Republican approach in Congress and much closer to the President," he said.
Mr. Engler's fellow Republicans say his plan is a terrific example of their push to give power back to the states by allowing them to shape their own welfare programs. But they have moved quickly to distance themselves from the specifics.
"It may not be the way we want to go in Pennsylvania," said Senator Rick Santorum, the conservative Pennsylvania Republican who managed the welfare debate on the Senate floor last year.
Mr. Santorum said he favored strict limits on the number of years that anyone could receive welfare, whether the person had found a job or not. The Michigan plan has no such time limits, although Mr. Engler has said he is considering them.
Even William F. Weld, the moderate Republican Governor of Massachusetts, said he would not try to follow the Engler example. "This is a generous plan on the part of John Engler," Mr. Weld said. But, he added, "I like a sterner approach" that requires work -- the Michigan plan allows community service for those who cannot find jobs -- and that throws people off welfare rolls after a certain time.
The Michigan plan, which takes effect on April 1, is called Project Zero because its aim is to reduce unemployment to zero among welfare recipients. It will start as a pilot program in a Detroit suburb, a poor Detroit neighborhood and four rural counties. As part of the program, Michigan will send social workers into the homes of every welfare recipient in those six areas and offer them help in finding jobs, along with subsidized child care and transportation to work. If the pilot effort shows itself to be successful after a year, Governor Engler hopes to expand it statewide.
Those who refuse to try to find jobs would lose all of their benefits almost immediately, provided that Congress and the President reach a compromise soon that would give states the discretion to cut off benefits. But at that point the Engler plan diverges from other Republican proposals. Welfare recipients who cannot find work will be required to perform unpaid community service to keep receiving checks. Most Congressional Republicans have favored requirements that recipients get jobs, and would cut off benefits after five years for recipients who had not worked.
Also unlike legislation supported by Congressional Republicans, the Michigan approach allows payments for children born to women already receiving welfare.
In response to unwanted compliments from Democrats, Mr. Engler is talking tough about how he will kick welfare recipients off the rolls if they do not participate in his jobs program. "It won't be five years now, it will be a month if they miss their appointments," the Governor said.
Stung by criticism that his plan is not conservative enough, Mr. Engler took pains in a telephone interview on Friday to say that he supported on principle some of the more severe restrictions on welfare benefits advocated by Congressional Republicans, but did not have the authority to put them into effect. "There are significant limitations on what we can do because of limits under Federal laws," he explained.
He said his preference would be to cut off all benefits to welfare recipients who had not found work in two to five years. But he said that he had not decided whether to cut off benefits to babies born to mothers already on welfare even if Congressional Republicans make it possible for him to do so.
And while liberals see his child care and transportation subsidies as a sign of enlightened policy tastes, Mr. Engler describes them differently: "We've used that to eliminate excuses from welfare recipients" who complain they cannot work.
But some prominent conservatives have agreed with the Clinton Administration that the Michigan welfare plan resembled programs more often put forward by Democrats.
"This is Bill Clinton's plan," said Charles A. Murray, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group in Washington and an author whose works link race, genetics and I.Q.
Nonpartisan welfare policy experts, including some who have criticized other Republican initiatives, have been intrigued by Michigan's experiment.
"This meets the public's interest in both protecting children and getting tough on parents," said Judith M. Gueron, president of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a nonprofit policy research group based in New York.
"This could have real reverberations at a state level," Ms. Gueron said. "States have the opportunity to recast the safety net, and Michigan is doing that in a way that really pays attention to what the message from the public has been on welfare reform."
Republican reaction has been more cautious. "Governor Engler's actions show that governors need flexibility -- what works in Michigan may not work in California," said Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican.
But Mr. Wilson praised the Engler plan as showing that states given more power to shape welfare programs will not "race to the bottom, as has been suggested by opponents to welfare reform," but would "develop new approaches designed to address the root causes of welfare dependency and to help recipients become self-sufficient."
Senator Spencer Abraham, a Michigan Republican and close ally of Mr. Engler, made a similar point. "One of the arguments we have had to go up against is that the states would be less compassionate" in dealing with the poor, he said. But Michigan's effort will genuinely help the poor, he said.
Mr. Abraham said that while conservatives may often oppose giving government too active a role, making Michigan's welfare workers more active might not be a bad idea. Michigan welfare workers typically spend two-thirds of their time filling out required paperwork, rather than working with welfare recipients, Mr. Abraham said, and Mr. Engler is right to send them into homes more frequently.
Mr. Moynihan said the Engler plan, with its open-ended commitment to provide welfare to anyone who at least expressed a desire to work, was simply more practical than other Republican approaches to welfare. "To impose a five-year time limit on the city of Detroit, where two-thirds of the children are on Aid to Families with Dependent Children, would invite social ruin," he said.

HEADLINE: California's Universities Confront New Diversity Rules

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Now that the University of California has reaffirmed its decision to use social and economic disadvantage, not race and sex, as criteria in hiring and admissions, the state's nine campuses face the difficult task of deciding which applicants will get preference.
The University's Board of Regents, which said it still wanted to pursue ethnic and racial diversity in hiring faculty, admitting students and awarding contracts, has issued guidelines to the nine campuses. Now the individual campuses must decide how to apply those guidelines in admitting students. 
Under the guidelines, 50 percent of the applicants would be admitted solely on academic achievement. But up to half the applicants meeting minimum academic requirements would then be evaluated based on what the Regents call "special circumstances."
Those circumstances include whether a student has shown unusual persistence and determination, needs to work, is from a socially or educationally disadvantaged environment or has a difficult family situation. All decisions will be made by college admissions officers.
"It really is going to boil down to a judgment call," said Charles A. Ratliff, deputy director of the California Postsecondary Education Commission, an independent state agency that provides information about higher education.
"You start with the traditional academic criteria, and then the question is whether one set of personal circumstances is more or less valuable than a different set," he said. "It's doable, but it sounds far more labor-intensive, and many wonder what is the hidden cost of moving to this gender- and race-blind approach to diversifying."
Among those who have questioned the approach are the faculty members and students who protested outside the Regents meeting last week in an 11th-hour effort to persuade the board to reinstate the traditional affirmative action policies. They argued that the new policy would reverse years of progress toward racial diversity and would saddle admissions officers with the unusual burden of deciding who was disadvantaged. New admissions policies will be used to select freshmen entering in 1997; revised hiring policies for faculty took effect on Jan. 1.
In July, when the Regents first approved the new approach to affirmative action, one special circumstance that admissions officers were asked to use as a criterion was whether a student is from "an abusive or otherwise dysfunctional home."
"The idea of measuring 'dysfunctionality' is a bureaucratic nightmare," said Jerome Karabel, a professor of sociology at Berkeley who opposes the Regents' action.
Keith F. Widaman, a professor of psychology at the Riverside campus and a member of a task force that helped the Regents develop their guidelines, agreed. "Most of us thought that was kind of bizarre," Mr. Widaman said. "What teen-ager doesn't think they come from a dysfunctional family?"
Instead, when the Regents gave their final guidelines to the campuses, the criterion "dysfunctional home" was replaced with "difficult family situations."
The campuses are now reviewing the Regents' guidelines and will develop new admissions policies in the next year, barring any successful challenges to the policy. Despite the protests on Thursday, the Regents rejected motions that would have delayed or overturned their new approach to affirmative action.
Beyond the potentially muddy task of sorting through a student's psychological difficulties, other criteria for identifying disadvantaged students could also pose dilemmas, educators said.
Economic disadvantage would seem to be clearly determined by a family's income level, parents' educational level and the applicant's neighborhood. But in deciding whether a student is poor, some suggest that there is an important distinction between the "newly poor," like students whose parents were among the thousands laid off from Air Force bases in Southern California, and students who have always been poor and at more of a disadvantage.
"There is no easy way to do this," Mr. Widaman said. "The campuses are going to have to figure it out."
Those developing new admissions policies said applications would include more personal essays, which could provide insight into an applicant's experiences and struggles.
On the current application, which is used for all nine campuses, students are asked to write a personal statement; part of the instructions say, "If you have faced unusual circumstances, challenges or hardships, describe them and how you have responded."
The new applications are expected to be more direct and to include a supplemental questionnaire that would ask students to describe their life circumstances in detail.
"Instead of discussing the job you had, we are going to need to know if you had to work to supplement family income or to pay for the car insurance on the BMW that mommy bought you," Mr. Widaman said.

HEADLINE: Ranchers Hurt By Steep Drop In Beef Prices

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: CASPER, Wyo., Jan. 21

 BODY:
In the 1980's, falling beef prices led to the failure of thousands of ranches, with more than 80,000 ranches disappearing from 1986 through 1990.
Now, many ranches are again at risk. Responding to an oversupply of beef, cattle prices have plunged about 35 percent in the last three years, threatening a replay of the 1980's. 
 "The cattle market has just fallen through the floor," said Jim Hendry, co-owner of the 150,000-acre Clear Creek Ranch, 60 miles west of Casper. "There seems to be no slowing up. It's in a free fall. There will be a washout before this is done."
Some ranches are already being forced by their lenders to liquidate, with the prospects of more to come, with no quick way for the cattle industry to overcome an excess of beef. High prices early in the decade spurred too much production, which is why the United States is now awash in record supplies of beef. Economists predict two more years of low prices before supplies begin to fall into line with demand.
The financial pain afflicting ranchers is very likely to be felt in other industries as cattle producers curtail capital costs to stay afloat. When beef prices are strong, many of the nation's 900,000 ranchers buy pickup trucks and heavy equipment, and build new corrals and barns. When prices plunge, those expenditures are put on hold.
"Most of our costs are fixed costs," said Mr. Hendry's son, Rob, a co-owner who oversees day-to-day operations. "You can't cut them." But big-ticket purchases can be put off, and that is exactly what Rob Hendry plans to do.
While ranchers suffer, consumers are getting a break. Many supermarkets are slashing beef prices, sometimes taking as much as 25 percent to 50 percent off 1993 prices, the National Cattlemen's Association reports.
Making the problem worse is a general meat glut nationwide -- too much pork and too much chicken as well, along with low-cost Mexican cattle. The devaluation of the peso has made Mexican beef a bargain. As a result, Mexican cattle are being imported to feedlots in the United States where they are fattened and slaughtered, adding to the supply, the Cattlemen's Association reported.
"There are record supplies of meat," said Chuck Lambert, the economist for the Cattlemen's Association. "There's a lot of competiton for consumer meat dollars."
In 1993, ranchers were selling steers for an average of $1.03 a pound. The price fell to 93 cents in 1994 and continued to drop almost every month through 1995. By the end of the year, ranchers were getting just 68 cents a pound, and the price could go lower.
Ranchers with low debts are likely to survive, but those with high debts are at risk, Mr. Lambert said. "The longer it drags on, the lower prices go, the more likely we are to see a greater percentage of failures," he said.
Neal Hilston, a ranch real estate broker here, said he had recently listed a 90,000-acre ranch for sale because the bank declined to renew its loans. If depressed beef prices stay low for through 1997, as economists expect, Mr. Hilston said, "More and more people will come to the end of their line of credit, and more and more ranch properties will come on the market.
"Eventually land prices will fall," said Mr. Hilston, recalling the 1980's when ranchland prices dropped about 50 percent, with prices varying depending on the sites. As the crash in the 1980's worsened, the fallout hit agricultural lenders who were stuck with growing inventories of land. "A lot of lenders took property back and then couldn't resell it for the money they had against it," he said.
Longtime ranchers have seen it all before. The Clear Creek Ranch, for example, has been in the Hendry family since 1912. Since then, successive generations of Hendrys survived the Depression and a series of post World War II beef price swings.
The Hendrys expect to ride out this cycle as well, but Jim Hendry said the lower beef prices would claim some ranches. "I just hope to goodness we're not one of them," he said.

Jobless Rate Jumps to 7.3%

BYLINE: By SUSAN JO KELLER 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
When it comes to jobs, the news in New Jersey recently has not been good. On Friday, the Federal Government announced that the state's unemployment rate jumped to 7.3 percent in December from 6.1 percent in November; that translates into 295,000 people without jobs.
Those figures, of course, do not reflect the 7,000 layoffs that AT&T began last week. 
 Today Commerce Commissioner Gualberto Medina will press a Senate committee for fast action on two bills designed to create jobs.
One measure would provide relocation aid to companies that move to New Jersey and create at least 25 new full-time jobs.
The second bill would give grants to businesses that create new jobs; the grants would be based on a percentage of state income taxes generated by the new workers.
The bills passed the Senate Natural Resources, Trade and Economic Development Committee last session but died when the full Senate did not vote on them.
Other Senate committees will be discussing whether motorcyclists should wear helmets, whether hospitals can use vacant beds to provide the kind of care now limited to nursing homes and whether illegal aliens should be eligible for workers' compensation.

HEADLINE: Young Turks and Plain English

BYLINE: By Laura Ingraham; Laura Ingraham, a lawyer, writes frequently about politics.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Stars like Tony Bennett, Rod Stewart and Eric Clapton found new fame with "Unplugged" albums, which feature tracks uncluttered by electronic enhancements. Politicians can learn from this. Last week, a group of freshmen Republican senators led by Spence Abraham of Michigan set off from Washington on a national bus tour to take a plain-talk conservative message to the people. Call it Conservative Young Turks, Unplugged.
The senators hit the heartland because recent polls show that the shine is off the Republicans' apple. Here are three steps they should take to get back to basics. 
 Speak a new language. Most Democrats concede that they were caught flat-footed during much of the first "100 days" when Speaker Newt Gingrich and his oxen were plowing through the Contract With America. Welfare, tort and tax reform were debated within a conservative framework and in plain language.
Today, however, Republicans squander precious time on news talk shows debating the merits of C.B.O. versus O.M.B. numbers or what sort of inflation rate should be used to calculate COLA's.
President Clinton, accompanied by thousands of tiny violins, soars above such details and simply vows not to balance the budget "on the backs of our children, our poor and our elderly." Too smart to waste any opportunity to bond with the public, the President uses his bully pulpit to cast the budget battle as a struggle between the Great Protector (himself) and the Great Wrecking Balls (Speaker Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole).
Like the President, Republicans should eradicate wonk-speak. They should talk about entrepreneurship and empowerment. Republicans should remind Americans that Democrats have nothing to offer but a white-knuckled grip on the status quo, and that their "answers" demand more taxpayer money to finance more government bureaucracy.
Get off the defensive. On Sunday talk shows, Republicans are insisting: "We're not really cutting this! We're not really cutting that." But wasn't that the whole point of taking over Congress? Republicans promised to free up individual enterprise by pruning the gnarled vines of the Federal bureaucracy.
Republicans have also bollixed their case for welfare reform. Welfare is not bad because it's expensive. It's bad because it's destructive. Democrats call it a safety net. Republicans should call it an unscalable wall. Then they should ask David Bonior, the House minority whip, to justify maintaining a system that has left the underclass burdened with illegitimate births and violent crime.
The other side's numbers make the point. The Children's Defense Fund says that 12 million American children go hungry every year. This is what $5 trillion of Federal welfare spending bought over 30 years.
Use new messengers. Turn on the television set, and you'll find that Republicans are almost always represented by Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Dole. It's understandable that Bob Dole wants media coverage during Campaign '96, but he and his party could reap major electoral benefits if they regularly passed the microphone to new, young, energetic leaders in the House like Susan Molinari, J. C. Watts and Christopher Cox, who can demolish the stereotype of Republicans as humorless country clubbers.
By using new messengers and sharpening their arguments, Republicans could play to packed houses again. One thing is for sure: They can't wait for a Presidential nominee to rescue them from themselves.

Stubborn Inequality

BYLINE: By DOROTHY J. SAMUELS 

 BODY:
Two decades ago, in a distant life, I was hired fresh out of law school to be a starting associate at a large Wall Street law firm. A year later, I left to pursue other adventures. But I retain fond memories of my brief high-paying apprenticeship in big-time corporate law. The firm was a surprisingly friendly place, and working there satisfied a wonky interest in the intricacies of the Federal tax code, and an ambition, stemming from my 60's upbringing, to be part of important social change.
This, recall, was 1976. Thanks largely to the women's movement, hard-won changes in discrimination law and the not unrelated boom in the number of women attending law school, major private firms were making a concerted effort to open their doors to women. At the point I showed up for work, along with a handful of other women more obviously suited for the enterprise, my firm's crowded letterhead included just one female associate and no female partners. That made us pioneers of sorts. The thought that we were helping to advance the cause of women's equality imbued even my low-level work on drab tax-shelter deals with a sense of larger social purpose. 
 Though it was concededly not the stuff of civil rights legend, I did make one tangible contribution. My boycott of the firm's monthly associates' luncheon, held at an all-male private club, helped persuade the partners in charge to switch the gatherings to a more welcoming place. It was a big victory, back then. I sensed that the day when women would be fully integrated into the work and profits of big firm life was not far off.
I was wrong. A new report by an American Bar Association panel carries the reminder that all these years later bias against women remains entrenched in the legal profession, with resulting inequities in pay and opportunities. This, despite the impressive surge in the number of women lawyers. The report points to the discouraging law firm scene portrayed last year in a study of eight large law firms by the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. It found women actually losing ground in the law firm retrenchment following the expansion of the high-flying 1980's, with the partnership rate for women falling even further behind the rate for men.
Curious, I checked the latest Martindale-Hubbell listing. In a development I like to think unrelated to my departure, my old law firm has grown bigger and more prosperous. By my count, there are now 92 partners. Nine are women -- progress, to be sure, but hardly the equality revolution I expected way back when.
What happened? Both bar reports cite a complex mix of factors, including subtle and not-so-subtle prejudice and harmful gender stereotyping. They also cite even harder to address obstacles beyond the tightening law firm economy, like punishing work demands and an ethos that requires attorneys to show they are partner-ready by logging an inhumane number of billable hours. This is hard on everyone. It works a special hardship on women, who, after all, still share the brunt of family responsibility in our society -- a problem not isolated, of course, to the legal profession. Addressing the problem should not remain just a woman's burden.
I guess I am getting old. When I was a new attorney just starting out, changing the world seemed a lot simpler. DOROTHY J. SAMUELS

HEADLINE: A Promising Palestinian Election

 BODY:
Saturday's elections for a Palestinian president and a legislative council marked another milestone toward peaceful coexistence between self-governing Israeli and Palestinian communities. The voting extended the evolution of the Palestine Liberation Organization from a guerrilla movement to an elected party of government and conferred a mandate of democratic legitimacy on the P.L.O.'s longtime leader, Yasir Arafat.
Mr. Arafat's election as President of the Interim Self-Government was a foregone conclusion. Facing only token opposition, he drew 88 percent of the vote. The legislative contests were more interesting. Nearly 700 candidates ran for the 88 seats, 7 of which were reserved for members of the minority Christian and Samaritan communities. 
 Turnout was encouragingly high, even though the Islamic Hamas movement and radical secular groups boycotted the election to protest Mr. Arafat's compromises with Israel over territory and security arrangements. But some of their members ran as independents, as did P.L.O. activists denied official endorsement. Other independents included figures like Hanan Ashrawi, the main Palestinian spokeswoman during the Madrid and Washington peace talks, who was elected from East Jerusalem.
Incomplete results suggested a significant number of these independents were elected. If these and other legislators take their responsibilities seriously, they could provided a democratic check on Mr. Arafat's previously unchallenged, and frequently abused, authority. The council's powers include deciding on legislation, passing on the budget and overseeing government performance. If the council were to vote no confidence in Mr. Arafat's government, the cabinet would have to resign.
Palestinians see the election as bringing them closer to having their own state. Israel's Labor Government insists that self-rule will not necessarily lead to statehood. It is fair to say that the elections make the prospect of eventual statehood seem more realistic, a point not lost on militant right-wing Jewish settlers.
For the most part these settlers did not follow through on their threats to disrupt the election. A large Israeli military presence may have kept the settlers in line. But in East Jerusalem, Israeli security measures appeared to intimidate Palestinians from voting. After complaints from international election observers, security was eased.
Despite the East Jerusalem tensions, and an assortment of problems at local polling stations, outside observers expressed general satisfaction with the election's conduct.
Israel can best serve its own interest by encouraging the democratic political development of the Palestinian community. If the mature voices of village elders, shopkeepers, doctors and lawyers can now be heard over the shouting of restless young men from the refugee camps, political arguments may gradually shift from the angry streets to the peaceful electoral arena and the overall level of violence may decrease.
America has an interest in helping the self-rule government get established economically and politically. But Washington need not restrain its criticisms of any major security lapses or human rights abuses. The line between restraining terrorism and respecting human rights can be difficult to maintain, but Washington must insist the Palestinian government do so on the West Bank and in Gaza.
Though the path has been bumpy and the timetable frequently set back, Israel's peace agreement with the P.L.O. has now been realized to an extent skeptics once considered impossible. This election brings both sides closer still to the ultimate goal of two self-governed communities living together in peace.

The Defense Anomaly

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The debate about how to balance the budget is distorted by a singular phenomenon. Both sides, President and Congressional Republicans, treat as untouchable one of the biggest spending areas: defense.
At around $265 billion, defense accounts for nearly half of what is called discretionary Federal spending. Congress and the President are doing all their cutting in the other half: domestic and international programs. 
 Military spending has not been made sacrosanct because it is unchallengeable in policy terms. Nor can anyone believe that fraud and waste are unknown there. The reasons for excluding the Pentagon and defense contractors from the budget-exercise are in fact political.
The United States now accounts for 37 percent of the world's annual military spending. We spent more in 1995, discounted for inflation, than we did at the peak of the cold war in 1980. Why?
The policy answer, formulated in the Clinton Administration, is that we must be able to fight two major regional wars simultaneously. But even on that premise it does not follow that we need such huge forces and massive spending on weapons systems. So Lawrence J. Korb, who was Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration, showed in a devastating analysis. He wrote in the November-December issue of Foreign Affairs.
For example, Mr. Korb noted, the Pentagon figured that it would take 400,000 American troops to counter a North Korean invasion of South Korea. That is more than we deployed in the Korean War, when the North was supported by Chinese forces: Highly unlikely to happen now. Moreover, South Korea's army has grown from nothing to a professional force of 650,000. The Pentagon's estimated requirement is grossly inflated.
As for waste, the amount is literally incalculable. That is because financial managers in the Defense Department cannot produce auditable books. The director of its accounting service so testified to a Congressional committee in November. Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said last March that the Pentagon had $33 billion in "problem disbursements."
The finagling of figures threatens something worse than unauditable accounts. The military services are embarked on enormous acquisitions of weapons, and before long the costs are going to run way beyond what budget forecasts have calculated.
Franklin C. Spinney, a Defense Department program analyst who has irritated the Pentagon for years by his candor, describes the situation as a "time bomb being fueled by the Pentagon's corrupt budget numbers." The bomb, he says, will explode "early in the next century."
Why have both Congress and the White House been so lavish with the Defense Department, and so inattentive to inflated requirements and waste? The first answer is that looking "tough" on defense is regarded as good politics -- even after the fall of the Soviet Union, the great adversary whose menace led us to build up our forces after 1950.
But an even more powerful factor has developed in recent years. That is the belief, shrewdly encouraged by arms manufacturers, that cutting military spending will cost jobs in Congressional districts. Mr. Korb put it:
"Both the Administration and Congress increasingly view defense as a Federal jobs program. Weapons programs like the B-2 bomber, the Seawolf submarine and the V-22 Osprey, designed to combat the Soviet threat, live on because of the temporary economic problems that taking them out of production would cause."
The B-2 is an extreme case in point. After 14 years of work on it, the so-called Stealth bomber still fails crucial tests. Its radar cannot distinguish a mountain from rain. Yet Congress has just voted to buy more at $2.2 billion a plane, and President Clinton agreed. The House Budget Committee chairman, John Kasich, made a big effort to stop the increase but was beaten by members who wanted work to continue in their districts.
Weapons make-work is a highly inefficient way to provide jobs in this country. But it will go on until we have leadership courageous enough to take on the politics of defense. It will probably take an Eisenhower: a President who knows the military and who cannot be attacked as soft on defense.

HEADLINE: Hillary Clinton Is No Eleanor Roosevelt

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Ever since Hillary Rodham Clinton became First Lady there have been many attempts to compare her with Eleanor Roosevelt (see A. M. Rosenthal's Jan. 19 column, for example, and Blanche Wiesen Cook's Jan 17 Op-Ed article). 
 Until the 1990's Eleanor Roosevelt remained better known than any other woman who has occupied that formidable but informal public position known as the First Lady. Largely because her husband was disabled, Mrs. Roosevelt acted in effect as his vice president, representing him all over the country.
While vicious partisan comments were made about her unprecedented public prominence during his four terms in office, many people, especially Democrats, accepted her unusual role because of his disability.
Since President Nixon institutionalized the office of the Vice President in the 1950's, it has been impossible for First Ladies to act even unofficially as their husbands' "vice presidents."
When Franklin Delano Roosevelt was first elected, Mrs. Roosevelt had already established an independent social and political network of women friends unrelated to his career. This gave her private and public autonomy that has also not since been duplicated.
In particular, she belonged to a generation of influential women coming out of the Progressive Era who had successfully advocated social justice and international peace since 1900. The Great Depression gave Mrs. Roosevelt and some of these women an unusual opportunity to influence national social welfare legislation demanded by the economic crisis.
None of the independent money Mrs. Roosevelt earned through her books, news column and talks was tainted by scandal or insider information. And no other First Lady to date has had an international career after her husband's death.
By contrast, Mrs. Clinton's prominence, symbolized by her early position as head of the national health care task force, is derivative of her husband's power as President and has raised serious constitutional questions about whether she was responsible to him or to Congress.
Unlike Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Roosevelt never claimed an independent career, and never touted herself as a feminist. She opposed the Equal Rights Amendment her entire life and resigned her one official administrative position as deputy director of the Office of Civil Defense in 1942 when criticism of her performance rose. Mrs. Clinton's feminism, while more apparent, is compromised by her "stand by my man" public persona and male-oriented careerism.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Prices Close Above $400 On Political Talk of U.S. Default

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Gold and platinum prices jumped yesterday, with gold settling above $400 an ounce for the second time this month, after Republicans in Congress talked of possibly forcing a default on the Federal debt if President Clinton did not agree to the Republicans' balanced-budget plan.
Gold was also supported by recent instability in other financial markets, said Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst for Prudential Securities Inc. in New York. 
 Investors buy precious metals during times of economic instability because their price remains fairly constant.
"A convenient place to park is gold and platinum," said Dave Esrig, an economist with the Platinum Guild International in New York.
On other commodity markets, energy futures prices dropped as traders reacted to concerns that some Iraqi oil might re-enter the world markets and to mild weather in parts of the country. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities rose 0.25 point, to 240.88.
Gold for February delivery settled up $3.60, to $403.50 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. That was the highest settlement price for the contract closest to delivery since August 1993.
Also on the Comex, January silver rose 12.5 cents, to $5.5610 an ounce. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, April platinum rose $7.20, to $427.80 an ounce, and March palladium rose 80 cents, to $133.25 an ounce.
Ms. Raptopoulos said platinum was mostly following the rise in gold but was also supported by reports that Japanese investors bought platinum overnight.
In the energy markets, the expiring February crude oil contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled with a loss of 32 cents a barrel at $18.62. March crude oil dropped 10 cents, to $18.15.
Crude oil was under pressure from the announcement on Friday that Iraq was interested in resuming talks on a United Nations plan to allow it to sell some oil to get money to buy food and medicine, said Tim Evans, an analyst in New York for Pegasus Econometric Group.
Heating oil and natural gas closed lower with forecasts for mild weather in the Midwest and Northeast. February heating oil dropped 0.55 cent, to 53.67 cents a gallon; February unleaded gasoline fell 0.53 cent, to 54.88 cents a gallon, and February natural gas dropped 4.3 cents, to $2.125 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: More Budget Woes for the City

 BODY:
As if on schedule, the winter season has brought a torrent of painful developments that will make it harder for New York City to balance its budget. Real estate tax revenues are down. Savings that the city had projected in welfare, Medicaid and other areas have fallen short of targets. Relations with all the municipal labor unions have been in turmoil since the teachers rejected their contract last fall. Faced with a gap that could widen to $2 billion for the next fiscal year, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani needs to rethink some of his basic assumptions about how to restore the city to solvency.
If these problems sound familiar, they are. Since the bottom dropped out of the city's economy in the late 1980's, budget after budget has been pasted together every summer with overly optimistic assumptions and financial gimmickry insuring that the deficits buried within would open up in the winter. Mr. Giuliani deserves credit for making the city aware of the enormity of the challenges, and he has pushed through some real economies, most notably by reducing the size of the city's work force by 17,000 employees. He was clearly hoping that by exacting painful austerity in his first two years of office, he could ease up in his second two. Recent developments demonstrate that he cannot. 
 Among the biggest factors eating at the budget are the disappointing pace of Mr. Giuliani's attempts to rein in health-care costs, both for Medicaid recipients and municipal employees. Some progress has been made in enrolling Medicaid recipients in managed-care programs, and the city labor unions were persuaded to accept cuts in payments to the funds that pay for health benefits. But the savings are not as great as hoped. Meanwhile, the falloff in real estate taxes seems to signal a leveling off of the city economy, the Board of Education continues to spend at a rate that will consume hundreds of millions of dollars it does not have, and lurking in the background is the prospect of further cutbacks from Albany and Washington.
Last year Mr. Giuliani negotiated a five-year deal with the city labor unions that involved a two-year wage freeze and other modest concessions in return for a pledge not to lay anyone off. It now appears possible that employees in the main city labor unions may follow the teachers' lead and reject this contract, in which case layoffs are almost certain. Since wages and benefits account for half the city's budget, Mr. Giuliani must stand firm against any further concessions to employees.
City Hall also needs to think about some alternatives that Mr. Giuliani has rejected. New tax cuts proposed for the next fiscal year should be deferred. Although it has been politically difficult, the Mayor could show some leadership and call for a review of the entire real estate tax system, in which residential property is undertaxed. The Mayor should also change his policy of sparing the police, fire and sanitation departments from significant cuts. He has not made sufficient progress, for instance, in replacing police officers at desk jobs with civilian workers, a step that would allow him to reduce the number of officers in the force without reducing the number actually in the streets.
There is still more he can demand of the unions in easing overtime guarantees and other costly work rules. In fact, he took a step in the opposite direction by yielding to a union demand and placing a fifth firefighter aboard pumper engines, ending a practice of having four-member crews. Although Mr. Giuliani insists that this step is a safety measure, city officials acknowledge that the real reason was pressure from the firefighters.
Above all, Mr. Giuliani needs to forge a better working relationship with the Legislature in Albany to squeeze as much aid for the city as possible out of an admittedly stringent state budget. His antipathy toward the Democrats who control the Assembly served the city poorly last year. One thing Mr. Giuliani must not do is rely heavily on one-shot savings to balance the budget this year and next. His recent proposal to refinance some city bonds in a way that poses a bigger debt service burden down the road was properly rejected by City Comptroller Alan Hevesi. Only by demanding that the budget be balanced with recurring savings can Mr. Giuliani insure in the long term that the hopes of the summer do not sink perpetually into talk of budget doom when winter comes.

HEADLINE: Flat Tax Lite

BYLINE: By Alvin Rabushka; Alvin Rabushka is senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford and co-author, with Robert E. Hall, of "The Flat Tax."

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif.

 BODY:
The flat tax has emerged as the central issue in the Republican Presidential primaries. The debate now pits an ideal, pure flat tax proposed by Steve Forbes against modified plans proposed by Phil Gramm and Patrick J. Buchanan that retain popular deductions like home mortgage interest and charitable contributions.
Advocates for a modified flat tax are worried that, under the unadulterated plan, housing values, home ownership and charitable giving would fall. But these dire predictions are unfounded. Under the current graduated rate system, the deductions for mortgage interest and charitable giving favor people in high tax brackets. Currently, the Treasury allows someone with a million-dollar mortgage to deduct the interest and receive a refund exceeding $70,000, while someone with a smaller mortgage gets a refund of a few thousand dollars. 
 Under a pure flat tax, this regressive feature would be eliminated. Indeed, housing would become more affordable, while housing values would be unaffected. This is because the pure flat tax plan would not just eliminate the deduction for home mortgage interest. There would also be no deduction for any interest paid, even by businesses, and no taxes on any interest received.
Once these tax considerations were removed, interest rates would fall. In a hypothetical 25 percent tax bracket, for example, a 10 percent interest rate equals an after-tax yield of 7.5 percent for both borrower and lender. If interest were neither deductible nor taxable, the yield would fall to the same 7.5 percent rate.
Lower rates would reduce mortgage interest payments. Most homeowners would be able to refinance their mortgages at the new lower rates. For most taxpayers, these lower rates would offset the loss of the mortgage interest deduction.
Housing prices are affected by the demand for housing, which in turn is affected by the ability to carry a mortgage. Since the flat tax would not reduce the ability to carry a mortgage, housing values would not decline.
But, paradoxically, it could be easier to own a home. Israel, Australia, Canada and Japan do not permit mortgage interest deductions, yet home ownership rates in those countries exceed or rival that in the United States.
Under a pure flat tax, American home buyers would find it easier to save for a down payment. Most public-finance economists maintain that a low flat tax would increase overall economic growth by one percentage point or more a year for the next seven years. That means by the year 2002, a family of four would have an additional $8,000 in income. The flat tax would also end double and triple taxation of dividends, capital gains and estates, making it easier for families to save.
What about charitable giving? From 1980 to 1989, total contributions increased from $49 billion to $107 billion, despite a fall in the top marginal tax rate from 70 to 28 percent, a drop of 60 percent. Strong economic growth, which increases real incomes and wealth, is a more important factor in giving than any tax break.
Perhaps the most important reason to stick to the pure flat tax is that any modification would probably kill tax reform. There would be other demands for "modification" -- to keep deductions for state and local taxes and fringe benefits, for example. Adding more deductions narrows the tax base, thus pushing up rates.
The principles that underpin the pure flat tax are growth, integrity, coherence and simplicity. Once these principles are abandoned, it is but a few small steps back to the current complicated, costly, inefficient, distorted tax system.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 34.68 Points to Set Closing High of 5,219.36

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks bolted into record territory yesterday on a late burst of computer-driven trading, but the wider market struggled higher as investors sought to minimize risks.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped past 5,200 points for the first time since mid-December, rising 34.68 to close at 5,219.36. The previous closing high of 5,216.47 was set on Dec. 13. 
 Most broad-market indexes were only slightly higher, though the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index advanced solidly, gaining 10.99 points to close at 1,029.44 as that depressed sector continued to firm its footing.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slim margin on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,218 to 1,109. Big Board volume totaled 398 million shares, down from Friday's heavy pace of 502.9 million.
The New York Stock Exchange's composite index rose 0.84 point, to 328.70. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 1.57 points, to 613.40. The American Stock Exchange's market-value index gained 1.09 points, to 531.71.
The failure of the broader market to advance more decisively indicates a no-confidence vote for the market, said Brian Belski, technical analyst at Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis.
"The market is once again being led by a narrowing list of issues," he said. "Investors were chasing stocks that came out with earnings last week, but they're late to the party."
Caterpillar and I.B.M., which both posted strong earnings last week, added to their gains. Caterpillar shares rose 3 3/4, to 62 3/4, and those of I.B.M. rose 1/4, to 102 1/4.
Gold stocks rose as gold cracked the $400-an-ounce level amid new frictions in the protracted battle over Federal spending cuts. Investors often buy precious metals as a hedge during times of economic instability because their price remains fairly constant. Among gold issues, Homestake Mining added 1, to 18 3/4, and Newmont Mining rose 2 1/4, to 56 1/8.
Technology stocks rose, continuing last week's renewed confidence.
"The buyers have come back into technology," said Andrew M. Brooks, head of equity trading at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore "I can't see the group moving the way it has without admitting that."
Intel, which plunged early last week after a disappointing earnings report, was up throughout the session, ending 5/8 higher at 52. Among other technology issues on Nasdaq, Sun Microsystems rose 19/16 a share, to 48 9/16, and Cisco Systems advanced 21/16, to 77 13/16.
Chrysler and Motorola both gained after favorable mentions in an article in Barron's, the financial weekly. Chrysler shares added 3 5/8, to 57 3/4, and Motorola gained 2 1/8, to 53 1/8. Chrysler was also aided by an article in The Wall Street Journal, which said the auto maker's smaller-than-expected decline in fourth-quarter earnings could mean a strong 1996 despite a weak domestic auto market.
Airline stocks helped prod the transportation sector, which trailed last week's blue-chip rebound. The Dow Jones index of transportation issues rose more than 1 percent, with USAir Group adding 3/4, to 15 3/4, after reporting its first fourth-quarter profit since 1988. Delta Air Lines rose 2 1/8 a share, to 74; AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, climbed 1 1/2, to 73 3/4, and UAL, the parent of United Airlines, jumped 7 5/8 a share, to 168 1/2.
In other active trading, Woolworth rose 1 1/4, to 11 1/8, after the retailer disclosed an investor proposal to spin off the company's successful athletic footwear and apparel division, which includes the Foot Locker and Lady Footlocker chains, to shareholders.
