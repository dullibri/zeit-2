HEADLINE: With Local Figures on the Ballot, Others May Shun an Early Primary

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Jennifer Medina contributed reporting from Hartford and Ronald Smothers from Trenton.

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 27 

 BODY:
When the State Legislature voted last week to move New York's presidential primary to Feb. 5 from March, lawmakers said they wanted to ensure that more candidates would actively campaign in the state.
 But if the bill is signed into law, it may have exactly the opposite effect.
That is because with two popular New Yorkers -- Rudolph W. Giuliani and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton -- running, other presidential candidates may well decide not to campaign in the New York primary so they can concentrate resources on the many other states, including California, that are moving presidential primaries to Feb. 5.
 The trickle of states moving their primaries earlier to Feb. 5 -- which is becoming known as ''Super-Duper Tuesday'' -- has become a flood in recent weeks. New Jersey has also acted to move its primary to Feb. 5, and Connecticut lawmakers said on Tuesday that they planned to do so as well. Both states, along with New York, said that they were doing so to try to play a greater role in the nomination process. 
 In New York, State Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader, said that moving the primary to Feb. 5 would ''restore New York's input into choosing the most important office of our democracy.'' But several political analysts and campaign operatives said the new date might mean a less competitive primary. 
 The effects could be especially stark in New York's Republican primary, political analysts said, because the candidate who wins the popular vote in New York gets all its delegates. Since Mr. Giuliani, a native son, is currently enjoying sizable leads in statewide polls, the other candidates will have to decide whether it is worth mounting a campaign in an expensive media market where a second-place finish would yield no delegates.
 None of the other Republican presidential campaigns would say publicly that they planned to skip the New York primary. But privately, operatives working for two rival candidates said it was highly unlikely that they would mount real campaigns in New York unless the Giuliani campaign stumbles or other factors change dramatically. 
 ''It would be cost-prohibitive for anyone to go in and campaign against Rudy in that particular state,'' said an operative on a rival Republican campaign who was granted anonymity to discuss campaign tactics. 
 A Republican operative at another rival campaign said it would be much more economical to devote resources to the other contests that day. ''Is anyone going to spend money there they could spend elsewhere?'' he said.
 William G. Mayer, a political science professor at Northeastern University who has written about the move to earlier primaries, said that the winner-take-all system would be a strong disincentive for other Republicans to campaign in New York. ''As long as Giuliani is a Republican candidate, there is remarkably little reason for any of the other Republican candidates to campaign there,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
 While the earlier primary would also benefit Mrs. Clinton, who would have an enormous advantage as New York's junior senator, it might not scare all the other candidates away, since the Democratic primary awards delegates proportionately by Congressional district. 
 So Senator Barack Obama could decide to challenge Mrs. Clinton in New York in the hope of winning districts with many black voters, or where antiwar sentiments runs strong, political analysts said. 
 The bill to move New York's primary to the first Tuesday in February -- which even some lawmakers are calling ''Rudy's and Hillary's law'' -- sailed through the Legislature, with the Democratic-led State Assembly hoping to help Mrs. Clinton and the Republican-led Senate hoping to help Mr. Giuliani. 
 Several Republicans state senators, who have seen their majority dwindle in recent years, say privately that they would like to see Mr. Giuliani at the top of the ticket in 2008. Their hope is that he would draw New York Republicans to the polls, and that those voters would support Republican candidates for the Senate. 
 Mr. Bruno said recently that he had not endorsed anyone but that ''Rudy Giuliani is certainly the front-runner here in New York State. and is highly accomplished.''
 He acknowledged that the other candidates would most likely consult poll numbers before deciding whether to invest in a New York campaign. 
 Of course, with New Jersey and Connecticut taking steps to move their primaries to Feb. 5 -- New Jersey's had traditionally been held in June; Connecticut's is March 4 -- the political calculus could change again. Since parts of all three states get the same television channels, candidates may decide to buy ad time to blanket the region. 
 Connecticut officials said on Tuesday that they planned to move the primary up because having to wait until March could ''disenfranchise'' voters in the state. 
 Secretary of State Susan Bysiewicz, a Democrat, said she did not consider seeking legislation to move the state's primary until after larger states, including California and New York, made it clear they would do so. 
 ''Connecticut didn't start this tidal wave, but we're going to ride it -- for now,'' she said. ''We really wanted to be sure that Connecticut voters had their say before the presidential primary was over on Feb. 6.''
 Connecticut has its own native son in the race -- Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat -- and Senator John McCain of Arizona won the Republican presidential primary there in 2000. But a recent poll by Quinnipiac University showed both Mr. Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton with double-digit leads over their nearest rivals.
 In New Jersey, the Legislature passed a bill moving the primary to Feb. 5 last month in the hopes of gaining more influence, only to watch as several other states followed. Gov. Jon S. Corzine has yet to sign the measure, but has said publicly that he supports the change and will sign it.
 Bill Pascoe, a national Republican consultant based in Chicago who has worked in New Jersey campaigns, said that because New York's Republican primary is winner take all and the Democratic primary doles out delegates in proportion to a candidate's votes, Democrats are likely to be more active in the state heading into the Feb. 5 primary.
 ''Barack Obama can't afford to concede any of these areas where Hillary Clinton is considered strong,'' he said. ''But John McCain could reason that Rudy Giuliani will do well in New York and New Jersey and decide that it is just too expensive to risk it. In that case he would just double down on Florida and Texas.''
 Mr. Mayer, the professor at Northeastern, said that the more states that jump on the Feb. 5 bandwagon, the less individual attention each state will receive. 
 ''But if they were to schedule their primary two weeks or a month or two months later, they'd get even less,'' he said. ''That's the kind of devil's bargain that they are buying into.''

HEADLINE: Child Wants Cellphone; Reception Is Mixed

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
TO her parents' amusement, Hannah Stacks, a third grader in Rye, N.Y., started asking for her own cellphone at age 6. To their consternation, she never stopped. Last fall, after a psychologist suggested tracking her behavior, Hannah, at the sprightly age of 8, got her phone as a reward for not being mean to her little sister for 30 days.
 ''I was so torn because, of course, I wanted her to stop beating on Kate,'' said Hannah's mother, Kim O'Connor, a clinical social worker. ''But I also thought, at the end of 30 days, what will I have done?''
After securing a foothold in the teenage market, cellphones are quickly emerging as the must-have techno-toy among elementary-school society. Companies are sating the appetite -- and expanding demand -- by offering special phones for children like the bright blue Firefly, which features only five keys, including ones with icons for speed-dialing a parent, and allows users to call a maximum of 22 numbers. 
 Industry analysts say the 'tween market, defined as 8- to 12-year-olds, represents one of the major growth opportunities for the wireless industry. Some 6.6 million of the 20 million American children in that age range had cellphones by the end of 2006, according to an analysis by the Yankee Group, a technology consulting firm in Boston, which projects there will be 10.5 million preteen cellphone users by 2010. 
 The number of 8-year-olds with phones, Yankee Group estimates, more than doubled to 506,000 over the past four years while the number of 9-year-olds jumped to 1.25 million from 501,000. 
 Children want a cellphone for reasons obvious to them. It looks cool and makes them feel grown-up. It conveys a certain status. And it lets them stay in near-constant touch with friends and (oh, yeah) parents.
 For parents, the decision of when, or whether, to buy children cellphones -- paralleling the age-old debate over the appropriate age for ear piercing -- is emotionally charged and value-laden, raising ticklish questions about safety and status, maturity and materialism.
 Some parents and child psychologists say the need for cellphones among such young children, who are rarely without adult supervision, is marginal, and the gadgets serve mainly as status symbols, quickly lost in a tangle of toys, batteries hopelessly out of juice. Others, though, say the phones are an electronic security blanket for both parent and child in a world of two-career households and split-custody arrangements, Amber alerts and color-coded terror threat levels.
 ''My kids are never left alone, so this is an emergency backup system,'' said Cindy O'Neill Vitale, who bought cellphones last summer for her sons, then 8 and 10, before a weeklong vacation with family friends. ''I honestly believe that we live in a time now where it's important to be able to have access for whatever reason. God forbid there's another 9/11. I was in the city that day and I couldn't reach them.''
 Dr. Cornelia Brunner, deputy director of the Center for Children and Technology, a nonprofit research group in Manhattan, said cellphones can serve as ''transitional objects'' for young children suffering separation anxiety from their parents, and that phones with ''reasonably interesting games'' might have some ''redeeming educational value.''
 ''Dolls are unnecessary too,'' noted Dr. Brunner, a developmental psychologist. ''The only harm is an economic one. Kids whose families can't afford all this junk are made to feel worse and worse, and some parents end up shelling out money that would be better spent elsewhere.''
 The Firefly, introduced in 2005, costs $49.99, plus $15 an hour of talk time (paid in advance); it comes with a backpack clip. Competitors include Enfora's TicTalk, $99 plus $25 for 100 prepaid minutes, and Disney Mobile's three youth-oriented phones, unveiled last summer, with a price range of $29.99 to $99.99, plus calling plans that start at $24.99 for 200 minutes.
 Brian Schillaci, principal of Indian Hill School in Holmdel, N.J., which spans fourth to sixth grades, said he has seen a sharp rise in the number of students using cellphones. When a committee devised new rules four years ago saying cellphones could not be visible or in use during the school day, Mr. Schillaci said, there were only a handful of incidents a year; now children are sent to the office once or twice a week for cellphone infractions. 
 Despite the popularity of the child-friendly phones, some industry analysts say they have a short shelf life because what seems cool to a 7-year-old feels babyish to a middle-schooler. Verizon is phasing out the LG Migo, a simple bright-green phone with a limited keypad that allowed users to program only five numbers, replacing it with the LG VX3450, which has a silver flip design, text-messaging capability and two embedded games (it costs $20 plus a two-year calling plan). 
 With a subtly playful bean shape, the new phone allows parents to restrict calls and messaging. And like the Migo, it features a global-positioning satellite device so that parents can locate the phone, and presumably the child, from another phone or a Web site. (Disney's phone also offers such tracking, and the TicTalk is being retooled to include it.) 
 ''An 11-year-old boy wouldn't be caught dead carrying the Migo,'' said David Samberg, a spokesman for Verizon Wireless. ''With this new phone, it still gives parents control, but if the child is entering that pre-adolescent period, this phone is not going to scream: 'My mother's watching me.' ''
 CHARLES GOLVIN, principal analyst at Forrester Research, a technology firm, said the tracking features, which can find a child down to the exact cross streets, were proving popular among parents. ''As the parent of a 13-year-old girl, I embrace the concept of invading her privacy to give me peace of mind,'' he said. ''A lot of the appeal for the parent in giving a child a cellphone is safety.'' 
 Scott Pierce, who lives in White Plains and is a news photographer for WWOR-TV in New York, bought the Migo for his daughter, Morgan, when she turned 11. Now 13, Morgan recently graduated to a real phone, and her 10-year-old brother, Darien, gladly took the Migo hand-me-down.
 ''He's not at the point where he can walk around alone,'' Mr. Pierce said of his son. ''But you never know. You're getting off the bus, and you have predators who swipe kids. What if the bus driver has a heart attack? Or the bus is stranded on the side of the road? Things happen.''
 After a feverish debut, the once-coveted cellphones often are quickly forgotten by young dialers who, after all, can barely be convinced to say a few words to grandma over the phone, and likely have few peers with phones to call.
 ''As soon as we purchased the phones, they lost some of their razzle-dazzle,'' said Christie Lavigne of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., whose 7-year-old son, Dylan, and 9-year-old daughter, Gigi, each got a Firefly for Christmas. ''The first three days they had them, they were calling me and my husband 20 times. But then the novelty wore off, and I think they're at a healthy place.''
 Audrey Gray, a single mother in Philadelphia who shares custody of her son, Jackson, 8, and travels on business once or twice a month, said that when she first bought her son a phone at age 7, he ''was like a jealous boyfriend calling me all the time.'' 
 ''He'd call me from the cafeteria, screaming, 'Mom, I'm at lunch,' and I said, 'Great, buddy. How's it going?' and he yelled, 'Good. Do you want to talk to Gabe?' Then he called me from math class and was whispering, 'Hey Mom, I was just calling to see how you are,' '' she recalled. ''Then I never heard from him again.''
 But Ms. Gray, a senior editor of E-Gear, a technology magazine, said she had ''zero agony'' over the decision to get Jackson a phone. ''He did lose it, of course, like 17 times, but we seem to find it,'' she said. ''There's something comforting about having a direct connection to him. We don't use it, but I like knowing it's there.''
 Parents say that the incursion of cellphones into 'tween society has ratcheted up the electronics race, with mobile phones joining laptops, digital cameras and iPods on children's wish lists. Because cellphones are still something of a novelty among 7- and 8-year-olds, those parents who cave sometimes feel a chill from those holding out.
 Phyllis Schneble, a marketing executive in Fairfield, Conn., is proud to buck the wireless trend: she has three children and said the oldest would not get a phone until she turns 16.
 ''Generations survived with a dime tucked in their shoe,'' she said. ''Ninety percent of the calls made on cellphones are not critical or even substantive -- mostly pure fluff and nonsense. Where are the casual conversations on the street, in the halls, when everyone is plugged into their own world?'' 
 And Mrs. O'Connor remembered the complications when Hannah's flashy phone made its debut last fall.
 ''Of course, the first day it's handed to her, she takes it to school, and her best friend starts screaming and crying that she wants a cellphone,'' she said. ''Her mother looked at me like, thank you for ruining my day. That afternoon I had a talk with Hannah: 'You have a cellphone. It's a privilege. Please don't advertise it to the other children.' ''
 But it was hard to hide from Mrs. O'Connor's younger daughter, Kate, who survived Hannah's abuse to turn 6 and recently started campaigning for a cellphone. 
 ''She said her life would be complete if she had a cellphone,'' Ms. O'Connor recalled. ''We said you can reapply when you're 8.''

HEADLINE: Round and Round They Go

BYLINE: By YISHANE LEE

 BODY:
PLENTY of hard-core triathletes have avoided spinning studios because they say they train better on hills and roads. But now that triathlons are a sport for the masses, more indoor cycling classes attract rookie triathletes looking to avoid freezing rain or to complement their road miles. 
 Meanwhile longtime triathletes are reconsidering indoor cycling classes. They can be a good place to focus on pedaling economy, said Joe Friel, the author of ''The Triathlete's Training Bible.'' The heavy flywheel of an indoor bike, he said, ''can help to improve the athlete's pedal mechanics.''
It helps to wear cycling shoes. They have cleats locking the foot in place and a full rigid plate in the sole to distribute pressure evenly. Choose an SPD cleat system, said Chad Selberg, a salesman at Toga Bike on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, because its recessed cleats are better suited to walking around the gym. 
 Lauren Perkins, a triathlete who teaches indoor cycling at the New York Health & Racquet Club, tested these five cycling shoes there this month. YISHANE LEE

GRAPHIC: Photos: SIDI DOMINATOR 5 LORICA $229.99, www.sidiusa.com. This synthetic leather shoe has a notched strap and supersecure Velcro for precise fitting. Lauren Perkins said the shoes were ''supportive, comfortable and versatile for walking on any surface: hardwood in the gym or tile in the locker room.'' She also liked the ''ratchet strap, like on a ski boot, nice for support and fit.''
LAKE CYCLING CX-125 $99.99, www.lakecycling.com. This leather-and-mesh shoe, which fastens with three Velcro straps, has thick rubber treads to protect the cleats. Ms. Perkins liked having the treads ''almost an inch off the ground,'' making it ''easy to walk around the gym.'' But, she said, they also made it hard to click properly into pedals with toe cages.
LOUIS GARNEAU MULTI $79.99, www.louisgarneau.com. Made from synthetic leather with a mesh upper, this shoe has a rigid rubber outsole for efficient pedaling and better grip off the bike. Ms. Perkins found the shoes ''very comfortable,'' with a ''good fit.'' She noted that the cleats ''protruded a little bit from the sole,'' making it slightly awkward to walk.
PEARL IZUMI X-ALP LOW $89.99, www.pearlizumi.com. A stiff cycling plate from heel to forefoot provides pedaling efficiency, while a flexible forefoot groove and a foam insole mean this shoe can also be used for running. Ms. Perkins liked its ''snug, comfortable and sneakerlike feel.'' But the laces loosened over time and could, she said, ''get caught in the pedals.''
 SPECIALIZED SONOMA 2 $75, www.specialized.com. A hard midsole plate on the bottom of these suede-and-mesh shoes makes it easier to pedal, while a bump in the forefoot spreads out the toes to reduce compression. ''The sole, firmer than a runner shoe's, gave more power,'' Ms. Perkins said. But she found the cleat protector difficult to remove. ''I had to use pliers,'' she said.

HEADLINE: 'Irresponsible' Mortgages Have Opened Doors to Many of the Excluded

BYLINE: By AUSTAN GOOLSBEE. 
Austan Goolsbee is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and a research fellow at the American Bar Foundation. E-mail: goolsbee@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
''We are sitting on a time bomb,'' the mortgage analyst said -- a huge increase in unconventional home loans like balloon mortgages taken out by consumers who cannot qualify for regular mortgages. The high payments, he continued, ''are just beginning to come due and a lot of people who were betting interest rates would come down by now risk losing their homes because they can't pay the debt.'' 
 He would have given great testimony at the current Senate hearings on subprime mortgage lending. The only problem is, he said it in 1981 -- when soon after several of the alternative mortgage products like those with adjustable rates and balloons first became popular. 
When Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, gave his opening statement last week at the hearings lambasting the rise of ''risky exotic and subprime mortgages,'' he was actually tapping into a very old vein of suspicion against innovations in the mortgage market.
 Almost every new form of mortgage lending -- from adjustable-rate mortgages to home equity lines of credit to no-money-down mortgages -- has tended to expand the pool of people who qualify but has also been greeted by a large number of people saying that it harms consumers and will fool people into thinking they can afford homes that they cannot. 
 Congress is contemplating a serious tightening of regulations to make the new forms of lending more difficult. New research from some of the leading housing economists in the country, however, examines the long history of mortgage market innovations and suggests that regulators should be mindful of the potential downside in tightening too much. 
 A study conducted by Kristopher Gerardi and Paul S. Willen from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and Harvey S. Rosen of Princeton, Do Households Benefit from Financial Deregulation and Innovation? The Case of the Mortgage Market (National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 12967), shows that the three decades from 1970 to 2000 witnessed an incredible flowering of new types of home loans. These innovations mainly served to give people power to make their own decisions about housing, and they ended up being quite sensible with their newfound access to capital.
 These economists followed thousands of people over their lives and examined the evidence for whether mortgage markets have become more efficient over time. Lost in the current discussion about borrowers' income levels in the subprime market is the fact that someone with a low income now but who stands to earn much more in the future would, in a perfect market, be able to borrow from a bank to buy a house. That is how economists view the efficiency of a capital market: people's decisions unrestricted by the amount of money they have right now. 
 And this study shows that measured this way, the mortgage market has become more perfect, not more irresponsible. People tend to make good decisions about their own economic prospects. As Professor Rosen said in an interview, ''Our findings suggest that people make sensible housing decisions in that the size of house they buy today relates to their future income, not just their current income and that the innovations in mortgages over 30 years gave many people the opportunity to own a home that they would not have otherwise had, just because they didn't have enough assets in the bank at the moment they needed the house.''
 Of course, basing loans on future earnings expectations is riskier than lending money to prime borrowers at 30-year fixed interest rates. That is why interest rates are higher for subprime borrowers and for big mortgages that require little money down. Sometimes the risks flop. Sometimes people even have to sell their properties because they cannot make the numbers work. 
 The traditional causes of foreclosure, even before there was subprime lending, were job loss, divorce and major medical expenses. And the national foreclosure data seem to suggest that these issues remain paramount. The latest numbers show that foreclosures have been concentrated not in places where real estate bubbles have supposedly been popping, but rather in places whose economies have stagnated -- the hurricane-torn communities on the Gulf of Mexico and the industrial Midwest states like Ohio, Michigan and Indiana, where the domestic auto industry has suffered. These do not automatically point to subprime lending as the leading cause of foreclosure problems. 
 Also, the historical evidence suggests that cracking down on new mortgages may hit exactly the wrong people. As Professor Rosen explains, ''The main thing that innovations in the mortgage market have done over the past 30 years is to let in the excluded: the young, the discriminated against, the people without a lot of money in the bank to use for a down payment.'' It has allowed them access to mortgages whereas lenders would have once just turned them away.
 The Center for Responsible Lending estimated that in 2005, a majority of home loans to African-Americans and 40 percent of home loans to Hispanics were subprime loans. The existence and spread of subprime lending helps explain the drastic growth of homeownership for these same groups. Since 1995, for example, the number of African-American households has risen by about 20 percent, but the number of African-American homeowners has risen almost twice that rate, by about 35 percent. For Hispanics, the number of households is up about 45 percent and the number of homeowning households is up by almost 70 percent. 
 And do not forget that the vast majority of even subprime borrowers have been making their payments. Indeed, fewer than 15 percent of borrowers in this most risky group have even been delinquent on a payment, much less defaulted. 
 When contemplating ways to prevent excessive mortgages for the 13 percent of subprime borrowers whose loans go sour, regulators must be careful that they do not wreck the ability of the other 87 percent to obtain mortgages. 
 For be it ever so humble, there really is no place like home, even if it does come with a balloon payment mortgage.

HEADLINE: Income Gap Is Widening, Data Shows

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
Income inequality grew significantly in 2005, with the top 1 percent of Americans -- those with incomes that year of more than $348,000 -- receiving their largest share of national income since 1928, analysis of newly released tax data shows.
 The top 10 percent, roughly those earning more than $100,000, also reached a level of income share not seen since before the Depression. 
While total reported income in the United States increased almost 9 percent in 2005, the most recent year for which such data is available, average incomes for those in the bottom 90 percent dipped slightly compared with the year before, dropping $172, or 0.6 percent.
 The gains went largely to the top 1 percent, whose incomes rose to an average of more than $1.1 million each, an increase of more than $139,000, or about 14 percent.
 The new data also shows that the top 300,000 Americans collectively enjoyed almost as much income as the bottom 150 million Americans. Per person, the top group received 440 times as much as the average person in the bottom half earned, nearly doubling the gap from 1980.
 Prof. Emmanuel Saez, the University of California, Berkeley, economist who analyzed the Internal Revenue Service data with Prof. Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics, said such growing disparities were significant in terms of social and political stability.
 ''If the economy is growing but only a few are enjoying the benefits, it goes to our sense of fairness,'' Professor Saez said. ''It can have important political consequences.''
 Last year, according to data from other sources, incomes for average Americans increased for the first time in several years. But because those at the top rely heavily on the stock market and business profits for their income, both of which were strong last year, it is likely that the disparities in 2005 are the same or larger now, Professor Saez said.
 He noted that the analysis was based on preliminary data and that the highest-income Americans were more likely than others to file their returns late, so his data might understate the growth in inequality.
 The disparities may be even greater for another reason. The Internal Revenue Service estimates that it is able to accurately tax 99 percent of wage income but that it captures only about 70 percent of business and investment income, most of which flows to upper-income individuals, because not everybody accurately reports such figures.
 The Bush administration argued that its tax policies, despite cuts that benefited those at the top more than others, had not added to the widening gap but ''made the tax code more progressive, not less.'' Brookly McLaughlin, the chief Treasury Department spokeswoman, said that this year ''the share of income taxes paid by lower-income taxpayers will be lower than it would have been without the tax relief, while the share of income taxes for higher-income taxpayers will be higher.''
 Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., she noted, has acknowledged that income disparities have increased, but, along with a ''solid consensus'' of experts, attributed that shift largely to ''the rapid pace of technological change has been a major driver in the decades-long widening of the income gap in the United States." 
 Others argued that public policies had played a role in the shift. Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an advocacy group for the poor, said that the data understates the widening disparity between the top 1 percent and the rest of the country.
 He said that in addition to rising incomes and reduced taxes, the equation should take into account cuts in fringe benefits to workers and in government services that middle-class and poor Americans rely on more than the affluent. These include health care, child care and education spending.
 ''The nation faces some very tough choices in coming years,'' he said. ''That such a large share of the income gains are going to the very top, at a minimum, raises serious questions about continuing to provide tax cuts averaging over $150,000 a year to people making more than a million dollars a year, while saying we do not have enough money'' to provide health insurance to 47 million Americans and cutting education benefits.
 A major issue likely to be debated in Congress in the year ahead is whether reversing the Bush tax cuts would slow investment and, if so, how much that would cost the economy. 
 Mr. Greenstein's organization will release a report today showing that for Americans in the middle, the share of income taken by federal taxes has been essentially unchanged across four decades. By comparison, it has fallen by half for those at the very top of the income ladder. 
 Because the incomes of those at the top have grown so much more than those below them, their share of total income tax revenue has risen despite the reduced rates.
 The analysis by the two professors showed that the top 10 percent of Americans collected 48.5 percent of all reported income in 2005.
 That is an increase of more than 2 percentage points over the previous year and up from roughly 33 percent in the late 1970s. The peak for this group was 49.3 percent in 1928.
 The top 1 percent received 21.8 percent of all reported income in 2005, up significantly from 19.8 percent the year before and more than double their share of income in 1980. The peak was in 1928, when the top 1 percent reported 23.9 percent of all income.
 The top tenth of a percent and top one-hundredth of a percent recorded even bigger gains in 2005 over the previous year. Their incomes soared by about a fifth in one year, largely because of the rising stock market and increased business profits. 
 The top tenth of a percent reported an average income of $5.6 million, up $908,000, while the top one-hundredth of a percent had an average income of $25.7 million, up nearly $4.4 million in one year.

HEADLINE: Mergers and Acquisitions No Longer Shock Japanese

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 24 

 BODY:
One of the hottest new shows on Japanese television is called ''Vulture,'' though it is hardly a nature program. It is about a fictional New York investment fund that buys ailing Japanese companies and imposes harsh American-style management changes.
 That may strike Americans as dry finance instead of family entertainment. But the program's popularity in Japan underscores a new openness in this country's business culture. After being virtually taboo for decades, corporate mergers have risen sharply in the last three years and are becoming something of a preoccupation even among ordinary people.
While Japan is a long way from the dog-eat-dog world of corporate America and Europe, takeovers and buyouts are becoming a common, if not always welcome, feature of the business landscape. The number of mergers involving Japanese companies as buyers or sellers more than quadrupled in a decade, to 2,775 deals last year from 621 in 1996, according to Recof, a Tokyo-based market research company. 
 In most such deals, the buyers were Japanese companies, which have also begun snapping up overseas businesses in large numbers for the first time since the late 1980s. 
 Corporate takeovers used to be rare here because of a deep cultural aversion to selling one's company, which had been seen as a humiliating failure by founders and owners. 
 But confronted with years of sluggish growth, and with the nation's birthrate among the world's lowest, companies are finding themselves with little choice but to seek new ways to increase revenue and profit -- by gobbling up competitors, for instance.
 ''Japan's in an M.& A. boom,'' said Nobuo Sayama, a professor of management at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo and president of GCA, a merger advisory firm. ''The thinking has changed here.''
 Analysts and bankers say the rise of mergers is part of Japan's embrace of less-fettered competition that has helped revive its $5 trillion economy from a decade of stagnation. The emergence last year of the first hostile takeover attempt between Japanese companies -- when Oji Paper tried but failed to buy the rival Hokuetsu Paper Mills -- was widely seen as a nail in the coffin for the old Japan Inc. collegial brand of capitalism.
 Hostile takeovers remain rare because of a cultural aversion to confrontation, and even friendly acquisitions can still carry a social stigma. Companies often go to great lengths to characterize takeovers as ''mergers of equals'' to save face for the company being bought. Healthy companies resist the idea of putting themselves on the block, even if a sale would enrich management and shareholders.
 This mind-set prevents Japan from becoming as active a merger market as other advanced economies, bankers say. In the United States, an economy 2.6 times the size of Japan's, there were nearly four times the number of mergers last year as in Japan: 10,634, according to Thomson Financial. European countries had 12,091, Thomson said.
 ''Japan has definitely embraced M.& A. as a tool for strategic growth,'' said Yasushi Hatakeyama, head of the Tokyo office of Lazard Freres, an investment bank specializing in mergers. ''But there's still the perception left that selling your business is a defeat.''
 And selling to foreigners often seems to be the biggest defeat of all, bankers and analysts say. As a result, foreign investors get only a small slice of the market, acting as buyer in just 171 deals last year -- a little more than 6 percent of all mergers involving Japanese companies, according to Recof.
 But these deals grab most of the headlines in Japan, where foreigners, and particularly foreign funds, are often viewed as hagetaka, or vultures, that have come to feed on hapless Japanese companies. To avoid scrutiny, an American fund, Steel Partners, does not even list the phone number of its office in the Marunouchi district of Tokyo, and it refused requests for an interview.
 Last month, Steel faced a wave of alarmist press reports about its ''greedy'' intentions after making a $1.2 billion bid for one of Japan's top brewery companies, Sapporo Holdings. Two American buyout firms, Texas Pacific and Cerberus, are among those bidding for the Victor Company of Japan, an ailing electronics producer that makes JVC products. On March 6, Citigroup offered as much as $10.8 billion to buy a troubled brokerage firm, Nikko Cordial, in what would be the largest foreign takeover ever here.
 The fear of an influx of foreign capital has been building ahead of a rule change in May that will allow overseas companies to acquire Japanese businesses with their own shares instead of cash, easing the way for more international mergers. This has many of Japan's salarymen looking over their shoulders for fear of foreigners swooping down on their companies. But many other Japanese seem to accept a Darwinian model as inevitable.
 When the national broadcaster NHK showed the first episode of ''Vulture'' last month, the show's director expected the audience to view the American fund, which was called Horizon Investment, as the villain. But to his surprise, about half the viewers responding supported the fund and faulted the Japanese acquisition targets for getting into trouble in the first place, the director, Keishi Ohtomo, said.
 Mr. Ohtomo said NHK decided to go ahead with the show after seeing the intense popular interest in mergers. The first episode attracted an impressive 3.5 million viewers in Tokyo alone, according to Video Research, a television ratings agency.
 ''The show struck a chord among Japanese because M.& A. is suddenly something that is close to our lives,'' he said. ''Japan is still trying to decide whether M.& A. is a good thing or a bad thing.''
 The level of interest was apparent on a recent evening in a Tokyo subway station, where commuters thumbed tabloids with articles speculating on foreign vultures' next victims. Nobutaka Yamada, a 37-year-old bank manager, said Japanese had to adapt to the competition, or risk being left behind in the global economy. ''Japan must learn to live with these vultures,'' Mr. Yamada said, ''or it will face takeover from an even bigger vulture, China.''
 Despite such sentiments, it is often the Japanese company that is buying the foreign one. Rich with cash from a rebounding economy, Japanese buyers acquired 412 foreign businesses last year, double the number of three years ago and the highest level since 1990, according to Recof.
 And analysts and bankers say Japanese companies have learned their lesson from their last overseas buying binge in the late 1980s, when they often paid extravagant amounts for trophy acquisitions like Columbia Pictures. This time, the acquisitions are making sounder business sense, they say.
 These include the office equipment maker Ricoh's $725 million purchase of I.B.M.'s digital printer unit, announced late in January; the $5.4 billion takeover early last year of Westinghouse Electric, which has evolved into a nuclear reactor maker; and Bridgestone's $1.05 billion agreement in December to buy Bandag, a Muscatine, Iowa, company that specializes in retreading worn tires. The deal will give Bridgestone entree into the retread market with control of Bandag's technology and 900 worldwide dealers.
 Saul A. Solomon, a vice president at Bridgestone's American subsidiary in Nashville, who is overseeing the merger, said, ''It would have taken us a number of years to build this kind of business up on our own.''
 Over the next few years, many bankers and fund managers expect mergers to become even more common here. The biggest reason, they say, is more assertive shareholders. 
 While the largest shareholders in Japan used to be companies and banks that silently supported management, these days they are outnumbered by individuals and foreign institutions. These new stock owners are making demands on management. 
 Last month disgruntled shareholders, unhappy with the terms of a proposed merger, vetoed such a deal for the first time. In that case, the American manager of a Japanese fund rallied the Japanese shareholders of a small steel maker, Tokyo Kohtetsu, to block its purchase by a rival, Osaka Steel.
 ''Shareholders are starting to stand up and they are powerful,'' said the fund manager, Scott Callon, chief executive of Ichigo Asset Management. ''Japanese management is increasingly being driven to do things differently, including M.& A.''

HEADLINE: A Dermatologist Shortage

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The emergence of cosmetic dermatology during the past 10 years is a fact of life. What ''The New Political Fixer: The Skin Doctor'' (Thursday Styles, March 22) did not mention is that, with the economic rewards for dermatologists who go the Botox route, real shortages in the availability of dermatologists to treat skin cancer, psoriasis, acne and warts are occurring in most of the urban areas of the country. 
Surveys of manpower needs show that patients may have to wait up to three months for care of important skin diseases by medically oriented dermatologists.
 As a dermatologist with 50 years under my belt, I am saddened by the loss of professionalism by my fellow dermatologists, and the emphasis on appearance that fuels the new desire not to grow or look old.Michael J. Franzblau, M.D.San Francisco, March 22, 2007The writer is a clinical professor of dermatology at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine.

HEADLINE: Killings in First Quarter Drop to One a Day, Lowest Rate in Decades

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
The recent fatal shootings of two auxiliary police officers and a restaurant worker in Greenwich Village hark back to a time when New York City's streets were far more deadly. But the city's year-to-date homicide rate is at its lowest point since before the Police Department started tracking crime using current record-keeping techniques in 1962.
 According to the department figures, 84 homicides were reported citywide from Jan. 1 through Sunday, an average of exactly one killing a day. That was down 28 percent from 117 during the same period last year. 
The first-quarter numbers continue what has been a downward trend in overall serious crime in the city. 
 Although the number of homicides in the city increased last year to 596 from 540 in 2005, total figures for all the major crimes the department tracks -- including murder, rape, robbery and assault -- dropped 4.7 percent in 2006. 
 By early indications, the decrease in violent crime in New York City continues to defy nationwide trends. After falling for several years, homicide, gun assault and robbery rates across the country rose by double-digit percentages in 2005 and 2006, according to a recent report by the Police Executive Research Forum. 
 ''There isn't any other big city that continues to show these remarkable results for such a long time,'' said David M. Kennedy, director of the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ''The national crime decline is over.''
 Mr. Kennedy dismissed the notion that the city's prosperity explained the dip. ''It's not just that the city is doing well economically,'' he said. ''Part of the reason it's doing well economically is it's so safe.''
 The lower violent-crime figures seem particularly striking given the recent surge in violence against the city's police. Along with the two auxiliary officers who were killed on March 14, three other officers have been wounded in the line of duty in stabbings or shootings in recent weeks, including a police officer who was shot in the leg in Brooklyn Tuesday night. Another officer was wounded in Brooklyn in February. Speaking to reporters yesterday, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said the violence showed that having a safer city came at the cost of police officers' risking their lives.
 Many experts credit the city's Police Department with much of the drop, praising its strategic policing as well as its dissemination of up-to-date crime statistics. By using those figures, the department holds precinct commanders accountable if crime in their areas goes up, according to Jerome H. Skolnick, co-director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University's School of Law.
 Some experts also attribute much of the drop to an increase in police officers, demographic changes among the city's young people and the ebbing of the crack epidemic.
 But some critics, including civil liberties advocates, contend that the dip in violent crime has been accompanied by overly aggressive policing, which they say is too great a price, Mr. Skolnick said. One of the most heated debates surrounds so-called stop and frisks: Of the 508,540 times people were stopped on New York City streets last year -- a fivefold increase from 2002 -- more than half were black. Commissioner Kelly said earlier this year that officers were stopping people only when they ''reasonably suspect'' them of committing a crime, though critics wondered why so many people were stopped if overall crime was down. 
 ''Without a doubt, Commissioner Kelly is a top-notch manager,'' Mr. Skolnick said. ''But the problem he has to deal with is how to maintain low violent-crime rates while not offending communities where crime is potentially the highest.''
 New York is not the only major city where the violent-crime rate has fallen this year. In Los Angeles, 64 homicides were recorded by March 17, a drop of 27 percent compared with the same period last year.

HEADLINE: City Wants Statue of Liberty Ferry Service to Expand Harbor Routes

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
In an effort to expand ferry service beyond the major tourist attractions to other parts of New York Harbor, city officials made an attempt yesterday to insert themselves into the federal government's process of choosing a Statue of Liberty ferry operator.
 The city offered to share its resources and marketing expertise with companies bidding for the lucrative ferry contract. In exchange, it asked them to agree that if they win, they will help the city with its goal of providing ferry service to tie various parts of the waterfront together as a Harbor District. 
 City officials hope that the statue, which attracts more than four million visitors a year, will become the district's centerpiece. But the National Park Service, which operates the statue and Ellis Island and has an April 27 deadline for the bids, put little emphasis on expanding service around the harbor in its contract. 
 Boats operated by Circle Line Sightseeing, the company that currently takes tourists to the statue and Ellis Island, leave only from Battery Park in Lower Manhattan and Liberty State Park in Jersey City. City officials want to expand that service to other areas they plan to redevelop, including Governors Island and Brooklyn Bridge Park.
 Several companies are expected to bid against Circle Line for the new contract, which would run for 10 years starting in the fall. But the park service did not offer bidders much incentive to expand the service beyond the two existing routes.
 Circle Line's revenue from the service was about $35 million in 2005, making it one of the biggest commercial operations among all of the national parks. 
 Without notifying park service officials in advance, the city's Economic Development Corporation invited prospective bidders yesterday to sign on as partners with City Hall. With access to the city's tourism-marketing resources and the city Parks Department's management experience, bidders who team up with the city could gain ''an advantage over those that do not,'' according to a solicitation the Economic Development Corporation released.
 For example, the city's marketing arm, NYC & Company, plans to set up a Web site that would allow tourists to book and pay for a trip to the city, including hotel rooms and tickets to museums and theaters. A ferry operator that pairs up with the city and wins the bid could then promote its service and sell tickets through that site, said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development. 
 But that service would not be available to a winning bidder who chose not to partner with the city, Mr. Doctoroff said. He added that ''we are not in any way trying to think about this as a way of penalizing anybody.''
 Instead, he said, ''we believe it can be a significant positive because by coordinating marketing efforts with the city, they will see greater ridership and therefore greater revenue.''
 In exchange for the city's aid, the bidders would have to agree to help develop what Mr. Doctoroff called a ''unified Harbor District,'' linked by a network of boats that would share a name, look and logos.
 Maria Burks, the commissioner of the National Parks of New York Harbor, said that she had no objection to the city's proposal to bidders and that it would not affect the park service's bidding process. 
 Ferry operators who are contemplating bidding for the park service contract were not prepared to say whether they would take the city up on its offer. They have just three weeks to decide: the city's deadline for responses is April 18, nine days before the park service's deadline.

HEADLINE: No U-Turns

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
There is an argument floating around Republican circles that in order to win again, the G.O.P. has to reconnect with the truths of its Goldwater-Reagan glory days. It has to once again be the minimal-government party, the maximal-freedom party, the party of rugged individualism and states' rights.
 This is folly. It's the wrong diagnosis of current realities and so the wrong prescription for the future. 
 Back in the 1970s, when Reaganism became popular, top tax rates were in the 70s, growth was stagnant and inflation was high. Federal regulation stifled competition. Government welfare policies enabled a culture of dependency. Socialism was still a coherent creed, and many believed the capitalist world was headed toward a Swedish welfare model. 
 In short, in the 1970s, normal, nonideological people were right to think that their future prospects might be dimmed by a stultifying state. People were right to believe that government was undermining personal responsibility. People were right to have what Tyler Cowen, in a brilliant essay in Cato Unbound, calls the ''liberty vs. power'' paradigm burned into their minds -- the idea that big government means less personal liberty.
 But today, many of those old problems have receded or been addressed. Today the big threats to people's future prospects come from complex, decentralized phenomena: Islamic extremism, failed states, global competition, global warming, nuclear proliferation, a skills-based economy, economic and social segmentation.
 Normal, nonideological people are less concerned about the threat to their freedom from an overweening state than from the threats posed by these amorphous yet pervasive phenomena. The ''liberty vs. power'' paradigm is less germane. It's been replaced in the public consciousness with a ''security leads to freedom'' paradigm. People with a secure base are more free to take risks and explore the possibilities of their world.
 People with secure health care can switch jobs more easily. People who feel free from terror can live their lives more loosely. People who come from stable homes and pass through engaged schools are free to choose from a wider range of opportunities.
 The ''security leads to freedom'' paradigm is a fundamental principle of child psychology, but conservative think tankers and activists have been slow to recognize the change in their historical circumstance. All their intellectual training has been oriented by the ''liberty vs. power'' paradigm. (Postwar planning in Iraq was so poor because many in the G.O.P. were not really alive to the truth that security is a precondition for freedom.) 
 The general public, which is less invested in abstract principles, has been quicker to grope its way toward the new mental framework. As a Pew poll released last week indicated, the public has not lost its suspicion of big government. Most Americans believe government regulation does more harm than good. But they do think government should be more active in redressing segmentation and inequality. Almost all corporations, including Wal-Mart, have extraordinarily high approval ratings. But voters are clearly anxious about globalization.
 The Republican Party, which still talks as if government were the biggest threat to choice, has lost touch with independent voters. Offered a choice between stale Democrats and stale Republicans, voters now choose Democrats, who at least talk about economic and domestic security. 
 The Democrats have a 15 point advantage in voter identification. Voters prefer Democratic economic policies by 14 points, Democratic tax policies by 15 points, Democratic health care policies by 24 points and Democratic energy policies by 20 points. If this is a country that wants to return to Barry Goldwater, it is showing it by supporting the policies of Dick Durbin.
 The sad thing is that President Bush sensed this shift in public consciousness back in 1999. Compassionate conservatism was an attempt to move beyond the ''liberty vs. power'' paradigm. But because it was never fleshed out and because the Congressional G.O.P. rejected the implant, a new Republican governing philosophy did not emerge. 
 The party is going to have to make another run at it. As it does, it will have to shift mentalities. The ''security leads to freedom'' paradigm doesn't end debate between left and right, it just engages on different ground. It is oriented less toward negative liberty (How can I get the government off my back?) and more toward positive liberty (Can I choose how to lead my life?).
 Goldwater and Reagan were important leaders, but they're not models for the future.

HEADLINE: 'Steamroller' In Albany Learns How To Concede

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and DANNY HAKIM; Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 28 

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer brought a hard-charging style to Albany, taking on adversaries personally and directly, even lambasting lawmakers in their home districts. But the State Legislature knows how to play hardball too, and the rookie governor is having to meet them halfway on his first budget.
 So after Governor Spitzer waged a lonely, bruising political battle to try to reduce Medicaid costs -- and was attacked in millions of dollars of television ads paid for by the health care union and a hospitals association -- he ended up agreeing to restore many proposed cuts as part of the budget deal he is hammering out.
In a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Spitzer claimed a victory of sorts, saying that the agreements he and legislative leaders had reached so far had given him much of what he wanted. But he acknowledged that he had had to alter many of his key proposals to win the support of lawmakers.
 ''The overall level of spending, obviously, it is a bit higher than I had initially wanted,'' Governor Spitzer said. ''As I've said to a number of you over the course of today, you do not turn a battleship inside a bathtub. It takes a bit more than one budget cycle to get us down to the spending levels we want.'' 
 Talks are still under way as the governor and the Legislature struggle to meet the April 1 budget dealine. But both sides say the Legislature has succeeded in increasing Mr. Spitzer's proposed budget by nearly $1 billion -- about the amount it usually adds to a governor's budget. And now lawmakers in both parties are questioning privately whether the governor's alpha-dog style has been all that effective. 
 State Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader, who led the main opposition to the governor's budget and sometimes found himself at the business end of the governor's public tongue-lashings, seemed pleased.
 ''You know, I've stated before and others have stated, when you want to talk about numbers -- depends on how you count,'' Mr. Bruno said at a hearing, to much laughter. ''You understand that, I understand that, this governor's learned it quickly.'' 
 The counting was still not done on Wednesday night. While there were many areas still to be agreed on, the agreements drove total spending for next year up to more than $121.6 billion -- making it the ninth-largest increase of state-financed spending in the last 40 years, according to the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative policy group. 
 Civic groups -- which have been largely supportive of Governor Spitzer so far -- were decidedly cool to the few details that emerged from the budget negotiations. The Citizens Budget Commission, which praised many of the governor's proposals, called the agreed-on Medicaid cuts ''modest,'' and said the price for achieving them was high in terms of increased spending overall. 
 Numerous civic groups complained about the secrecy of the budget talks, saying that it looked as if, in the rush to make the April 1 deadline, the governor would have to waive the constitutional requirement that gives lawmakers three days to study laws before voting on them. 
 There were many contentious issues left to be resolved -- any one of which could derail the chances of passing a budget by Sunday. These included whether to allow more charter schools in the state, whether to add a nickel deposit to cans and bottles of non-carbonated beverages, whether to give a tax break to people who send their children to private and parochial schools, and whether to give pay raises to judges.
 But in a number of areas, Mr. Spitzer argued that the agreements he won would yield dividends in the future, even if they did not look significant at first.
 His plan to create a new school spending formula to send more money to New York City and other high-needs districts survived, with some significant changes. But the Republican-led State Senate got him to double the amount of operating aid being sent to Long Island's school districts, and to increase aid to other wealthy districts. 
 This allows the governor to boast that he has boiled the state's many arcane formulas down to one understandable, predictable formula, and that he has broken the historic system of dividing school aid by shares -- a system that always gave New York City close to 39 percent of new school aid and Long Island between 12 and 13 percent.
 Senate Republicans lost their fight to change the new formula to enshrine the current share system, but were nonetheless able to win an agreement to add $420 million outside the formula to make sure Long Island gets its traditional share next year.
 ''In terms of operating aid, what we call above the line, I believe our share will be at least what it was in the past'' said Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican. ''Maybe a little more.''
 Still, even if shares survive in some form next year, analysts argue that the new formula is significant. ''I think if you succeed in changing the formula through the statute -- putting in place a new aid formula that actually breaks shares -- that is significant,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, the director of the Empire Center.
 And when it came to the fight over health care spending -- the biggest public battle of the budget -- the governor said that he was restoring about $350 million out of his $1.3 billion in proposed cuts. Details were sketchy, but people with knowledge of the deal said the largest components involved restoring most of an annual inflation adjustment to Medicaid payments made to hospitals and nursing homes, and allowing the expiration of a tax on hospitals that he had proposed extending. 
 During the budget battle, the leaders of two powerful health care groups, 1199 United Healthcare Workers East and the Greater New York Hospital Association, were singled out for criticism by Governor Spitzer in front of hundreds of business and civic leaders at a power breakfast early this month. On Wednesday they gleefully sent out a news release claiming that the governor's concessions would amount to the restoration of nearly 70 percent of his proposed cuts to hospitals and nursing homes.
 But Mr. Spitzer said that ''their 70 percent is just way off.''
 ''The hospital reductions are over 50 percent of what we had initially proposed, over 50 percent, and that is an important number,'' Mr. Spitzer said. 
 But the governor won changes to how health care spending is distributed that he argues will yield benefits in time, and he got the State Senate to agree to pass a False Claims Act that he says will help Albany significantly recoup losses from Medicaid fraud.
 The governor agreed to the Senate's demand that property tax relief be sent directly to homeowners in the form of rebate checks. And while he held firm to his demand that it be focused on the middle class, he agreed to extend the relief to more high earners at the request of the Senate. 
 In the end Mr. Spitzer, who referred to himself earlier this year as a ''steamroller,'' did not flatten out everything in his path. He gave ground in some areas and won ground in others.
 ''There's no steam in the roller,'' State Senator Martin J. Golden, a Brooklyn Republican, said. ''You can't do it on your own. I think he's learning that.''

HEADLINE: The D.C. Tea Party

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Larry Chapman is a firefighter, and during an interview the other day I couldn't help but notice the burns from a recent fire that circled both of his wrists. He shrugged them off. Part of the job.
 He and I were talking about something that bothered him a lot more. He's an American citizen, lives in the nation's capital, has kept his nose clean his entire life and has always had a strong interest in national politics and government.
So why, he wanted to know, should he be denied the right to be represented in Congress? 
 President Bush was on television yesterday explaining why he feels it's so important to keep fighting the war in Iraq. Nearly 12 million Iraqi citizens showed up to vote, he said, ''to express their will about the future of their country.''
 Supporting that effort, in Mr. Bush's view, is an important enough reason to send Americans off to fight and die in Iraq.
 But in Washington, D.C., which has more than a half million residents, American citizens are denied the right ''to express their will about the future of their country'' by voting for members of Congress. And Mr. Bush has not only opposed their effort to right this egregious wrong, he has threatened to veto legislation that would give these D.C. residents -- hold your breath -- one seat in the House of Representatives.
 Someone please explain why the president is sending young Americans to fight and die for democracy abroad while working vigorously to deny the spread of democracy to American citizens here at home.
 ''Just because I live here,'' said Mr. Chapman, ''I'm denied the fundamental rights of every other American in the United States. That is messed up.''
 The slogan on license plates in the district is ''Taxation Without Representation.''
 There's a poster in wide circulation in the city, put out by DC Vote, a group that has campaigned hard for an expansion of voting rights. It shows two firefighters in full gear. One is Mr. Chapman, and the other is Jayme Heflin, who lives in Maryland. The poster says:
 ''Both will save your life. Only ONE has a vote in Congress -- Washington D.C.'s nearly 600,000 residents include firefighters, nurses, teachers and small business owners. They pay federal taxes like all Americans, but are denied representation in Congress. That's taxation without representation -- and it's still wrong.''
 This denial of a fundamental voting right is especially significant at this moment in history. The executive branch is under the control of a belligerent and often amateurish group that has hacked away at civil liberties and is adamant about pursuing a war that neither Congress nor the public wants.
 The rest of the nation's business, including the economy, which looks increasingly like it may be going south, has been neglected. Nothing was more basic to the establishment of a co-equal legislative branch than the idea that it would serve as a check on a runaway executive.
 And yet the residents of Washington (who can vote for president) are prevented from having any real say in the business of the legislature. (Eleanor Holmes Norton serves as a nonvoting delegate from the District.) There are, in fact, some Republicans who have stepped up valiantly on behalf of voting rights for the District. Representative Tom Davis, a Virginia Republican, has been a leader in the fight to have a Congressional seat established.
 But President Bush and some of his mean-spirited, antidemocratic allies are determined at all costs to prevent this expansion of the franchise to decent, honorable Americans.
 The threat of a presidential veto was already in the air as the House moved close to a vote last week on legislation to create the Congressional seat. And then the entire process was sabotaged when the sleazoids from the gun lobby, acting with their usual hypocrisy and bad faith, tried to insert language that would demolish the District's gun control laws.
 The legislation was pulled, to the delight of the mischief-makers. Democrats said they will try to bring the matter up for a vote again soon, without the offending language.
 This is another example of serious matters not being taken seriously in this country. President Bush and the bozos in the gun lobby probably got a chuckle out of their last-minute legislative maneuver. So clever of them.
 But the real issue is the continued denial of a vote -- something of tremendous value -- to men and women who want and deserve more of a say in the important matters facing their country.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall as Hopes of a Rate Cut Fade

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday after the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, repeated his concern that core inflation remained ''uncomfortably high,'' diminishing hopes that the Fed might soon reduce interest rates. The Dow Jones industrials fell nearly 100 points, the third consecutive session of declines.
 Investors' worries were compounded by a rise in oil prices to a six-month high and a weaker-than-expected rise in orders for large manufactured goods. 
In testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr. Bernanke also said that troubles among some mortgage lenders that cater to those with poor credit did not appear to have spread to the broader economy, but he added that the situation required further observation.
 Stocks rallied last week after investors interpreted language from the Fed as opening a possibility of a reduction in interest rates.
 ''I think what the Fed is trying to tell us is that it is between a rock and a hard place. And when you're between and a rock and a hard place, you just can't move,'' said Drew Matus, senior economist at Lehman Brothers Holdings.
 The Dow industrials declined 96.93 points, to close at 12,300.36. The Dow fell by as much as 140 points after the Fed released Mr. Bernanke's prepared remarks for his testimony.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 11.38 points, to end at 1,417.23, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 20.33 points, to 2,417.10. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.96 points, to 797.40. 
 ''It wasn't quite a perfect storm, but you had enough winds buffeting the market around, so it made it hard,'' Mr. Matus said, referring to the combination of Mr. Bernanke's testimony, the report on orders for durable goods and political tensions between Iran and the West.
 Economic data released yesterday also weighed on investors. The Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods increased 2.5 percent in February, less than the 3.5 percent expected, after a fall of 9.3 percent in January. 
 Adding to economic concerns, oil prices continued to climb amid political tensions in the Middle East over Iran's detention of British sailors and marines. 
 Oil prices spiked after rumors, which the American military denied, that Iran had fired a missile at a United States ship in the Persian Gulf. Also, weekly government inventory data showed a decline in stores of crude oil, gasoline and distillates.
 Light crude rose $1.15, to settle at $64.08 a barrel, its highest level since Sept. 11, 2006.
 In corporate news, the home builder Beazer Homes fell $2.64 a share, to $28.77, after coming under government investigation for its mortgage lending practices as well as other financial dealings. Beazer said it was complying with a federal prosecutor's request for documents.
 Other home builders also fell. Hovnanian Enterprises dropped $1.09 a share, to $25.55, while KB Home fell $1.43 a share, to $43.88.
 Circuit City Stores rose 35 cents, to $19.23 a share, after the company announced plans to lay off about 3,400 workers at its stores and replace them with lower-paid employees. The company also plans to eliminate 130 technology jobs.
 Archer Daniels Midland increased 91 cents a share, to $36.84, after an analyst at Citigroup said the company, which also makes a type of ethanol derived from corn, should benefit if an expected bump in supply pushes corn prices down.
 Vyyo, a communications equipment maker, rose 97 cents, to $8.44 a share, after receiving $35 million in financing from Goldman Sachs.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note dropped 5/32, to 100 1/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.62 percent, from 4.60 percent.

HEADLINE: Reassurance By Fed Chief On Loan Ills

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS and EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Wednesday that he did not expect the escalating problems in the mortgage lending business to spread to the rest of the economy, but noted that the Fed had given itself the ''flexibility'' to adjust interest rates should the outlook change for better or for worse.
 In his first remarks on the economy since the Fed decided last week to leave interest rates unchanged, Mr. Bernanke did not stray far from the monetary policy statement the central bank issued with its decision. Inflation is still the predominant concern, and the economy does not appear to be in danger of slowing too much, he said in testimony to the Congressional Joint Economic Committee. 
To many analysts, the Fed appears on track to keep its main short-term interest rate steady, but investors appeared to read the comments as a sign that a cut in interest rates was somewhat less likely soon.
 Stock prices fell sharply as news media reported the substance of Mr. Bernanke's prepared testimony. But they recovered some of that lost ground as he continued testifying through the morning. Still, Wall Street ended the day broadly lower as investors digested news of rising oil prices and modest orders of durable goods in February. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 0.8 percent for the day, closing at 1,417.23, while the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 96.93 points, or nearly 0.8 percent as well, to 12,300.36.
 Mr. Bernanke, in his testimony and in responding to questions from lawmakers, offered a window into the Fed's thinking, saying that growing doubts about which path the economy might take prompted the central bank to leave itself some room.
 ''We are looking for a bit more flexibility, given the uncertainties that we are facing and the risks that are occurring on both sides of our outlook,'' he said. Those uncertainties have ''increased somewhat in recent weeks.''
 He was careful to hedge his remarks with a firm reiteration of the Fed's inclination to raise rates, not lower them, given the high rate of inflation.
 ''I do want to emphasize that we have not shifted away from an inflation bias,'' he said.
 The hearing also allowed Mr. Bernanke to wade deeper into the discussion about whether the rising number of defaults among riskier borrowers -- those with weak or subprime credit histories -- threatened the nation's overall economic vitality. 
 Mr. Bernanke's answer, in short, was probably not. 
 In recent months, numerous subprime lenders have reported serious financial problems. As homeowner defaults have risen, dozens of small subprime lenders have gone out of business. Some lenders have filed for bankruptcy. Others have stopped issuing loans or tightened lending standards. 
 Many economists have expressed concerns that trouble in the subprime market could worsen the slump in the housing market and, in turn, cause the economy to stall.
 But Mr. Bernanke said the Fed believed that was unlikely to happen. ''The impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained,'' he said. 
 His picture of the economy was generally sanguine. 
 The economy is likely to expand at a moderate pace this year and inflation is expected to decline slightly, he said. He expects business investment and consumer spending to continue to grow.
 Mr. Bernanke also weighed in on the issue of whether Congress should more closely regulate mortgage lenders.
 Some lawmakers have called for tighter restrictions on issuing loans to people with low incomes and weak credit. 
 In the hearing on Wednesday, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said he planned to introduce legislation that would establish a national regulatory system for mortgage brokers.
 Mr. Bernanke said that he believed ''it's worth looking at'' whether Congress should give the Fed the authority to enforce regulations on mortgage lenders that are not part of a banking institution. 
 ''Although we have the authority to pass these rules, we still have the enforcement issue,'' he said. ''Our enforcement powers do not extend beyond the banking system.''
 But broadly, the Federal Reserve chairman said that imposing government restrictions had the potential to damage the housing market. He said financial institutions were already tightening their lending standards, which would eventually bring the housing market back into balance. 
 In the short term, though, tougher lending standards could further reduce the demand for housing and add to the bloated inventories of unsold homes.
 Democrats and Republicans on the Joint Economic Committee greeted Mr. Bernanke with blunt expressions of worry, particularly about troubles in the housing market. And they used the forum to advocate tougher legislation.
 ''This is a terrible instance where a lack of oversight has led to a Wild West mentality among unscrupulous lenders and, frankly, the exploitation of large numbers of financially unsophisticated borrowers,'' Mr. Schumer said. 
 During the hearing, Mr. Bernanke was his usual self: cautious and economical with his words and at times cagey, never tipping his hand about what he thinks the Fed's next move would be.
 Might Mr. Bernanke indulge the committee with a scenario under which the Fed might cut rates, asked Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat from New York.
 The chairman politely declined. ''I can't tell you specifically what policy is going to do,'' he said.
 James Knightley, an economist with ING Global Financial Markets, said: ''While Bernanke seems to have made room for the possibility of policy easing with his more guarded prognosis for the U.S. economy, he continues to believe that inflation is the main threat to the economy.'' 
 ''Therefore any imminent policy easing seems unlikely.''

HEADLINE: Drivers Offer a Collective Ho-Hum as Gasoline Prices Soar

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Lisa Munoz contributed reporting in Los Angeles, Nate Schweber in Westchester County and Micheline Maynard in Detroit.

DATELINE: HOUSTON, March 29 

 BODY:
Prices at the pump are rising again, much as they do every spring as oil traders bid up the price of crude ahead of possible summer shortages. Possibilities for more conflict in Iran and elsewhere in the Middle East are adding to the surge.
 But there is something new this time, energy experts say, in how drivers are reacting -- or, more accurately, not reacting, even as the price of gas has climbed over the last two months to a national average of more than $2.60 a gallon. It has topped $3 a gallon in many parts of the country, particularly along the Pacific Coast.
In the late 1970s, OPEC oil shocks and gas lines persuaded most Americans to sacrifice some of their pleasure trips and drives to the mall, ease up on the gas pedal, and switch to the bus or train.
 But as Americans enter the sixth year of rising oil and gasoline prices, their shift in driving habits this time has been much less extensive. What's more, in recent weeks, gas consumption has gone up, not down, and drivers are changing their daily driving habits only slightly. 
 ''I don't think about gas prices at all,'' said Michael Machat, 48, a lawyer in West Los Angeles, where gasoline prices are among the highest in the country. As he filled up his BMW with super unleaded at $3.39 this week, he added, ''I guess maybe if it was $10 a gallon, I'd think about it.''
 A recent study that Christopher Knittel, an economics professor at the University of California, Davis, helped write showed that every time from November 1975 to November 1980 that gasoline prices went up 20 percent, consumers changed their driving behavior by cutting gas consumption by 6 percent per capita nationwide.
 But from March 2001 to March 2006, drivers reduced consumption just 1 percent when prices rose 20 percent. Prices swung up and down seasonally during both periods, but Mr. Knittel said the two periods were comparable because regular gasoline prices increased in both periods by about 66 percent, to $2.50 from $1.50 in real terms, set at 2000 dollars.
 While more and more consumers around the country are buying smaller, more-efficient cars and fewer S.U.V.s, that trend is unfolding a lot more slowly these days than 30 years ago. It was a very different era back then, when Congress was willing to enact tougher gasoline standards and when President Jimmy Carter called on the country ''to live thriftily'' and ''find ways to adjust and to make our society more efficient.''
 ''One would think that with prices up over the last few years, people would drive less, but that's not the case,'' said Aaron Brady, an expert on gasoline refining and consumption at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm. ''Demand is up over the last year.''
 The Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that gasoline demand for transportation over the last four weeks averaged 9.2 million barrels a day, or 1.6 percent higher than in the corresponding time last year, when prices were a bit lower. The rising use by consumers and businesses is putting further pressure on prices. On top of that, United States commercial crude oil inventories fell by 0.9 million barrels in the week ended March 23, compared with the previous week. Spring is also the season when refineries retool, producing slightly less gasoline.
 Economists say the increasing demand for gasoline and the muted reaction among drivers are related to many factors, all having enormous policy implications as the Bush administration and Congress try to find ways to stem climate change and oil imports, which now supply about 60 percent of American needs.
 Experts note that commuters are driving longer distances to work because of suburban sprawl, that improvements in mass transit have fallen behind over the years and that driving to malls and ferrying children around has become part of the American lifestyle. Some suggest that with more dual-income families, high gas prices mean less to many families than they once did, and credit cards have eased the immediate pain at the pump.
 ''Our preferences have changed over the years and we are much more willing to continue our driving habits in the face of price increases,'' said Mr. Knittel, who is studying driver response to gas price increases. ''Unlike the 1970s when people did drive less, data shows people now are not taking the extra step to conserve.'' 
 Interviews with drivers around the country show they are less than alarmed by the new run-up in prices, even if they are not happy about it. And they still suspect Big Oil is fleecing them. Not surprisingly, higher-income drivers are particularly unruffled, but middle-income drivers also seem fairly tranquil.
 Veronica Burgos, a 39-year-old bookkeeper, says she is not about to give up her aging gas-guzzling navy blue Ford Explorer to commute to work and shuttle her children around, even though gasoline prices in the Los Angeles area where she lives are now ''ridiculous.''
 ''With this S.U.V., you really feel it, but I have two kids so I need it,'' she said. ''In reality my husband would probably rather that I don't drive the S.U.V. so much, but I still do and I drive quite a bit. With work and two kids and all their activities, especially on the weekend, we're more comfortable in the S.U.V. So what are you going to do?''
 Across the country prices of gasoline have been shooting up for the last two months, with AAA reporting that the average retail price for regular unleaded is $2.62 a gallon, the highest since last September and 12 cents higher than a year ago. A month ago, the average was $2.37. 
 With crude oil prices rising in recent days because of Iran's detention of British military personnel last week, some experts say retail gasoline prices may go up another 10 or 15 cents in the next couple of weeks before settling down. Oil closed up $1.95 at $66.03 a barrel on Thursday. 
 ''The market rally in gasoline is like the Oscars,'' said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at Oil Price Information Service, a trade publication. ''It gets moved up every year.''
 The immediate cause for the rise in gas prices is the annual slowdown in March at the refineries, as they switch from winter to summer oil blends. But this year, that has been accentuated by refinery accidents, escalating tensions over Iran and more speculation by traders. 
 ''The prices for unleaded gasoline are way overblown for this time of year,'' said Michael Rose, director of the energy trading desk at Angus Jackson in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ''The traders are just going along with a theory that we are going to have a gasoline shortage in the summer.''
 Most experts expect prices to ease in April, as refineries resume full operation, before rising again during the summer driving season. But many are wondering why the demand for gasoline is going up in March, a month not usually known for heavy driving.
 ''Is it because the economy is stronger or because people are going back to their old driving habits?'' wondered Charles T. Drevna of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association. 
 There had been signs that the high price of oil was beginning to have an impact on consumption. The International Energy Agency reported that oil consumption in its 30 member countries, including the United States, declined 0.6 percent last year, the first drop in more than two decades.
 Sales of sport utility vehicles peaked in 2002, and have fallen since; sales of small cars rose 5.3 percent last year. 
 But in research for a new study, Mr. Knittel said he found little change in the average fuel efficiencies of vehicles driven by motorists over the last five years. 
 ''Our preliminary analysis is showing vehicle choice is less sensitive to gas prices today than compared with the 1970s,'' he said. ''We might be buying fewer S.U.V.s, but a lot of the shifting is to cars that are not appreciably more fuel-efficient, such as minivans.''

HEADLINE: A Union Takes Cautious Aim at Blackstone's Public Offering Plan

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
Norma Rae, Wall Street insider?
 In Europe, unions have been organizing street demonstrations against the power, influence and wealth of private equity firms.
In the United States, union sentiments are running in the same direction. But instead of taking to the streets with European-style demonstrations or to the barricades like the cotton-mill union organizer of the 1979 movie, unions in the United States have embraced the tactics of technology -- the Internet. 
 A blog dedicated to the proposed $4 billion initial public offering by the Blackstone Group, the first of the big American private equity firms to go public, was started Tuesday evening by the Service Employees International Union, which has two million members and is led by the charismatic Andrew Stern. 
 The blog, blackstonerevealed.blogspot.com, so far does not offer anything resembling a critique of Blackstone, nor does it take issue with the vast riches made by the firm's co-founder, Stephen A. Schwarzman.
 Rather, the blog, which at first did not even identify itself as associated with the S.E.I.U., appears to be little more than a cautious collection of articles linked from newspaper and magazine Web sites that highlight aspects of the Blackstone I.P.O. 
 ''One of the things that is interesting about the news articles is that they're so comment-oriented on their own,'' said Stephen Lerner, assistant to the president of the S.E.I.U., in explaining why there seemed to be so little union perspective on the site. The union does not express an opinion as to whether it thinks people should buy Blackstone stock when it becomes available.
 Mr. Lerner took issue with a reporter's use of the word ''targeted'' in asking about the goals behind the Blackstone Web site. 
 ''This is part of a broader question that goes way beyond Blackstone to one of how, in this economy, are workers able to have a voice in how they're treated,'' said Mr. Lerner. ''The question is, with private equity firms buying and selling companies, how do workers get a seat at the table of this discussion?''
 A spokesman for Blackstone declined to comment on the Web site. 
 This is not the first time the S.E.I.U. has used the power of the Internet to focus attention on a private equity firm. 
 More than three years ago, the union sponsored a site that criticized the Chicago buyout firm GTCR Golder Rauner in an effort to pressure contract talks at a nursing home company owned by GTCR. The union took down the Web site after GTCR sold the company. 
 This time, however, rather than trying to drum up support over a specific labor negotiation with a Blackstone-controlled company, the S.E.I.U. seems to be trying to frame a bigger debate over the growing concentration of wealth and the gap between corporate owners and executives and workers who earn far less and frequently lack benefits like health insurance. 
 ''We watched when Blackstone bought Equity Office Properties and saw billions of dollars exchange hands and millions of dollars in fees made, but I don't know of any janitors who work in those buildings who got health insurance who didn't have it before or who got a raise out of the deal,'' Mr. Lerner said.
 Chief executives of public companies, like H. Lee Scott Jr. of Wal-Mart or Robert L. Nardelli, the former chief of Home Depot, have long been criticized by unions, partly because of their wages, which have far outstripped those of their employees. 
 Now that Blackstone has decided to part the curtain on its finances and compensation to the extent required by a public offering, its executives may find themselves on the hot seat as well.
 Washington, too, is beginning to shine a spotlight on private equity firms. 
 Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, has been exploring the idea of taxing the huge fees that private equity firms take on the profit of investments as ordinary income instead of the lower capital gain.
 And Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Committee, said that he had met with a number of union heads, including Mr. Stern, and that he expected that private equity companies would face closer scrutiny.
 ''There is a concern that the takeover of companies by private equity firms could have a negative impact on the people who work for those companies,'' Mr. Frank said. ''One problem is when there is a high level of debt involved in the purchase, is whether that drives decisions to deal with the immediate implications of the debt rather than the long-term implications for the workers of the company.''
 At this stage of the game, it appears the S.E.I.U. is treading carefully.
 ''Private equity firms have to ask themselves, what is their role in society going to be? Are they going to be a part of making lives better or conducting themselves in a way that benefits many?'' asked Mr. Lerner. 
 ''That is a decision they're going to make. Is it part of their business model that they figure out during these transactions how the people who do the work in the buildings they buy actually going to share in the transaction?''
 For some union leaders, the good-old-fashioned stick -- the threat of a strike -- is still the best way to get noticed. 
 The United Automobile Workers union this week rejected a new wage offer from the Delphi Corporation, General Motors and the private equity firms that are looking to take Delphi out of bankruptcy. 
 The U.A.W. president, Ron Gettelfinger, vowed to strike if Delphi continued with plans to void its labor contracts in court. The private equity firms can back out of plans to invest as much as $3.4 billion in Delphi if no agreement is reached with the unions.
 Now that's a maneuver that would make Norma Rae proud.

HEADLINE: Ruling Could Lead to Tariffs on Chinese Goods

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29 

 BODY:
In a ruling that could lead to new trade barriers on imports from China, a federal judge on Thursday dismissed a bid by China to block the Bush administration from imposing tariffs on Chinese goods produced by heavily subsidized government companies. 
 The ruling, by Judge Gregory W. Carman of the United States Court of International Trade in New York, clears the way for the Commerce Department to decide whether to impose the tariff barriers on one specific product, high-gloss paper, as early as Friday.
The effect of the ruling could be even more far reaching. If the Commerce Department raises tariffs on paper, as many in the industry expect, it could set a precedent for duties to be imposed on steel, machinery, plastics, furniture and other goods from China.
 Executives and union employees in these industries say they may seek duties on the ground that their Chinese competitors have devastated American companies and thrown Americans out of work.
 Judge Carman dismissed the Chinese claim that the Commerce Department was barred from imposing the duties because it had no basis for such an action in the law or its own regulations. He said that the court had no jurisdiction to make such a finding.
 The Commerce Department announced last year that it would decide by April 2 whether to revise its longstanding ban on imposing duties to counteract industry subsidies in ''nonmarket economies.'' Such a step would break with a precedent established about 20 years ago.
 Duties can at present be imposed on products exported from these countries if ''dumping'' can be proved -- that is, if a United States industry can show that the products are sold below cost. But these antidumping duties are small compared with the duties under a separate regulation against subsidies.
 In the 1980s, the federal government adopted the rationale that it was impossible to tell what was a subsidy in a nonmarket economy like China's, closing off the possibility of ever imposing antisubsidy duties. But last year, the Commerce Department said it would review that ruling and make a new determination on the issue this year.
 Congressional leaders have, meanwhile, vowed to pass legislation to force the Commerce Department to impose the duties if it refuses to do so on its own.

HEADLINE: JIM HALL AND RON CARTER

BYLINE: By NATE CHINEN

 BODY:
Thirty-five years ago the guitarist Jim Hall, above left, and the bassist Ron Carter, above right, released ''Alone Together,'' the chronicle of an engagement at the old Playboy Club in New York. A study in effortless economy and subtlety, the album has long been a testament to their collaboration, which has since been repeated only infrequently. (They last performed together a decade ago.) 
It's a modest sort of landmark: after the springiest of welcomes, Sonny Rollins's calypso ''St. Thomas,'' it ambles through a handful of other themes, most just as untroubled and familiar. Along the way Mr. Hall finds myriad opportunities to practice his brand of humble virtuosity, and Mr. Carter takes quietly adventurous harmonic flights. They both sound superbly relaxed, whether engaging in improvisational dialogue -- the two-chorus solo portion of ''Softly, as in a Morning Sunrise'' consists entirely of back-and-forth exchanges -- or easing their way together through a theme. On ballads, including the title track, they wisely maintain a lightly strolling tempo; their nonballads employ much the same feeling, but at a brisker clip. There's no great range of volume or tempo, in other words, but the bright rapport enlivens the enterprise, keeping each song distinct from the rest. And along with the menu of standards come a surprise or two, like ''Receipt, Please,'' a postbop ditty by Mr. Carter, and an aptly named piece by Mr. Hall, ''Whose Blues?'' Of course it's unfortunate that ''Alone Together'' is currently out of print; the good news is that it can easily be found through various online sources, including the iTunes Music Store. Even better, Mr. Hall and Mr. Carter have decided to give their partnership another whirl next week at the Blue Note. Given that both musicians have sounded wonderful and wise in recent weeks, the sequel could well outdo the original. (Tuesday through April 8 at 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.) NATE CHINEN

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Slight Drop In City Unemployment

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN; Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate dropped to 4.8 percent in February, from 4.9 percent in January, the State Labor Department reported yesterday. The city's jobless rate, adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, has held below 5 percent for seven consecutive months, the longest stretch since 1988. The state's jobless rate rose to 4.4 percent, from 4.3 percent in January, but remained below the national rate of 4.5 percent. The number of private-sector jobs in the state increased only slightly last month, rising by 5,200, or 0.1 percent, to 7.18 million. In the last 12 months, the state has added 103,100 private-sector jobs, a gain of 1.2 percent. PATRICK McGEEHAN

HEADLINE: New Orleans Proposes to Invest in 17 Areas

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, March 29 

 BODY:
New Orleans unveiled its latest redevelopment plan Thursday, choosing 17 zones where the city has decided to concentrate resources in order to stimulate investment and renewal.
 The 17 development zones, each about a half-mile in diameter, are scattered throughout New Orleans. They vary from a devastated shopping plaza in the eastern section of the city, to blocks in the ruined Lower Ninth Ward and to areas not hard-hit by Hurricane Katrina but still in need of renewal, as officials put it, including the old St. Roch Market in the Bywater area.
The plan is at least the fourth such effort since the storm, and at about $1.1 billion, notably more modest than its predecessors. 
 Its modesty provided some hope that, unlike the other plans that have been shelved or are in limbo, the outline presented at City Hall by Mayor C. Ray Nagin and his recovery chief, Edward J. Blakely, may come to fruition in some form. 
 Indeed, Mr. Blakely, an academic and a recognized expert in disaster recovery, promised ''cranes on the skyline'' by September. But where exactly they will be, and what they will be doing, was unclear from Thursday's summary presentation. 
 While the city that tourists know has regained much of its old life, many other areas that were blighted long before the storm or that have become lifeless since, have yet to come back. 
 The hope is that if these 17 limited areas are redeveloped, they will become catalysts for further development around them.
 Under the plan, some of the public investment will be used as loans and unspecified ''other incentives'' to private developers, and some will be used for the development of public works like libraries and clinics. 
 A common historical thread is that the designated areas are ''all centered on the old markets, on which the city was built in the first place,'' Mr. Blakely said, referring to public market buildings like the St. Roch, that once were neighborhood hubs.
 The bulk of the money will be used on citywide projects like park improvements and traffic lights. 
 Development in the 17 areas will be ''driven by incentives and a market-driven approach,'' Mr. Nagin said at a City Hall news conference. He has long maintained that the economic market will guide New Orleans's recovery, a process that has been playing out in the 19 months since the hurricane, though not necessarily to the city's advantage. Developers, for instance, have been fearful of making large-scale commitments in the absence of an authoritative plan, and former residents who lack resources to re-establish themselves have yet to return. 
 Finger-pointing, bitterness and unrealistic expectations have helped to dissolve previous planning exercises that have emanated in a flurry since the hurricane. One recent proposal called for spending $14 billion on a grab-bag of ideas, with no parts of the city, no matter how vulnerable or dangerous, excluded. 
 This latest concept, with its narrow geographical focus and limited budget, struck some planners as more realistic. 
 ''It's promising to see somebody who is giving us a program that's based on a realistic assessment of potential resources,'' said Janet Howard, president of the Bureau of Governmental Research, a nonprofit public-policy organization here.
 Still, the money is not a sure thing. The biggest chunk, $324 million, depends on Congress's agreeing to waive Louisiana's share of federally financed disaster recovery projects. President Bush is against forgiving this 10 percent match, which is mandated under the law, but the idea of a waiver -- as was provided to New York after the Sept. 11 attacks and to Florida after Hurricane Andrew -- has strong support in Congress. 
 Another $260 million would come from bonds already approved by voters, and $300 million more would come from a new bond sale based on selling the city's blighted-property holdings to developers. 
 ''I expect by the end of the summer you're going to see a lot of activity,'' Mr. Nagin said Thursday -- a promise citizens here have heard before.

HEADLINE: This Family's Hot Stuff

BYLINE: By KRISTINA SHEVORY

DATELINE: AVERY ISLAND, La. 

 BODY:
In April, board members and shareholders of the McIlhenny Company plan to gather here for their annual meeting. Unlike well-publicized events at big public companies this year, where activist shareholders often hope to create a stir, a private gathering is planned, and the agenda will probably not be debated. The meeting promises to be what it always is: one part business and one part family reunion.
 Food is on the menu, and plenty of it: Cajun specialties, like boudin, corn-and-crab bisque and crawfish pie. There will be sweet tea, soda pop and bloody marys. And on every table, there will probably be all six flavors of Tabasco sauce. But for the McIlhennys, this is no idle condiment to spice up bland food. This is business.
The McIlhenny Company, the maker of Tabasco, is one of the country's biggest hot sauce makers. Its fiery condiment has become so popular that its name is a generic term for hot sauce. Less known is that the family has weathered storms, both personal and economic, to keep the business going since its founding more than 130 years ago. 
 Now in its fifth generation as a family-run business, the McIlhenny Company is operated by an eight-member board that is largely part of the extended family. All of the 145 shareholders either inherited their stock or were given it from another living family member.
 But in practice, only two to four family members typically run the company because it is so big and the family does not want it to become insular and resistant to change. They make sure decisions are transparent and issue financial statements every quarter to their shareholders.
 "They have a good process for how they make decisions," said Ann M. Dugan, executive director of the Institute for Entrepreneurial Excellence at the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business at the University of Pittsburgh. "They've taken the emotionality out of it. Once you get into the third and fourth generations, you're looking at cousins with different experiences and family. It's easier to become factionalized."
 Even so, emotions ran high when the family faced its biggest crisis in recent memory. That occurred in the midst of the devastating storms in 2005, but not from Hurricane Katrina, which wreaked havoc on nearby New Orleans, but from the storm that followed.
 The McIlhenny family knew Hurricane Rita would bring high winds and rain to southern Louisiana. They had heeded an evacuation order and had a volunteer crew of workers in case something went wrong. They assumed Avery Island, one of the highest points along the coast and home to their Tabasco sauce, would be fine.
 They were wrong.
 The day Rita made landfall, a guard called at 8 a.m. and said water was rising quickly. Everyone on the island raced over to the low-lying factory to see what they could do. The sight gave them pause.
 Water was starting to cover the main road leading to the factory and was gaining ground quickly. Employees jumped on forklifts to move some of the barrels of hot sauce onto pallets to give them a few inches off the ground. Others ferried computers to the main office up the hill. The low-lying pepper fields were underwater and white caps dotted the surface. Two hours later, the water was four inches from the factory floor.
 And then it stopped. At 9 feet 8 inches, it was nearly double the highest flood level anyone could remember.
 While the factory was saved by mere inches, the family lost some of its pepper plants, a gatehouse and six days of bottling to the storm.
 "When you live on the highest point in the area, you just don't think flooding is going to be an issue," said Harold G. Osborn, a cousin and vice president of agriculture.
 The family was left with a tough choice to make.
 It had planned to build a museum and culinary center in New Orleans, where many family members live and where Tabasco was first sold. After Katrina hit on Aug. 29, the company lost the contractor for that project.
 In early January 2006, they were trying to get new bids on construction. But costs had risen so much that they decided not to proceed. "We hate it," Tony Simmons, executive vice president and a family member whose business card is a miniature Tabasco bottle, said of the decision.
 Instead, the family plans to spend $5 million on something far more urgent: a 17-foot levee on Avery Island and a back-up generator. Construction should begin by April and be ready in time for the 2008 hurricane season.
 "Never say never, but we don't think we can get a storm surge past that," Mr. Simmons said.
 Since it started making hot sauce in 1868, the McIlhenny Company has faced various crises, both personal and economic, to keep the business going. First there was the challenge of starting a self-named company after the Civil War, then building Tabasco into a recognized brand and finally maintaining its popularity despite am abundance of competitors.
 The McIlhenny Company is now one of the country's biggest hot sauce makers and turns out as many as 720,000 two-ounce bottles every day. Its slender glass bottles are found in soldiers' rations, restaurant tables across the country and in 161 countries, according to the company.
 "What makes Tabasco as a brand great is that the family continues to deliver," said David Martin, president of United States operations for Interbrand, branding consultants in New York. "It always tastes the same, has the right degree of spice and flavor. You can always count on it."
 Consumers must agree. Around 62 percent of Americans had hot sauce in their pantry in 2005, according to the most recent data available from the NPD Group, a research and consulting firm in Port Washington, N.Y., versus 57 percent in 1999.
 To stay ahead of its competitors and expand valuable supermarket space, the company has been rolling out new pepper sauces with jalapenos, habaneros and chipotles one of their best sellers over the last 13 years. They recently released a new sweet-and-spicy sauce in seven markets.
 Paul McIlhenny, the company's chief executive, has entered into licensing deals to add Tabasco to Spam, steak sauce and mayonnaise and ramped up the business with the food service industry, which now counts for more than half of sales.
 "What impresses us the most is that they keep bringing out new sauces," said Gretchen VanEsselstyn, editor in chief of Chile Pepper magazine in New York. "They're really trying hard to be more than a one-trick pony."
 For all the variation, the family has stuck to the same basic recipe peppers, salt and vinegar and production techniques since its beginning. After the Civil War, Edmund McIlhenny experimented with growing peppers on Avery Island as a way to spice up his food, said Shane K. Bernard, the company's historian and curator. They still follow Edmund's growing instructions and use seeds from the original plants.
 Most of the peppers are now grown in Latin America they ran out of room here in 1965 and started experimenting with plants in Mexico but all the seeds are still grown on the island. While different climates and soils affect a pepper's heat level and flavor, the McIlhenny Company blends them in the final product so the taste remains familiar.
 When the peppers are harvested, they are shipped back to Avery Island where they are ground into mash. Salt is added and the mixture is put into old whiskey barrels from distilleries like Jack Daniels and Jim Beam to age for up to three years. (The bright red mash is so corrosive that forklifts last only six years.) After three years, a family member samples the mash and, if approved, it is mixed with vinegar and stirred for one month. The seeds and skins are then removed and the sauce bottled.
 The family has not tweaked Tabasco to shave expenses or lower prices because they make money from more than just the sauce. On Avery Island, a 2,200-acre salt dome west of New Orleans, they mine rock salt, pump oil and natural gas and operate Jungle Gardens, a botanical garden. They also reuse everything, from selling their used oak barrels to selling the seed mash to a company for use in candies.
 "The family has the good fortune to have an island made of oil and salt, with constant revenues, and has not had to follow the fortunes of family businesses that depend on one product," Richard Schweid, the author of "Hot Peppers: The Story of Cajuns and Capsicum," wrote in an e-mail message. "This has meant they could reject alternative practices with Tabasco sauce that would mean less quality and more savings."
 Avery Island has also helped keep the family together because it is more than just a place where Tabasco is made. It is also home. Many family members grew up working summers on the island, from picking peppers to operating the company's general store. Many still spend their weekends here. Before they joined the company, Mr. Osborn was a civilian military contractor and Mr. Simmons was a construction crane supplier.
 They have ideal commutes: both live on the island. Half of their 200 full-time employees do, too. The company has 40 part-time workers. Around 80 clapboard homes for employees dot the island, a holdover from the days when most people didn't own cars and traveling to remote Avery Island was difficult. (The family leases the homes to workers.) Many of the employees' parents and grandparents worked on the island and many still send their children to the island's elementary school.
 "Everyone here could leave and work in the oil industry and make twice the money, but why?" said Kip White, 28, a third-generation employee. "We have a good time, and we're like family here."
 And it is likely to stay that way. Every once in a while, the family is approached to see if the company is for sale, but the offers have never been serious enough to bring to shareholders for a vote.
 "As long as we can grow the business profitably and with dividends," Paul McIlhenny said, "then the family will be happy."

HEADLINE: Shares Rise Despite Concerns About Iran

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks ended higher in volatile trading yesterday as investors weighed fears about mounting tension involving Iran against a report that indicated better-than-expected economic growth.
 The major indexes bounced around as crude prices surged to a six-month high. Investors remain nervous about the West's response to British sailors held captive in Iran, and oil prices crossed the $66 mark.
This offset the Commerce Department's final measure of fourth-quarter gross domestic product, which showed growth of 2.5 percent, a rate that could help quell concerns that the economy was slowing too quickly. But strong economic growth could also make it harder for the inflation-wary Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates. 
 Investors also bought and sold stocks to window-dress their portfolios ahead of tomorrow's end of the first quarter. The modest advance snapped a three-day losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average.
 ''The market is at a pivotal point,'' said Scott Fullman, director of investment strategy for Israel A. Englander & Company. ''The market has become more volatile and more sensitive to news items.''
 The Dow finished up 48.39, at 12,348.75, after climbing as high as 12,381.91 in the morning session.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.30, to 1,422.53, and the Nasdaq composite index edged up 0.78, to 2,417.88.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.54, to 798.94.
 Oil prices settled at their highest level since mid-September amid political tensions in the Middle East. Light crude rose $1.95, to settle at $66.03 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after rising as high as $66.50.
 Earlier in the session, the Labor Department released a report that showed a decline last week in the number of newly laid-off workers applying for unemployment benefits. This suggests the job market is still in good shape even as the economy goes through a sluggish spell.
 In corporate news, United States Steel announced it would acquire Lone Star Technologies for $2.1 billion, which represents a 39 percent premium over Lone Star's closing price on Tuesday. United States Steel rose $3.61, to $101.22, while Lone Star surged $17.66, to $66.11.
 RF Micro Devices, which makes radio frequency components, warned that weaker demand from a major customer would hurt its first-quarter results. Shares fell 76 cents, to $6.31.
 Multi-Fineline Electronix, a maker of circuit boards, said its second-quarter sales and profit could decline from the first quarter. The stock fell $1.95, to $15.55.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 6/32, to 99 27/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.64 percent, from 4.62 percent.UBS Cuts Floor Trading Staff By Reuters
 The Swiss bank UBS said yesterday that it would cut 23 of its 30 floor positions at the New York Stock Exchange.
 The company notified 23 employees who process and execute trades that they would be dismissed or reassigned. 
 As electronic systems take over transactions, Wall Street firms are shedding employees who carry out trades on the Big Board.
 ''As the use of electronic platforms on the N.Y.S.E. has increased, we have made the difficult decision to restructure our N.Y.S.E. floor operations and to reduce our staff presence to bring our personnel in line with current needs,'' UBS said.

HEADLINE: A Budget Deal Is Announced, Minus Details

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and DANNY HAKIM; Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 29 

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer and legislative leaders agreed behind closed doors to double the number of charter schools in the state to 200 and create a fund of more than a half-billion dollars for stem cell research, officials said late Thursday night. 
 In what many Albany watchers regarded as a vintage performance in a Capitol long known for secrecy, the governor held a news conference to reveal that he would not reveal the details of the private budget agreement he worked out during marathon negotiations with the legislative leaders. But he did say that he was now confident of passing a budget before the state's April 1 deadline. 
To protect the notion that the budget would be negotiated in public conference committees, rank-and-file members were told the parameters of the deal Thursday night and then went through the motions of hashing out the budget in a series of abbreviated public conference committees. 
 ''We would like to see a process that had much greater public opportunity for observation of how this was done,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''Rome was not built in a day.''
 By late evening, a few new policy details had become clear. 
 State officials dropped plans to close all but two corporate tax loopholes, one that would force some national and international companies to file tax returns that cover more of their far-flung operations and another involving the taxation of property holding companies known as real estate investment trusts. To offset that, the governor agreed to reduce the base tax rate for companies to 7 percent from 7.5 percent. 
 ''The message of the reduction in the overall corporate tax rate is very positive because it benefits every company, large and small,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a consortium of major employers. 
 Details on some of the most substantive questions were not disclosed. The governor's $120.6 billion budget will rise to at least $121.8 billion, increasing spending far above the inflation rate. Homeowners will get $1.3 billion in property tax rebates this year, double the amount distributed last year. But the sides have been haggling over how much of the money to give to wealthier New Yorkers, and did not disclose what they had decided. 
 The sides have also not released details of how $500 million in additional education aid over the governor's original budget will be doled out. On charter schools, up to 50 were approved for New York City. 
 There was no agreement on pay raises for judges and lawmakers. And a proposal by the governor to expand nickel bottle deposits to bottled water, tea and sports drinks was rejected.
 Negotiations proved even more inscrutable than in recent years. At about 11 a.m., the governor, the lieutenant governor and the four legislative leaders began a private meeting in the governor's offices on the second floor of the Capitol; they did not emerge until after 5 p.m. 
 Beyond saying the bottle bill had been rejected, the governor would not reveal what had been decided. A New York Post reporter asked him, ''With all due respect, what is the point of this press conference, then?'' 
 ''To tell you, well, first of all, you've been hanging out here for quite a while, these guys didn't think they could sneak out the back door without being caught,'' the governor said, referring to the lawmakers standing with him. ''But the point of this press conference is to explain to you what we've been doing all day.''
 ''But you haven't,'' the reporter said. 
 ''Sure we have,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''We have told you we have reached consensus on critical and tough issues.''
 Barbara Bartoletti, legislative director of the League of Women Voters of New York State, said afterward that she and other members of good-government groups had not been permitted to attend the news conference, the first time since Mr. Spitzer took office that she had been barred from such an event.
 ''A bad process often makes for a bad work product,'' she said. ''We had high expectations, and we obviously don't think this process has met the expectations that the governor, as well as we, had.''

HEADLINE: New Jersey Commerce Secretary, a 9/11 Widow, Is Picked for the Port Authority Board

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 29 

 BODY:
New Jersey's commerce secretary and the widow of a 9/11 victim was appointed Thursday by Gov. Jon S. Corzine to a seat on the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the World Trade Center site. 
 The official, Virginia S. Bauer, has been in charge of the state's Commerce, Economic Growth and Tourism Commission since 2004 and before that was the director of the New Jersey Lottery Commission. Ms. Bauer will fill one of the six seats held by New Jersey appointees on the 12-member unpaid board of commissioners. Six seats are held by New York appointees. Ms. Bauer's nomination has to be reviewed by the State Senate, and she is expected to have little problem winning its approval.
 She will replace Jack G. Sinagra, a former central New Jersey state senator who was appointed to a six-year term by Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco in 2001.
 Ms. Bauer's husband, David, was killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center, where he worked as head of global sales for Cantor Fitzgerald's electronic trading unit. She became a familiar face in the news media and among victims' relatives who were lobbying Congress and the White House for tax breaks and other benefits for the families.
 Ms. Bauer, of Red Bank, said in an interview on Thursday that she thought her 9/11-related activities, coupled with her work as an advocate for state businesses as commerce secretary, helped make her the logical choice for the post.
 ''It was certainly more than my 9/11 connection,'' she said. ''I think it was my successes at the Lottery Commission and as commerce secretary where I have been an ambassador for the state and dealing with so many nuances concerning business in the state.''
 In announcing the nomination, Governor Corzine echoed this view and said, ''Ginny Bauer's integrity, business savvy, commitment to excellence and advocacy for the families of 9/11 victims make her the perfect choice.''
 Ms. Bauer would become the second spouse of a 9/11 victim to be appointed to the Port Authority board. Christine A. Ferer, the widow of Neil D. Levin, the executive director of the Port Authority, who was also killed in the attack, was appointed to the board by Gov. George E. Pataki of New York in 2004.
 The authority operates the region's airports and ports as well as the Hudson River bridge and tunnel crossings. It also overseas hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to New Jersey and New York for transportation and economic development projects. One of the agency's priorities is to contribute $1 billion to a proposed plan to build a $6 billion passenger rail tunnel under the Hudson River.
 Ms. Bauer said that she did not yet want to choose the priorities that she would stress as a board member, but that her role as commerce secretary had emphasized to her how important the airports, tunnels and bridges are to the region and to the Eastern Seaboard.

PERSON: Martine G. Guerrier

HEADLINE: A Player Switches Sides in the Interest of Education

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
Not that Martine G. Guerrier, a self-possessed, child-obsessed education policy expert, is much of a blusher. But at first blush the arrangement recently struck between Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, the Department of Education and Ms. Guerrier, formerly a most outspoken appointee to the city's Panel for Educational Policy as well as its first Haitian-American soccer mom, sounds like an exercise in keeping friends close and enemies closer. For all three parties, finally, unanimity! Or maybe not.
 ''At first it felt like a huge conspiracy to get me off the PEP, but I would never have come to work here if I thought it meant I was joining the axis of evil,'' says Ms. Guerrier, the new chief family engagement officer for the Department of Education, which has had a fraught relationship with parents since City Hall took over the public schools in 2002. Ms. Guerrier was educated in the public system (Townsend Harris High School at Queens College) and it now serves her son, Domenic, a fifth grader. But for decades, she says, the system, which is responsible for 1.4 million children, has lacked parental input at the policy-making level. She hopes to fix that by wearing her parent hat. 
''My job is to ensure that parents have access to timely and useful information in order to make good decisions for their kids in the city schools, and do it in a collaborative way, but I'm not having a lobotomy,'' Ms. Guerrier asserts. She pointedly refused to resign from the policy panel (the city's board of education) until the negotiations regarding her new job were cemented. A little suspicious of the sudden welcome mat? Sure, but she's gotten beyond it. 
 ''No one here has asked me not to be myself,'' she says. ''No one has asked me to buy into any agenda. If you're an authentic person, you don't change who you are just because of where you stand.'' Or sit.
 For this conversation, she deliberately selects a seat with a Brooklyn Bridge view (''My beautiful borough!'' she calls it, despite growing up in Corona, Queens) in the same ornate second-floor conference room at department headquarters in the Tweed Courthouse where, as an appointee of the Brooklyn borough president, she routinely livened up Panel for Educational Policy meetings. 
 Ms. Guerrier, 36, is practiced in the craft of contrarianism. Ask her to show you her desk in Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein's inner sanctum upstairs, or to provide her husband's surname, or amplify the desolation she felt when her mother, a nurse, died while she was in high school and her father, an accountant-turned-artist, left her to be raised by an aunt, and she just says: ''No.'' Nicely but definitively. She does disclose that along with a photograph of her son in his soccer regalia, her desk holds a red-and-gold gong, ''a noisemaker for a noisemaker,'' she jokes -- sort of. 
 Hers was the voice that disparaged City Hall's ambitious plan to demolish social promotion of third graders when it was unfurled in 2004. And she was the one who persistently harped on (her words) the school budget allocation as harmful to schools in need of extra money for programs devised for at-risk students. 
 So Ms. Guerrier inspired skepticism -- and received some poison-pen mail accusing her of selling out to the political establishment -- this month when she accepted a $150,000 offer from Mr. Klein to join his marble bullpen in a cubicle within shouting distance of him. But nobody shouts in the bullpen. 
 ''It is an intense, mission-driven place,'' she says, plucking at the vintage subway tokens on her novelty charm bracelet (tokens remind her, she says, of good times, like the first day of school, new pencils and the 64-pack of Crayolas starring her favorite color, gold). ''I believe everyone agrees on the outcome of our mission: a quality education for every child. How to get there is a source of public debate and conflict, and a reason I'm here.'' 
 Ms. Guerrier lives in Brooklyn with her husband, 10-year-old son, and a rescued and rehabilitated Schnauzer. Because the job seemed tailor-made for her, Ms. Guerrier, who served on a district school board from 1999 to 2002, felt it would be a mistake not to attempt a temporary detente with Mr. Klein and Mayor Bloomberg, who apparently championed the hire. So she said yes to working on ''the other side.''
 ''It was the first time where I felt like everything I'd worked on as a PEP member had shown its value,'' she explains.
 If this is a ruse by the mayor to preserve his legacy and avoid a parental ambush when mayoral control of the system is up for legislative renewal in 2009, Ms. Guerrier, who graduated from Wells College with a degree in social economic policy, is undeterred. 
 ''Mayors have always meddled in education,'' she says with a sharp nod that nearly dislodges her eyeglasses from their perch in her hair. ''Their control comes with the budget. Mayor Bloomberg clearly has a vision about reform and is more involved than most. The jury is still out whether all this control is good or bad.''
 She adds: ''I can't be concerned with big-picture politics. My focus has to be on doing what's right for the kids. My job is not to sell an opinion; my ideas will always be influenced by the concerns of parents, not politicians or bureaucrats, and anyone who thinks otherwise will be sadly mistaken.''
 All that, and she coaches soccer, too, for Brooklyn's American Youth Soccer Organization, in which nobody keeps score and every kid's a winner.

HEADLINE: City to Reward Poor for Doing Right Thing

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL; Elisabeth Malkin contributed reporting from Mexico City.

 BODY:
Seeking new solutions to New York's vexingly high poverty rates, the city is moving ahead with an ambitious experiment that will pay poor families up to $5,000 a year to meet goals like attending parent-teacher conferences, going for a medical checkup or holding down a full-time job, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday.
 Under the program, which is based on a similar effort in Mexico, parents would receive payments every two months for family members meeting any of a series of criteria. The payments could range from $25 for exemplary attendance in elementary school to $300 for a high score on an important exam, city officials said.
The officials said the program was the first of its kind in the country. 
 The project, first announced in the fall. was scheduled to begin as a pilot program in September with 2,500 randomly selected families whose progress will be tracked against another 2,500 randomly selected families who will not get the rewards. Officials planned to draw the families from six of the poorest communities in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx.
 To be eligible, families must have at least one child entering fourth, seventh or ninth grade and a household income of 130 percent or less of the federal poverty level, which equals roughly $20,000 for a single parent with two children.
 The city has already raised $42 million of the $50 million needed to cover the initial program's cost from private sources, including Mr. Bloomberg. If it proves successful, the mayor said, the city will attempt to create a permanent program financed by the government.
 Likening the payments, known as conditional cash transfers, to tax incentives that steer people of greater means toward property ownership, Mr. Bloomberg said that the approach was intended to help struggling families who often focus on basic daily survival make better long-term decisions and break generational cycles of poverty and dependence.
 ''In the private sector, financial incentives encourage actions that are good for the company: working harder, hitting sales targets or landing more clients,'' the mayor said in an announcement at a health services center in Brownsville, Brooklyn. 
 ''In the public sector, we believe that financial incentives will encourage actions that are good for the city and its families: higher attendance in schools, more parental involvement in education and better career skills.''
 Since Mr. Bloomberg outlined the plan last fall, reaction among antipoverty experts and advocates has been mixed, with some hailing it as an innovative approach that could become a powerful model for the rest of the country and ultimately win the support of the federal government. 
 Indeed, the program is being financed by several high-profile organizations, including the Rockefeller, Starr and Robin Hood Foundations, as well as the Open Society Institute and the insurance and financial firm American International Group. 
 The Rockefeller and Starr Foundations are donating $10 million each, while the Open Society Institute is giving $5 million and A.I.G. is donating $2 million. A spokeswoman for the Robin Hood Foundation did not return calls or an e-mail message, and Mr. Bloomberg's spokesman, Stu Loeser, declined to say how much the mayor contributed.
 Some antipoverty advocates have bristled at what they see as the condescending notion that poor people need to be told how to raise their families. Others have focused on the broader economic issues at play.
 ''It is encouraging that the mayor believes there's a public role for addressing intergenerational poverty, inequality and economic mobility,'' said Margy Waller, a former Clinton administration adviser who is a co-founder of Inclusion, a research and policy group based in Washington. 
 ''What is troubling is the focus on personal behavior as the solution to what is at least in part a problem of the economy,'' she said. ''Given what we know about the growth of low-wage jobs and the shrinking of the middle class, it will be, in fact, impossible to bring more people into the middle class unless we improve the labor market as well.''
 A similar concern seems to have emerged with Mexico's program, known as Oportunidades, which is now 10 years old, has a budget of more than $3 billion a year and covers nearly one-fourth of all Mexicans.
 Intended to replace the food subsidies that had dominated much of Mexico's antipoverty efforts, the program offers cash stipends to families to keep their children in school and take them for regular checkups. Parents must also attend regular talks on issues including health, nutrition and family planning. 
 Outside evaluations have found that the program has been successful in raising school attendance and nutrition levels and that the percentage of Mexicans living in extreme poverty has fallen.
 Still, there are questions about how much more effective the program can be in lifting large numbers of people permanently out of poverty, in part because jobs are lacking.
 In January, Santiago Levy, one of the program's creators and a former undersecretary of finance in Mexico, said at the Brookings Institution in Washington that even if the program were 100 percent effective, it alone could not solve the problem.
 ''Now's he's out with a high school degree, a healthy man: Is he going to get a job or migrate to the U.S.?'' he said.
 But others see cause for optimism in the results of Mexico's program and similar ones in other Latin American countries. In Nicaragua, for example, primary school enrollment rates grew to 90 percent from 68 percent; in Colombia, secondary school enrollment in urban areas rose to 78 percent from 64 percent, said Laura Rawlings, a World Bank specialist who has studied the programs, which she said are active or being created in nearly 20 countries. 
 The idea to try the program in New York has its roots in the broad attack on poverty that Mr. Bloomberg has made a high-profile cause for his second term. Roughly one in five New Yorkers lives in poverty, according to the Community Service Society of New York. 
 In keeping with the administration's emphasis on outcomes, city officials say they will closely monitor the test group's progress against that of the control group with the help of M.D.R.C., a nonprofit policy research organization involved in the program's design.
 All 5,000 families will be asked to agree to participate in the program before knowing which group they are in, said Gordon Berlin, the president of M.D.R.C., and those not receiving benefits will be paid a nominal fee to submit to monitoring and surveys, he said. 
 Officials expect that some of the control families will inevitably drop out, but Mr. Berlin said that in conducting similar experiments in the past, he had found that most were willing to participate even without the benefits because they were informed that it would help guide a government policy decision in which they had a stake.
 The families receiving the benefits will be given a list of goals they are expected to meet, as well as the values assigned to them. They will also get a ''passport'' for documenting the completion of tasks that are not automatically reported elsewhere, said Linda I. Gibbs, the deputy mayor overseeing the effort. 
 The city is working with state and federal officials, Ms. Gibbs said, to make sure that families do not lose other benefits because of the grants.

HEADLINE: House Budget Is Clear on Spending, Vague on Revenue

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29 

 BODY:
House Democrats passed a five-year spending plan Thursday that offers something to almost everybody but leaves many questions unanswered -- much like the plan passed last week by the Senate.
 The House plan, approved 216 to 210, envisions a balanced budget by 2012. It would provide an additional $50 billion over five years for medical care to low-income children, $7.9 billion more next year for education and social service programs and $3.5 billion more than President Bush has requested for veterans programs.
The plan would also reject Mr. Bush's proposal to reduce the projected spending on Medicare and Medicaid entitlement programs by more than $250 billion. 
 But both the House and Senate budgets implicitly require tax increases in the years ahead. Neither offers any guidance about where the needed extra revenue would come from.
 Almost all of Mr. Bush's tax cuts are now set to expire at the end of 2010. Democrats have said they want to extend most of them, but they have adopted tough ''pay-as-you-go'' requirements that will require Congress to pay for new spending and additional tax cuts with tax increases or savings in other areas. 
 ''After years of reckless budgets and skyrocketing debt, Democrats have brought fiscal sanity back to Washington,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. The plan, Mr. Emanuel said, ''funds the right priorities for our country and puts middle-class families first.''
 Republicans said the Democratic budget would lead to huge tax increases without doing anything to slow the explosive growth of entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
 ''No matter how they spin it, no matter how they dodge it, they will raise taxes,'' said Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, in debate on the House floor. ''Numbers don't lie. This budget, this Democratic budget, gives us the largest tax increase in American history.'' 
 Democrats easily defeated, by a vote of 268 to 160, a substitute proposal by Mr. Ryan that would have exempted tax cuts from the new budget rules and would have reduced projected spending on Medicare and Medicaid by $279 billion over the next five years. 
 The Democrats' plan would postpone most of the hard decisions on how to finance their priorities.
 Instead of instructing the tax-writing committees to raise taxes or cut spending, the plan includes a long list of ''reserve funds'' to pay for new programs. 
 The ''reserve funds'' are not actually funds, but rather expressions of commitments to use funds for particular purposes if more money becomes available.
 The list of reserve funds includes $50 billion over five years for doubling the Medicaid health care program for low-income children; $50 billion for a one-year freeze of the alternative minimum tax; $20 billion over five years for additional farm programs; and a less well-defined fund for middle-class tax cuts. 
 One immediate hurdle for Democrats is the proposed freeze on the alternative minimum tax. Originally created to catch millionaires who took too much advantage of tax breaks, the tax is about to affect 20 million households because it is not adjusted for inflation. 
 The one-year freeze alone will cost $50 billion, and the cost of a freeze would rise sharply with each additional year.
 The cost of extending Mr. Bush's tax cuts is even higher. As now written, the Democratic budget assumes a gusher of more than $400 billion in the two years after Mr. Bush's tax cuts are set to expire.
 Representative John M. Spratt, Democrat of South Carolina and chairman of the House Budget Committee, insisted that the plan would protect Mr. Bush's tax cuts at least through the end of 2010 and would ''leave until the future'' the decisions about what happens to them after that.
 Supporters of the Democratic plan said it was a step toward greater fiscal discipline. Mr. Bush and Republican lawmakers have opposed applying any ''pay as you go'' rules to tax cuts, and Mr. Bush's tax cuts have largely been financed with higher government borrowing.
 Indeed, total government spending has climbed far faster under Mr. Bush than it did under President Bill Clinton, while tax revenue has climbed far more slowly. All told, federal debt has grown by almost $4 trillion since Mr. Bush took office.
 Democrats scoffed at suggestions that they would roll back the Republican tax cuts for middle-class taxpayers.
 ''These Republicans have imaginary demons about what Democrats might do to their taxes,'' said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas and a leader of the Blue Dog Democrats, who consider themselves fiscal conservatives.
 ''We believe it is possible to target tax relief toward middle-income families,'' Mr. Doggett said. ''And second, we say that if tax relief is worth having, then we should pay for it.''

Activities / Procedures:
1. Warm-Up/Do Now: Have students view the slide show "Coming Attractions" (found online at http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/03/21/arts/attra.1.jpg). If the slide show can't be viewed, print out the images and display them on the classroom board. Explain to the class that each piece of art is taken from a current art exhibit. Using a show of hands, poll students on which exhibit they would most want to see. Why? Ask the class what other items they would expect to see at a show that includes this piece. What would students hope to learn or experience at this exhibit?
 2. As a class, read and discuss the article "What to See, Region by Region" (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070330friday.html) and focus on the following questions:
 a. Who is Edward Hopper?
 b. What characterizes the artwork of Francis Bacon?
 c. Do you think architecture is an important art form? Why?
 d. What is noteworthy about the "Ike Taiga and Tokuyama Gyokuran: Japanese Masters of the Brush"?

 3. Distribute copies of the Weekend Arts: Fine Arts/Leisure section of The Times. Allow students up to 20 minutes to scan the section for each of the following:
 -Find a quote from a critic that is complimentary about a work of art.
 -Find a quote from a critic that is unfavorable about a work of art.
 -What photo, drawing, painting or sculpture do you like best in the section? Why?
 -What photo, drawing, painting or sculpture do you like least? Why?
 -Write down the headline of the article that interests you the most from the section.
 -Find an example of an antique. Write down one fact related to what was happening in the world during the time this item was made. Your selection could be an event, name of a ruler, etc.
 -Name one advertiser in the section and speculate on why the decision was made to place an advertisement.
 -Can you think of another industry or company that might want to advertise in the section? Why?
 -Out of all the art shows described, which one would you most like to see? Why?
 -Find a book that you might want to read.
 -Find an example of something seasonal, like an outdoor performance or a photography exhibit featuring flowers in the spring or summer.
 -Make a list of the countries represented by the articles, photographs and reviews in the section.
 -Write down three interesting facts that you learned by looking at the section.
 After students have scanned and taken notes on the Weekend Arts: Fine Arts/Leisure section, divide students into small groups. Allow time for students to share their answers within their small groups. Discuss differences in opinions and encourage students to justify their choices.
 During the last five minutes of class, students should come together as a large group to discuss the Weekend Arts: Fine Arts/Leisure section as a whole. Consider questions like: What elements of the section surprised you? What do you think was missing from the section? How might you encourage your peers to look at the section? What can be learned by exploring this section of the newspaper, even if one cannot visit the exhibits, watch the movies, read the books, see the shows, etc.?
 Allow students to take home parts of the Weekend Arts: Fine Arts/Leisure section as a reference for their Wrap-Up/Homework assignments.
 4. Wrap-Up/Homework: Individually, students choose one of the exhibits from the article "What to See, Region by Region." Ask students to research their selected artists, types of work, etc. so they can create companion pieces for the blurbs that appeared in the article. Students may choose to create photo essays with introductions and captions, expository articles, feature articles that describe the history behind the art, etc. Students should use pieces from the Arts section to model their work. In a future class, students compile their photo essays, articles and features into an Arts section for a national newspaper. 
Further Questions for Discussion:
-What art exhibits have you seen?
 -What is the difference between viewing art live and looking at slides or prints?
 -How might a museum or gallery use its space to enhance sculptures, paintings, etc.?
 -In what activities can young people participate to engage them more fully when viewing art in a gallery or museum?
 -What impact does art have on your life?
 -How does art affect your community? 
Evaluation / Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on participation in the class polling activity, class and pair discussions, completion of the scavenger hunt and thoughtfully written companion pieces.
Vocabulary:
seminal, formative, integrated, commemorating, centennial, reigning, assemblages, punter, effete, caliphate, prominence, cathode
Extension Activities:
1. Visit a local art gallery. Who are the featured artists? Why do you think this gallery has selected their work? Why do you think their work is important? Write a review to submit for publication in your local newspaper.
2. Choose one of the exhibits from the article "What to See, Region by Region." Research the artist featured in it, as well as their body of work. Write an essay exploring the value of this exhibit. How important is this work? How does it help us to foster a deeper understanding of ourselves, our community and our culture?
3. Analyze the degree of access students in your school have to fine arts programming, including live performances, nonmainstream films, art exhibits, etc. Begin your research by looking at what libraries and historical societies offer. Then examine how many art galleries, film houses, performance theaters, concert halls, etc. exist in your community. Write a report examining your findings. Include a proposal on how to bring more art into the lives of students in your area.
4. Create a scrapbook with the works of art for one of the artists mentioned in the article. Write a brief introduction to the collection and a caption for each example you include. 
Interdisciplinary Connections:
American History- October has been designated National Arts and Humanities Month. Research the history behind this month-long celebration. When was it established? Why? Create a report based on your findings, including the various ways in which it is celebrated across the United States.
 American History/Global Studies- Choose one of the artists featured in the article "What to See, Region by Region." Create an illustrated poster highlighting who this artist is and why their work is important. Include examples of their work, as well as any interesting facts that will encourage students to become more interested in the arts.
 Fine Arts- For one of the art forms described in the article, create an original work of art. For example, Robert Rauschenberg's work is characterized by cardboard boxes. Write an artist's statement explaining your creation.
 Technology- Visit the National Gallery of Arts Kids page (http://www.nga.gov/kids/kids.htm) to make a collage, play a game of hide-and-seek and learn more about the gallery's collections.

HEADLINE: A Bridge No Longer So Humble, at $600 Million

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
The Willis Avenue Bridge is hardly the most recognizable or the most graceful of the city's many bridges, but it will soon gain a distinction as one of the most expensive.
 The city has long planned to replace the Willis Avenue Bridge, a 3,212-foot-long, 106-year-old structure spanning the Harlem River, with a new one, just to the south. But when officials at the Transportation Department opened the bids on March 8 they got a shock. The two bids submitted came in at $612 million and $637 million -- each $200 million or so greater than estimated.
Transportation Department engineers had projected a cost of $417 million. 
 Transportation Commissioner Iris Weinshall said that the city had no choice but to go ahead with the work. The existing structure, a swing bridge that opens to allow ships to pass, often requires costly maintenance because of its age. And the ramps are configured in a way that has made it a site of frequent accidents. 
 ''It's like having an old house and you have to keep on fixing the stuff versus having a new house,'' said Ms. Weinshall, who is stepping aside as transportation commissioner next month after six years on the job. She said that construction was likely to start around the end of the year and that the project would take five years to complete. 
 When it is done, Ms. Weinshall said, the Willis Avenue Bridge will be the most expensive bridge ever built by her department. 
 But the reconstruction of some bridges has cost more, and New York State and New Jersey spent more, when inflation is taken into account, for the George Washington Bridge, which was completed in 1931. The 6,016-foot-long Brooklyn Bridge, which was financed by what were then the separate cities of Brooklyn and New York, cost about $16 million to build. It was finished in 1883. In today's dollars, taking inflation into account, that would be about $300 million, according to the MeasuringWorth.com Web site. 
 Of course, were the city to build a new Brooklyn Bridge today, the price would reach into the billions. The city has spent more than $3 billion over the last two decades to rehabilitate the East River bridges and is in the midst of an $829 million project to reconstruct the Manhattan Bridge, according to information on the Transportation Department's Web site.
 The George Washington Bridge, built by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, cost $60 million, which works out to more than $800 million in today's dollars. 
 But no new bridge has begun its life with a budget approaching that of the Willis Avenue project, which also includes the cost of building ramps to the surrounding roadways, a part of which will be reimbursed by the state.
 The Willis Avenue Bridge had much more humble origins. It cost $1.6 million to build and was opened in 1901. Last year, as the city prepared to seek bids on the new project, it offered to sell the existing bridge for $1 to anyone who would take it away and preserve it at another site rather than having to turn it into scrap. But the logistics of removing the bridge were too complicated; there were no takers. 
 Kay Sarlin, a Transportation Department spokeswoman, said that about 5 percent of the contract amount, or about $30 million, represents the cost of demolishing the old bridge. She said the contractor would dispose of it, most likely by selling it as scrap steel. 
 The stone masonry that is part of the bridge's structure will be recycled in city parks, she said, and much of it will go to the new Brooklyn Bridge park that is planned along the East River in Brooklyn. 
 The Transportation Department is not the only public agency to be hit with unexpected cost increases in its major construction projects. 
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority recently began a review of its construction activity in search of ways to cut rapidly ballooning costs that have led it to cancel some large projects. 
 Ms. Weinshall said the price of steel has skyrocketed in the last two years and the cost of fuel has also soared. 
 And she pointed to the large number of major construction projects that are either going on or about to start in the region, including the World Trade Center, the Fulton Street Transit Center and the Second Avenue subway, as well as the many office buildings and apartment towers that have been going up.
 ''This is the strongest construction market in New York City in a long, long time,'' said Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress, an umbrella group that represents contractors, developers and unions. ''There's a lot of work out there and there's a lot of work to come and the pool of contractors is fairly limited and they just don't have the capacity to do all that work.''
 Chris Ward, managing director of the General Contractors Association, said that with plenty of work available today, contractors were often reluctant to do large projects for public agencies. The agencies can be slow to pay, he said, and often place the risk of delays and engineering problems on the contractor's shoulders. 
 That the two bids on the Willis Avenue project were so close to each other, he said, shows that they were a more accurate reflection of the construction market than the estimate made by the city.
 Another consequence of the glut of projects is that fewer companies bid on each job.

HEADLINE: Where Millions Entered U.S., a Debate on Letting in More

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
It was the perfect setting for a Congressional hearing on immigration, all the speakers agreed -- the Great Hall on Ellis Island, where from 1892 to 1953 more than 12 million immigrants waited to be let in to America. 
 But the meaning that could be drawn from the backdrop was a matter of disagreement yesterday as the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration heard testimony from scholars and immigration officials. 
Some, like David V. Aguilar, chief of the Border Patrol at the Department of Homeland Security, contrasted the orderly inspection at Ellis Island a century ago with the chaos of illegal immigration at the Mexican border today.
 ''The vast majority of that clutter, that chaos at our Southern border, are seeking economic employment,'' Mr. Aguilar said. Sending more of them into a legal flow, like a temporary guest worker program, would let the Border Patrol concentrate on stopping criminals, he testified.
 Others noted that only 2 percent of would-be immigrants were turned away at Ellis Island. The requirements were minimal compared with those of today, said Representative Linda Sanchez, a Democrat from California: reasonably good health and $10, or the equivalent of $216 in today's dollars, to show that one would not become a public burden.
 ''I am the youngest daughter of immigrants who came to this country with very little money,'' she said. ''They sent every one of my six brothers and sisters to college.'' 
 Zoe Lofgren, the California Democrat who chairs the subcommittee, evoked her immigrant grandfather, Carl Robert Lofgren, who debarked in Boston at 16 a century ago without money and speaking no English, ''armed only with his dreams, his work ethic, his optimism and visions of America forged from reading Westerns written in Swedish.''
 ''This room is a visible vestige of a controlled, orderly and fair immigration system,'' she said.
 Like four other members of the subcommittee, the lone Republican, Steve King of Iowa, spoke of an immigrant forebear -- a grandmother, who arrived at Ellis Island from Kiel, Germany, on March 26, 1894, as a 4-year-old. But he went on to caution, ''The realities today are not the same.'' 
 With a nod to the New York skyline, which could be seen through the arched windows of the hall, sparkling across the bay, he mentioned the attacks of the World Trade Center and warned, ''Criminal aliens are coming to the U.S. in record numbers.''
 But the testimony of several scholars painted a more optimistic outlook -- and a less golden picture of Ellis Island's past. 
 Dan Siciliano, who teaches corporate governance at Stanford Law School, cited recent research showing that the record immigration between 1990 and 2004 had helped to increase wages in the United States, contradicting older research that predicted the opposite would occur. He said that immigration-- including illegal immigration --increased the wages of the native-born by an average of 1.8 percent, and by as much as 3.4 percent among 9 out of 10 native-born workers with at least a high school education. 
 Mr. Siciliano, a research fellow at the Immigration Policy Center, an organization affiliated with groups that support liberalized immigration, said the older studies failed to recognize that immigrants create jobs as well as fill them. 
 With enough immigrant waiters to staff a restaurant for lunch as well as dinner, for example, he said, the owner will make more on his capital investment -- and perhaps open a second restaurant across town.
 ''There's a divide between what we say we want from immigration and what the economy is telling us we need,'' he said.
 Immigrants at all skill levels will be needed more than ever over the next 20 years, said Dowell Myers, a demographer from the University of Southern California, to offset the aging of the baby boom generation and the decline in the nation's birth rates. 
 From the other side, Jack Martin, a director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said no study showed that the United States was harmed from 1914 to 1965, when immigration was reduced to a trickle. And he suggested tradeoffs might be necessary, noting that a new White House plan considers denying citizens the right to sponsor foreign brothers and sisters, in exchange for more employee visas. ''The country changes, and the needs of the country change,'' he said. 
 Some things do not change, however, said Daniel J. Tichenor, who teaches history and political science at Rutgers University. 
 ''Each wave of 'new' immigrants has been scored by critics as incapable of successfully joining our ranks, only later to distinguish themselves among our most loyal and accomplished citizens,'' he said. And American history has been marked by waves of xenophobia that ebbed as the new immigrants gained the power of the ballot box. 
 He cited Benjamin Franklin's complaint that German immigrants in Pennsylvania had made his home ''a Colony of Aliens, who will shortly be so numerous as to Germanize us instead of our Anglifying them.''
 In response, Representative King suggested that if the number of immigrants of one group grew too large, Franklin's fear of his culture being overwhelmed was legitimate. 
 ''The Germans did help Germanize the United States,'' Professor Tichenor replied. ''There was a blending.''
 Mr. King persisted. ''Is there a missing component in American culture?'' he asked.
 As Mr. Tichenor thought about his answer, tourists of all complexions gawked from the sidelines, and an audience of immigrant activists let their T-shirts do the talking -- ''Legalize the Irish'' and ''I Love Immigrant N.Y.'' They sat on the same benches where years ago anxious immigrants waited to be called for inspection.
 ''We've always been a nation becoming,'' Professor Tichenor said. ''We've always added layers.''

HEADLINE: Let's Put on an Automat! Cue Cops and Cheesecake

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
Diamonds may be forever, but a big bucket of rhinestones can spread a lot of glitter if you know what to do with 'em. The 1932 show ''Face the Music,'' with a sunny score by Irving Berlin and a gag-ridden circus of a book by Moss Hart, certainly isn't an enduring masterwork of the American musical theater. A full Broadway revival has never been attempted. But as the zippy Encores! concert staging of this forgotten bauble amply demonstrates, it must have shown audiences a fine time during the dark days of the Depression. And it is still quite capable of lifting the heart and setting the belly laughing with some regularity. 
 Directed by John Rando and choreographed by Randy Skinner, this flossy production doesn't boast the glamorous cast that made the first entry in this year's Encores! series, Stephen Sondheim and James Goldman's ''Follies,'' a see-it-or-commit-seppuku event for lovers of musical theater. Judy Kaye, Lee Wilkof and Walter Bobbie -- the latter now better known to theatergoers as a director -- are leading the charge, with the relative unknowns Jeffry Denman and Meredith Patterson playing the romantic leads. Supported by a cast of well-drilled dancers and choristers, they bring enough style to make up for any perceived lack of stardust.
Although ''Face the Music'' was originally conceived by Hart and ultimately billed as a ''musical comedy revue,'' it actually acquired a real book that turns on a zany variation of the durable let's-put-on-a-show theme. Times are tough in Manhattan after the crash. So tough that the Astors and the Whitneys are hanging out at the Automat, along with out-of-work actors and a destitute producer named Hal Reisman (Mr. Bobbie).
 ''Are you doing any casting?'' the unemployed ingenue Kit Baker (Ms. Patterson) asks Reisman. Cracks he: ''If this keeps up, I'm casting my body into the river.''
 It seems suckers -- er, backers -- are thin on the ground. Enter Myrtle Meshbesher, played by the droll Ms. Kaye, paying tribute to the addled pomposity that Margaret Dumont would trademark in the Marx Brothers' movies. (Mary Boland was the much-feted original in the role.)
 Mrs. Meshbesher is dripping diamonds -- or, rather, dropping them. (''Oh, keep it,'' she says. ''I was through with it anyway.'') And she's married to a guy who always wanted to be in showbiz. ''The first time I saw him he was a fairy in the Christmas pantomime,'' Mrs. M. warmly recalls, one of Hart's many throwaway lines that still raise a smile, often for reasons you couldn't explain if you tried.
 Turns out Martin van Buren Meshbesher (the choicely idiomatic Mr. Wilkof) is a police chief and has a little problem: too much money stashed away in little tin boxes. Money that needs to be lost, quick, as a corruption investigation is on the boil. What better way to shed a few thou than throw them the way of Broadway? 
 That may sound a mite familiar. Yes, it's the same basic concept that would serve Mel Brooks rather well a few decades later. Here it sets rolling a boisterous tale of backstage and onstage doings that keeps churning out silly bits of comic business for a brisk two hours of genial entertainment.
 How silly? Ever seen a chorus girl take a pratfall in a crinoline? You will here. A rehearsal for the extravagant beauty parade in ''Rhinestones of 1932,'' as the bomb-to-be is called, finds the baritonal eminence squirming his way through a Ziegfeldian ode to the bejeweled goddess in every girl. Seems the poor guy has rhinestones jabbing him in all the wrong places. Cheesy, yes, but as mugged by Chris Hoch as the stone-stuck Rodney St. Clair, the gag still goes. 
 David Ives, now a dab hand at skimming the cream in his adaptations of old shows' often fusty books, has kept the prime stuff here. The show was tartly topical when it was fresh: there really was a headline-making scandal about money stuffed away in those boxes, and it resulted in the resignation of Mayor Jimmy Walker. But cops merrily on the take and showbiz folk scheming scams, or scamming schemes, are subjects that haven't grown whiskers yet.
 Still, the jokes in ''Face the Music'' would be withering into dust in an archive somewhere if it were not for the Berlin score they stitch together. Once upon a time Encores! was all about rediscovering and restoring unheralded scores, and a return to this worthy purpose reveals a minor delight here. Probably only a couple of the songs will be familiar; you might know the gently swinging picker-upper ''Let's Have Another Cup of Coffee,'' or the lilting romancer ''Soft Lights and Sweet Music.'' But all of them demonstrate the crisp expertise of Berlin's lyric-making and his easy mastery of popular music forms. 
 Comedy is paramount. Besides the opening number that finds the swells putting dimes in Automat slots, there's a funny march for the downtrodden about downsizing the patriotic urge: ''We'll just have two cheers instead of three/For the land of the brave and the free!'' 
 Hard luck keeps dogging the characters' heels, but music keeps lifting their spirits back up. A shrug, a wisecrack in verse and a few merry bars, and the sun has come out again. Even a torch song is played for big laughs, by Felicia Finley as a streetwalker who fell into the gutter just so she could sing about it. 
 Ms. Patterson and Mr. Denman have most of the vocal chores, and their light lyric voices blend beautifully on those two enduring tunes I mentioned above, as well as another throwaway charmer about bucking up and plugging on, lovably titled ''I Say It's Spinach (And the Hell With It).'' (The title was derived from a well-known New Yorker cartoon from 1928 in which a mother tries without success to convince her daughter that the vegetable on her plate is broccoli.)
 Neither performer radiates personality (not much is required in these stock roles), but they share a nice rapport on the dance floor. Mr. Skinner has but a strip of stage and a few risers to work with, but he does a more than creditable job of transforming this modest real estate into that enchanted land where Fred and Ginger once floated on air.
 His tap numbers brashly aim for the extravagance of old, too. The best is winningly led by Eddie Korbich and Mylinda Hull, playing a dance team of mismatched dimensions and mismatched intentions. The adorably gangly Ms. Hull lobs her wisecracks a foot over Mr. Korbich's head and grouses in song: ''I Don't Wanna Be Married (I Just Wanna Be Friends).''
 A last, affectionate word for Mr. Bobbie, whose career took off in another direction when his staging of ''Chicago'' for the Encores! series became a Broadway smash. As the harried Hal Reisman, plagued by the idiotic affections of his dilettante backer and chorus girls making time with cops when they should be drilling their numbers, he breathes fresh comic life into even some of the hoariest routines. Like this one: ''How did you like the undersea ballet, Jerry?'' ''I thought it was terrible, Mr. Reisman.'' ''Who asked you?''
 Was that ever fresh? Maybe not, but it's so old I laughed anyway. As I did at another bit that Mr. Bobbie played with prime flavor. Hiding out in the countryside -- long story -- Reisman waxes rhapsodic over a cow. ''You've got to see one to believe it!'' he says, as if he'd just hit upon a sure showstopper. As a bit it's just rhinestones, but I never cared much for diamonds anyway.Face the MusicMusic and lyrics by Irving Berlin; book by Moss Hart; directed by John Rando; music director,Rob Fisher; choreography by Randy Skinner; sound by Scott Lehrer; lighting by Clifton Taylor; original orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett, Maurice De Packh and Frank Tours; music coordinator, Seymour Red Press; company manager, Michael Zande; production stage manager, Rolt Smith; concert adaptation by David Ives.

HEADLINE: First Off-Track Betting Parlor Opens (in Style) in New Jersey

BYLINE: By BILL FINLEY

DATELINE: VINELAND, N.J., March 30 

 BODY:
One thing is certain: It's not your traditional off-track betting parlor. Whether it will pay off is something else.
 By early afternoon on Friday, about 200 patrons had converged on a former car showroom, now known as Favorites of Vineland, to usher in a new era for horse-racing aficionados: the opening of the state's first parlor for off-track betting, also known as OTB.
''I like this place,'' said Les Ewen, 80, a veteran horseplayer from nearby Millville. ''I used to have to drive all the way to the casinos in Atlantic City to bet the horses, and that's 25 miles away. I can get here in 10 minutes, and it's a very nice place.'' 
 The New Jersey racing industry is hoping that there are many more racing fans just like Mr. Ewen who will increase their betting activity as 15 parlors open across the state in the coming years.
 Instead of operating from a forbidding storefront with few amenities, like the off-track betting sites in New York State, the parlor has 250 televisions and a large oval bar where customers can simultaneously watch races around the country and other sporting events. The 13,500-square-foot site was renovated at a cost of $4 million. 
 ''A central piece of what we were trying to do here with the heavy influx of sports and the big, big bar area is to encourage the younger clientele to come in on weekends,'' said Hal Handel, chief executive of Greenwood Racing Inc., which owns Favorites of Vineland located in this rural South Jersey town. ''We want the guy who has his baseball hat on backwards, wants a beer, wants to watch a ballgame and will bet on a couple of races. We want this to be a very comfortable place for that sort of person.'' 
 Mr. Handel said the operation would be open seven days a week and should bring in about $400,000 a week in bets. And should Mr. Handel's prediction be accurate, the parlor here will contribute about $1 million a year to purses at the state's four racetracks -- Freehold Raceway, Atlantic City Race Course, Monmouth Park and the Meadowlands.
 The next parlor is scheduled to open in Woodbridge Township this summer and another one is to open in Toms River in the fall, according to Mr. Handel. The state has declared Monmouth County, Freehold Township and Atlantic City off limits to the OTB parlors.
 The 15 licenses have been divided among the three companies that operate tracks in the state -- Greenwood, which owns Atlantic City Race Course and has licenses to operate two parlors; Pennwood Racing Inc., which owns Freehold and will control four; and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which operates Monmouth and the Meadowlands and will eventually run nine of the off-track wagering locations. 
 ''If these things are spread judiciously around the state, you're really going to ease proximity issues for people,'' Mr. Handel said. 
 Legislation legalizing the parlors was signed in the summer of 2001 by Acting Gov. Donald T. DeFrancesco, and in the fall of 2005, New Jersey residents were able to bet on an Internet site operated by the state's OTB system. But the bricks-and-mortar facilities were delayed as contractual issues and liquor licenses were ironed out and approval was sought from local governments.
 Mr. Handel said that one reason the parlor opened here first was because local officials welcomed it.
 ''I think this has great possibilities for Vineland,'' Mayor Perry D. Barse said. ''Favorites in Vineland is going to bring people into our town who will spend money not just at this location but at many of our retail operations. That's important for Vineland from an economic development standpoint.'' 
 He added: ''Not only do you have a beautiful, state-of-the-art facility that people will come to, but it's a place that has created jobs for the town and helped the local construction trade. It's the ultimate win-win situation.''
 By 1:30 p.m., the field was going to the gate for the second race at Aqueduct Race Track in Queens, about 200 customers were busy betting on races around the country, which Mr. Handel said exceeded his expectations.
 ''It's early,'' he said, ''but I think we're on to something good here.''

HEADLINE: Summer's Here, at Least at the Gas Pump

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
IN anticipation of the summer driving season, consumers can expect more of the same: higher gasoline prices. But if they stop in at a Burger King along the way, they will know that at least some of the food they are eating comes from suppliers that treat their animals well. 
 The Tribune Company has a new bid to digest, and the Fed continues to balance rising inflation against slower growth.DRIVING SEASON -- Gasoline prices are surging again and energy analysts are blaming all the usual suspects.
 Futures traders are bidding up prices of crude oil and gasoline in part because of early projections of a strong hurricane season that may interrupt refinery operations this summer. Refineries, which are retooling now anyway to convert from winter to summer gasoline, are further hampered by a string of recent accidents. So output is somewhat off and inventories of gasoline are declining. But driver demand is up, even with the increase in prices. To make matters worse, Iran has taken British sailors and marines captive, making the Middle East even more tense.
 Gasoline prices, which have increased 20 percent since Jan. 1, rose to $2.62 a gallon on average for regular unleaded across the country on Thursday. That is 12 cents higher than a year ago. Experts predict another 10-cent to 15- cent rise because crude oil prices have increased by more than $6 in the last week, to $66 a barrel on Thursday. A rise in crude oil prices is almost always followed in a few days by an increase at the pump. 
 Consumers may feel better that many analysts expect prices to ease in a couple of weeks when refineries get back on track. But the summer driving season will probably bring higher prices once again.

HEADLINE: Authorities Arrest Founder Of Internet Gambling Site

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, March 30 

 BODY:
The founder of the BetOnSports gambling Web site, Stephen Kaplan, was arrested late Wednesday in the Dominican Republic, the United States attorney in St. Louis, Catherine Hanaway, said on Friday. 
 Ms. Hanaway is prosecuting a case against BetOnSports, which is based in London, in federal court in St. Louis. Mr. Kaplan is named in a 22-count criminal case related to Internet gambling.
Mr. Kaplan was arrested at a hotel in Santo Domingo, Ms. Hanaway said, by the Dominican National Police, officials from the United States State Department and the F.B.I.
 ''This was a worldwide search, and thanks to the assistance of many law enforcement agencies, this fugitive will soon be back in St. Louis to face the charges against him,'' she said in a statement.
 Mr. Kaplan has been charged in St. Louis along with the former chief executive of the company, David Carruthers, and nine others. Mr. Carruthers remains under house arrest in a suburb of St. Louis.
 In Geneva on Friday, at the World Trade Organization, a compliance panel ruled that the United States had failed to change its ban on Internet betting to comply with a W.T.O. ruling that said the legislation unfairly aims at offshore casinos.
 The ruling opens the door to possible commercial sanctions against the United States.
 In a 215-page decision, a three-member compliance panel sided with the Caribbean island nation of Antigua and Barbuda, which has argued that Internet gambling is a lucrative source of revenue and provides an income for hundreds of islanders.
 The trade group has said Washington can maintain restrictions on online gambling, as long as its laws are equally applied to American operators offering remote betting on horse racing.
 The Antiguan finance minister, Errol Cort, said in a statement that the ruling ''vindicates all that we have been saying for years about the discriminatory trade practices of the United States in this area, and we look forward to the United States opening its markets.'' 
 Washington claimed victory in the W.T.O.'s initial ruling two years ago because the group recognized its right to prevent offshore betting as a means of protecting public order and public morals.
 But the United States acknowledged Friday that the latest decision was a setback.
 Washington has yet to say if it will appeal the panel's findings. A final ruling upholding Antigua's claims would allow the twin-island nation to seek trade sanctions on the United States for its failure to comply.
 To avoid the penalties, the United States government would have to either permit Americans to gamble over foreign-based sites or eliminate exceptions for off-track betting on horses, including wagers over the Internet, as permitted under the 1978 Interstate Horseracing Act.
 Nevertheless, it appears unlikely that the United States will ease access to companies with servers licensed in Antigua, a nation of 80,000 people that was largely bankrolled by British-owned operators in pursuing its legal action.

HEADLINE: Shares Falter on Trade Tensions

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Escalating trade tensions between the United States and China pushed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slightly lower yesterday, the last trading day of March, limiting its third straight quarterly advance.
 General Electric and Boeing fell after the government imposed new tariffs on Chinese imports, a sign that trade tensions would strain United States exports. Marathon Oil and Schlumberger led energy shares to the steepest decline in the S.& P. 500 after oil fell for the first time in nine days.
The S.& P. 500 rose 0.2 percent in a quarter that exhibited the biggest swings in four years. The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose less than 0.1 percent yesterday, posted its first quarterly decline since 2005. 
 Reports this month showing that employment and economic growth had topped forecasts added to evidence that the economy was not heading for a recession and helped the S.& P. 500 erase a decline of as much as 3.1 percent during the quarter.
 Relatively positive news to end the quarter suggests that the economy ''is on reasonably solid footing as we enter the second quarter,'' said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at Trusco Capital Management in Richmond, Va.
 The S.& P. 500 fell 1.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,420.86 yesterday. The Dow rose 5.60 points, or 0.05 percent, to 12,354.35. The Nasdaq composite index increased 3.76, or 0.2 percent, to 2,421.64. All three benchmarks finished the week with losses of at least 1 percent.
 Stocks erased early gains after the government decided to impose new duties on Chinese goods. The change of policy by the Bush administration, which debated the action for months, applies initially to imports of coated paper from China. It also opens the way for steel companies, textile producers and other manufacturers facing competition from China to apply for the same protection.
 China is the second-largest United States trading partner, behind Canada, and holds more than $350 billion of United States debt. Investors fret that a trade dispute could prompt China to sell some of its Treasury holdings. Duties on Chinese imports would also probably increase costs for United States consumers.
 ''When you talk about the possibility of growing protectionism, that could be a really serious blow to an economy that was already slowing down,'' said Ernie Ankrim, chief investment strategist at the Russell Investment Group in Tacoma, Wash.
 G.E. declined 19 cents, to $35.36, and Boeing slid 85 cents, to $88.91.
 Energy shares retreated 1.2 percent after crude oil's first price decline in nine days. Marathon Oil declined $3.03, to $98.83, and Schlumberger fell $1.57, to $69.10.
 Utilities slipped from levels that were the highest since 2001, led by Exelon and Dominion Resources. Reports yesterday showing bigger-than-forecast increases in consumer spending and a gauge of business activity, along with faster inflation, reduced the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates. The absence of a rate reduction makes dividend-paying shares, like those of utilities, less attractive.
 Exelon lost 39 cents, to $68.71, and Dominion slipped 36 cents, to $88.77. Utilities slumped 0.6 percent as a group. 
 ''The Fed is more likely to reduce rates if you get bad news and today's data is probably more in line with a stay-the-course strategy,'' said Eric Green, a money manager at Penn Capital Management in Cherry Hill, N.J. ''We need to see some really good inflation data before they're willing to cut rates.'' 
 Caterpillar jumped 84 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $67.03, for the best gain in the Dow industrials after it was added to Credit Suisse's United States ''focus list'' with a target of $78 a share. 
 Dendreon, a drug developer, rose $7.71, to $12.93, after a prostate cancer drug it was developing won an endorsement from a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel. 
 PMC-Sierra, a maker of computer chips for telecommunications equipment, gained 71 cents, or 11 percent, to $7.01, after saying it would close two research centers and cut about 175 jobs, or 15 percent of its work force.
 Interest rates were steady, with the 10-year Treasury bill unchanged at 9927/32, yielding 4.64 percent.

HEADLINE: Lenders May Prove Adjustable

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
The day of reckoning is near for millions of homeowners who financed their dream house by taking out an adjustable-rate mortgage. 
 Rates are resetting higher, and in some cases, the monthly mortgage payments that were so affordable in 2004 or 2005 when the loan was signed will push homeowners to their limit or beyond.
What is a borrower to do? You can try to make ends meet by cutting back on expenses. Shut off HBO and the premium cable channels, skip your Starbucks run and bring your lunch to work rather than eating out and you might have enough to cover the bump-up in your mortgage payment.
 Don't despair. There is another way to look at this problem. You, the borrower, are not powerless. ''Consumers get the feeling it is a lost cause to do anything, but it is pretty much the opposite,'' said Harry H. Dinham, president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers. ''The most motivated people are the lenders.'' 
 Homeowners should seek a lower rate or switch to an interest-only loan for a spell. They might even ask for more time to pay, just as long as it does not create ''negative amortization,'' that is, letting the amount owed increase with each payment.
 Mr. Dinham has been through six real estate cycles since 1967 and every time the market goes sour, he said, consumers make the mistake of avoiding the loan officer. 
 But know this: lenders do not want to get stuck with a property. They have to maintain it and then try to sell it on the open market, usually at a loss. Some industry analysts say that it costs a bank an average of $40,000 to foreclose on a loan. That amount gives the borrower that much more room to negotiate. 
 About 1.1 million homeowners will lose their homes to foreclosure because of a mortgage resetting to a higher rate over the next six to seven years, said Christopher L. Cagan, director for research and analytics at First American CoreLogic, a mortgage industry research firm in Santa Ana, Calif.
 He studied two databases with information on 58 million mortgages and sees a wave of mortgage resets moving through the system, first the mortgages with low teaser rates, followed by subprime loans and finally, as the decade comes to a close, the loans to homeowners with good credit. 
 This pig-through-the-python transition is not enough to hurt the overall economy -- about $112 billion will be lost, he calculated -- but it is a world of pain for the households involved.
 Almost all of the teaser loans issued this decade -- those mortgages offered for less than 3 percent -- have reset in the last two years. Rates for most of the homeowners with good credit who obtained adjustable-rate mortgages during the boom years of the housing market will reset from 2008 to 2010. Mr. Cagan said he thought only 7 percent of these loans would default because of the reset.
 He concluded that ''2008 is the pinch year.'' If he were a gambling man -- or a real estate investor, but really, what's the difference? -- he said he would start buying residential properties in 2009. 
 The bulk of the subprime adjustable-rate mortgages, those made to people with less-than-sterling credit reports, are resetting this year and next. About 12 percent of the subprime mortgages will default, he predicted. 
 Subprime borrowers are particularly vulnerable to resets because the interest rates they were originally paying were higher than market rates. People who were subprime borrowers are, by definition, those who have had trouble with money. Some were already on the edge when they borrowed. For instance, an adjustment on a $300,000 loan to 9.5 percent from 7 percent leads to a 26 percent increase in the payment, to $2,523 from $1,996. 
 The way to look at resets, whether they are subprime or prime, is what percentage of income is going to the mortgage. Assume that the lender determined when it granted the loan that the borrower was paying 30 percent of income to mortgage payments. Using the example above, upon reset, the borrower is paying 7.8 percent more of their income to the mortgage, that is 30 percent times 26 percent. 
 It becomes scarier when a borrower originally devoted 50 percent of income to mortgage payments, a rate not uncommon on the coasts where housing is more expensive. Multiply 50 percent times 26 percent and you reach the sad fact that the person has to pay 13 percent more of income to cover the mortgage. ''At 50 percent of your income there is not that much you can cut,'' Mr. Cagan said.
 Catherine Williams, the vice president for financial literacy at Consumer Credit Counseling Services in Houston, said, ''We can all have a great garage sale, but, sadly, that only works once.'' 
 The smart thing to do is to take action before the lender does. The homeowner should initiate the contact with the lender. So first thing: know when your loan resets are scheduled and by how much and how often. Read those loan documents you got at closing.
 Then 90 to 120 days before the loan resets start talking to the lender. Lenders usually approach their borrowers 45 days before a reset. That is not enough time for a borrower to act. Here is an online calculator so you don't even have to bother to count the days by hand: www.timeanddate.com/date/dateadd.html.
 If you started out with a 5.5 percent interest rate, it will adjust to something like 7.75 percent. ''If you want to wait and get that rate you can,'' said Joe Rogers, executive vice president for the sales and service systems office of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. ''Or you could get a 6 percent fixed loan now.'' 
 The dynamics are slightly different when you have no equity in your home or the value of your home is less than the amount of your loan. As a negotiating ploy, you could suggest to your lender that you are willing to just walk away and rationalize the mortgage payments you made as monthly rent payments: tax-deductible monthly rent payments. You wouldn't want to go through with it because you will seriously damage your credit. It's a black mark that remains for seven years. Of course, by then the real estate cycle could be back to where it was in 2004 and lenders will be once again throwing loans to anyone.
 But tell your lender that's what you intend to do. What you are seeking is what's called a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Hearing that, the lender may find more motivation to work something out. 
 Another strategy to suggest to the lender is something that is called a temporary buy down, Mr. Rogers said. The lender locks you into a rate that is slightly higher than the going rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage. Right now that would be 6 7/8 percent. In the first year of the loan, the payments are set as if you are paying a loan at 4 7/8 percent. In the second year it jumps to 5 7/8 percent. In the third and successive years it is 6 7/8.
 You would want this only in a circumstance where you are buying time and expect something to happen within three years that will bail you out. Not that you hope or pray something will happen in that time, but that you actually know you will get a big bonus, an inheritance, or a transfer so you can sell the house. 
 If your rate does not reset until 2009 or 2010, just sit tight. A lot can change in two or three years. If you don't believe that, look at how the housing market has changed from 2005. 
 If there are more signs that the Federal Reserve will begin to lower interest rates, as you near a reset it might be worth considering riding an adjustable-rate mortgage down. A fixed rate is viewed as less risky. The spread between the opening rates on A.R.M.'s and those on fixed-rate loans are not very wide. Mr. Rogers said of taking an A.R.M., ''that's just rolling the dice; if the rates fall, just refinance again.'' 
 But if you worry that you might not be able to refinance as rates drop because a recession might decrease the equity in the home, the adjustable-rate mortgage will allow you to benefit from the lower rates. Erik Hurst, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, said homeowners who took out A.R.M.'s benefited from lower-than-market rates. ''If the Fed cuts rates, they've won again,'' he said.
 Is there any good news in this topic? Mr. Cagan, the researcher at First American CoreLogic, found that if house prices went up 1 percent nationally, 70,000 fewer loans would foreclose because of resets. 
 Of course, the opposite is true as well, he said. Every 1 percent fall in national prices drives an additional 70,000 loans into foreclosure. And for right now, at least, house prices are falling.FOLLOW-UP: Fidelity Investments said this week that it had calculated the amount of money an American retiring at age 65 would need just for health care during their twilight years: $215,000
 It was supposed to be a scary number to encourage Americans to save more, but spread over the 20-year life expectancy that Fidelity also predicts, that comes to $10,750 a year. Fidelity said 27 percent of the average Social Security check would cover that expense.
 The frightening part was another calculation. With the rate of health costs rising at more than twice the pace of general inflation, Fidelity said in 20 years, half of the Social Security check would be needed to cover health care costs.

HEADLINE: A New Rush to Go Public

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
ANOTHER frenzy so soon?
 Business 2.0 reports that we are about to witness a new round of technology companies racing to go public.
This year ''is shaping up to be the biggest year for initial public offerings in the tech world since the end of the dot-com bubble in 2000,'' Michael V. Copeland writes.
 In the last year, the value of technology companies waiting to go public has risen more than fourfold, to $4.7 billion from $1.1 billion, according to figures provided by Dealogic. 
 What is behind this rush to market? Two things, he writes: the Nasdaq's rise of nearly 20 percent in the last half of 2006 and the good performance of the relatively small number of companies that went public last year.
 ''Tech I.P.O.'s in 2006 returned a healthy average of 37 percent over their offer prices, according to Renaissance Capital,'' Mr. Copeland writes.
 Many of the companies had planned to go public but pulled back in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble's bursting. This includes the wireless equipment company Aruba Networks, the software security firm Sourcefire and the local cellular carrier MetroPCS.
 Zappos.com, the shoe seller, and Art.com, which sells posters and prints online, are also expected to go public.
 FIDO RETURNS -- There is a new Dogs of the Dow theory that promises to work even better than the old one, Smart Money reports.
 The initial one was simple to understand. On the first trading day of the year, an investor would choose the 10 highest-yielding stocks among the Dow Jones industrial average, hold them for a year, then sell. For the 50 years ended in 1995, the Dogs beat the Dow itself by about three percentage points a year.
 But since then, with the exception of last year, the Dogs of the Dow theory had stopped working. 
 One possible explanation is that companies are taking the money they would have paid in dividends and using it to repurchase their stock. This, of course, is another way to make a stock more appealing: reducing the number of shares outstanding, by definition, increases earnings per share.
 The logical question to ask is, Wouldn't a new measure that combined dividends and stock repurchases work even better than the Dogs of Dow theory alone? And according to four academics who have prepared a paper for the Journal of Finance the answer is yes, Jack Hough writes.
 The professors ranked stocks by what they called their ''net payout yield,'' or money spent on dividends and share repurchases, minus money raised by issuing new stock. ''Stocks with the highest net payout yields, the researchers found, outperformed their sample by five percentage points a year,'' Mr. Hough writes.
 Mr. Hough's new Dogs of the Dow list comprises 3M, Caterpillar, Citigroup, DuPont, Exxon Mobil, Intel, Microsoft, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble and Walt Disney.
 OVER HERE -- If you want to know why Bill Gates and other technology leaders have been lobbying for immigration reform, you need to look no further than this:
 In the last 10 years, a quarter of all technology companies formed in the United States had at least one founding member who was an immigrant, East West writes, reporting on a study conducted by Duke University and the University of California, Berkeley. 
 ''The number of international patent applications filed by nonresident immigrants increased from 7.8 percent of all applications in 1998 to 24.2 percent in 2006,'' the article reports.
 The study's author, Vivek Wadhwa of Duke, writes, ''We need to attract the world's best and brightest and have them come here to stay.''
 FINAL TAKE -- In the National Football League, teams no longer have exhibition contests, they play preseason games. Second-hand luxury automobiles are not used, they are preowned. And apparently, if Domino magazine's description catches on, salvaged wood will no longer be known as recycled but ''pre-loved.''
 You do have to wonder what other products and services will be labeled pre-loved in coming years. Would returned engagement rings qualify? PAUL B. BROWN

HEADLINE: The Fiery Family

BYLINE: By KRISTINA SHEVORY

DATELINE: AVERY ISLAND, La. 

 BODY:
In April, board members and shareholders of the McIlhenny Company plan to gather here for their annual meeting. Unlike well-publicized events at big public companies this year, where activist shareholders often hope to create a stir, a private gathering is planned, and the agenda will probably not be debated. The meeting promises to be what it always is: one part business and one part family reunion.
 Food is on the menu, and plenty of it: Cajun specialties, like boudin, corn-and-crab bisque and crawfish pie. There will be sweet tea, soda pop and bloody marys. And on every table, there will probably be all six flavors of Tabasco sauce. But for the McIlhennys, this is no idle condiment to spice up bland food. This is business.
The McIlhenny Company, the maker of Tabasco, is one of the country's biggest hot sauce makers. Its fiery condiment has become so popular that its name is a generic term for hot sauce. Less known is that the family has weathered storms, both personal and economic, to keep the business going since its founding more than 130 years ago. 
 Now in its fifth generation as a family-run business, the McIlhenny Company is operated by an eight-member board that is largely part of the extended family. All of the 145 shareholders either inherited their stock or were given it from another living family member.
 But in practice, only two to four family members typically run the company because it is so big and the family does not want it to become insular and resistant to change. They make sure decisions are transparent and issue financial statements every quarter to their shareholders.
 ''They have a good process for how they make decisions,'' said Ann M. Dugan, executive director of the Institute for Entrepreneurial Excellence at the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business at the University of Pittsburgh. ''They've taken the emotionality out of it. Once you get into the third and fourth generations, you're looking at cousins with different experiences and family. It's easier to become factionalized.''
 Even so, emotions ran high when the family faced its biggest crisis in recent memory. That occurred in the midst of the devastating storms in 2005, but not from Hurricane Katrina, which wreaked havoc on nearby New Orleans, but from the storm that followed.
 The McIlhenny family knew Hurricane Rita would bring high winds and rain to southern Louisiana. They had heeded an evacuation order and had a volunteer crew of workers in case something went wrong. They assumed Avery Island, one of the highest points along the coast and home to their Tabasco sauce, would be fine.
 They were wrong.
 The day Rita made landfall, a guard called at 8 a.m. and said water was rising quickly. Everyone on the island raced over to the low-lying factory to see what they could do. The sight gave them pause.
 Water was starting to cover the main road leading to the factory and was gaining ground quickly. Employees jumped on forklifts to move some of the barrels of hot sauce onto pallets to give them a few inches off the ground. Others ferried computers to the main office up the hill. The low-lying pepper fields were underwater and white caps dotted the surface. Two hours later, the water was four inches from the factory floor, with the water at nearly double the highest flood level that anyone could remember. 
 And then it stopped. While the factory was saved by mere inches, the family lost some of its pepper plants, a gatehouse and six days of bottling to the storm.
 ''When you live on the highest point in the area, you just don't think flooding is going to be an issue,'' said Harold G. Osborn, a cousin and vice president of agriculture. 
 The family was left with a tough choice to make. 
 It had planned to build a museum and culinary center in New Orleans, where many family members live and where Tabasco was first sold. After Katrina hit on Aug. 29, the company lost the contractor for that project.
 In early January 2006, they were trying to get new bids on construction. But costs had risen so much that they decided not to proceed. ''We hate it,'' Tony Simmons, executive vice president and a family member whose business card is a miniature Tabasco bottle, said of the decision.
 Instead, the family plans to spend $5 million on something far more urgent: a 17-foot levee on Avery Island and a back-up generator. Construction should begin by April and be ready in time for the 2008 hurricane season. 
 ''Never say never, but we don't think we can get a storm surge past that,'' Mr. Simmons said.
 Since it started making hot sauce in 1868, the McIlhenny Company has faced various crises, both personal and economic, to keep the business going. First there was the challenge of starting a self-named company after the Civil War, then building Tabasco into a recognized brand and finally maintaining its popularity despite am abundance of competitors. 
 The McIlhenny Company is now one of the country's biggest hot sauce makers and turns out as many as 720,000 two-ounce bottles every day. Its slender glass bottles are found in soldiers' rations, restaurant tables across the country and in 161 countries, according to the company.
 ''What makes Tabasco as a brand great is that the family continues to deliver,'' said David Martin, president of United States operations for Interbrand, branding consultants in New York. ''It always tastes the same, has the right degree of spice and flavor. You can always count on it.''
 Consumers must agree. Around 62 percent of Americans had hot sauce in their pantry in 2005, according to the most recent data available from the NPD Group, a research and consulting firm in Port Washington, N.Y., versus 57 percent in 1999. 
 To stay ahead of its competitors and expand valuable supermarket space, the company has been rolling out new pepper sauces with jalapenos, habaneros and chipotles -- one of their best sellers -- over the last 13 years. They recently released a new sweet-and-spicy sauce in seven markets.
 Paul McIlhenny, the company's chief executive, has entered into licensing deals to add Tabasco to Spam, steak sauce and mayonnaise and ramped up the business with the food service industry, which now counts for more than half of sales. 
 ''What impresses us the most is that they keep bringing out new sauces,'' said Gretchen VanEsselstyn, editor in chief of Chile Pepper magazine in New York. ''They're really trying hard to be more than a one-trick pony.'' 
 For all the variation, the family has stuck to the same basic recipe -- peppers, salt and vinegar -- and production techniques since its beginning. After the Civil War, Edmund McIlhenny experimented with growing peppers on Avery Island as a way to spice up his food, said Shane K. Bernard, the company's historian and curator. They still follow Edmund's growing instructions and use seeds from the original plants.
 Most of the peppers are now grown in Latin America -- they ran out of room here in 1965 and started experimenting with plants in Mexico -- but all the seeds are still grown on the island. While different climates and soils affect a pepper's heat level and flavor, the McIlhenny Company blends them in the final product so the taste remains familiar.
 When the peppers are harvested, they are shipped back to Avery Island where they are ground into mash. Salt is added and the mixture is put into old whiskey barrels from distilleries like Jack Daniels and Jim Beam to age for up to three years. (The bright red mash is so corrosive that forklifts last only six years.) After three years, a family member samples the mash and, if approved, it is mixed with vinegar and stirred for one month. The seeds and skins are then removed and the sauce bottled.
 The family has not tweaked Tabasco to shave expenses or lower prices because they make money from more than just the sauce. On Avery Island, a 2,200-acre salt dome west of New Orleans, they mine rock salt, pump oil and natural gas and operate Jungle Gardens, a botanical garden. They also reuse everything, from selling their used oak barrels to selling the seed mash to a company for use in candies.
 ''The family has the good fortune to have an island made of oil and salt, with constant revenues, and has not had to follow the fortunes of family businesses that depend on one product,'' Richard Schweid, the author of ''Hot Peppers: The Story of Cajuns and Capsicum,'' wrote in an e-mail message. ''This has meant they could reject alternative practices with Tabasco sauce that would mean less quality and more savings.''
 Avery Island has also helped keep the family together because it is more than just a place where Tabasco is made. It is also home. Many family members grew up working summers on the island, from picking peppers to operating the company's general store. Many still spend their weekends here. Before they joined the company, Mr. Osborn was a civilian military contractor and Mr. Simmons was a construction crane supplier. 
 They have ideal commutes: both live on the island. Half of their 200 full-time employees do, too. The company has 40 part-time workers. Around 80 clapboard homes for employees dot the island, a holdover from the days when most people didn't own cars and traveling to remote Avery Island was difficult. (The family leases the homes to workers.) Many of the employees' parents and grandparents worked on the island and many still send their children to the island's elementary school.
 ''Everyone here could leave and work in the oil industry and make twice the money, but why?'' said Kip White, 28, a third-generation employee. ''We have a good time, and we're like family here.'' 
 And it is likely to stay that way. Every once in a while, the family is approached to see if the company is for sale, but the offers have never been serious enough to bring to shareholders for a vote.
 ''As long as we can grow the business profitably and with dividends,'' Paul McIlhenny said, ''then the family will be happy.''

HEADLINE: Abortion Plan in Mexico City Shakes a Heavily Catholic Land

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.; Yazmin Quiroz, Elisabeth Malkin and Antonio Betancourt contributed reporting.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 30 

 BODY:
Dominated by liberals, Mexico City's legislature is expected to legalize abortion in a few weeks. The bill would make this city one of the largest entities in Latin America to break with a long tradition of women resorting to illegal clinics and midwives to end unwanted pregnancies. 
 But the measure has stirred a vicious debate and shaken this heavily Roman Catholic country to its roots. In recent days, the bill has dominated conversations from family dinner tables to the president's office. Celebrities and politicians of all stripes have lined up on both sides, throwing verbal darts at one another. Catholic and feminist groups have staged dueling protests and marches.
The contours of the debate are familiar to veterans of similar battles in the United States. But Mexico City's law would be groundbreaking in Latin America, where most countries allow abortion only under strict conditions, like when the life of the mother is in danger or when she is a victim of rape or incest. Only in Cuba, Puerto Rico and Guyana can women have abortions for any reason during the first trimester. Three countries -- Chile, Nicaragua and El Salvador -- ban it without exception. 
 The Mexico City bill would make it legal to have an abortion during the first trimester for any reason. The procedure would be free at city health facilities. Private hospitals would be required to provide an abortion to any woman who asks for one, though doctors with religious or ethical objections would not be required to perform abortions.
 Catholic leaders and church officials have denounced the proponents as ''baby killers'' and have warned that the law could provoke violence against doctors who agree to provide the service. A group of Catholic lawyers are pushing for a citywide referendum on the issue, hoping to avert the vote in the city Legislative Assembly.
 The debate in Mexico threatens to revive tensions between President Felipe Calderon, a conservative who opposes abortion, and the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, whose candidate narrowly lost the election last year and still refuses to concede. 
 Mr. Calderon has tried to stay above the fray, but he said last week, ''I am in defense of life.'' His health minister and other surrogates in the conservative National Action Party, however, are in the thick of it. They have proposed streamlining adoption laws, improving sex education and providing subsidies to unwed mothers as alternatives. 
 Leftists and feminists, meanwhile, have accused opponents of turning a blind eye to reality. They say millions of women here, and indeed throughout much of Latin America, already ignore the law and choose to abort fetuses, often in dingy underground clinics or the private homes of midwives. They risk infection, sterility and sometimes death.
 ''Women are dying, above all poor women, because of unsafe abortions,'' said Maria Consuelo Mejia, the director of Catholics for the Right to Decide. ''What we would like is that these women never have to confront the necessity of an abortion, but in this society it's impossible right now. There is no access to information, to contraceptives. Nor do most women have the power to negotiate the use of contraceptives with their partners.''
 Conservatives respond that abortion is tantamount to murder. ''This law is a law that will cost many lives,'' said Jorge Serrano Limon, the head of Provida, an anti-abortion group. ''If it is signed, it will spill a lot of blood, the blood of babies just conceived in the maternal womb.'' 
 Mr. Serrano Limon and other opponents also dispute that the law will end illegal abortions. The procedure carries such a stigma here, they say, that whether legal or not, many women will seek out underground clinics to keep their condition secret from their friends and families anyway. 
 The bill, tentatively scheduled for a vote on April 19, is likely to pass the 66-member city Legislative Assembly with a solid majority, and the mayor, Marcelo Ebrard, has said he will sign it, the sponsors say. It would legalize abortion in the capital, which has eight million residents, and could make Mexico City a magnet for women seeking abortions across the country.
 The debate now roiling Mexico would have been nearly unthinkable a decade ago, proponents of the law say. The topic was so taboo that the church once excommunicated actresses and television producers for bringing it up in a soap opera.
 ''People are talking about abortion openly for the first time in Mexico,'' said Lilian Sepulveda, a lawyer with the New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights who tracks the issue in Latin America. ''It is historic.''
 Still, lawmakers in the Assembly are bracing for an ugly fight, and each side has held competing rallies. 
 Several hundred people in favor of the law marched Thursday afternoon through the narrow streets of the historic downtown. The crowd was made up mostly of women, largely from women's rights groups and political parties that support legalizing abortion. 
 Last Sunday, Cardinal Norberto Rivera was among the church leaders who joined a protest march down the boulevard to the Basilica of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Despite a ban on the clergy taking part in politics, the cardinal told the crowd of several thousand, ''We are united here so that they hear our voice, the voice of life.''
 ''They say that it's a problem of a woman's rights over her body, but they ignore the right over their bodies that all the aborted girls and boys have,'' he said later in his homily. ''They deny them the fundamental right, which is the right to life.'' 
 Victor Hugo Cirigo Vasquez, the majority leader of the Assembly, said many of the 34 legislators from his Party of the Democratic Revolution who support the measure had received threatening calls and messages on their cellphones, as well as nasty e-mail. They were told they would be excommunicated or go to hell if they approved the law. 
 ''There is a media lynching campaign that has been orchestrated by clerical groups from the very, very far right,'' he said. He added, ''It's a black campaign that's coming hard.''
 The bill's prime sponsor, Jorge Diaz Cuervo of the Alternative Party, said church leaders had broken Mexican law by meddling in the legislative process. ''This is a layman's state,'' he said. ''There is no reason to impose the beliefs of one church on 100 percent of the people.''
 Many women here are watching the political battle with a mix of trepidation and hope. Like many laws in Mexico, the abortion law is honored as much in its breach as its observance. 
 Government officials estimate at least 110,000 women a year seek illegal abortions in Mexico, and many abortion rights groups say the number is much higher. At least 88 women died in 2006 from botched abortions, the Health Ministry says, though it is far from clear that all cases were reported.
 For the well off, it is common knowledge that certain gynecologists perform illegal abortions in private hospitals, disguising the procedure as something else on documents. 
 For the poor, unwanted pregnancies often mean finding a midwife or an underground clinic, abortion rights advocates say. Some young women also resort to huge doses of drugs for arthritis and gastritis, available over the counter, that can cause miscarriages. Others use teas made from traditional herbs to cause miscarriages. All of these methods carry dangers. 
 The story of one woman, Dolores, who did not want her full name used, is typical. When she was 18, she became pregnant after her first sexual encounter with a boyfriend she barely knew, mostly because she knew nothing about contraception or even the basics of sexuality.
 ''I was alone and had no help,'' she said in an interview. ''In fact, I thought about it a lot before I made the decision, but in the end there was no other way. I wasn't in the economic position to face the situation.'' 
 Panicked, she visited a midwife, who inserted a flexible tube into the womb to let air in and provoke a miscarriage. Dolores was told to wait three days before removing the tube.
 She started bleeding within 15 minutes of leaving the midwife's house. The bleeding continued unabated for a month. At last, she fainted in front of her parents from a loss of blood and they took her to a hospital, where she recovered slowly after a week of treatment. ''I almost died,'' she said. 
 Now 41, she has never carried a baby to term. Two of her pregnancies ended in premature births, and both infants died.

HEADLINE: Tax Deal Provides Added Relief To Middle-Income Homeowners

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and FORD FESSENDEN

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 30 

 BODY:
Middle-class homeowners in Westchester County will get nearly $3,000. In Albany, they will receive $994, and in Erie County, $842.
 That is a sampling of the tax relief that homeowners will receive under a plan hammered out this week by Gov. Eliot Spitzer and legislative leaders that would add $1.3 billion to the state's School Tax Relief program, known as STAR. Under the plan, the state would spend nearly $5 billion on STAR in the coming year.
The agreement, which emerged during state budget negotiations, would direct more relief -- through rebates and property tax adjustments -- to middle- and lower-income taxpayers than in the past. The largest benefit would go to homeowners with annual incomes up to $120,000 in the downstate region and up to $90,000 upstate. 
 ''People come to New York and look at the price of a house and say, 'Gee, the price is good, but the property tax hit is troublesome,' '' Mr. Spitzer said on Friday. ''So when we begin to ratchet down on that property tax bite, people will find it more economically viable to stay here.'' 
 In New York City, where property tax rates are low because city income taxes are the principal means of financing schools, homeowners have received relatively small benefits from STAR. For that reason, the Legislature agreed as part of the deal to increase the personal income tax credit to $290 from $230 for married couples filing joint returns, and to $145 from $115 for individuals. 
 It is far from clear that the increased benefits will address longstanding criticisms about STAR. Many homeowners have expressed dismay that their property taxes have continued to rise, often sharply, despite the program. Critics on the left assert that STAR gives too much money to higher-income neighborhoods; critics on the right say it has done nothing to control property taxes, despite doling out huge sums of money. 
 And some independent analysts say that STAR, created in the late 1990s, has had the perverse effect of encouraging localities to raise property taxes. Since 1998, property tax levies in New York State have risen 41 percent, nearly twice the rate of inflation.
 ''It's an inefficient use of funds that basically encourages what it's supposedly trying to fix,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative group. ''When you subsidize something, you get more of it.'' 
 STAR exempts at least $30,000 of a home's value from tax, an amount that can be higher, and sometimes far higher, in counties where the home values are above the statewide average. Homeowners who are 65 or older receive higher benefits. 
 Initially, STAR aid was sent directly to school districts and was used to adjust property tax bills. But starting last year, the Legislature also sent rebate checks directly to homeowners. The rebates would roughly double under the new agreement, to $1.3 billion. Homeowners will continue to receive adjustments to their property tax bills. People who have already enrolled in the STAR program with their local assessors will have to apply for the new rebate checks through the state's Department of Taxation and Finance. 
 According to numbers released by Governor Spitzer's office, homeowners who live in Westchester County, where property taxes are particularly high, and who earn up to $120,000 would get $1,094 rebate checks and another $1,823 deducted from their property tax bills. The agreement calls for taxpayers making more than $250,000 to receive no rebates. 
 Some homeowners were not impressed with the rebate checks last year. 
 ''We need real relief,'' said Laurann Pandelakis, a former teacher living in Manhasset who received a $300 check last year. In the past seven years, her annual property taxes have risen to $13,500 from $6,000, causing her to become an outspoken critic of school spending.
 ''It's insulting to people who are seeing increases of 6 or 7 percent,'' Ms. Pandelakis said, referring to the spending increase projected in her district this year. 
 Studies show that school districts spend the largest portion of their budgets on personnel costs, supporting teacher salaries that are among the highest in the nation. Unions have been strong supporters of STAR.
 School board presidents say that while they do not raise taxes because of STAR, the program makes it easier for homeowners to swallow increases.
 ''People are squeezed, and because of STAR they feel less pressured and less squeezed,'' said Bruce G. Miller, the president of the Port Jefferson school board on Long Island. ''I think it does help. As president of a board of education who has to present a budget to voters, you're aware of what the limitations are and how careful you have to be.
 ''Would I like to have the money as direct state aid? Definitely,'' Mr. Miller said. ''In the past, when we've had large state aid payments, we've reduced taxes.''
 Liberal critics of the program say STAR is not always equitable. A review of STAR spending shows that wealthy districts receive a higher percentage of aid from STAR than from traditional educational aid programs, which favor lower-income districts. 
 Homeowners with the same incomes and home values can also receive very different STAR savings, based on where they live. And because STAR ignores commercial properties and multifamily dwellings, businesses and landlords -- and ultimately renters -- lose out.
 ''It is school aid, but it's perverse,'' said Frank Mauro, executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a left-leaning budget watchdog group. ''Places like Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse do so poorly because they have high percentages of renters.''
 Massachusetts and New Jersey have moved to cap local property tax levies, a practice that Mr. Spitzer opposes but that Republicans have supported. A cap successfully reduced the tax burden in Massachusetts in the 1980s. In 1977, Massachusetts had the nation's third-highest state and local tax burden as a percentage of income, after Alaska and New York, mostly because of property taxes that consumed 6.5 percent of income, the highest percentage in the nation. (Property taxes in the New York City suburbs currently consume 5.8 percent of income.)
 Proposition 2 1/2, passed in Massachusetts in 1980, put a 2.5 percent ceiling on yearly property tax increases, which voters are able to override in municipal elections. Although the cap has often been overridden, overall property tax collections as a percentage of income have fallen drastically since it was implemented.
 Eastchester, in Westchester County, and Newton, Mass., each had a median home price of about $700,000 in 2005. In Eastchester, the median tax bill was $12,348, a figure that has increased 36 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1995. In Newton, the median tax bill was $6,138, and it has increased just 3 percent in real dollars since 1995.
 While Massachusetts is now 31st in terms of its state and local tax burden, New York ranks first, according to the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute.
 Mr. Mauro said a tax cap would lock in, and even increase, disparities between rich and poor school districts. He would prefer also limiting property tax bills based on how high they are relative to the homeowners' incomes. 
 Paul E. Francis, the state's budget director, said, ''The problem with the cap is that at the end of the day, for all the efforts you can make to design one, you're taking away local control over how much money they want to spend on schools.''

HEADLINE: FED WATCH

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, acknowledged on Wednesday that the central bank was more uncertain about the economic outlook and was giving itself more maneuvering room on policy. But that was not a hint that the Fed was about to reduce interest rates and shore up sluggish growth. The risks, Mr. Bernanke emphasized, are in both directions: inflation that might prove higher than expected and growth that might be slower. 
 ''We have not shifted away from an inflation bias,'' Mr. Bernanke told the Joint Economic Committee, referring to the Fed's view that inflation is a bigger risk right now than slower growth. Rather, he said, ''we are looking for a bit more flexibility.''
 Data yesterday reinforced the Fed's point: its favorite measure of inflation jumped 0.3 percent in February and was up 2.4 percent from one year earlier -- well above the Fed's unofficial target of 1 percent to 2 percent. Personal income and personal consumption jumped sharply as well. The economy might be slowing, but consumers are not getting the message.
 The picture will not be much clearer next week. Next Friday's employment report for March could offer signs of a tighter job market or slowing growth, but it is unlikely in itself to bump the Fed off its wait-and-see stance. EDMUND L.

HEADLINE: IN MAJOR SHIFT, U.S. IS IMPOSING TARIFFS ON CHINA

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, in a major escalation of trade pressure on China, said Friday that it would reverse more than 20 years of American policy and impose potentially steep tariffs on Chinese manufactured goods on the ground that China is illegally subsidizing some of its exports.
 The action, announced by Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez, signaled a tougher approach to China at a time when the administration's campaign of quiet diplomacy by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has produced few results.
The step also reflected the shift in trade politics since Democrats took control of Congress. The widening American trade deficit with China, which reached a record $232.5 billion last year, or about a third of the entire trade gap, has been seized upon by Democrats as a symbol of past policy failures that have led to the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.
 Mr. Gutierrez's announcement has the immediate effect of imposing duties on two Chinese makers of high-gloss paper, one at 10.9 percent and the other 20.4 percent, calculated by adding up the supposedly illegal subsidies. 
 But trade and industry officials say future actions based on the department's new policy could lead to duties on imports of Chinese steel, plastics, machinery, textiles and many other products sold in the United States, if as expected those industries seek relief and the department finds that they are harmed by illegal subsidies.
 Indeed, industry and administration officials say that they chose the high-quality paper industry last year to serve as a test case for a sweeping revision of the administration's previous policies, which did not allow for antisubsidy duties for Communist or other nonmarket economies.
 Mr. Gutierrez said that the administration's step was based on careful study of Chinese subsidy practices and was being carried out irrespective of any pressure from Congress.
 ''This is simply an application of our law,'' he declared. ''The message that we have been sending all along to all of our trading partners is that we want fair trade and that we will use every tool at our disposal to guarantee that our workers and our companies have a level playing field.''
 A spokesman at the Embassy of China, Chu Maoming, said in Washington that China expressed ''strong objection'' to the Commerce Department announcement, which he said sets a bad precedent that could damage China-United States relations.
 ''The Chinese side strongly urges the U.S. side to reconsider the decision and reverse it as soon as possible,'' he said.
 The stock market at first reacted negatively to the news, on fears that a trade war with China could erupt, harming the dollar as well as stocks of companies that rely on trade with China. But stocks later recovered, ending the day barely changed. 
 Beyond seeking a review of the new policy in coming months, China is expected to challenge it in federal court and also at the World Trade Organization, but not through imposing tariffs of its own on American goods, according to lawyers who have been representing China in the dispute.
 Under W.T.O. rules, China must seek recourse through the courts or the W.T.O.'s adjudication process if it hopes to get the new tariffs declared illegal.
 Democrats in Congress hailed the announcement by Mr. Gutierrez but said they would continue their efforts to force a tougher policy on China through various pieces of legislation. Many Democrats won their elections last fall in part by advocating a tougher policy on trade with China and other countries where labor and material costs are much lower than those in the United States. 
 Some lawmakers also complain bitterly that China unfairly ties its currency to the dollar, which aggravates the trade imbalance by making exports to America cheaper and imports to China more expensive. But American officials say there is no thought being given to citing currency policies as a form of subsidy that would bring about import duties. 
 ''This is a long-overdue change in policy,'' said Sander M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 He said that lawmakers would nonetheless press for sweeping legislation calling for tougher actions against American trading partners deemed to be engaged in unfair practices. He also said that he would try to enact legislation codifying the new administration policy in case the courts overturn it.
 The Commerce Department decision affects Chinese manufacturers of the kind of high-gloss paper used for brochures, catalogs, annual reports, movie posters and the like. At present, imports account for only 5 percent of the domestic market, but American manufacturers fear that imports are underpricing what they can produce and could wipe out the industry in a matter of years.
 The department responded to a complaint by the NewPage Corporation, the largest producer of high-quality paper in the United States.
 The NewPage complaint was backed in separate filings by leaders of several industries, including steel. The ruling on Friday was hailed by several groups critical of current trade policies, from manufacturers to labor unions to environmental groups, none of which have been very complimentary toward the administration on these issues in the past.
 ''This is an important day for the thousands of paper workers throughout the United States,'' said Leo W. Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers of America, whose union represents paper workers. ''The message to foreign governments is, 'Stop providing unfair subsidies to your exporters.' ''
 John Engler, a former governor of Michigan who is now president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said the announcement was ''great news and an important step toward balanced trade with China.''
 But the president of a company that serves as the American marketing arm of the Chinese paper industry warned that the ruling would lead to higher costs for American consumers. ''What we are hearing from paper buyers is that because of high American prices, they have no choice but to buy paper offshore,'' said Tom Vendetti, president of China Paper Holdings.
 The paper case has been closely watched for months in trade circles, where the rules on subsidies and duties are somewhat arcane. American law allows the United States to impose what are called antidumping duties when imports are sold in the United States at prices below what it costs to produce them.
 But these antidumping duties tend to be small compared with duties imposed for illegal subsidies when they are employed by trading partners with free market economies. Since the 1980s, the United States has barred antisubsidy duties in Communist or nonmarket economies.
 The rationale has been that it is impossible to determine what a subsidy is in a state-controlled economy, and that government-run businesses in China did not make marketing decisions based on their subsidies because they were merely told what to do by the authorities.
 Today, that reasoning is regarded as out-of-date as China has moved from a faltering economy two decades ago to an export superpower with sophisticated marketing and manufacturing techniques and a determination to find jobs for hundreds of millions of poor Chinese.
 ''The China of today is not the China of years ago,'' Mr. Gutierrez said. ''Just as China has evolved, so has the range of our tools to make sure Americans are treated fairly.''
 Although the tariffs imposed by the decision today are effective immediately, the action is subject to review by the Commerce Department, and a formal decision is due in October. But the administration's position is not expected to change unless it is ordered to do so by a court or by the World Trade Organization. 
 The decision, however, is certain to become a focus of talks in the ''strategic economic dialogue'' begun by Mr. Paulson last September. The first meeting of top Chinese and American cabinet members to discuss a range of economic issues was in December, and another is due in Washington in May.
 Mr. Paulson's effort is aimed at getting China to move on a number of issues, including the suspected manipulation of its currency, that Washington regards as unfair.

HEADLINE: Plan for Wind Farm Off Massachusetts Clears State Hurdle

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: BOSTON, March 30 

 BODY:
A proposal to build the country's first offshore wind farm in the waters off Cape Cod won state environmental approval on Friday, bringing the project a major step closer to being built.
 The project, known as Cape Wind, would involve 130 wind turbines in a 25-square-mile area in Nantucket Sound, and would provide as much as 79 percent of the electricity for the cape, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.
 Opponents of the project, including many residents of the cape and the islands, worry about its potential effects on the fishing industry, tourism, bird habitat, ocean navigation, the marine environment and views from summer homes. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, whose family has a compound on Cape Cod, is one of the opponents. 
 On Friday, Ian A. Bowles, the state's secretary of environmental affairs, said the environmental report for Cape Wind had passed state muster. Because the turbines are planned for federal waters, a federal environmental review must still be completed, a process that is expected to take much of this year.
 Mr. Bowles, whose agency was responsible for reviewing the impact of the underwater cables that would connect the turbines to the shore, said the project ''provides significant environmental benefits.''
 He said that compared with electricity generated by power plants, Cape Wind would offset 802 tons of sulfur dioxide, 497 tons of nitrous oxide and 733,876 tons of carbon dioxide each year.
 ''This is equivalent to taking 175,000 cars off the road,'' Mr. Bowles said, adding that those benefits, along with a $10 million mitigation package in which Cape Wind agreed to pay $5.6 million over 20 years and restore marine and bird habitat, were enough to outweigh any environmental detriments the project might cause.
 Gov. Deval Patrick, a supporter of the project, said in a statement on Friday that it was ''an important symbol of our commitment to clean energy.''
 Several environmental groups hailed the decision. Philip Warburg, president of the Conservation Law Foundation, said in a statement that ''projects like the Cape Wind offshore wind energy proposal are critically important in our effort to combat climate change and lessen our dangerous dependence on fossil fuels.''
 But the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound issued a statement calling the decision ''wholly unacceptable'' and saying it ''reflects the current administration's willingness to sacrifice Nantucket Sound to advance its renewable energy agenda'' and ''has opened the door to gross developer exploitation of an irreplaceable natural resource.''
 The alliance also said the state's report performed a ''substandard review'' of alternative sites for the wind turbines, which would extend up to 440 feet above sea level.
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Kennedy, Melissa Wagoner, suggested that the ball was now in the federal government's court. 
 ''The review of the Cape Wind project rests with the Department of the Interior, the Coast Guard and the Department of Defense, which will release their findings in the months ahead,'' Ms. Wagoner said. ''Senator Kennedy hopes those agencies will give serious consideration to the safety, maritime, environmental and economic concerns raised by the Cape Wind proposal.''
 Jim Gordon, the president of Cape Wind, has said the project will not be as unsightly as critics maintain.
 ''Today's decision brings a major source of clean renewable energy and the benefits of new jobs, a healthier environment and greater energy security one step closer to this region,'' Mr. Gordon said.
 He said that if federal approval was granted, the project would take two years to complete, although some of the turbines would begin operating as they were built.

HEADLINE: Divining the Future of the G.O.P.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''No U-Turns'' (column, March 29), David Brooks argues that Reagan-Goldwater small-government conservatism is outmoded in today's society. He writes, ''The Republican Party, which still talks as if government were the biggest threat to choice, has lost touch with independent voters.''
The Republicans have certainly lost touch with independent voters, precisely because they have abandoned their commitment to limited government. It wasn't just Iraq and scandal that brought about the Republican defeat in the 2006 midterm elections. It was a belief that the party had abandoned its basic principles. 
 If swing voters had wanted needless foreign interventions, huge increases in domestic spending, the first new entitlement program since the Great Society and a federal takeover of education, why wouldn't they have voted for Democrats?
 Big government doesn't work, whether run by liberals or conservatives. In the wake of the government's failure to deal with Hurricane Katrina, the Walter Reed mess, and potential Social Security and Medicare bankruptcy, does Mr. Brooks believe that big government can fix health care, the economy and even our families?Michael TannerWashington, March 29, 2007The writer is the director of health and welfare studies, Cato Institute.To the Editor:
 David Brooks tells us what could have been. George W. Bush had it right in the 2000 campaign when he argued for ''compassionate conservatism,'' which accurately captured the mood of the country. 
 But instead of being true to his campaign promises, Mr. Bush allowed the country to be hijacked by the neocons in the Republican Party, with disastrous results: a significant lowering of America's economic and moral values worldwide. And just maybe the opposite of the neocons' intended results -- a permanent Democratic majority.Garth Bishop Los Angeles, March 29, 2007To the Editor:
 David Brooks says that Republicans have lost touch with independent voters and attributes this loss of confidence to the party's ''liberty vs. power'' approach. He advises a ''security leads to freedom'' paradigm. 
 But this change will not convince many voters, because without a sense of equality, there can be neither security nor freedom.
 The electorate understands that the G.O.P. cannot meet its need for equality, economic and civil, because it represents the economically privileged at the expense of the majority.
 The Bush policies have eroded the middle class's sense of equality. As this becomes more obvious, the Republicans' popularity will sink further. The question now is: Can the Democratic Party return to its New Deal roots?Thomas M. Stephens Columbus, Ohio, March 30, 2007To the Editor:
 I agree that Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater should not be the Republican Party's models for future leadership. The party should return to the way it was before 1964, the year it decided to sacrifice credibility with the country's moderates to court the right wing. 
 It should look to examples of Republican leadership like Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower. These two presidents were men of strength, decency and integrity, qualities sorely lacking in our current Republican hierarchy.Donald Isler Irvington, N.Y., March 29, 2007To the Editor:
 David Brooks's abandonment of the right's antistatism is something that I have long anticipated from a commentator who writes with consistent honesty and acuity. 
 While there is room for disagreement about whether the burden of the state addressed by Senator Barry Goldwater and President Ronald Reagan was the problem Mr. Brooks alleges it was, he seems to have arrived in the liberal camp with his acknowledgment that liberty may be meaningless when it is not enabled by personal and economic security and good health.Edward Bristow New York, March 29, 2007The writer is a professor of history at Fordham University.

HEADLINE: Incomes Rose, As Did Buying In February

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30 

 BODY:
Consumers spent more in February, and construction spending rose by the largest amount in 11 months, the government reported Friday.
 The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending, bolstered by strong income gains, was up 0.6 percent last month, the best showing since December. Personal income also rose by 0.6 percent. Both figures were double what analysts had expected.
In a separate report, the department said that construction spending rose by 0.3 percent last month, the best showing since a 1 percent increase in March 2006. Until the February increase, construction had either fallen or had been flat since the big rise last March. 
 Strong gains in construction of hotels, shopping centers and state and local government projects offset the 11th consecutive decline in residential construction.
 The increase in construction was a surprise. Economists had expected the continued weakness in housing to result in a 0.4 percent decline.
 Housing construction fell by 1 percent after declining 1.7 percent in January, but nonresidential spending rose by 2.3 percent and state and local projects increased 0.6 percent to a record level.
 The strength in consumer incomes and spending and in construction should help to alleviate recession fears that have been growing because of a deeper-than-expected slump in housing and troubles in the domestic auto industry. But analysts said they still expected the economy, which has turned in a sluggish performance for the last year, to slow even further in the first quarter from a lackluster 2.5 percent growth rate in the final three months of 2006. 
 Analysts noted that much of the strength in consumer spending last month reflected higher inflation. After adjusting for price increases in gasoline and other products, consumer spending rose by only 0.2 percent in February.
 The spending report showed that an inflation barometer that excludes energy and food rose by 0.3 percent in February, the biggest increase since a similar rise in August.
 That left core inflation rising by 2.4 percent over the last 12 months, significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's 1 percent to 2 percent comfort zone. The year-over-year increase has not been exceeded since a 2.5 percent jump in April 1995.
 The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told Congress on Wednesday that inflation remained the predominant concern of the central bank but that risks to economic growth had also risen. Mr. Bernanke's testimony dashed hopes in financial markets that the central bank, which has kept interest rates unchanged since last June, might soon move to cut rates in an effort to bolster a faltering economy.
 Mr. Bernanke said the biggest risks to the Fed's forecast for continued economic growth were the housing slump and the possibility that the slowing economy might prompt businesses to cut back on their investment plans.
 The 0.6 percent increase in incomes came after an even bigger 1 percent surge in January. The 0.6 percent rise in consumer spending came after a 0.5 percent January increase and was the largest since a 0.7 percent increase in December, during the holiday shopping season. After adjusting for inflation, the February rise in spending was a more moderate 0.2 percent.
 Even with the rise in incomes, the savings rate remained in negative territory for a 23rd consecutive month. It was unchanged in February at a negative 1.2 percent of after-tax incomes, the same as in January.
 That means that consumers spent more than they earned in February.
