HEADLINE: U.S., Having Won Changes, Is Set to Sign Law of the Sea

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
After two decades of on-again-off-again negotiations, the Administration announced today that it would sign the Law of the Sea treaty, which Republican Administrations have condemned as hostile to free enterprise.
In announcing the decision, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the Administration had negotiated broad changes that make the treaty friendlier to business. 
 The decision is expected to significantly strengthen the treaty, which sets comprehensive rules on sea-bed mining, fishing rights, oil exploration, conservation, scientific research and other matters. Sixty-one countries have ratified the treaty, which takes effect in November.
President Reagan angrily rejected the treaty in 1982, saying it clashed with free-enterprise principles by requiring mining companies to pay hefty royalties and share sophisticated technology with poor countries.
"We have been successful in fixing all the major problems raised by the Reagan Administration," said Wesley Scholz, the chief American negotiator.
Pentagon officials were eager for Washington to ratify the treaty because it guarantees the right to pass through straits and specifies that countries have full sovereignty over the seas within 12 miles of shore. The treaty also gives countries control of fishing and oil and gas rights within 200 miles.
Administration officials said they hoped they could win Senate confirmation, but they acknowledged that some Republicans oppose it.
Conservative groups attacked the treaty today because, they said, even the amended version places too many burdens on business.
"We've taken all these sea issues that could have been solved easily through bilateral agreements and instead we have created this massive superstructure," said Doug Bandow, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, who was a special assistant to President Reagan. "I think the Senate has a duty not to ratify it. This treaty comes out of an era when socialism ruled in the third world and all the talk was redistribution of wealth."
In talks that ended early this month, the Administration persuaded other countries to delay setting royalty payments and to drop production quotas that the treaty set for private sea-bed mining companies.
Mr. Scholz also said that under the amendments, the United States and other industrial nations would have an effective veto over decisions by the International Seabed Authority, to be based in Jamaica.
For more than a year, the Administration has negotiated with more than 50 countries to amend the mining section of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
Testifying to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Christopher said, "It's an extremely important treaty, and I think it's very desirable that we have been able to obtain from the other members satisfactory amendments to the seabed mining provisions that enables us to approve the treaty as a whole."
On other topics today, Mr. Christopher made these points:
*The United States is prepared to return to the Security Council to seek sanctions if North Korea uses coming negotiations to stall for time to continue its nuclear program.
*He will go to the Middle East on July 17 as an intermediary in indirect talks between Syria and Israel.
*Washington supports a war-crimes tribunal to prosecute those responsible for genocide in Rwanda.
 
Basic Premise Disputed
 The Law of the Sea treaty has generated disputes between rich and poor countries because of its underlying premise -- that the oceans and the sea bed are a "common heritage of mankind," to be shared through "a just and equitable economic order."
This premise disturbed President Reagan, but Clinton Administration officials say the amended provisions seek not to redistribute wealth, but to create incentives for sea-bed mining.
Under the amendments, companies would no longer have to pay $1 million a year to explore for minerals on the ocean floor. The Administration, joined by other industrial nations, also persuaded poor countries to drop provisions forcing the transfer of mining technology.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Touches a New Low Against the Yen in Tokyo

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar slid below 98 Japanese yen in trading in Tokyo early today despite efforts by Japan's central bank to prop it up.
The dollar touched a new record low of 97.73 yen , then rebounded to 98.52 yen in early afternoon trading. Earlier in New York yesterday, it settled at 98.49 yen, down from 98.80 yen on Wednesday. 
 Currency dealers in Tokyo said investors were dumping dollars for a variety of reasons, from a swelling United States trade deficit to fears of higher American inflation. Investors are also concerned that the leading economic powers will be unable to agree on a way to support the American currency at a coming meeting.
Intervention by the Bank of Japan did little to stem the fall last night.
 
 
Dollar Up Against Mark
 In New York trading, the yen rallied once again across the board, although the dollar edged up against the German mark and other European currencies. the dollar advanced to 1.5875 marks from 1.5855 marks.
The dollar also managed a slight gain against the British pound. In New York, the pound slipped to $1.5440 from $1.5460. And the Canadian dollar was steady at 72.31 United States cents.
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said he was delaying sanction proceedings against Japan until July 31. The decision was motivated in part by the change in political leadership in Tokyo and by the fact that bilateral trade talks are still underway.
 Traders said the dollar remained under pressure because the postponement of the sanctions did not preclude an escalation in the trade dispute between Washington and Tokyo that would most likely hurt the dollar further.
The worrisome slide of the dollar against the yen and the trade tension between the United States and Japan are seen casting a shadow on the summit of the Group of Seven main industrial nations, scheduled for July 8-10 in Naples.
Analysts have speculated that the nations may consider some coordinated action to shore up the dollar.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen fueled such speculation Thursday, saying lower Japanese and German interest rates would help the dollar and stimulate world economic growth.
 
 
Calling on the Bundesbank
 "I'm not trying to tell the Bundesbank what to do," Mr. Bentsen said. "But, obviously, lower interest rates would help."
Tim McGee, an economist with Tokai Bank Ltd. said, "There still was some hope of some G7 action," largely because of what he called "a yen problem" as much as concern over the dollar's slide.
Mr. McGee noted that the dollar's recent declines should not be interpreted as a crisis because "on a trade-weighted basis, the dollar has actually appreciated," mainly against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners, Canada and Mexico.

HEADLINE: Mayor Presses Revamping School Board

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he would push the city's Board of Education to redistribute many of the powers of its central headquarters to borough offices and local school boards. He said he wanted the changes to begin by September.
His proposals, if adopted, would amount to the most sweeping changes since the 1970 decentralization of the system. The changes include the elimination of some offices and divisions at the board headquarters. 
 Mr. Giuliani's comments on his plans for changing the school governance system were his most extensive since he received a draft report on the subject last week from Edward N. Costikyan, his special adviser on school reform. At the time, Mr. Giuliani and his aides declined to comment on the report, but yesterday, speaking in a telephone interview, the Mayor endorsed "the spirit and direction" of Mr. Costikyan's recommendations and said they would be at the top of his summer agenda.
 
Short of Goals
 Mr. Giuliani said that while his administration had made major progress on issues like reducing crime and rejuvenating the city's economy, it had come up short in changing the school system.
"We could not achieve all we wanted on school governance," he said, "so most of the next three to four months will be spent on that."
Since taking office in January, Mr. Giuliani has effectively controlled the seven-member Board of Education through his influence with its four-member majority. But the death early yesterday of Michael J. Petrides, the board's Staten Island member, has raised uncertainties about the future cohesion of the majority faction. [Obituary, Page A23.]
Mr. Giuliani is not the first mayor to seek a revamping of the city's school system. But he is the first to prepare to use his influence with the Board of Education and his budgetary control to enact a wide-ranging administrative decentralization. Previous mayors have largely limited their efforts to seeking action on legislation in Albany to change the school system.
Mr. Petrides forged the faction two years ago and held it together despite recent tensions between the other three members, Ninfa Segarra, Irene H. Impellizzeri and Carol A. Gresser, the board president. Mr. Petrides had also been a crucial intermediary after Mr. Giuliani's relationship with Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines deteriorated in battles this spring over the school budget.
Mr. Giuliani yesterday called Mr. Petrides's death "a great, great loss to the board."
 
'Points of Compromise'
 "Michael knew how to build consensus," he said. "He had the great ability to see the other side in debate and to see points of compromise."
The Staten Island Borough President, Guy V. Molinari, said yesterday that he would not consider whom to appoint to replace Mr. Petrides on the board after Mr. Petrides's funeral on Saturday. Mr. Molinari is one of Mr. Giuliani's closest supporters, and he will doubtless choose someone supportive of the Mayor's agenda.
Mr. Giuliani, who can also count on the support of his own two new representatives on the board, Ms. Segarra and Dr. Impellizzeri, said he was confident that the board majority would continue to support his positions.
But several educators said the unity of the majority faction after Mr. Petrides's death was not a forgone conclusion.
Although Mr. Giuliani endorsed Mrs. Gresser's re-election for board president, she has declined to commit herself to supporting the Mayor's agenda, and during Mr. Giuliani's public battles with Mr. Cortines over the school budget, she took Mr. Cortines's side. She is also known to believe in the need for a board that is independent of mayoral control.
As for Mr. Cortines, his relations with Mr. Giuliani remain tense, and the Chancellor acknowledged in an interview last week that his own agenda and the Mayor's differ dramatically.
On the board, Mr. Petrides had helped to moderate the differences among Mr. Giuliani, the Chancellor and the board president.
To build consensus for his school revamping proposals, Mr. Giuliani said he planned to meet this summer with the borough presidents, union officials, board members and other political leaders.
"Our plans will be subject to some negotiation," he said.
Also, Mr. Giuliani said he would seek sponsors for legislation in Albany to revise the school system along the lines of the Costikyan report, which calls for abolition of the seven-member board and replacement of the chancellor with a commissioner of education appointed by the mayor.
Mr. Giuliani expressed particular enthusiasm for another recommendation in the report: creation by the board of "a special district for schools ready for school-based and school-budgeted management, free of the oversight of the central bureaucracy."
"What I have my eye on is the flow of the money," Mr. Giuliani said. "What I hope to achieve is that we come out with a governance system that has a much greater flow of money to the schools."
Mr. Giuliani said he hoped that in the next year the board would create the new district and encourage the formation of "30 or 40" new schools that would be independent of the central or any bureaucracy. Similar schools in some parts of the country have been termed charter schools.
 
'Should Be Manageable'
 "These would be schools run by principals and a business officer, with independent budgets they would have to justify each year," he said. "We have 1,100 schools. We should have 1,100 budgets. The schools should be manageable small businesses, with budgets of $8 million or $10 million."
He estimated that it would take three or four years to change the system's structure sufficiently to free large numbers of schools from bureaucratic control.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: BEHIND THE SCENES;
Choices Painful for Hartford Politician

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
In her 14 years in Congress from Hartford, a district where 50,000 people work in insurance, Representative Barbara B. Kennelly of Connecticut has always known how tempting it would be for her colleagues to typecast her as the Congresswoman from Aetna.
So she has worked hard as a member of the Ways and Means Committee to involve herself in other issues, like overhauling welfare, compiling statistics on people attacked in hate crimes and increasing access to mammograms for older women. And she has chosen her shots carefully. 
 The work has paid off: She has as safe a seat as any member, is one of four chief deputy majority whips and is the highest-ranking woman in the House.
But as the committee groped its way through long caucuses and late-night debates toward passage of a health care bill this week, Mrs. Kennelly personified the painful choices faced by House Democrats. She has voted time after time -- giving her final aye today -- for sweeping health insurance changes that are not only guaranteed to anger many of her constituents but are also far from certain to pass in the full House, let alone the more conservative Senate.
 
'Best Judgments'
 "I've spent a great deal of time knowing that I could be looked at as a member of Congress with only one issue," Mrs. Kennelly (pronounced kuh-NELL-ee) said Wednesday in a few stolen moments in the Ways and Means library. "I wasn't going to have people saying, on the biggest bill, 'All of a sudden, she won't give. She's going to stand in cement because this is what they want.' " She acknowledged that some people would be annoyed, but said, "What you try to do is give your best judgments."
Mrs. Kennelly's goal has been to reconcile her longstanding belief in the need for universal health coverage with her desire to preserve an active private insurance industry.
This week, her best judgments included helping to broker a compromise that would delay until at least the year 2001 the imposition of Federal price controls on health care if states exceeded spending limits. The committee's acting chairman, Sam M. Gibbons of Florida, had proposed that the fee schedules take effect in 1999, but Mrs. Kennelly and others wanted to give private competition more time to bring costs under control.
"She's not in the leadership by accident," said Liz Robbins, a lobbyist whose clients have included social welfare and health agencies in New York State and New York City. "People look to Barbara on this stuff. You can count on her to know her stuff and not flinch."
Mrs. Kennelly's vote was important because the committee Republicans gave the bill no support, forcing Mr. Gibbons to muster 20 Democratic votes for every measure. To do that, the committee has retreated into closed party caucuses to thrash out each proposal -- 11 hours on Tuesday alone -- before reappearing for public votes. It is in these private sessions, her colleagues say, that Mrs. Kennelly's personal and political skills have been most apparent.
 
Some Victories
 She won on several fine points. When Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, proposed lowering to 100 employees the threshold at which companies would be allowed to insure themselves, Mrs. Kennelly argued successfully that such companies should also be allowed to buy private insurance based on an "experience rating" of their claims, rather than a broad community rating. If such employers had to pay rates based on an entire community's risk, she contended, they would have strong incentives to insure themselves, leaving private insurers to compete for only the sickest, most risky populations.
Mrs. Kennelly, who will turn 58 on July 10, also secured a provision that would allow mammograms every year for women over 65, instead of one every other year. The original bill called for annual tests only for women between the ages of 50 and 65. "I said, 'I need this one,' " she recalled, noting the increased risks of breast cancer for older women.
 
Born to Politics
 "Her father must have injected her and her mother must have fed her political milk," said former Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro, one of her old friends, "because she really has this sixth sense. Obviously, she's going to be concerned about how something affects her district, but she looks at the bigger picture."
Indeed, Mrs. Kennelly has been surrounded by politicians her whole life. Her father was John Bailey, the legendary Connecticut Democratic boss and chairman of the Democratic National Committee under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. She is married to James J. Kennelly, a former Speaker of the Connecticut House. Her first political job was as a member of the Hartford City Council, and she went on to become Secretary of State for Connecticut, bucking the party's pick to win the nomination and then an easy general election. She won her House seat in a special election in 1981, after the death of the longtime incumbent.
Mrs. Kennelly speaks quickly but quietly. Even in a casual conversation, she refers to her colleagues with exquisite but unforced formality as "Mrs. Johnson" and "Dr. McDermott." She was the first woman on the House Intelligence Committee and is now the senior woman on Ways and Means, and she was picked by Speaker Thomas S. Foley as a chief deputy whip in 1991. She has often been touted as a potential candidate for Governor of Connecticut, but she decided last fall to pass up the chance. Next year, she will run for vice chairman of the Democratic caucus, but she laughingly deflected questions about that, saying members have other things on their minds.
"She's in a special spot" because of pressures in her district, said a committee colleague, Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan. "She has been courageous and strong, and won and deserves the respect of the group."
Mrs. Kennelly put it tersely: "You're never going to make everybody happy. That's how I've kept the respect of the committee. They know I won't be a flack without policy reasons."

YESTERDAY
 
CONGRESS
 
The House
 The Ways and Means Committee, the most influential House committee in the health care debate, passed a measure meeting President Clinton's goal of universal coverage and requiring employers to pay most of the cost of insuring their workers. But the margin of victory was slim, 20-18, and strictly along party lines, suggesting that passage of a similar measure in the full House would require party discipline it will be difficult for Democrats to maintain.
 Republicans engineered a vote on Clinton's original 1,342-page Health Security Act. After an occasionally angry debate, 19 Democrats voted present; 3 Democrats and all 14 Republicans voted no.
 
The Senate
 In a blow to the White House, the Finance Committee rejected a plan proposed by its chairman, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, that would have required employers to provide coverage to workers if changes in insurance regulations did not produce universal coverage by 1999.
 Instead, it adopted by a vote of 12-8, a proposal to let a National Health Commission recommend remedies to Congress if 95 percent of Americans are not insured by 2002. The plan would seek to force Congress to vote on any recommendations.
 On this issue and on others, the committee reluctantly followed proposals made Friday by a bipartisan group headed by Senator John H. Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, and John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat.
 
The White House
 President Clinton called the Ways and Means Committee's action "a giant stride forward."
 He attacked a proposal by Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, that would alter insurance regulation and offer some subsidies to make insurance easier to obtain and more affordable for the very poor. Mr. Dole's proposal, supported by 39 of the 44 Senate Republicans, "is politics as usual," Mr. Clinton said today.

HEADLINE: Victory Over the Doubters;
Once, Whitman's Budget Plan Was Ridiculed. Now Other Governors Follow Her Lead.

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 30

 BODY:
Christine Todd Whitman, the Governor of New Jersey, has an admirer who will never vote for her -- unless she runs for President.
It's George E. Pataki, the Putnam County State Senator and Republican aspirant for governor in New York. Mr. Pataki is consulting with Mrs. Whitman on campaign issues and has all but embraced her program as his own. 
 A New York pol crossing the Hudson seeking advice? What more satisfying tribute could a Jersey governor ask?
"She's doing the right thing, she's doing it well, and it's something that we're going to have to emulate," Mr. Pataki declared. Even Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, seeking a fourth term, has adopted a Whitmanesque kindliness to business as a mantra.
 
'It's About Keeping Promises'
 In her first year, Mrs. Whitman has delivered the cuts in taxes, state spending and state agencies that have made her a role model for Republicans across the country as well as across the river. In the 38 races for governor under way this year, Republicans and even some Democrats are campaigning on similar platforms. Governor Whitman did not create this new tide in American politics, but she was quick to capture the wave.
Today, as she signed her first state budget into law, flanked by the Legislature's Republican majority leadership, Governor Whitman wasted no time in declaring victory over the scoffers and doubters who nine months ago, as she campaigned for governor, disparaged her proposed budget cuts as irresponsible and undoable.
"This budget is about doing what I said I would do," Governor Whitman declared at the signing. "It's about keeping promises."
Other governors have imitated Mrs. Whitman's politics and policies right down to the catch phrases. "Virginia is open for business," Gov. George F. Allen intoned before a Republican audience two weeks ago, five months after Mrs. Whitman had made "New Jersey is open for business" her slogan. On the stage with Mr. Allen, she could only smile.
"She's leading the parade," said Steven D. Gold, an expert on state government at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute in Albany. "She's the new kid on the block, and her ideas that government needs to be smaller and smarter sound right to people."
 
Other States Consider Cuts
 As late as last September, the state's first female Governor was being written off by the political establishment as a stumbling, amateurish candidate, clutching at an outlandish plan to slash state taxes. But following in her wake, at least 19 other states, including Connecticut and New York, have enacted or are considering tax cuts this year, Mr. Gold's research indicates. Eleven of the states are headed by Republican governors.
Mrs. Whitman's $15.3 billion budget reduces income taxes by 10 percent, or $285 million, the first full installment of her promised, and once much derided, 30 percent rate cut over three years. It cuts 400 state jobs, out of 65,000, and eliminates the Department of Higher Education, freeing state colleges to be more self-governing, and the Office of the Public Advocate, which represented citizens suing the state.
By all accounts, it was the easiest installment to deliver. Jim Florio, her Democrat predecessor, helped by leaving a $400 million surplus. And stymied by a Republican legislature, he also hurt by borrowing heavily to finance his initiatives. The state's direct debt service will more than quadruple to $400 million next year.
On her way to today's achievement, Governor Whitman rolled over feeble objections from the Democratic minorities in both legislative houses, who voted in bloc against the spending plan but never found an effective way to oppose tax cuts. She ignored noisy protests by public employee unions, which predict that her reductions in state pension financing will haunt future governors and future taxpayers. Indeed, she may have welcomed the protests as reinforcing her image as a fighter against entrenched interests.
 
'Will Have to Be Paid Back'
 Some people nevertheless believe the state employees had a point.
"She is stealing from the pension fund, which will have to be paid back by future governors who will have to be braver than she is," said Richard C. Leone, a Democrat and former New Jersey State Treasurer. In effect, he said, since by law Mrs. Whitman could not propose a state budget in deficit, she bridged the gap by diverting pension contributions.
"I do not think it shows you anything about character or philosophy to do popular things without doing the unpopular things that pay the bills," added Mr. Leone, who headed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey during Governor Florio's term.
Mrs. Whitman, of course, has heard for nine months the charge that her economics do not add up, beginning with the chorus of derision that greeted her original tax cut proposal last September.
Business leaders, now her champions, then worried that the tax cuts would simply shift taxes to localities -- and that yet may happen. Newspapers editorialized against the program as shabby electioneering. Mr. Florio, who had sharply increased taxes to cover a looming shortfall and help the cities, derided his opponent by waving her three-page tax cut program in the breeze as a visual proof of its insubstantiality.
Studiously gracious, Mrs. Whitman spurns any credit for the wave of tax-cutting that grips the imaginations of so many politicians. She notes that two other Republican Governors, William F. Weld of Massachusetts and John M. Engler of Michigan, preceded her in trimming spending. In fact, Mr. Gold pointed out, states frequently cut tax rates as their economies recover from recession, as is occurring now, just as they raise taxes to cover income shortfalls during recessions.
 
A Center of National Attention
 "For a while, New York was to some extent protected from further job losses because of Florio's tax increases, which made business take a second look at moving to New Jersey," Mr. Pataki said. "Governor Whitman's emphasis on economic competitiveness is going to restore New Jersey's edge, and I think it just makes it clear that if we want to restore economic competitiveness in New York, we will at least have to follow suit."
With her iron-clad ideas and air of faint amusement at the interest she has excited, Mrs. Whitman becomes a center of attention at national events like the National Governor's Association meetings in Washington. When the governors meet in July in Boston, she is expected to play a prominent role.
She is seen as moderate on social issues, a supporter of abortion rights, proudly but pleasantly feminist, a personable campaigner from a midsize industrial state. Her name has begun to pop up in Republican discussions of future national tickets. Though she publicly scoffs at that ambition, she has done nothing to discourage her national prominence. She has been a frequent guest on Washington political talk shows, and George Will, the conservative columnist, ventured to Trenton to extol her philosophy.
 
A Powell-Whitman Ticket?
 This talk got louder when William Kristol, the Republican Party theoretician, proposed pairing Mrs. Whitman as vice president with retired General Colin L. Powell at the head of a Republican "dream" presidential ticket.
In May, when the General and the Governor addressed a business conference in Princeton, General Powell joked, "Let's see, am I supposed to call you, or are you supposed to call me?" Later the General sent Mrs. Whitman a note, saying he had enjoyed the meeting -- and included his telephone number.
Mrs. Whitman, who has campaigned for Republican tickets going back to 1952 (as a young girl, she sold lemonade to benefit Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon), is a walking melange of modern Republicanism. Relaxed and approachable, she combines the assurance of a Nelson A. Rockefeller with the minimalist-government religion of Ronald Reagan. On occasion her complicated syntax brings back memories of President Eisenhower.
Mrs. Whitman, whose inner circle is notably but not exclusively female, has brought more women into the state's executive branch than any previous governor. Her staff says she is easy to work with, rarely vexed, though that ease may reflect the on-stage amiability that is second nature to a woman who was raised in wealth and who cherishes such freedom and privacy as public life permits, sometimes eluding her state trooper security escort. She spends most nights at home on her farm in Somerset, rather than in the governor's mansion outside Princeton.
 
Policy Off the Cuff
 Mrs. Whitman has won all this prominence less than six months into what is only her second elected office. She was once a Somerset County freeholder. She has yet to do enough in public life, good or bad, to reveal a genuine political philosophy. As Governor, she sometimes seems to create policy off the cuff, as she did when she responded to anti-Semitic remarks by a Nation of Islam leader by suggesting that everyone see "Schindler's List," a movie about the Holocaust.
As yet, she has experienced no state crisis acute enough to test her equanimity, her canniness or her command over the gears of government. No one in the Legislature seems to fear her. No legislator has yet tested whatever appetite she might have for getting even. In surveys, her approval ratings are high and notably few voters voice disapproval of her performance.
Mrs. Whitman has never presented herself as a political intellectual. Her stance on answering New Jersey's problems with enduring economic development is garden-variety suburban Republicanism: "One of the reasons this is an expensive state for business is, obviously, that we're heavily unionized, which has been very successful in protecting union membership but that also has a cost in doing business," the Governor said in an interview this week.
"We're also the most densely populated state, our property costs are high, and we've had this attitude that we can be even tougher than the national Government on some regulations, which unfortunately has not resulted in something that is better for the population of the state."
As for her goals -- and for next year's budget plan, the first that will be entirely her own -- Mrs. Whitman often reaches for the opaque language of corporate management and big-business Republicanism, a world where she and her family, with its considerable wealth, are quite comfortable.
"I won't call it reinventing government, because that's overused," she said when asked to look ahead. "It's reconstituting government, putting departments on performance-based budgeting, starting to set goals, making intelligent programmatic choices. All of those initiatives have got to be part of the overall direction of this administration."
At the same time, the Governor will face new problems that will make squeezing another quarter-billion dollars in income tax cuts all the harder. Not only will the state's debt payments quadruple in the coming year, but the deadline for compliance with Federal clean air rules (which New Jersey is far from achieving) also approaches, and state courts are expected to order a large increase in state aid to urban school districts.

HEADLINE: Ferrer Urges HUD to Revise Aid Plan in Bronx's Favor

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
Making an end run around Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and a powerful Harlem Congressman, Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx appealed directly to the Clinton Administration yesterday to include more of the Bronx in an "empowerment zone" New York City has proposed as a target area for Federal aid.
Mr. Ferrer's bid is a direct challenge to Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, the fourth-ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, who wrote the legislation creating the Federal empowerment-zone program and whose district is expected to benefit most from the grant it hopes to win. 
 Having failed to get the distressed Bronx neighborhoods of Mott Haven and Melrose included in the city's proposed empowerment zone, Mr. Ferrer and Jose E. Serrano, the Democratic Congressman who represents the South Bronx, asked Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to alter the New York officials' proposal -- which was the product of lengthy negotiations -- in favor of his own plan.
The request was seen yesterday as a brash gambit by Mr. Ferrer that mayoral aides said could scuttle New York's chances of getting any grant. Mr. Ferrer's proposal arrived in Washington on the deadline for cities to apply to the program. It came after months of negotiations among Mr. Rangel, Mayor Giuliani and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo that produced the boundaries of the city's proposed empowerment zone.
 
Pressing His Case
 A spokesman for Mayor Giuliani, Forrest R. Taylor, said that if Mr. Ferrer persisted in pressing his case in Washington, "he runs the risk of creating confusion and thereby jeopardizing the entire city application when it arrives in Washington."
Mr. Taylor said that before Mr. Giuliani became Mayor the agreement between Mr. Rangel and then-Mayor David N. Dinkins included none of the Bronx in the empowerment zone. Mr. Giuliani reopened the discussions to include the area around Yankee Stadium and the industrial strips of Port Morris and Hunts Point, giving the Bronx about 16 percent of the proposed zone.
Mr. Rangel brushed aside Mr. Ferrer's bid for the attention of Washington officials. "I drafted the legislation," he said. "These are not applications in which borough presidents and city councilmen can say, 'Include me.' "
Mr. Ferrer noted that the announcement of the awards was expected just around the time Mr. Rangel was up for re-election. And Mr. Rangel, in turn, suggested that Mr. Ferrer, who is often mentioned as a possible mayoral contender, might simply be seeking media attention with his proposal.
But Mr. Ferrer said he was simply trying to stick up for the Bronx. And he said he thought he was making headway with Mr. Cisneros and officials in the Housing Secretary's office, with whom he said he had had frequent discussions.
"My impression is they are very receptive to the fact that the poorest of the poor are being left out," he said.
Mr. Ferrer said that the zone proposed by the city included the area around the home of the richest franchise in baseball, but not the most distressed neighborhoods in the Bronx.
As with Mr. Rangel, there was flexing of political prowess by Mr. Ferrer yesterday.
Ticking off his recent successes -- the resurrection of a dying plan to build a new police academy in the Bronx and the staving off of a city attempt to alter the design of a large housing development in the Bronx -- Mr. Ferrer suggested that he was on a roll that might continue with a victory in the empowerment-zone fight.
"I'm beginning to think the Yankees are having a good season," Mr. Ferrer said. "I'm beginning to think I'm having a pretty good season too. I doesn't hurt to have the merits on your side."
The Federal Empowerment Zone program is the centerpiece of the Clinton Administration's urban redevelopment agenda. Under that program, the Federal Government will designate six urban areas in the country as eligible for $100 million each in social-service grants and tax breaks for employers who hire local residents.
In Mr. Ferrer's proposal to Mr. Cisneros -- which is backed up with three bound volumes of data, maps and community comments -- the Borough President asks that neighborhoods with about 25,000 people to be included in the zone.
That would mean either taking some areas of Harlem and the Yankee Stadium area out of the zone, or waiving the 200,000-person limit set by the Federal Government for each empowerment zone. Under Mr. Ferrer's proposal, the number of Bronx residents covered by the zone would increase to 59,000 from 33,000.
In applying for the zone designations, officials were asked to design a strategy to address a range of problems, including employment, the environment, housing and recreation. In New York, the Federal funds intended for the empowerment zone are expected to be supplemented by $100 million each from the city and the state.
Yesterday, the state seemed to be one player in the equation not miffed by Mr. Ferrer's action. Alan Sullivan, the executive deputy director of the State Department of Economic Development, said the state would be happy if the Federal Government waived the 200,000-person limit and if the zone could include both Mr. Ferrer's request and Mr. Rangel.
Mr. Sullivan said he was not offended by Mr. Ferrer's request. "Freddie's an effective communicator and he wants to communicate directly with the people who are making the decisions," he said. "Who can tell Freddie what to say?"

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Drop To Nearly 6-Week Low

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday to their lowest in nearly six weeks after stronger-than-expected economic data and a continuing slide in the dollar.
The economic reports, which showed faster growth, renewed concerns of rising inflation and higher interest rates. The selling of government securities intensified as the dollar was again battered in the global currency markets, said traders. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 11/32 , to 846/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 7.61 percent, from 7.50 percent on Wednesday, and the highest since May 9, when it was 7.63 percent. The long bond's yield, however, is still in its three-month trading range, traders noted. But it is close.
 
Speculation of a Rate Rise
 Greg Jones, an economist for MMS International, a market research and analysis firm, said the economic data and weakness in the dollar raised speculation of an iminent interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve.
"While the reports themselves were in fact stronger than expected, they were not terrible," he said. "Some price components captured the market's attention and raised the concern of some investors about future inflation." For instance, the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago report's index of manufacturing fell to 65.6 in June from 67.3 in May and 67.6 in April. The association's June index of prices paid by manufacturers surged to 69.7 from 63.6 in May. Analysts say a reading of above 50 is consistent with economic expansion.
The combination of continued strength in the purchasing management report, and the Conference Board's help wanted index, up 6 points in May to 123, which made some people nervous about next week's employment report, helped to keep bonds on the defensive.
Mr. Jones said an increase in interest rates by the Fed would come sooner, rather than later, and the increase could be as much as 50 basis points. "Our bet has been for a 25- basis-point hike, but the dollar's weakness has increased the risk of a 50-basis-point hike," he said. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
Much of the weakness in bonds yesterday was caused by investors and dealers trading on expectations of what could happen next week. The Fed's policy-making committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, and the employment report for June will be released on Friday, which should give a clue about the strength of the economy.
In addition to the strength in some economic data, Treasury prices also came under pressure from a jump in precious metals, which pushed the Commodity Research Bureau index, a basket of 21 commodity prices, up by 1.01 point, to 230.39. Oil prices surged as the war in Yemen threatened to disrupt production and supplies. The Public Securities Association, the main trade group for the public debt industry, recommended that the government securities market close at 2 P.M. today in observance of the Fourth of July holiday.
Elsewhere, municipal bonds were little changed or lower, with investors holding back from making any purchases while Treasury prices are on the decline. Traders said many investors were even hesitant about selling with a drop in supply expected.
The Bond Buyer reported yesterday that the amount of new tax-exempt bonds scheduled to be sold in the next 30 days was down to $2.49 billion, the lowest this year.

HEADLINE: Incomes in U.S. Advanced by 0.6% in May

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
The income of Americans rose for the fourth consecutive month in May and spending nearly kept pace, the Government said today. A separate report showed that factory orders increased for the month.
The reports, along with the latest data on claims for jobless benefits, demonstrated that the economy expanded at a comfortable pace this spring, analysts said. 
 "The basic message is that the economy has downshifted to a slower growth pace," said Robert Dederick, an economist with the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "I think the consumer will come back. But the great spurt is behind us."
The Commerce Department reported that Americans' personal income rose six-tenths of 1 percent in May -- as it did in April -- helped by job growth, a longer average workweek and higher hourly earnings.
Consumer spending increased four-tenths of 1 percent, slightly higher than anticipated, after dipping a revised four-tenths of 1 percent in April. Spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, has risen in 12 of the last 14 months.
Incomes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.71 trillion in May from $5.67 trillion in April. Spending was up to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.61 trillion from $4.59 trillion.
Disposable income -- income after taxes -- rose 1.2 percent above the April rate. April's figure was down because of a new Federal law that required the wealthiest Americans to make retroactive tax payments by April 15 of about $30 billion at an annual rate.
The combination of incomes and spending meant that Americans' savings rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable income -- climbed to 4.7 percent in May from 3.9 percent in April. But analysts said the latest figure was misleading because of the timing of the tax payments.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said today that the number of initial applications for state unemployment benefits was unchanged last week from the previous week. A seasonally adjusted 353,000 people filed first-time claims in the week that ended on June 25.
"Once again, the economic data indicate the U.S. economy is not overheating but instead growing at a pace consistent with stable inflation," Donald Straszheim and Bruce Steinberg, economists with Merrill Lynch & Company, said in a statement.
In the manufacturing sector, the Commerce Department said orders to United States factories rose six-tenths of 1 percent in May, after a revised two-tenths of 1 percent increase in April.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Investors Finance a Trump Project

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
A group of Hong Kong investors stepped in yesterday with the money that Donald J. Trump needs to begin building the first towers of Riverside South, a project that could profoundly alter the Upper West Side of Manhattan by creating homes for thousands of wealthy residents on what is now an abandoned riverfront rail yard.
Construction could start within a year, Mr. Trump said yesterday after he signed a financing deal and joint-venture agreement with a consortium that includes the New World Development Company Ltd., headed by Y. T. Cheng and his son, Henry, and the Shui On Group Ltd., headed by Vincent Lo. 
 "Now, we're at the really productive level," Mr. Trump said, 10 years after he took control of the 75-acre site along the Hudson River, from 59th to 72d Street.
The new "multi-billion-dollar joint venture" -- the partners would be no more specific about the amounts of money involved -- represents a high-profile plunge into the New York market by Hong Kong investors.
"We've traveled to various cities," said Daniel K. S. Yiu, president of Polylinks International Ltd. of Hong Kong, which advises private and public companies, including New World. "With all the potential, the people, the demographics, we really think that New York can't be substituted."
Their arrival is not only crucial for Mr. Trump, who has been struggling to emerge from millions of dollars of debt, but is also a "solid vote of confidence in New York City," Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said.
"Development of Riverside South will mean the creation of thousands of construction jobs at a time when that industry is at nearly 50 percent unemployment," Mr. Giuliani said in a statement released by his press office. "It will create thousands of permanent jobs and will brings hundreds of millions of dollars in sales and other tax revenues to the city."
Mr. Trump and his new partners said no final decision had been made on which parcels would be developed first, or how many. For now, they said, they are contemplating a mix of rental buildings and one condominium tower for the opening phase.
Under plans approved by city officials in 1992, there may ultimately be 5,700 apartments in 16 towers. At least 12 percent of the housing must be set aside for moderate- and low-income residents. There would be 1.8 million square feet of commercial space at the southern end of the site. A waterfront park would be built in phases, along with construction of the towers.
"We have no intention whatsoever of changing the original plans," Mr. Yiu said.
 
Money Talks, but Quietly
 The developers would not disclose anything about the amounts of money involved in yesterday's deal, citing a confidentiality agreement with the Chase Manhattan Bank, which holds the mortgage on the property. Mr. Trump would say only, "Essentially the mortgage has been purchased by this group, so we don't have any debt."
Mr. Yiu said the Polylinks group was formed a little over a year ago to look for investment opportunities in the United States, particularly in New York, San Francisco and Honolulu. New World bought the Renaissance hotel chain in 1989 and the Stouffer hotel chain last year.
"We put more of a focus on New York," Mr. Yiu said. He said Polylinks has already purchased large blocks of condominium apartments in Park Avenue Court, at Lexington Avenue and 86th Street, and the Horizon, at First Avenue and 37th Street.
Because of the size of Riverside South, Polylinks sought other investors as well, including Shui On, a diversified company involved in hotels, construction and development; the Edward Wong Group, and the Far Eastern Consortium Ltd., whose holdings include the Warwick Hotel, at Avenue of the Americas and 54th Street.
Frankie Y. L. Wong, a group managing director of Shui On, attended yesterday's signing, along with Mr. Yiu. Afterward, he said: "New York is coming out of the recession. So is the United States. We see a big potential for property development."
When asked what attracted Shui On to Riverside South, Mr. Wong simply pointed across the room to Mr. Trump. "You see him there," he said.
But Mr. Wong also said the sheer size of Riverside South made it unusual. "You don't find such large-scale projects easily in New York or in the United States," he said.
Until the arrival of the Hong Kong investors, it was not exactly clear how Mr. Trump would realize his $3 billion vision for the old Penn Yards site, given the debt he was carrying.
But yesterday, he said he was "just about finished" retiring that debt, crediting in part the income from his Atlantic City casinos and hotels, which he said "have broken every record" in the last two years.
For Riverside South, Mr. Trump and his partners may take advantage of the "80-20" mixed-income housing program. Tax-exempt bonds are available to finance projects in which 20 percent of the units are set aside for lower-income tenants, with the other 80 percent available at market rates.
Mr. Trump's original plan for the site was something far grander: Trump City, which was to have had 7,600 apartments, a regional shopping mall and the tallest building in the world.
This highly unpopular proposal was withdrawn in 1991, after Mr. Trump entered into an unusual alliance with several civic, neighborhood and environmental groups, including the Municipal Art Society and the Parks Council: the very people he had been battling over Trump City. Under the name Riverside South Planning Corporation, this alliance devised the new plan.
Although Riverside South was opposed by the local community board and the local Councilwoman, Ronnie M. Eldridge, it was approved by Borough President Ruth W. Messinger and the City Planning Commission. It passed the City Council in December 1992.
The executive director of the Parks Council, Linda Davidoff, said about yesterday's deal: "The financial wizardry involved is beyond my ken. But the net result -- that an investor is prepared to build -- is thrilling and a great step forward in building a new and marvelous waterfront on the West Side of Manhattan."
There are still many critics of the project. Among their concerns is that Riverside South would add to the already overtaxed North River Sewage Treatment Plant in Harlem. A group led by the Coalition for a Livable West Side has filed suit in Federal court seeking to prevent further hookups to the North River sewage treatment plant and another one on Wards Island.
Mr. Yiu said yesterday that the investors had reached "a certain comfort level that this issue can be resolved over time as the project moves along."
Mr. Wong added that "city officials have already done a lot to reduce the flow, so there is a lot of capacity."

HEADLINE: U.S. Closer to End of Ban On Alaska Oil Exports

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration moved closer yesterday to recommending that the ban on exporting oil from the North Slope of Alaska be lifted, issuing a study that showed that such exports would create jobs and stimulate domestic production.
Hazel R. O'Leary, the Secretary of Energy, cautioned, however, that some trade issues would first have to be resolved before Congress could be asked to lift the 1973 ban. 
 The study by the Energy Department concluded that if the ban was lifted, Alaskan crude could be exported to Asian nations -- Japan, in particular -- creating thousands of jobs and stimulating new investment and production in Alaska and California. These gains could be attained without increasing gasoline prices on the West Coast, the report said.
 
Looking to Japan for Sales
 Japan, which imports all its oil at the rate of about 4.38 million barrels a day, would be the most likely foreign customer of Alaskan crude, the report said.
"The energy and economic issues clearly compel lifting the ban," Mrs. O'Leary said.
Yesterday's statements were the strongest yet from the Secretary in favor of lifting the ban, which she described as an "economic anomaly" left over from the energy crisis of 1973. The Administration has indicated in the past that it supports lifting the ban, and in a recent meeting with lawmakers from energy states, President Clinton said he would favor ending the ban if trade issues could be resolved.
Mrs. O'Leary said the Administration would have to resolve whether the exported oil would continue to be shipped on American vessels, using American crews, as required by law. Such a requirement, aimed at preserving maritime jobs, could complicate attempts by the Administration to ease trade restrictions with other nations.
The 1973 ban was included in the law authorizing the construction of the Alaskan pipeline and was aimed at cutting the nation's dependence on imported oil. Limiting the oil for domestic use was also a concession to environmentalists, who had opposed the pipeline.
But the chief effect of the ban, yesterday's report said, has been to provide California refiners with crude oil cheaper than oil on the world market. The Deputy Energy Secretary, William H. White, said yesterday that the ban created "a subsidy" for California refiners that had not been passed on to consumers.
Lifting the ban would raise Alaska crude prices to world market levels, which should attract investment to Alaska's oil fields, where production has been falling.
The Energy Department said it was concerned about the increasing loss of jobs in the domestic energy industry as many oil companies have been and are cutting back on domestic production and shifting investment into exploration abroad.
Lifting the ban is expected to help in particular small independent oil refiners in California, which buy crude on the open market.
Carol Currie, a spokeswoman for the California Independent Petroleum Association, a trade group, said that the smaller producers have lost about 32,000 jobs in the last nine years.
Some oil economists and California refiners have challenged the assumption that the price of crude would rise in California if the ban on exports from the North Slope of Alaska is lifted. They have argued that there is now little difference between the world price and prices for crude coming from California fields.
The Energy Department's study also found that no environmental problems would be created by lifting the ban. It noted that the Clinton Administration remained firm in opposing exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

HEADLINE: Bail Denied In Slaying Of 2 Children

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J., June 30

 BODY:
A father charged with slaying his two children while they were on a weekend visit to his home pleaded not guilty today in New Jersey Superior Court here.
Judge Sybil Moses ordered the father, Avi Kostner, 50, of Teaneck, held without bail. She denied bail because, she said, John J. Fahy, the Bergen County prosecutor, is considering seeking the death penalty if Mr. Kostner is convicted. 
 Law-enforcement officials are exploring the possibility that the children were drugged before they were slain, Mr. Fahy said. He said further tests were being done to determine if they were drugged.
He said the bodies of the children, Geri Beth Kostner, 12, and her brother Ryan, 10, showed no sign of injury or struggle, suggesting they were unconscious when they were killed by suffocation last Sunday.
Autopsies have determined that Geri Beth was murdered about 4 A.M. and Ryan at 1 P.M. Their bodies were found about 9 P.M. Sunday under a sleeping bag in the rear seat of an Isuzu Trooper parked behind the Teaneck Police Headquarters. Their father was at the wheel.
 
Treated for Depression
 Mr. Kostner is unemployed and under treatment for depression.
During his brief arraignment, Mr. Kostner's eyes welled up for a few seconds and he sniffed twice. But he remained calm and composed during the hearing and answered "Yes" firmly to Judge Moses' questions about his understanding of his legal rights. The judge also ordered a psychiatric evaluation.
Mr. Kostner's acquaintances have said he was disturbed that his former wife, Lynn Mison, of Wayne, N.J., had planned to move to Florida with the children on July 1. Since Mr. Kostner and Ms. Mison were divorced in 1988, they have fought in the courts about custody, visiting rights, child support and how the children would be raised.
Whether the children were suffocated with bare hands or with a plastic bag, pillow or other object remains uncertain, Mr. Fahy said. Where the children were killed and their whereabouts in the hours before their deaths also remains a mystery, Mr. Fahy said.

HEADLINE: Blue-Chip Stocks Tumble; Dow Skids 42.09

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market closed mixed, but sharply lower for blue-chip stocks yesterday, as the turbulent second quarter ended and Wall Street professionals headed out of town for the long Fourth of July weekend.
Bond yields approached the record-high levels of May, coaxing money away from stocks and exacerbating the fall in stock prices. 
 Other factors were also at work. Commodities prices rose, inflaming traders' inflation fears, and the dollar continued to fall against the yen, discouraging foreign investors.
 
Bonds More Appealing
 But with the leap of the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 7.61 percent, fixed-income instruments are now an attractive alternative to stocks.
"I can just see people calling in on their cellular phones from the Hamptons," a popular weekend spot for New Yorkers, said Harrison Roth, senior options strategist for Cowen & Company. "They ask how the long bond is doing and they yell, 'What do you mean it's 7.6!' "
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.09 points, to 3,624.96, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index declined 3.36 points, to 444.27. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 1.95 points, to 705.96.
The volume on the New York Stock Exchange was about normal, with 293.4 million shares changing hands, but the volume may have been lifted by the expiration of a variety of stock options tied to the S.& P. 500. Exercising options requires the purchase or sale of shares.
In connection with the options expiration, the New York Stock Exchange counted large sell-side order imbalances for at least six companies, the largest of which was United Healthcare, at 1.5 million shares.
United Healthcare, an operator of health maintenance organizations, was the exchange's most-active stock yesterday, with 8.4 million shares changing hands. Its price dropped 2 3/4, to 45 1/8; other H.M.O. stocks like U.S. Healthcare fell as well.
The industry fears an "any willing provider" provision passed by the House Ways and Means committee yesterday, which might hurt the industry's ability to control costs by restricting access to select doctors and hospitals.
 
CBS Soars on Merger Talk
 Blue-chips stocks like I.B.M. and conglomerates like Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing fell. But over-the-counter stocks like Microsoft and QVC Network rose.
CBS, which is negotiating a merger with QVC , saw its shares rise 50, to 313, after an initial delay in the trading of its stock.
The dollar continued its fall. It declined to another post-1945 low of 98.49 yen, from 98.80 yen at the close in New York on Wednesday. But it rose to 1.5875 German marks from 1.5855 marks. While stock traders, at least for now, do not seem as concerned as before about the dollar, it remains important. A weak dollar makes dollar-denominated assets like stocks less attractive, particularly to foreigners.
The Commodity Research Bureau index rose 1.01 points, to 230.39, led by rising futures contracts for silver, cocoa, and copper. Also, crude oil set for August delivery rose 54 cents, to $19.37 a barrel, in part because of a civil war in Yemen that might disrupt that country's modest output of oil. The demand for crude oil is rising.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.56 points, from 245.16, with declining stocks outnumbering advancers, 1,275 to 951. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.60 point, to 424.08.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 25 fell, led by Caterpillar, which dropped 2 1/8, to 100. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 313 fell, led by General Electric, which fell 1, to 46 5/8.

HEADLINE: $2.7 Billion Merger for Big Railroads

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
In a move that would create the nation's largest railroad, Burlington Northern Inc. and the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation yesterday announced a plan to merge. The new railroad, with a reach even more expansive than its name, would be called the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company.
The proposed merger calls for a stock swap valued at $2.7 billion. The owners of Santa Fe and Burlington Northern stock must approve the transaction. The deal must also be approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, which may not make a decision until late next year at the earliest. 
 The merger would create a company with more than $7.1 billion of revenue and 31,000 miles of track in the Midwest, Southeast and West. The companies have not determined how their combined 45,000 employees would be affected or where the combined company would be based.
 
 
A Merger Trend
 The two companies' desire to join forces adds new life to a consolidation trend that has reshaped the railroad industry since it was deregulated in 1980. In an effort to cut costs, many railroads have merged to achieve economies of scale and more efficient operations that cover vast swaths of the country.
"Ever since we have been deregulated, we sink or swim based on our product, and customers want as broad a product range as possible," said Robert D. Krebs, the chairman of Santa Fe who would be president and chief executive of the merged company. The parent of the merged railroads would be called the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation.
Gerald Grinstein, chairman and chief executive of Burlington Northern, would be chairman of the merged company.
Industry analysts said the two railroads would help each other in several ways. Santa Fe, based in Schaumburg, Ill., specializes in intermodal services, which involves moving goods by rail to be delivered locally by truck. That business is growing fast but has low profit margins. Burlington Northern, based in Fort Worth, carries heavy commodities like coal, grain and timber, a business with higher margins but slower growth.
"It's a complementary mix for both entities," said Thomas M. Galvin, a transportation stock analyst at C. J. Lawrence.
Santa Fe's rail lines also stretch into Mexico and Burlington Northern also operates in Canada, thus brightening the combined company's prospects for winning business from customers taking advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
 
 
'Little Overlap'
 "The combination of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe is a predominantly end-to-end merger that will benefit shippers and the public," Mr. Grinstein said. "There is very little overlap between our rail systems." That fact improves the companies' chances of winning approval from the commerce commission, analysts said.
The Union Pacific Railroad Company, based in Omaha, is currently the nation's largest railroad, with $4.85 billion in revenues last year.
The most recent attempted railroad merger of comparable size was in 1983, when Santa Fe sought to buy the Southern Pacific Company in a stock swap valued at $5.2 billion. The commerce commission reviewed the application for five years, then rejected the proposed merger on antitrust grounds.
Yesterday, Standard & Poor's raised its ratings outlook on Santa Fe and Burlington Northern and on their railroads to "positive" from "stable," citing the broader and more diversified commodity mix of the combined companies. Shares of Burlington Northern fell 12.5 cents, to $53.375, on the New York Stock Exchange. Santa Fe shares rose 25 cents, to $20.625.
 
 
Another Railroad for Sale
 For now, the two railroads' decision removes them from consideration as the most likely suitors for Kansas City Southern, the nation's 12th-largest railroad. Its parent, Kansas City Southern Industries, said in May that it was considering selling its railroad so it could focus more on mutual funds and other financial services. Mr. Krebs and Mr. Grinstein said yesterday that they would be too focused on shepherding their merger proposal to consider other possible acquisitions.
Mr. Krebs said Santa Fe had been considering a merger partner for more than two years out of concern that it lacked the geographical coverage to be competitive as the industry evolved.
Burlington Northern was the first choice because of its route network, but Santa Fe had been hamstrung in pursuing a merger until recently because it operated a gold subsidiary that Burlington Northern did not want. Santa Fe recently spun off that subsidiary.
The executives said there had been little discussion about which railroad's name would come first in the new company's name. After all, Burlington Northern is about twice the size of Santa Fe.
"It really wasn't an item of disagreement," Mr. Grinstein said. "We didn't even flip a coin."

HEADLINE: 30 Drown as Haitian Police Fire on Refugees

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, June 30

 BODY:
A police launch fired on a 60-foot boat carrying Haitian refugees early Wednesday, causing a panic in which at least 30 refugees drowned, two foreign journalists said today.
The journalists, Edward J. Barnes of Time magazine and Simon Dring of the BBC, who arrived at the scene Wednesday afternoon, said witnesses had told them that most of the victims were women and children. 
 Mr. Barnes, quoting witnesses, said just three shots from four policemen riding in a motor launch caused the panic. The refugee boat capsized about 300 yards offshore from Nan L'Etat, about 15 miles east of Les Cayes, a southern port.
[Mr. Barnes's report was circulated on Thursday by America On Line as part of Time Daily, a news bulletin prepared by Time magazine. According to the report, monitored in New York by Reuters, the refugees were among about 400 Haitians waiting in surrounding coves for boats that would take them to sea.
["The boat people froze in fear," the report said. "The refugees tried to stay quiet and hide, hoping the boat would pass. Then three shots rang out in the darkness and there was chaos," with panicky passengers pushed others into the water. The boom on the refugees' boat broke free, knocking women and children into the sea.]
 
No Confirmation
 There was no independent confirmation of the account.
It was the first reported instance of soldiers trying to stop a refugee vessel since the surge in boat people began a week ago. Since then about 4,700 Haitians have been intercepted at sea by Coast Guard cutters and Navy warships; at least 1,056 were picked up today, a Coast Guard spokesman, Rob Wyman said.
Most of the 38 boats intercepted today were off Haiti's southern peninsula, he added.
The military-backed Government threatened in May to arrest anyone leaving on a refugee vessel. On May 21, about 50 people in Petit-Goave, 40 miles west of Port-au-Prince, were arrested when they tried to board a boat and flee. Others have been arrested on La Gonave, an island that is another common departure point.
 
50,000 Boat People
 More than 50,000 Haitians have been intercepted at sea by the Coast Guard since the elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was overthrown in September 1991. Father Aristide, who lives in exile in Washington, said this week that he could not restrain Haitians from fleeing the military repression in Haiti, which he called "a house on fire."
Intensified economic sanctions on Haiti and a new, liberalized Clinton administration refugee policy may have provoked the refugee wave.
The Coast Guard, backed by warships enforcing a trade embargo on Haiti, has deployed 15 cutters and patrol craft in its biggest operation since Vietnam. The Administration has repeatedly appealed to Haitians not to risk their lives at sea and to apply instead for asylum at United States consular offices in Haiti.
Before June 16, Haitian boat people were repatriated without a hearing to determine whether they were fleeing political repression. Criticism by human rights groups and increasing political violence prompted President Clinton to change the policy. Washington has moved the Navy hospital ship Comfort, with 1,000 beds for refugees, to Kingston, Jamaica, where refugees now get hearings.

Inching Toward a U.N. Force
 UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Special to The New York Times) -- The Security Council tonight adopted a resolution that would prepare for an expanded international presence in Haiti if and when the United Nations thinks it necessary.
The resolution, adopted unanimously, did not specify how this would affect the military Government of Haiti, which would presumably have to leave if a large international force were to be landed.
The resolution was a result of more than a week of talks between United States officials and senior United Nations administrators. The chief United States delegate, Madeleine K. Albright, has met several times with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
The United Nations currently has about 90 relief workers in Haiti.
The resolution also calls on Mr. Boutros-Ghali to report to the Security Council by July 15 on the need for further action.

HEADLINE: Japan's First Socialist Premier Appoints a Familiar Cabinet

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 30

 BODY:
Japan's new Socialist Prime Minister appointed a Cabinet today in which the most important positions went to members of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party, a signal that the new Government might not make radical departures from past policies.
The naming of the new Cabinet by the Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama, helped quell some of the sense of panic that accompanied his election on Wednesday night by an almost unthinkable partnership of Socialists and Liberal Democrats. 
 Today, some of the Cabinet members, in their introductory news conferences, issued assurances that they would maintain continuity with the policies of previous Governments, particularly in foreign affairs. Mr. Murayama suggested to reporters on Wednesday night that he would not undo the reform of electoral system that was perhaps the most significant accomplishment of the previous governing coalition.
 
Cure for 'Murayama Shock'
 A sense of relief in the business sector, which had been aghast at the idea of a Socialist Prime Minister, was reflected in the Tokyo Stock Exchange. When trading opened, the market went into what one trader called "Murayama shock," with the Nikkei average quickly plunging more than 200 points. But by the end of the day the market had rebounded and closed at 20,643.93, up 162.93 Currency markets remained jittery, however, with the dollar closing at 98.95 yen, a new low for Tokyo.
In addition to being cheered by the news that the Cabinet would be dominated by the pro-business Liberal Democrats, stock market investors were encouraged that the Cabinet was formed so quickly, dispelling some fears that the new coalition would be marked by bitter infighting.
Still, many important policies, particularly concerning Japan's attitude toward the North Korean crisis and its willingness to cooperate with Washington militarily, remain in doubt. The new Cabinet members do not seem to place much priority on economic deregulation either. And many here think it is only a matter of time before the Socialists and the Liberal Democrats, who were archrivals for 40 years, are back at each other's throats.
In the new Cabinet, Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party, will be Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Ryutaro Hashimoto, a well-regarded Liberal Democratic Party stalwart who has had several Cabinet positions, was named to head the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. The new Finance Minister is Masayoshi Takemura, the chairman of the Harbinger Party, a smaller party that is also in the new coalition.
 
Donations and Doves
 The Socialists took control of the Construction Ministry, which regulates the industry that traditionally has been a huge contributor, sometimes illegally, to politicians.
Mr. Murayama had said he would create a "dovish" Cabinet, implying one that believed Japan should not change its pacifist Constitution and should not send troops abroad.
Mr. Kono, the Foreign Minister, and Mr. Takemura, the Finance Minister, fit that description. But Tokuichiro Tamazawa, the Liberal Democrat named to head the Defense Agency, had been a leader of the right-wing students in the 1960's when left-wingers were protesting the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.
Asked today whether he was a dove, Mr. Tamazawa replied, "I consider myself a Japanese."
 
A More Traditional Look
 Morihiro Hosokawa, who was the first Prime Minister in 38 years who was not from the Liberal Democratic Party, had tried to shake up the formation of the Cabinet by giving seats to two people who were not members of Parliament. He also appointed three women to posts.
But the Murayama Cabinet is more traditional in look and formation. Jobs were apportioned to the various parties, and to the various factions within the Liberal Democratic Party, according to their numbers. In all the Liberal Democrats hold 13 seats, the Socialists 6, including the Prime Minister, and the Harbinger Party, 2.
There is only one woman in the Cabinet, Makiko Tanaka, the daughter of the late Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, who was disgraced for taking bribes from Lockheed Corporation. Miss Tanaka was named director general of the Science and Technology Agency.
Many of the appointments went to people who had played an active role in forging the partnership between the Socialists and Liberal Democrats.
 
Seeds of a Clash
 One appointment that could lead to a clash is that of Mr. Takemura as Finance Minister. The Government has promised to cut income taxes to stimulate its economy, a move sought by the United States as well as by Japanese corporations. The Finance Ministry believes that the lost revenues from the income tax reduction should be made up by increasing the sales tax.
But the Socialists are against a sales tax increase because it hurts the lower income people most. Mr. Takemura, when he served as the chief spokesman in Mr. Hosokawa's Cabinet, had objected to Mr. Hosokawa's decision to raise consumption taxes. Their split on that issue was the beginning of the rupture between the two former allies.
Today, Mr. Takemura expressed his opposition to raising sales taxes, saying the Government should first look at cutting Government spending to compensate for the income tax cut.

HEADLINE: Russians in Estonia Feel Lost in a Baltic Limbo

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TALLINN, Estonia

 BODY:
They've turned off the eternal flame at the Soviet-built memorial to those who fought Fascism in World War II and long ago removed the plaques with the names of the dead for "cleaning."
Pavel K. Voronin, who commanded a Soviet antiaircraft battery during the war and retired from the army at the age of 65, seems shocked at everything in Estonia, once again sovereign, which is running toward the West as fast as it can. But the mothballed memorial appalls him. 
 "Now the Estonians say we shouldn't have bothered defending them, as if they would have preferred it under the Germans," Mr. Voronin said. "They're forgetting how much we helped them."
Of course Estonians don't recall the Soviet occupation with quite the same sense of gratitude. Many thousands of Estonians were killed or deported as Russians and other "loyal Slavs," like Mr. Voronin, were sent in to crush the Estonian state, dilute the population and hold the ground for the Soviet Union. Today, non-Estonians, most of them ethnic Russians, make up about 37 percent of the population of 1.6 million.
To make a gesture toward the plucky Baltic nations, President Clinton will stop in Riga, Latvia on July 6, the first American President to visit the Baltic republics since the collapse of the Soviet Union. He will find in Latvia a new furor over questions of citizenship and language rights of the ethnic Russian population that are so prevalent in Estonia.
 
Lost in the Translation
 Now 75, Mr. Voronin feels out of place in the new Estonia. But that's precisely the point; he's supposed to. In Soviet days, when asked by vacationing Russians for directions, Estonian residents of Tallinn would politely direct them, in the Russian they had to study, to the city dump.
Now, naturally enough, the Estonians have made their own language dominant, and Russians who want to become citizens must show a degree of competence in it. Written Russian is slowly disappearing from the streets of Tallinn, and English is now the favored second language for study in schools. There are some local Russian-language newspapers, but the main Russian television channel, Moscow-based Ostankino, is no longer available to everyone, supposedly because of the cost, though it is still offered to those 60 percent or so with cable.
"Younger Estonians really don't speak Russian any more," said Tarmu Tammerk, editor of The Baltic Independent newspaper. "It's quickly becoming a foreign language. Many choose not to learn it at all."
Nina V. Makarova, 61, is now studying Estonian to try to pass the citizenship exam, and said she feels stupid trying to learn a language at her age. But she never bothered before, and now she knows she must. There is anti-Russian sentiment, "but it's okay," she added, "so long as you don't watch television or read the newspapers."
 
Withered Bouquets
 Mr. Voronin's wife, Valentina, said: "We're no longer sure of ourselves here. I can ask for bread or rolls in Estonian in the shops." But that's about it, and the prices in the new, free-market Estonia frighten her. Her husband, who belongs to a club of army veterans, says most members come without their medals: "They're afraid to wear medals in public. People swear at them. They used to throw flowers at us. Now they throw words."
Still, despite the complaints, most Russians are coming to terms with the new Estonia, where nearly all have chosen to stay. Many ethnic Russians don't have any clear place to go in Russia, they say, but they also admit that this is a cleaner, more modern place to live just now than turbulent Russia, and the economy is in much better shape.
Nikolai A. Yugantsev, 44, is head of the Representative Association of the Russian-Speaking Population, with offices at the Tallinn Garrison's Officers Club. He says that only about 48,000 ethnic Russians in Estonia have opted to become Russian citizens, while some 65,000 were already entitled to Estonian citizenship even though not all have taken it. The rest are dangling between the two countries or planning to naturalize.
After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Estonia reinstituted its prewar citizenship laws, which set conditions for non-Estonians to become citizens. Those who are neither Estonian nor Russian citizens are considered in Estonia a form of resident alien. Those non-Estonians with Soviet passports do not necessarily have permission to re-enter Estonia without a visa.
"Estonia wants to push them out, but Russia is not eager to have them back," Mr. Yugantsev says, an assertion Estonian officials deny publicly but shrug about in private.
 
Russians in Tears
 Russians are less worried about deportation these days, but there are a lot of rumors and bureaucratic problems, especially about travel documents and the need to pass Estonian-language competency tests in order to keep jobs. Larisa T. Yakovleva, Mr. Yugantsev's secretary, said, "All I know is that Russians keep coming here in tears, and I don't know what to do for them."
She asserts that some ethnic Russians without Estonian passports are strongly encouraged to take Russian citizenship to be able to travel. The nannies at the day-care center in Maardu, a small, mostly Russian town near Tallinn, worry that if they don't pass their Estonian language test by September they'll be fired and the centers closed.
Both Estonians and Russians say the segregation among the two communities, especially among the young, is almost total, but it is also without serious conflict. Prime Minister Mart Laar thinks it's improving, however.
"In the Soviet period, there was real hate then and no contact," Mr. Laar said. "Differences exist but they're not getting larger. Now more Russians are becoming more loyal to our state and learning the language. If an Estonian hears a Russian trying to speak our language, they're very happy -- what matters is the attitude, not the skill."
 
Aug. 31 Withdrawal Planned
 These issues are not the focus of negotiations with Moscow, however, which concentrate on the rights of military retirees and the final withdrawal of the last 2,000 or so Russian troops by the end of August. In an effort to win for their military retirees an automatic right to settle here, as in Latvia, where the two sides have agreed on an Aug. 31 withdrawal date, the Russians have talked tough. The Estonians insist on case-by-case decisions, which annoys the Russians, who want more certainty.
Senior American diplomats, trying to mediate, think compromise is likely and the Aug. 31 date will be met. Not only has Russia raised the level of talks, naming Deputy Foreign Minister, Vitaly I. Churkin, as their chief negotiator, but President Boris N. Yeltsin will be in Berlin on Aug. 31 bidding a formal goodbye to Russian troops stationed in the former East Germany.
"Yeltsin doesn't want to stand in Berlin and have Russian troops still stationed in Estonia," a senior American diplomat said. "It would be too embarrassing."
The Americans say the 10,000 or so military officers and their families who retired before the failed coup of August 1991 should be able to stay, though without guaranteed titles to their current apartments, to which they had privileged access. The Russians agree, but want an automatic right to settle; they also want help with housing those officers who will leave.
 
U.S. Housing Vouchers
 The Americans have promised housing vouchers, to spend on an apartment in Russia, to the uniformed officers of the troops still in Estonia who will retire and leave this summer. So far, the number of those is about 620, and Russian units have been providing lists of those officers who qualify.
Those who retired between August 1991 and Jan. 28, 1992, when Mr. Yeltsin took over formal control of the former Soviet military, are another problem. Latvia let them stay; Estonia says no. Washington has offered to provide this group of about 260 officers housing vouchers, too, to help them leave.
The Estonians have stressed the danger of another group, some 950 officers so far who have left the army after January 1992 and remain here, some of whom have engaged in crime. Western diplomats think these fears are exaggerated, but believe that Russia will not try to protect them from deportation -- so long as Estonia does it in small groups, without embarrassing Moscow.
Tunne V. Kellam, the deputy speaker of Parliament, agrees that relations between Estonians and Russians are fraught, and may create new difficulties for an integrated state. He urges the West not to forget the moral question, of an Estonia brutally occupied by the Soviet Union and now full of foreigners, but admits that Estonia needs to come to terms with the future too, and its special security problems.
It would help if fully recognized Estonia as a sovereign state, Mr. Kellam said. That's why the final withdrawal of Russia's troops is so important, he said. "Their leaving will be a crucial symbol that Russians here must take our independence seriously and integrate."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
City of Pittsburgh Digs Deep to Offer Pirates an $8 Million Loan. Will It Be Enough?

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Is baseball dying in Pittsburgh? The Pirates have a mediocre 38-38 record, but those numbers aren't the ones that count these days.
The team is wheezing financially, losing money by the day, and looking far removed from 1990-92 when they were champions of the National League East. 
 On Wednesday, the Pittsburgh City Council voted by 7-1 to bail out the Pirates with an $8 million loan. What's surprising is that the team may not take it unless the city renegotiates its lease at Three Rivers Stadium.
Since 1991, the team has reported operating losses of $24 million.
The Pirates owe $26 million ($6 million in interest) to the city, which put up half the purchase price for the team in 1985, another $34 million from dipping into a credit line that is available to all major league baseball teams through Citibank. The $20 million city loan does not have to be paid back unless the team is sold, but the first payment on the Citibank loan is due in August.
 
Shrinking Corporate Base

 Pittsburgh has a long tradition in baseball, but today, the market is not overly supportive of the Pirates. The corporate base isn't big. Local media revenues are small, about $7 million. The cushion of about $14 million a year in national TV money is gone, with teams expecting $6 million each this season.
Not surprisingly, no credible local buyer has surfaced. "Howard Baldwin offered to buy us, with very little cash," said Jim Lachimia, a Pirates spokesman, referring to the owner of the Penguins.
To the City Council members who unenthusiastically voted for the bailout, the Pirates' financial plight is not the equivalent of better-financed teams holding cities ransom for better stadium deals or new ball parks. The Chicago White Sox squeezed out a sweetheart deal from the state of Illinois for new Comiskey Park with a well-orchestrated plan to defect to St. Petersburg.
But the council members don't view the financial drama being played at the confluence of the Ohio, Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers with a happy face.
"It's a bad situation," said Councilman Alan Hertzberg, who voted for the loan. "We tried to get every other governmental entity to help. And it's a tough nut for us. Our bond rating was just lowered because of a $20 million shortfall in our anticipated revenues."
 
Hoping Against Hope
 So why the bailout? The $80 million in regional economic impact the Pirates produce, said Bob O'Connor, another councilman. "The average person doesn't want to give them money, but doesn't want to lose them, either," O'Connor said.
The council is not happy with the management of the Pirates, and is hoping, perhaps naively, to stabilize the franchise through the city loan, $8 million more that the ownership has pledged in matching funds, and the adoption of revenue sharing and a salary cap by major league baseball owners and players.
"Sure, it's a hope," said O'Connor, referring to revenue sharing and a cap, the dual subjects of fierce disagreement between labor and management.
 
More Concessions Sought
 But the Pirates may say thanks, but no thanks, to the city if they don't receive substantial givebacks on cash from stadium concessions, luxury suites and parking. According to Financial World magazine's study of team values, the Pirates received the least in such revenues of any major league team, $2.3 million in 1993, compared with $21.8 million for the Toronto Blue Jays.
O'Connor said he believed that the loan and the lease negotiations were not intertwined. "We thought this was one issue at a time," he said. But Mark Sauer, the president of the Pirates, said, "The loan is part of the negotiations." The Pirates' board is meeting today to consider the loan.
Lachimia said: "The loan is a temporary solution. A new lease, revenue-sharing and a salary cap are the long-term solution. We don't want to draw on the $8 million if we can't use it to get to the long term."
This is somewhat strange. The Pirates are playing hardball with the city as the vicissitudes of its daily operations are weakening the team. But the Pirates have the leverage of being a major league franchise in a city that would feel as if it drove its baseball team into the arms of wealthier markets like Charlotte, St. Petersburg or Phoenix if it did not contribute what it probably can't afford to keep the team afloat.

HEADLINE: WORLD CUP '94;
Soccer's Study In Contrasts

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MISSION VIEJO, Calif., June 30

 BODY:
Diego Maradona scored his first goal in Argentina's opening game of the 1994 World Cup, and he kept running until his face nearly pressed into a television camera behind the net, his jaw clenched in celebratory defiance. His look was predatory, like a shark poking his snout into a diver's cage.
Soccer's most riveting and difficult superstar was back. Or so it seemed. The critics who once said he was overweight, over the hill, would soon retreat into fawning obeisance as Maradona attacked with renewed ferociousness. 
 "Diego is in very good physical condition," Alfie Basile, the Argentine coach, beamed after his team had routed Greece by 4-0. "His touch is still magic."
But this magic could never make the dark, troubled side of Diego Maradona disappear. Today, he was withdrawn from the World Cup by the Argentine team after testing positive for the banned drug ephedrine. If his expulsion was unsettling to Argentina's chances of winning the World Cup, it could hardly be called shocking.
If he was the best player of his generation, Maradona was also the most volatile. He experienced drug problems, weight problems, legal problems and emotional problems in the grand, lamentable melodrama that has been his career.
Twice before, the enormity of his skills had been obscured by the shadow of drugs. While playing for Naples in the Italian League, Maradona tested positive for cocaine in a routine post-game doping exam on March 17, 1991. He received a 15-month worldwide ban from the game by FIFA, soccer's world governing body.
Upon returning home to Buenos Aires, Maradona was arrested in a police raid and charged with cocaine possession. He said he would retire, and entered a drug rehabilitation program.
Some fans forgave him for his transgressions, but others remained suspicious. Japanese authorities, citing his drug record, prevented Maradona from entering the country to play in exhibition matches before the 1994 World Cup.
There was a striking contradiction to his personality and his career, one of peerless accomplishment and repeated disgrace.
 
Incomparable, Indifferent
 He was a child of the Buenos Aires streets, a boy who grew up in the slums, then amassed enough of a fortune to throw a $1 million wedding in 1989, chartering a 747 jet to ferry hundreds of friends to the ceremony. He was a doting father of two daughters with his wife, Claudia, and a restive husband who was accused in two paternity suits. He was an incomparable player and an indifferent athlete, whose body was often as bloated as his ego.
Maradona could dribble a ball in traffic and thread an impossible pass with unruffled calm, but he was equally prone to violent outbursts, often directed at journalists. He punched out a photographer before his wedding, and, in March of this year, fired an air rifle at journalists outside at his home in suburban Buenos Aires, slightly injuring five reporters. After the latter incident, he was ordered to undergo psychiatric treatment.
His weight fluctuated like his temper. In the past year, he has gained and lost 25 pounds at least twice, leading to speculation that he went to extraordinary, perhaps illicit, means to get his weight under control for the World Cup.
Reared in a shantytown, Maradona had, by age 16, become the youngest player ever called up to the Argentine national team. He was an emerging star at the 1982 World Cup, then established himself as perhaps the game's most spectacular player at the 1986 World Cup in Spain, where he fashioned the tournament into his own highlight film for the ages.
In a tense, dramatic quarterfinal match against England -- the first meeting between Argentina and Britain since the Falklands War -- Maradona broke open a scoreless game in the second half with a dribbling foray into England's penalty area that resulted in the most infamous goal in World Cup history.
A British defender peeled the ball from Maradona's foot and lobbed it back toward the English goalkeeper Peter Shilton. Only one problem. Maradona arrived at the ball before Shilton did, slashing inside for the interception, leaping and heading the ball into the net.
At least it appeared that he used his head.
 
A Helping Hand
 Replays showed clearly that Maradona used a forbidden hand to cuff the ball into the net. He never owned up to the infraction, saying only that the goal was accomplished "partly by the hand of God and partly with the head of Maradona."
Maradona has long had a bellicose relationship with soccer authorities. After commanding a record transfer fee of $7.5 million from Barcelona to Naples in 1984, Maradona led Naples to a pair of Italian League titles, but not without numerous impetuous eruptions.
He once reported to training camp a month late; later, Maradona avoided practice as if it were a communicable disease. His weight ballooned. Eventually, Maradona demanded to be traded. Then, in 1991, he failed a drug test in Italy and his career began a precipitous decline into scandal.
 
Nation Needs Him
 His suspension ended, Maradona returned to club play in 1992 with Seville in the Spanish League. He was fired after one season, his welcome expiring just before his $7.5 million contract did. He fought during a game, developed a familiar truancy from practice and was even cited for reckless driving as his wayward career appeared to careen toward a dead end.
Maradona retreated to Argentina and signed with a club team, Newell's Old Boys, but the national team ignored him until it lost a 5-0 qualifying game to Colombia in Buenos Aires in September of 1993, and came perilously close to not qualifying for the World Cup. Facing national disgrace, all of Argentina, even President Carlos Menem, knew what had to be done.
Like a reliever called in from the bullpen, Maradona made a confident re-entry a month later in a playoff series against Australia. True to his indomitable spirit, Maradona set up Argentina's lone goal in a 1-1 draw in Sydney; Argentina won the second game, 1-0, and clung to the final World Cup berth by the slimmest of threads. Argentina had made it, but had Maradona?
After missing numerous practices with his club team, he was sacked by Newell's Old Boys in early February. When reporters showed up at his country home outside Buenos Aires to ask about his release, a distraught Maradona fired at them with an air rifle, shouting, "If you don't get out of here, we're going to start shooting real bullets."
Media support withered and Argentine psychologists questioned his emotional state.
But, like soccer's Rasputin, Maradona was not finished yet. Though his weight again mushroomed, so apparently did his enthusiasm and desperation for one final chance to star on soccer's international stage. Maradona went into seclusion with a personal trainer and melted away 26 pounds of suet.
The cup arrived and so did a reinvigorated Maradona. He scored a goal against Greece, and slid a quick pass to Caniggia to catch his opponents flat-footed and unprepared in a 2-1 victory over Nigeria. Every pass seemed made with deliberate purpose and marvelous economy. Maradona appeared to waste nothing. Until today, when he wasted a final chance to renew himself and his reputation in the World Cup.

HEADLINE: New Era, New Pie

BYLINE: By Robert D. Hormats; Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, helped prepare eight economic summit meetings as a Presidential adviser.

 BODY:
The Group of Seven industrial democracies will celebrate the 20th anniversary of their annual summit meeting at Naples next week. The leaders of the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada should seize the occasion to take a hard look at the international trade and financial system and begin to work together to shape its evolution into the 21st century -- especially by incorporating large emerging economies into the world market system.
Since they possess nearly 70 percent of the world's gross domestic product and the world's key currencies, these countries bear a special responsibility for a stable global economic order. 
 Russia's unsettled economic status makes premature its request to join as a full member. Moreover, bringing in Russia could divert attention from other urgent issues: how to maintain growth in the global economy, how to increase jobs in the Group countries, how to bolster currency stability and how to maintain momentum in world trade liberalization now that the Uruguay Round of trade talks is over.
But Russia and China should be invited to become associate members for next year's summit meeting, in Canada. A very limited number -- about half a dozen -- other important emerging powers such as India, Mexico and representative key countries in East Asia, South America and Eastern Europe could be added in due course.
Under this proposal, Group of Seven leaders would meet after their own sessions with leaders of associate members, as they have done on an ad hoc basis with President Boris Yeltsin and Mikhail Gorbachev before him.
Core and associate countries together would meet with heads of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the new World Trade Organization. These officials would focus the summit leaders on priority issues and press them to consider the views of non-summit nations that are members of these large global institutions, thereby reducing their resentment at not being at the summit table. The heads of these institutions would try to avert any tendency toward narrow nationalism or protective regionalism that would fragment or weaken the global economy.
Integrating newly market-oriented economies smoothly into the world economy, as Japan and Germany were after World War II, would harness the enormous productive power and market potential of more than three billion people. That would transform the global economy and give an enormous boost to world growth and be a powerful antidote to divisiveness and instability. The supreme test of the Group of Seven as we move into the next century will be its ability to manage this integration.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Pay the Money, Sam

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Vive la France! A good strong vive from everybody, please, to the French for taking on what no other country would touch -- flying troops into the hell of Rwanda to save African lives.
The French do not want to occupy the country -- they have not suddenly gone mad -- and there is no economic or strategic gain to be found in that land of corpses. They went in because their stomachs could not stand it anymore -- that's the reason and it does them credit. 
 Now, a good strong vive for the Secretary General of the United Nations. Who? Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt? The man American diplomacy so loves to blame for everything from war in Bosnia to monsoons in Bangladesh? A vive for our own whipping boy?
Correct -- the Secretary General has been screaming, pleading, begging for members of the U.N. to do something more useful about Rwanda than look shocked. It is pure churl not to recognize grace and courage in the French and the first Secretary General since Dag Hammarskjold to speak his mind, or even know it.
No, I did not want American troops in Rwanda -- the U.S. plate over floweth. But I think it should embarrass Americans that at the United Nations, the richest country in the world, the nation that aspires to leadership by right of power and democracy, has become a champion welsher in payments to the U.N. peacekeeping forces and the U.N. in general. We are hanging around the U.N. bar, looking for a free drink and acting as if we were buying rounds on the house.
As of June 15, according to U.N. figures, the United States owed $531 million to the U.N. general budget for years of arrears, and $748 million to the peacekeeping budget.
American figures are somewhat less because they deduct some general budget arrears that Washington expects to pay by the end of the year. All right, so taking all the accounting breaks, round it off as one billion dollars, without a penny of interest ever. We are lucky they don't throw us out of the place.
For decades, the U.S. took it as a matter of honor to pay up on the due date or before and properly looked down at countries that welshed. But in the 80's, the Reagan Administration got annoyed at the U.N. for then being a center of anti-American agitation. It was. But the Reagan people took a strange way of upholding America -- refusing to meet U.S. financial obligations.
During the Bush Administration, the welshing continued for other excuses, including the demand that the U.N. overhaul its budgeting and spending, which it has been doing.
What's the excuse now? The Clinton Administration says it wants to catch up. Madeleine Albright, the U.S. chief delegate, does her very best -- making special trips to Washington to urge members of Congress to put the checks in the mail.
Clintonians say the problem is that a poor-mouth Congress won't vote the money. But isn't that a Democratic President down there, with a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate?
In private moments, Administration people concede that getting Congress to pay up is not "very high on the President's priority list."
If national honor is not enough to push it higher, how about this: American welshing cripples peacekeeping missions for which the U.S. voted and shifts the burden to far less wealthy nations.
Some of them are not as keen on that as they used to be. Because of U.S. defaults, sometimes the U.N. cannot pay poorer peacekeeping nations the money it legitimately owes them for expenses -- which means it will be a long day on the East River before those countries volunteer again.
The U.S. is not self-destructive enough to want to do away with the U.N. and never has been. Whatever any Administration in Washington says in complaint, American diplomats and most politicians are sophisticated enough to know that the U.N. is simply the will of its members, that among those members the U.S. is the most powerful and effective, that the U.S. gets much of its payments back in U.N. money spent in America, and that the world is at least a somewhat safer place because nations can meet, negotiate, cool down and even occasionally reach agreement at the U.N.
Put the check in the mail, pay for your own drinks -- what is so complicated about that? We will feel a lot better and so will all our friends.

HEADLINE: Offering Forces UAL to Dip Into Its Cash

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
The UAL Corporation, the parent of United Air Lines, sold $1.15 billion in bonds and preferred stock yesterday, after being forced by reluctant investors both to raise interest rates and to cut the amount of preferred stock being sold.
As a result of the shortfall, the company has said it will contribute $300 million from its cash holdings to shareholders if they approve a sweeping reorganization giving employees majority control of the airline in return for wage and benefit concessions. 
 Shareholders will vote on the proposed employee buyout on July 12.
 
 
Question of Rates
 Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch sold only $410 million of preferred stock, at a rate of 12.25 percent, down from the $765 million originally hoped for. Seth Waugh, a managing director of Merrill Lynch, said the entire amount could have been sold but only at a rate higher than UAL was willing to pay.
UAL also sold $370.2 million of 10-year notes, at a yield of 10.67 percent, or 3.35 percentage points higher than 10-year Treasuries, and $371 million of 20-year bonds at a yield of 11.21 percent, or 3.55 percentage points higher than 30-year Treasuries.
In both cases, the rates were slightly higher than the underwriters had wanted.
The issues had to be sold by yesterday because of deadlines associated with the planned shareholder meeting. All the sales will be canceled if UAL shareholders do not approve the reorganization, which would leave existing shareholders with a minority of the company while providing a cash payout of $84.81 a share.
The decision by the company to dip into its bank account to make up the shortfall was applauded by institutional investors who plan to vote for the deal. In recent months, they have increasingly signaled their displeasure over the prospect of being given debt securities of uncertain value in exchange for surrendering majority control.
"Cash is king, always," said Tim Pettee, a transportation analyst at Alliance Capital Management, which owns about 17 percent of UAL's stock.
UAL currently has about $2 billion in cash, which would be reduced to $1.07 billion if the employee buyout succeeds. Philip Baggaley, transportation analyst at the Standard & Poor's Corporation, said he was "not overjoyed" at the prospect of the additional drain on cash. But considering that the company has about $16 billion in debt and leases -- much of it carried off its balance sheet -- switching debt securities to cash "doesn't make much difference," he said.
Mr. Baggaley speculated that UAL had trouble selling preferred stock because such securities were typically bought by corporations for tax advantages, but they generally preferred securities with lower risk than the UAL offering.
UAL's shares closed at $127, down 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 6, 1994, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Friday about a bond and preferred stock sale by the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, included an erroneous figure supplied by the company for the cash that would remain on its balance sheet if shareholders approve an employee buyout on July 12. UAL's cash would total $1.5 billion, not $1.07 billion.

HEADLINE: ALBANY IN ACCORD ON SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR HASIDIC GROUP

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 1

 BODY:
Just four days after the United States Supreme Court ruled that a public school district created specially for ultra-Orthodox Jews was unconstitutional, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders reached agreement today on a bill that would allow the district to continue operating.
The legislation is intended to address constitutional issues raised by the high court when it struck down the Kiryas Joel Village School District in Orange County, which was created by the Governor and Legislature in 1989 to serve about 200 Satmar Hasidic children with disabilities. 
 The Hasidic parents did not want to send their children to the local public schools but wanted to receive Federal and state aid to pay for special education.
Critics of the arrangement contend that it fragments education at a time when the state is trying to consolidate school districts. They argue that the Legislature is responding to the political power of the Hasidim, a charge that lawmakers deny.
The Supreme Court majority had ruled that establishing the district amounted to improper favoritism toward religion in general and one sect in particular. But in drafting their bill, the Legislators seized on an opening they believed was supplied by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who said in a concurring opinion that the district might have been permissible if it had been created through legislation applicable to any municipality, not just Kiryas Joel, a village about 50 miles northwest of Manhattan whose residents are all Satmar Hasidim.
The lawmakers said their new bill would meet that standard by allowing all municipalities that fit specific criteria to establish new school districts. Currently, only state education officials can create new districts, something that rarely happens.
Legislative aides said that between 20 and 60 towns in addition to the village of Kiryas Joel, could create new school districts under the new bill.
"It's right on point with Justice O'Connor's decision," said Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who sponsored the bill. "It's mentioned in the ruling that if it's done this way, it would be fine."
But critics of the legislation said it addressed the concerns of only one justice and not necessarily the court's majority. And they charged that the Governor and Legislature had rushed to help the 12,000-resident Satmar community because they are thought to vote and give political contributions in a bloc.
"I'm personally disappointed in the utter disrespect and disregard the Governor and Legislature have for the Supreme Court," said Louis Grumet, executive director of the New York State School Boards Association. "This law would encourage the very balkanization I thought everyone was moving against."
Mr. Grumet, who brought the original court challenge against the Kiryas Joel district, said the School Boards Association as a group and he as an individual taxpayer would challenge the new legislation in court.
 
Intent to Move Quickly
 But supporters of the bill said they had to act quickly because the legislative session is scheduled to end this week. And they said there is little evidence that the Satmars have the political clout to make an entire Legislature act.
"It is offensive to say we are helping the Jewish community because they vote and participate in the political process," said Assembly Jules Polonetsky, a Brooklyn Democrat who co-sponsored the bill.
Mr. Grumet and other critics also contended that Mr. Cuomo, who has spoken passionately about the importance of keeping church and state separate, had used legal technicalities to sidestep a Supreme Court ruling on that very issue.
 
'A Duty to Protect'
 Mr. Cuomo could not be reached for comment this afternoon. But earlier this week he said he had signed the Kiryas Joel legislation in 1989 because "I believe government has a duty to protect and serve all its citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs."
He added, "I believe that while the Constitution, thankfully, bars government from forcing anyone to be religious, it does not mandate that we punish people for being religious."
The Legislature was expected to pass two bills that would deal with Kiryas Joel. The first would abolish the existing school district, but allow existing educational services to continue until a new school district is formed, possibly this summer.
The second would establish criteria for creating new districts: Municipalities must have at least 2,000 students and come from established districts with at least 4,000 students. New districts would have to be at or above the state average in wealth and leave behind districts whose wealth would be essentially unchanged.
Those measures were designed to prevent small towns from creating new districts and to insure that wealthy villages could not secede from school districts that include poor areas.
 
A Three-Step Process
 A new district would require three steps of approval: first from the municipal council, then from the local electorate and finally from two-thirds of the existing school district's board of education.
When told of the legislative agreement, residents of Kiryas Joel responded ecstatically. "For my child, it means the difference between a nice life and nothing, barrenness," said Judith Gluck, whose six-year-old son attends the school district. "Every time I talk about it, my tears well up."
 
'Motor Voter' Bill Advances
 In other action, the Governor and legislative leaders also reached agreement early today on how to comply with a 1993 Federal law that requires states to distribute voter registration applications in an array of state and local offices.
Under the so-called "motor voter" bill, the state would make voter registration materials available at offices of the Department of Motor Vehicles and the Department of Social Services, including all local human services offices. Forms also would have to be distributed at agencies that serve people with disabilities, armed forces recruitment offices, and worker's compensation offices. All State University of New York and City University of New York schools would have to provide registration forms to students once a year, and twice a year in Presidential election years.
At motor vehicle offices, applicants would simply have to complete a section of their driver's license registration form. At social services offices, a tear-off voter registration application would be attached applications for benefits.
The Federal law allowed the states a certain amount of discretion. The Republican-controlled Senate wanted to limit distribution of the forms to motor vehicles and social services offices, the minimum requirement of the Federal law.
That is because in New York City, where 69 percent of all registered voters are Democrats, only about half of the voting-age population has a driver's license, compared to three-fourths of the voting-age population statewide.
The Assembly Democrats succeeded in expanding the distribution of registration forms somewhat, but failed to win an agreement that the forms be made available in housing agencies, unemployment offices and high schools.
Nonetheless, voting-rights advocates said the bill should generate a significant increase in voter registration. Sixty-four percent of the state's voting-age population is registered now, making New York 37th among states, according to Board of Elections figures.
 
Accord on Teacher Discipline
 The process for disciplining teachers accused of wrongdoing would be simplified and speeded up under an agreement reached among Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders that would also bolster the rights of accused teachers.
The bill tightens a loophole that currently allows teachers convicted of a crime to continue receiving pay until a disciplinary hearing is complete. Under legislation proposed by Mr. Cuomo the teacher could be fired upon conviction for several drug and sex crimes, but they would be paid back if the conviction was overturned.

HEADLINE: Bland but Tough, Gov. Wilson Uses Lessons of Nixon

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
The words rolled soberly off Gov. Pete Wilson's tongue in his eulogy for Richard M. Nixon: "It was his heart that taught us the great lesson of Richard Nixon's life. Never give up. Never give up. Never, ever, give up."
Mr. Wilson, an advance man for Mr. Nixon's unsuccessful campaign for governor of California in 1962, was talking as much about himself that afternoon last April. The eulogy was sprinkled with passages that suited both men, down to the Governor's description of Mr. Nixon's "iron will." It was not lost on followers of his career that Mr. Wilson had been given the less-refined accolade of "iron butt" for his political durability -- a durability evidenced by his improving ratings in the polls. 
 Pete Wilson is rarely inspiring, is hardly charismatic and, after three decades in public life as Mayor of San Diego, a United States Senator and Governor of the most populous state, he still looks far more comfortable behind the scenes plotting campaign tactics than out on center stage.
But like his mentor, the 60-year-old Mr. Wilson has succeeded not because voters have deep affection for him (they do not), but because he is smart, reaches out to moderates, thrives on the game of politics and is relentless in practicing it.
That helps explain why, having presided over the biggest recession in California since the Depression and after being 20 points down in some opinion polls last summer, Mr. Wilson is rebounding in his race for a second term. He is helped by an economy that is beginning to emerge from a recession, but also by his own acumen in shifting the debate to crime and immigration. The latest polls show that in the most important governor's race of the year, one that could signal President Clinton's prospects here in 1996, Mr. Wilson is edging out his Democratic opponent, State Treasurer Kathleen Brown. She had practically been anointed by the pundits as the next governor.
This would have been no surprise to Mr. Nixon, who staged the most successful political comeback of his generation and recognized that Mr. Wilson had a similar capacity. In one of his final political prognostications before his death, the former President told friends that if Mr. Wilson was re-elected, as Mr. Nixon expected, he would be the front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1996. (Few analysts believe Mr. Wilson's protestations that he will not run for President in 1996.)
"Pete and the President are very much the same," said Ken Khachigian, a Nixon speech writer who helped Mr. Wilson polish the eulogy, along with Ronald Reagan's speech writer, Peggy Noonan. "They both have this great love of the ins and outs of politics. They're devoted to it. Married to it, in a way."
 
Pupil of Nixon
 Mr. Khachigian recalled that when the three met last year over soft drinks and Mr. Nixon offered his thoughts about the race, "Pete was not awed, but he was very much the pupil to the teacher, eager to listen."
In a recent interview, Mr. Wilson brightened when asked about the comparisons to Mr. Nixon. "I hear that from friends and foes," he said.
Although Mr. Wilson speaks in a monotone, his words are those of the Marine infantry officer he once was when he describes his Nixonesque win-at-all-costs mentality. "I don't go looking for fights," he said. "I don't shrink from combat either. There are people who think that I particularly enjoy it. The fact of the matter is that I would be perfectly happy dealing with responsible people honestly and functioning in a largely nonadversarial setting. That isn't my fate in life."
An important reason Mr. Wilson has quashed all but one of his opponents over the years (he lost the 1978 primary for governor) is that his tenacity is well honed. The strategy of Mr. Wilson, who has long surrounded himself with the same close aides, is simple: set the agenda by seizing on highly emotional issues, and never let a rival get the upper hand.
Darry Sragow, a Democrat strategist who has managed two losing statewide campaigns against Mr. Wilson, described it from the other side: "I always picture the Wilson operation stepping out in the path of the opponent and throwing a bag of marbles in the opponent's path. The opponent has to dance on the marbles and invariably slips, falls and is immediately set upon by a host of Wilson operatives who emerge from the woods. They just sit on the opponent until the end of the campaign."
George Gorton, Mr. Wilson's campaign manager and adviser for 24 years, described Mr. Wilson's "trademark move" as "letting his opponents go too far and coming back and blowing them away."
Take Ms. Brown's accusation last March that Mr. Wilson was responsible for the release of Melvin Carter, a serial rapist, from a state prison. Mr. Wilson counterattacked immediately. Saying that he had tried to change the sentencing laws that had allowed for Mr. Carter's release, he accused Ms. Brown of "the most outrageous, deliberate deception."
Characteristic of an attention to detail that many politicians would leave to their handlers, the workaholic Governor stayed up well past midnight drafting a 13-page statement to his aides, plus attachments, for a news conference at which he attacked Ms. Brown. The meticulously hand-printed memorandum was so detailed that it even included citations to the penal code. A week later, Mr. Wilson wrote the script for his first commercial attacking Ms. Brown as soft on crime. He specified that it be shot in black and white for a stark image and with a female narrator.
"I saw an opportunity, frankly, to reveal her for what she was -- and do some damage," Mr. Wilson said. Calling the commercial "dramatically successful," he boasted that it brought Ms. Brown's opponent in the Democratic primary, John Garamendi, up about 10 points in the polls temporarily. Mr. Garamendi was defeated by Ms. Brown last month, 48 percent to 33 percent.
Mr. Wilson seized on another opportunity in April when he called a news conference to announce the early reopening of the Santa Monica Freeway, which had been damaged by the 1993 earthquake. The move infuriated Clinton Administration officials, who were caught off guard and unable to take credit before the television cameras.
Mr. Wilson is also a formidable fund raiser. He and Ms. Brown are expected to raise at least $15 million apiece for the November election.
It takes more than political acumen, though, to be a popular Governor, and Californians rate Mr. Wilson relatively poorly. In a poll in the primary conducted by The Los Angeles Times, only 39 percent of voters approved of the job he was doing, and 61 percent disapproved. Two out of five Republican voters said they were unhappy with his performance.
An even more telling sign was that Ron Unz, a computer industry millionaire and political unknown who challenged Mr. Wilson in the Republican primary, got 34 percent of the vote. And at the Rose Bowl late last month, the Governor was drowned out by boos as he tried to address opening ceremonies of the World Cup soccer tournament.
Mr. Wilson argued that the lackluster showing was a result of sour economic conditions in the state and not because of him personally. "The negatives arise from the deepest, longest recession since the Great Depression," he said.
But the Governor's conduct did not always endear him to voters. Early in his term, he alienated conservatives by allying himself with Democratic legislators to close a budget gap by raising $7.3 billion in new taxes; then he offended Democrats for many positions, from his support of a successful term-limit referendum to his oratory against illegal immigrants, which many view as offensive.
He tried to counter the notion that people did not like him by first saying that many voters did not really know him -- a telling admission for someone who has been in public life so long. Then, he offered anecdotal evidence to make his case.
"The other day I was in Sacramento," he said. "I was waiting for the light to cross the street and a good-looking black guy had the windows rolled down and he was waiting there at the light. He looked over and he saw me and he did a double take. And he said, 'Hey! Go get 'em, Pete!' I get a lot of that. So I am not feeling unloved."
Mr. Wilson has been helped as much by his political skills as by Ms. Brown's lack of them. She is more personally engaging and comes across as far more compassionate. But her campaign has had trouble settling on a theme for her candidacy, and improvements in the economy have hampered her effort to make the campaign a referendum on a failed economy.
Mr. Wilson and his advisers speak dismissively of Ms. Brown, and revel in describing her gaffes on the campaign trail. The Governor went as far as to say that there was nothing that worried him about Ms. Brown as a candidate -- and that only factors beyond his control could cost him the election, like the economy and an inclination for women to vote for her.
Mr. Nixon, he said, told him as much. "He said, 'I think you can win this thing very credibly,' " Mr. Wilson recalled. "He said, 'My sole concern is circumstances beyond your control, meaning international recession.' "
The Governor should be mindful, of course, of the lesson of former Gov. Jim Florio, a New Jersey Democrat. Mr. Florio thought he had recovered from presiding over huge tax increases early in his term and a soured economy, only to lose last November to Christine Todd Whitman.
Mr. Wilson offered much higher praise for the political ability of Senator Dianne Feinstein, whom he defeated when he was elected Governor four years ago. "I don't think she's as nearly as good a candidate," the Governor said of Ms. Brown.
Mr. Wilson's stewardship has been defined largely by events that he could not control, from the state's economic crisis, to calamities worthy of the biblical plagues, including two major earthquakes, fires, floods and droughts. But those disasters may also be what saves Mr. Wilson because they have showcased before the television cameras his steady, yet bland, ability to take charge.
His strength as Governor is his command of the intricacies of policy, a trait that critics say prevents him from standing back and sketching grand themes for his Administration to follow. Mr. Wilson is so taken by the pabulum of policy that his aides cautioned that unless a reporter repeatedly reminded him that the article was not about facts and figures, that would be all he would talk about.
But at the start of the interview, Mr. Wilson made clear that he would stray only so far into his personal side. "No pop psychology," he said.
In addition to his seemingly obsessive drive to win, there is a more personal reason why a victory over Ms. Brown would be sweet for Mr. Wilson. It was Ms. Brown's father, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown, who handed Mr. Nixon a humiliating defeat in the 1962 Governor's race. Now, the advance man in that race has a chance to take his own shot at a Brown.
"I think it's going to be one of the dirtiest campaigns, if not the worst, that I have ever been exposed to," Mr. Wilson said. Would he enjoy it? Without skipping a beat, he said: "Yeah, I think it'll be fun."

HEADLINE: Tents for Haitians Rise Again at Guantanamo

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba, July 1

 BODY:
For the last two days, 1,700 American troops have been working around the clock, once again, to raise a tent city here for thousands of Haitian refugees. But the boat people are flowing in faster than the soldiers can pitch tents.
Coast Guard cutters delivered 500 more Haitians today, bringing the total to 1,956 since the camps opened on Wednesday. Hundreds more remain on United States ships offshore. 
 "I've got to expect that the flow out of Haiti will remain fairly constant," said Col. Mike Pearson, an army officer in command of the task force at this United States Navy outpost in southeastern Cuba. "I'm ramping up to take my maximum."
Colonel Pearson could reach his limit of 12,500 within days, forcing the Administration to plead even louder with its Caribbean neighbors for help in sheltering the refugees. An American hospital ship at Kingston, Jamaica, the Comfort, has 1,000 Haitians aboard; the Turks and Caicos Islands have agreed to take up to 2,000 refugees later this month.
But Haitians here say tighter economic sanctions against Haiti's military Government, heightened oppression by security forces and a United States immigration policy that seems more lenient will send even larger numbers to sea in rickety boats.
Seeking additional sites was the focus of urgent meetings today in Washington.
Asmime Pierre, a 25-year-old sales clerk, said she and her husband, Jeudy, fled after he was arrested for belonging to the party of the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. But the administration's new policy was the catalyst, she said.
"We noticed everyone was leaving on boats, so we decided to leave as well," Ms. Pierre said through a Creole-speaking interpreter.
Jasdrem Codoue, a 48-year-old construction worker, said he left Haiti a week ago with his 11-year-old son, Erkuil, out of fear.
Mr. Codoue said that when he intervened to help a woman arguing with some soldiers at a market, they arrested him.
"They know my face now," said Mr. Codoue. "I can never go back."
Reporters were allowed to interview and photograph only those Haitians already granted asylum, who account for 215 of the nearly 2,000 Haitians here. The rest have arrived in the last 48 hours.
Scores of Haitians trooped down the gangplank of the cutter Durable this morning, carrying only small bundles of clothes, and climbed onto a waiting blue school bus to be taken to a processing center.
The camps echoed with the pounding of hammers and the grinding of forklifts. Marines and Navy Seabees rolled in portable toilets and pitched rows of khaki tents that hold 20 cots each. Double rolls of barbed wire encircle the camp.
The officers have learned several lessons from the time when the Bush Administration housed Haitian refugees here in 1991 and 1992. Then some were held up to 22 months, raising tensions and even causing small riots, Colonel Pearson said. The poor conditions and assertions by human rights groups that the Haitians were not being treated fairly led the Bush Administration to close the camp.
"If any lesson was learned, it was you have to give people some flow-through quickly, either repatriating them or granting them asylum" Colonel Pearson said.
About 80 interviewers from the Immigration and Naturalization Service are to begin arriving on Saturday to hear the Haitians' appeals and judge whether "they have a well-founded fear of persecution," said Seth Libby, a senior immigration officer.
If asylum is granted, the Government looks for a sponsor in the United States, which takes about two weeks. If not, the refugees will be sent back to Haiti.
The Haitians fill their days playing soccer, checkers, cards and dominoes. The camps serve three meals a day, mostly rice and beans served with meat. The American troops are trying to soften the spartan conditions at the tent city and at a second site, Camp Bulkeley, where Haitians granted asylum live in cinder-block barracks.
Each Haitian gets a "comfort package" of a tooth brush, tooth paste, shirt, plastic sandals and towel, and a bucket to put it all in. Soldiers have bought dolls for some of the little girls.
Colonel Pearson said he is ordering camouflage netting to drape over the rolls of barbed wire that give Camp Bulkeley the appearance of a prison. The wire is for crowd control, but he acknowledged that "it looks pretty intimidating."
The officer also noted that graffiti scrawled on the barrack's cinder blocks -- "This Place Is for Animals" -- was left over from the last group of refugees two years ago, and was not the handiwork of the new arrivals.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Attack Under Investigation
 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, July 1 (Special to The New York Times) -- United States Embassy officials said today that they were investigating reports that Haitian soldiers had fired on boat people, leading to a panic in which at least 30 refugees drowned.
The incident was first reported on Thursday by two foreign journalists who quoted witnesses who said they saw the police fire three shots as the refugees were waiting to board a boat in Nan L'Etat, a hamlet 15 miles east of Les Cayes, on the southern coast.
The journalists, Edward J. Barnes of Time magazine and Simon Dring of the BBC, who arrived at the scene on Wednesday afternoon, several hours after the incident, said witnesses told them that most of the victims had been women and children.
Haitian military spokesmen would not comment on the report.
"If it's true, then it's typical of the repressive nature of the de facto Government," said Stanley Schrager, an Embassy spokesman.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rise With Dollar On a Light Trading Day

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The dollar paused yesterday and stock traders, or at least the few that were left on Wall Street, were relieved.
After five consecutive sessions of declines, the dollar rallied against both the Japanese yen and the German mark. And in light trading, the stock market rallied moderately as traders began the long Fourth of July weekend. 
 Stocks generally followed the course of bonds, whose yields were again close to the highest levels of the year, but whose prices were virtually unchanged. Commodities prices fell slightly, but not enough to calm traders' inflation concerns.
 
Below-Normal Volume
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.69 points, to 3,646.65, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.93 points, to 446.20. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 0.89 point, to 706.85.
The volume on the New York Stock Exchange was far below normal, with about 199 million shares changing hands, about 32 percent below this year's average daily volume of 293 million shares.
Blue-chip stocks rose, including the Aluminum Company of America and International Paper, as well as oil producers like Exxon and soft-drink companies like Coca-Cola. Also rising were over-the-counter stocks like Intel and MCI Communications.
The share price of CBS, which confirmed on Thursday that it was in negotiations to merge with QVC, fell 6 points, to 307, after generally positive assessments of the proposed deal by Wall Street analysts and a sharp run-up on Thursday.
 
Dollar Rebounds a Bit
 The dollar stopped its fall, for now. After more than a week of establishing post-World War II lows, it rose slightly against leading currencies. It moved up to 98.75 yen, from 98.49 yen on Thursday. Against the German mark, the dollar rose to 1.5995 marks, from 1.5875 marks.
While the dollar has receded somewhat from traders' concerns, in part because of the truncated holiday week next week, the political turmoil in Japan and what is seen as the short-term intractability of the United States' trade deficit with Japan, the issue remains important.
A declining dollar makes assets in dollars, including stocks, less attractive, particularly to foreign investors. Thus, it puts pressure on the Federal Reserve, whose policy-making committee is to meet on Tuesday, to raise interest rates a fifth time this year.
 But not all foreign investors are equally disadvantaged by a weak dollar. For instance, if Spanish investors had bought the Dow industrial stocks 12 months ago, they would have had a modest return of 3.88 percent in dollars for the last 12 months. But when converted to Spanish pesetas, that return would improve to 5.6 percent.
The New York Stock Exchange's composite index rose 1.18 points, to 246.34, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining issues by 1,282 to 810. The American Stock Exchange market value index moved up 0.64 point, to 424.72.
The most active stock was Microsoft, with 4.2 million shares traded. It fell 1 1/4, to 50 1/4, as technology stocks retreated. There have been reports that the Justice Department is in the final stages of an antitrust examination of the company.

HEADLINE: THE SIMPSON CASE: THE COURTHOUSE;
The Crowd Consensus: 'Turn the Juice Loose'

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 1

 BODY:
Two weeks ago Denise Brown buried her sister, Nicole Brown Simpson. Today, again dressed in black, she walked past the vendors selling 10 T-shirt styles all proclaiming O. J. Simpson's innocence -- "Save O. J.," "Turn the Juice Loose" -- past bystanders yelling that O. J. was framed, past the lone man with the megaphone trying to talk about the victim, past the ubiquitous television cameras.
Ms. Brown, who once modeled for Vogue magazine, looked straight ahead as she went through a metal detector, rode the elevator to the ninth floor, passed through a second metal detector and entered the small courtroom. The television commentators keep telling viewers that Nicole Brown's two sisters, Denise and Dominique, and her mother, Judy Brown, are there, while Mr. Simpson, they say, has no family members in the courtroom. 
 It is as if they are declaring that the man charged with slashing to death his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, could not possibly be related to the Browns. The last time they were all together was at the funeral. For two days now, they have been together in Room 9-311. The parents of the other victim, Ronald L. Goldman, have also been there.
 
Brown Family Noncommittal
 Denise Brown has said she does not want to discuss the case, adding that the Brown family will not criticize the father of Nicole's children. Denise's father, Lou Brown, has made only one comment to reporters this week, saying that the last phone call his wife had with Nicole was at 10 P.M., a statement that seemed to undercut Mr. Simpson's alibi.
There are only 65 seats, and there is a seating chart. In one way it is like a wedding, with a section designated for Mrs. Simpson's family -- as well as Mr. Goldman's -- and another for Mr. Simpson's. In Mr. Simpson's section were friends and lawyers.
There are 25 seats for news reporters, and 10 for the public. To get one of those 10 seats for today's hearing, Sharon Rogers left her 2-year-old son with a baby sitter and staked out a position in front of the courthouse at 7:30 Thursday night.
This is a city obsessed by sensational trials and lawsuits. People here name them as if they were earthquakes, or hurricanes: McMartin, Rodney King (two separate trials), Damian Williams, Michael Jackson, Heidi Fleiss, the Menendez brothers. Ms. Rogers was in the courtroom when Damian Williams and his co-defendants were acquitted of many of the charges in the beating of Reginald Denny, a truck driver, at the start of the Los Angeles riots in April 1992.
Unlike most of the people in the crowd today, Ms. Rogers said she is waiting to hear all the evidence before making a judgment about Mr. Simpson. "Everyone loves him," she said. "It's hard to imagine he did this."
Richard Burns, who arrived at the courthouse 11:30 Thursday night, also got a seat. But this morning Mr. Burns, an unemployed aerospace worker, was disappointed: He didn't get a look at the enlarged police photographs of the victims, which the prosecutor, Marcia Clark, had displayed before one witness.
"I wanted to see what they looked like," Mr. Burns said during a break. "I wanted to see how badly they were stabbed. The reports have said it was pretty bad."
In front of the courthouse, Josie Scieneaux, a vacationing loan officer at a bank, announced the consensus of the crowd, saying, "We think O. J. was framed."
Anthony Bryant, a hotel custodian on his morning off, agreed. "He could've received a phone call saying something had happened at his ex-wife's house," he said. "He saw the body and then ran into the house to check on his kids."
Ms. Scieneaux nodded. "Thank you!" she said. "He ran upstairs to check on his kids. He could've gotten blood on himself when he hugged the body. He saw his ex-wife -- you still love this person -- and he hugged her."
Mr. Bryant said: "Then he panicked. He said: 'What am I going to do now?' "
Ms. Scieneaux: "Thank you! He panicked."
 
'Couldn't Leave Him Alone'
 Ms. Scieneaux brushed off the 1989 police report describing Mr. Simpson's spousal abuse. "I think they had a fight, like any husband and wife," she said. "My husband used to hit me. I left Louisiana to get away from him. O. J. must not have been so bad. This woman couldn't leave him alone."
Rory Felix has sold T-shirts for the Rodney King trial, the Northridge earthquake and the Malibu fire. Today he was selling an O. J. Simpson T-shirt. The slogan: "Media -- Can I Get an Ounce of Truth? Not a Shred of Evidence."
"O. J.'s going to be the biggest seller," Mr. Felix said.
He added that he believed in his product. "I grew up in L.A.," he said. "I idolize O. J. He didn't do it."
Another vendor, Perris Clark, said his T-shirt -- "Let the Juice Loose" -- was inspired by Mr. Simpson's televised drive down the freeway.
"I'm not going to say who did it," Mr. Clark said. "But O. J. didn't do it. Did you look in his face? Look in his face. He didn't do it. If he did it, why would he have gone to the funeral? You have to be a strong person to do that."
 
Dismissing the Competition
 Nearby were nine competitors, all selling T-shirts for $10. Then two newcomers appeared with a new T-shirt -- "Say It Ain't So, O. J." -- for a bargain $8. Mr. Clark eyed them suspiciously. "They're capitalists," he said. "They're just here for the money. I'm trying to uplift my community."
For two days now, the prosecutors have been laying out the evidence that they hope will bring O. J. Simpson to trial. With all the attention focused on what is happening inside Courtroom 9-311, it is as if there is only one case in all of Los Angeles.
But there are more than 60 courtrooms in the Los Angeles Criminal Courts Building. Dana Rannels, 24, emerged from one this morning after testifying in a preliminary hearing involving accusations that her boyfriend assaulted her.
Ms. Rannels said she was testifying on behalf of her boyfriend, whom she declined to name. She attacked him first, she said. They struggled with an iron, she said, which ended up pressed against her face, chipping a tooth.
Leaving the courthouse, Ms. Rannels bought a "Save O. J." T-shirt. "I'm going to stand by him," she said. "I don't believe he did it."
Mr. Simpson's history of spousal abuse did not matter, she said. "I know how it happens," she added. "Why bring it back up now?"
Ozell Roberson, a 59-year-old chauffeur, was there today for Nicole Brown Simpson. He said he had made four trips to the town house where she died to leave flowers.
"Let's not forget the victims," he said.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Watches Its New-Issues Business Tumble

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The volume of new stock and bond issues tumbled in the second quarter to the lowest level since the third quarter of 1991 amid volatile financial markets and rising interest rates.
The decline was bad news for Wall Street, which saw quarterly underwriting fees fall to the lowest level in nearly three years. 
 The falloff in business during the second quarter continued a slide that began in early February, when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time since 1989.
For the first half of 1994, the total volume of new stock and bonds sold domestically fell to $437.8 billion, according to the Securities Data Corporation, a Manhattan research firm, down 18 percent from the first six months of 1993. If not for a busy January, the numbers for the first half of the year would have looked even worse.
That point was underscored by what happened in the second quarter.
 
40% Drop From '93
 During the last three months, companies issued a total of $159.9 billion of new stocks and bonds, a drop of almost 40 percent from the comparable period a year ago, when $264.4 billion in new debt and equity was sold. Largely because of a strong January, new-issue volume in the first quarter totaled $262.1 billion. In the third quarter of 1991, domestic issuance of new stocks and bonds totaled $149.3 billion, Securities Data said. The second quarter was the worst since then.
As the year began, Wall Street executives were resigned to a business slowdown, if only because so much financing was done during the early 1990's, when interest rates were falling and stock prices were rising. But the magnitude of the decline, caused mainly by the sharp rise in interest rates since early February, caught everyone by surprise.
"Since the beginning of the year, yields on 10-year Treasury notes have risen by more than 1.50 percentage points," said Richard B. Dubusc, a managing director in the syndicated loan department at CS First Boston.
"Nobody expected that kind of a wrenching rise, and when you see something like that you sort of suspend your belief in hopes it will get better," he added. "In this sort of environment, people are funding themselves defensively, either in the commercial paper market, or through the issuance of floating rate notes."
According to Securities Data, the volume of new debt issued fell by nearly 39 percent, to $141.2 billion, from the second quarter of 1993.
But to many on Wall Street, the comparisons with what went on in 1993 are irrelevant.
"People have to keep in mind that 1993 was an aberration," said Thomas W. Davis, head of stock-capital markets at Merrill Lynch & Company.
"Virtually every month of last year was good," Mr. Davis added. "Even in 1991 and 1992, which were record years, there were tough periods. Right now we are in a tough period."
Rising interest rates and a drop in the value of the dollar also hampered new equity issues, even though the stock market spent much of the quarter moving nervously sideways.
Common stock volume totaled $14.3 billion during the quarter, down more than 30 percent from the $20.6 billion issued in the second three months of 1993.
The stock market's twists and turns were particularly frightening for companies coming to market for the first time.
During the quarter, companies raised $8.5 billion through initial public offerings, down more than 21 percent from $10.7 billion in the second quarter last year.
Not surprisingly, the steep drop in underwriting activity has had a negative impact on Wall Street's bottom line.
Underwriting fees last quarter were $1.3 billion, Securities Data said, the worst three-month period since the third quarter of 1991, when fees totaled $1 billion. In the second quarter of last year, underwriting fees were $2.2 billion.
 
Merrill Lynch Leads Again
 Merrill Lynch, the perennial underwriting leader since 1988, held on to the top spot last quarter. The company issued $26.9 billion of securities, 16.8 percent of the market, but down from its market-leading 18 percent share during the second quarter of 1993.
Kidder, Peabody, which surprised many on Wall Street when it vaulted into second place in underwritings in the first quarter on the strength of its dominance in issuing collateralized mortgage obligations, or C.M.O.'s, fell back to seventh place in the second quarter.
During the last three months, the firm has been besieged by an array of problems that in June prompted the General Electric Company, its parent, to make changes in its top management.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: BEHIND THE SCENES;
For Once, Powerhouse Can't Produce the Votes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
For years, Representative John D. Dingell has been one of the most intrepid investigators and dominant committee chairmen in Congress.
He has taken on the Pentagon, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Institutes of Health. He has exposed unsafe blood banks, bottled water and pacemakers. He has championed civil rights bills and blocked gun control measures. His fingerprints are on every piece of energy and environmental legislation that has been enacted in a generation. 
 And this week, after 39 years in Congress, years in which he has made more friends and more enemies than most members of Congress have constituents, Mr. Dingell, a 67-year-old Democrat from the outskirts of Detroit, suffered the biggest disappointment of his career. He sent a letter on Tuesday to the Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, saying he would be unable to muster enough votes in his Energy and Commerce Committee to approve a health care bill.
"I tried; damn, I tried," Mr. Dingell said in an interview in his office afterward. "It was simply not possible to do."
He had been unable to find a way to finance guaranteed medical insurance for all Americans that was acceptable to a majority of the 44 members of his committee, and he had refused to put out a bill that fell short of universal coverage.
 
A Monument to His Father
 Passing a universal health insurance bill with his name on it has been Mr. Dingell's goal since he entered the House in 1955 to fill a seat left vacant by the death of his father, John David Dingell Sr., to whom the bill was supposed to be a monument.
The elder Mr. Dingell survived tuberculosis as a young man and became a union leader and then a New Deal Congressman. In 1943, he sponsored the first national health insurance bill to be introduced in the House.
At the beginning of every session since the son entered Congress, he has introduced national health insurance legislation and has arranged to have it numbered H.R. 16, the number of his and his father's Congressional district.
"My dad believed, and I have always believed, that from a humanitarian standpoint it was the most important thing we could do for the country," Mr. Dingell said.
"And now," he continued, "it has ceased to be just a question of humanitarian concern. It has become an economic concern. Health care costs are going to break the country."
 
A Non-Negotiable Issue
 Mr. Dingell could have shepherded through his committee a watered-down bill that would not have guaranteed medical insurance for every American, but he refused. "Almost anything else is negotiable," he said. "Universal coverage is not."
So rather than produce a bill that would compete with those promising universal coverage that have come out of the Ways and Means Committee and the Education and Labor Committee, he swallowed his disappointment, folded his cards and cashed in his chips.
"I'm not going to dilute the currency of the President and the other committees by putting out bad coinage," he said.
Mr. Dingell blames Republicans for his failure and particularly "the religious right, the far right, who are committed to one principle alone, and that's rule or ruin."
"This is the most bitterly partisan, angry, divided Congress I have ever seen," he said.
 
A Problem of His Making
 All 17 Republicans on his committee were committed to voting against a health bill that bore even the slightest resemblance to what President Clinton proposed.
But Mr. Dingell had an additional problem, and it was largely of his own making. Five of the 27 Democrats on the committee were also prepared to vote against him: Jim Cooper of Tennessee, Ralph M. Hall of Texas, J. Roy Rowland of Georgia, Jim Slattery of Kansas and W. J. (Billy) Tauzin of Louisiana.
That was enough to deny him a majority. It was also a result of Mr. Dingell's own scheming. In the 1980's, Speakers Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. and Jim Wright more or less let Mr. Dingell choose the Democrats who would be on his committee. Most, if not all, of the five recalcitrant ones this year were picked by Mr. Dingell because he could count on them to vote against pollution legislation being fought by the automobile industry.
Mr. Foley does not give Mr. Dingell such free rein. But the chairman conceded that "some of those I didn't want are standing with me now better than some of those I did want."
 
The Battle Yet to Fight
 Mr. Dingell said he expected the House, after a ferocious fight and with few if any Republican votes, to pass a health bill that would guarantee insurance for all. But he said he had much less confidence that a bill acceptable to him could be passed by the Senate and clear a House-Senate conference committee.
He said he expected to be a member of the conference committee and to have a chance to work on writing the final legislation, and he is determined to block those who opposed him from having that opportunity. He is especially furious with Mr. Cooper, who is sponsoring an alternative to the President's plan.
He also plans an intense investigation of the health insurance industry, which he says is greedy, corrupt and partly responsible for the difficulty in attaining a national health bill.
And what would his father say about all this?
Mr. Dingell turned in his chair and looked at the photograph of his father, a small man with a mustache, on the cabinet behind his desk.
"He'd say, 'Son, you did right,' " the Congressman responded. "Dad was above all things else a practical politician."

Treasury Prices Seesaw In Pre-Holiday Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities seesawed yesterday in an abbreviated and thinly traded pre-holiday session after a series of conflicting economic reports that failed to generate more concern about inflation and higher interest rates.
Victoria M. Schwatka, a senior vice president for Legg Mason Capital Management in Baltimore, said there was so little trading activity that she wondered whether anyone had bothered to go to work. 
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 2/32 , to 848/32 , to yield 7.60 percent, down from 7.61 percent on Thursday. Shorter-maturity bills were higher, with the rate of a three-month issue up 6 basis points, to 4.18 percent, and a six-month issue up a basis point, to 4.64 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The dollar, which the market has tracked closely during the last few sessions, was mixed against most leading currencies yesterday. Mrs. Schwatka said she thought it was a good sign that the dollar was not down against all the currencies.
 
Commodity Prices Slip
 Commodity prices, another recent market irritant, were subdued yesterday, as the Commodity Research Bureau index of prices slipped 0.40 point, to 229.99.
The Government's gauge of future economic growth, the index of leading economic indicators, was unchanged in May, the Commerce Department said. "I was a little surprised, " Mrs. Schwatka said of the data. "If I had made a prediction, it may have been for a touch lower, and that would have been a long-term trend."
The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its June index of manufacturing was 57.5, down from 57.7 in May, in line with expectations.
The prices-paid component index rose to 75.5, from 71.5 in May, and the highest since August 1988. Analysts said that while the gain was not surprising, it was disconcerting for the market, which is already sensitized to price increases. "That component made people uncomfortable," Mrs. Schwatka said.
Analysts said the purchasing management group's June report affirmed the continued strength in the manufacturing sector. The new orders index remained strong, rising to 62.6 percent, from 59.8 percent, as production edged back slightly to 57.5 percent. Similarly, the order backlog component eased to 60 percent. Employment slipped to 49.1 percent, from 52 percent, with the 73.5 reading on the price index the highest since August 1988.
 
Consumer Sentiment Index
 The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for June declined to 91.2 from a preliminary reading of 94.5 and from 92.8 in May. Construction spending rose nine-tenths of a percent, and was in line with expectations.
The rise in the purchasing management group's price component caused a brief dip in Treasuries, though the decline in the University of Michigan's sentiment index may have tempered the impact.
Market participants appeared to be apprehensive ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee's meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday, and next week's monthly employment report scheduled for release on Friday.
The expectations are increasing that the Fed will make a move on interest rates. "I've heard that the Federal Reserve is looking to string any kind of numbers together as an excuse to raise interest rates," Mrs. Schwatka said. She added that there was speculation that the committee might give the chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, "the green light to raise rates for the fifth time this year, when he sees fit."
Rising confidence in the European bond market that the Fed will raise rates may have allowed the dollar to rebound against some European currencies, and in turn may have given some support to bond prices.

HEADLINE: New Data Suggest Slow Economic Growth

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
More statistical evidence emerged today that the economy is advancing at a moderate pace, though a June survey of factory purchasing managers suggested that inflation may be set to rise.
The Government said its chief forecasting gauge of economic activity, the index of leading economic indicators, was unchanged again in May, while construction spending rose nine-tenths of 1 percent, the third consecutive monthly increase. 
 The Commerce Department said the index of leading indicators remained at 101.2 in May, matching its record high but showing no movement since March. The Government began the index in 1948.
 Analysts said the trend was further confirmation that the economy was cooling but was still in good shape. Most had expected the index to rise slightly in May.
"It should give some comfort to the financial markets, which were beginning to get another case of the 'we're growing too fast' blues," said Martin A. Regalia of the United States Chamber of Commerce.
David Orr, an economist with the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., said: "My perception is we're having a mini-slowdown. It's the ebb and flow of consumer cash flow. The rate of growth has slowed, but the level of activity is fine."
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity, has shown signs of slowing from the pace that fueled the surge in growth at the end of last year.
Some of the slack caused by leveling consumer demand, particularly for cars, new houses and other expensive items, is taken up by increased spending by businesses for factories and equipment, economists say.
Still, there were signs that consumers could be paying higher prices in the coming months for manufactured goods. A June survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management showed that more factories were paying higher prices in June than at any time in nearly six years.
The survey's broader barometer of manufacturing growth showed a mild decline in the rate of industrial expansion. But the results showed that manufacturing continued to expand, for the 10th consecutive month.
The Government's index of 11 forward-looking statistics is intended to predict economic activity six to nine months in the future. Three consecutive moves by the index in the same direction are considered a good gauge of the economy's direction.
The index had a gain of seven-tenths of 1 percent in March, its eighth consecutive increase before the current flat period.
 
Building Activity Is Up
 The construction spending reports showed increases for all leading sectors, including houses, businesses and schools. The Commerce Department said spending for all categories totaled $504.2 billion, up from a revised $499.5 billion in April, when spending increased seven-tenths of 1 percent.
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for June declined to 91.2, from 92.8 in May, an indication that the outlook for the economy had soured slightly.
Economic growth is expected to be more subdued in the next six months as the full effects of rising interest rates are felt.

48 Years Devoted To J.F.K. Are Over

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 1

 BODY:
Dave Powers began working for John F. Kennedy in 1946 and did not stop until today, when he retired as curator of the John F. Kennedy Library.
He heard Kennedy's first political speech in Boston and his last in Fort Worth. He was one of the President's closest aides, more of a First Friend than a policy maker. And after the assassination in Dallas -- where he helped carry the President from the Lincoln convertible into Parkland Memorial Hospital -- he devoted the rest of his life to preserving the Kennedy legacy. 
 It was more than 48 years ago that a young man showed up on Mr. Powers's doorstep and introduced himself as Jack Kennedy. Mr. Powers was an unemployed veteran living with his widowed sister and her eight children on the top floor of a three-decker tenement in Charlestown, the working-class Irish neighborhood surrounding Bunker Hill. Mr. Kennedy, an ambassador's son with a Harvard education, was mounting his first campaign for Congress. A Democratic worker had directed him to Mr. Powers as someone who knew the neighborhood, someone with political savvy who could help him.
The two men went over to the American Legion Hall, where Mr. Kennedy spoke to a group of women who had lost their sons in the war, telling them about the death of his brother Joseph. "He wasn't a great speaker, but he was an honest, sincere speaker," Mr. Powers remembered. "He looked out at these Gold Star Mothers and he said, 'I think I know how you feel, because my mother is a Gold Star Mother.' It was amazing. The women all said that he reminded them of their boys."
Their friendship began when the speech ended. During the next 18 years the two men went from house parties during the Congressional campaign to ladies' teas during the Senate race to state dinners at the White House.
Mr. Powers, now 82, was known for his sense of humor. Pierre Salinger, Kennedy's press secretary, said he was "the most gregarious and popular member of the staff."
People who served in the Administration still talk about the time the deputy premier of the Soviet Union, Anastas Mikoyan, arrived to see the President. "Are you the real Mikoyan?" Mr. Powers asked him. Then there was the state dinner that President Kennedy gave for the Shah of Iran. "You're my kind of Shah," Mr. Powers told the guest of honor.
After the assassination, Robert F. Kennedy asked Mr. Powers to catalogue the gifts that the President had received in office. "We had 16,657 three-dimensional objects," Mr. Powers said, displaying the prodigious memory that enabled him to recite the tallies of every one of his boss's elections.
And he has spent the last 30 years caring for those objects and more. In 1965 he moved them to the National Archives Federal Record Center in Waltham, Mass., where he and a staff of archivists spent the next 14 years assembling the Kennedy collection. In 1979 the collection was moved into the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum, which is housed in a large white I. M. Pei building overlooking Boston Harbor.
When the museum was refurbished last October, Mr. Powers gave the first official tour to President Clinton, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and the rest of the Kennedy family.
The museum has a director, who is in charge of the administration and the archives. As curator, Mr. Powers was responsible for the objects.
"Dave Powers is a great repository of lore about the Kennedy years," said Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the historian and former Kennedy aide. "He is filled with Irish stories, with political stories." Many of those stories are collected in a reminiscence, "Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye" (Little, Brown & Company, 1970), which Mr. Powers wrote with Kenneth P. O'Donnell and Joe McCarthy.
The walls of Mr. Powers's office are covered with photographs and mementos, like the 50th birthday plaque he received from President Kennedy. "In recognition of your athletic ability in hiking to my icebox to drink my Heinekens," it says.
And ever since the Wisconsin primary he has worn the same "Kennedy in '60" tie clip in the shape of the PT-109, the vessel Kennedy made famous after World War II. As he spoke, Mr. Powers packed a Waterford crystal football -- a retirement gift from Senator Edward M. Kennedy -- into a plastic blue shoulder bag with fading white letters spelling out "White House Press."

HEADLINE: Q&A

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane

 BODY:

Withdrawing From I.R.A.
Q. When you choose the "term certain" method for withdrawing I.R.A. money, what percentage of the total holdings is withdrawn at age 70 1/2?
E. ALBRECHT, Flushing, Queens
 
A. Term certain is one of two primary ways that minimum distributions can be made from an individual retirement account. Distributions must begin by April 1 after the year in which you become 70 1/2. If you are 70 1/2 and base withdrawals on your own life expectancy, you must withdraw at least 6.25 percent in the first year under the term certain method. If you and your spouse are 70 1/2 and use joint life expectancy, you must withdraw at least 4.85 percent in the first year.
"The payment would change each year because both factors used in the calculation -- the I.R.A. balance and the life expectancy -- change each year," said Joseph J. Seymour, director of retirement services of the Quest For Value mutual funds. "The term certain method means the length of time over which the account to be distributed is certain. It does not mean that the amount of payment is certain." 
 The rate at which distributions are made if the account holder dies after starting withdrawals depends on whether the beneficiary is a spouse. Spouses can roll over the money into retirement accounts. Distribution rules are listed in Section 401(a)(9) of the Tax Code and summarized in Internal Revenue Service Publication 590.
 
Withholding From 401(k)
Q. When I roll over my 401(k) into an I.R.A., is my employer required to withhold 20 percent from my 401(k)?
PERRY M. STEWART, Yellow Springs, Ohio
 
A. It depends on whether you roll over the account directly or take a distribution and then roll it over yourself. If you ask your employer to transfer the funds directly, withholding is not required.
But when you take the distribution, your employer must withhold 20 percent of the amount received, even if you intend to put it into an individual retirement account within 60 days. When you file your tax return for the year, you can ask that the amount be refunded.
A complication may arise for people who have borrowed money from their accounts. "Be careful," said Melvin W. Borleis, managing director of William M. Mercer Inc., a benefits consulting firm. "If you have borrowed against your 401(k) account and that loan is paid off by using a portion of your account, then you may owe taxes later."

Cyclical Stocks Defined
Q. What are "cyclical" or "economically sensitive" stocks?
BEATRICE WEBER, West Palm Beach, Fla.
 
A. Such stocks belong to companies whose performances are closely linked to the economy, and their prices tend to rise and fall with the economic cycle. Auto, steel and machinery companies are considered cyclical because their products are in greater demand when the economy is expanding. .
"The converse of cyclical stocks are those that supply necessities -- the purchase of which cannot be easily postponed until the next economic upturn," said Robert N. Gordon, president of Twenty-First Securities. "These include companies such as food and drug manufacturers."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Shows Some Gains After a Week of Declines

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen yesterday for the first time in a week and gained against other currencies in light trading. But the market remained bearish about prospects for the dollar.
Dealers avoided making big trades ahead of next week's summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations and a meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making board. Either meeting could have a large impact on interest rates and international currency policies. 
 "Everyone is sitting tight; we have a big week coming up," said Win Thin, an economist at MCM Currencywatch Inc. "People are not being too aggressive either way."
Speculative pressure on the dollar eased in advance of the three-day holiday weekend in the United States. Although European and Asian markets will be open on Monday, American financial markets will be closed in observance of the Fourth of July.
The dollar started the day by falling to yet another record low in Tokyo, hitting 97.73 yen, but the Bank of Japan reportedly then intervened. Later in Europe, the dollar rallied strongly, rising close to the 100-yen level.
But the dollar began to retreat when the American financial markets opened. In late New York trading, it was quoted at 98.75 yen, up from 98.49 yen on Thursday.
It also rose in New York to 1.5955 German marks, from 1.5875 marks on Thursday.
Traders cited weakening bond prices for the dollar's erosion in New York yesterday. They expect further declines unless Washington and other governments take stronger action to support the dollar against the yen.
"You can talk about technical factors and a lot of other things people look at," said Cyrus Whitney, chief trader for Commerzbank in New York. "There's a confidence crisis, and that's not going to change for a while."
That is why traders are focusing on the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday and the Group of Seven summit meeting on Friday.
"The market is waiting to see what action the central banks and the G-7 nations take," said Tom Benfer, director of foreign exchange for the Bank of Montreal in New York. "If there's no concrete action, it will be a green light to sell dollars."
An increase in American interest rates would probably push up the dollar by making dollar-denominated assets more attractive. But economists say the Fed is unlikely to act simply to support the dollar against the Japanese yen.
More likely is coordinated action by the Group of Seven to prevent a further weakening of the dollar. More declines in the dollar could hamper economic recoveries in Europe and Japan by depressing their exports to the United States.

HEADLINE: Six Major-Party Candidates Compete in an Open Race to Succeed Weicker

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn., July 1

 BODY:
The issues in Connecticut's race for governor have already been decided. Among the six Democrats and Republicans campaigning to succeed Lowell P. Weicker Jr., everyone agrees that the state needs more jobs and less crime.
But as the Weicker era comes to a close, neither major party is agreed on who will represent its cause on the ballot come November. At this stage, the public barely knows who is running. 
 One result is an unusually open race in a state once noted for strong party leadership, especially among the generation of Democrats raised in the ways of John M. Bailey, the powerful state and national chairman in John F. Kennedy's day.
Both parties say this election is critical. A united party could return the Democrats, who finished third in 1990, to the office they have lost only twice in 40 years. Unity could elevate the Republicans to a chair they have not captured since 1972.
Still, some of the strongest potential candidates have opted not to run. Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and United States Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, both Democrats, announced that they would not run for governor. So did United States Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a Republican.
Four Democrats -- State Senator John B. Larson of East Hartford, State Senator Richard J. Balducci of Newington, State Comptroller William E. Curry Jr. and Mayor Joseph P. Ganim of Bridgeport -- are going to their party's convention on July 16, and a September primary is expected.
 
'Going to Give You a Choice'
 Among Republicans, Secretary of the State Pauline R. Kezer is intent on waging a primary, even though the party's 1990 candidate, John G. Rowland, has a large majority of delegates to its July 23 convention.
"I'm going to give you a choice on who to select for governor," Mrs. Kezer, the only Republican elected to a statewide office in 20 years, told the Greenwich Republican Town Committee last week as they met over veal parmigiana and surf and turf at a steakhouse here.
"In 1990 I won my race," she said. "John Rowland did not. Republicans need other voters, and I can appeal to them."
With the nominating conventions weeks away, the candidates are conducting several campaigns at once: courting delegates; reaching out to the voters who will take over once the conventions end, and trying to raise the money that makes it all possible.
Polls show that only Mr. Rowland, a former United States Representative from Waterbury who spent $3 million in 1990, is widely known to voters. The polls also show him with wide leads over Mrs. Kezer, all of the Democrats and Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark, Mr. Weicker's successor in A Connecticut Party, a party the Governor created in 1990.
Mr. Rowland moved this week to solidify his position at the convention by announcing his choice for a running mate as lieutenant governor, State Representative M. Jodi Rell, who has represented the town of Brookfield in Fairfield County since 1984.
 
From Town to Town
 But the polls also show that people are not paying attention yet. Given all the possible match-ups among candidates, a large majority of those surveyed had no preference in nearly every pairing. And so the candidates see no doors closed yet as they speed from town to town, from party meeting to union picnic, from talk show to television taping, their stump speeches already honed, their identities ready to emerge.
"After the convention, the delegate counts don't matter," said Jane Ciarleglio, the campaign manager for Mr. Balducci, a former House Speaker, who she says is on the threshold of qualifying for a primary with 15 percent of his convention's 1,476 delegates.
In the Groton Public Library, signs of southeastern Connecticut's economic distress are everywhere. People study relocation information at the Job Search Center. A notice on a newspaper rack says the Sunday help-wanted sections from Boston, New York and Washington are held at the reference desk.
 
A Brief Appearance
 In a meeting room, the Democratic Town Committee is waiting for Senator Larson. An aide, Thomas Moukawsher, fills the time with a plea for party unity.
Mr. Larson, the Senate president and his party's best known hopeful, has the record of a classic Connecticut Democrat, progressive on social issues (an early advocate of family-leave legislation), fiscally conservative (he resisted the income tax). A 45-year-old Irish Catholic, he carries a bit of the Kennedys in his voice and manner.
As his aides are quick to point out, he also carries the support of party leaders, he is raising the most money and he has advertised on television. As the convention approaches, he is laboring to set himself apart as the Democrat who can win.
Mr. Larson, arriving late from halfway across the state, has time to thank the Groton delegation for its support -- he has been a strong advocate for the region's submarine-based industries -- and to answer one question before the library closes for the night, ending the meeting.
At Quassy Amusement Park in Middlebury, Mr. Curry stands on a picnic table to address state maintenance workers eating hot dogs and drinking beer at their union's annual picnic. As Comptroller, he has had the luxury of being a critic in residence the last four years, commenting on the state budget without having to vote on it or, like Senator Larson, to reject arbitrated pay raises for unions like the one he is addressing. He is counting on strong union support in a primary.
At 42, Mr. Curry also eerily echoes the Kennedys, especially in a knack for relaxed humor. On WATR, a Waterbury radio station, a caller asks if he is a liberal, and Mr. Curry states a familiar Connecticut creed: "I was born in a family that believed if you didn't vote Democratic, you couldn't be buried in the Catholic Church."
His fuller answer: yes, if liberal means believing that government can help people; no, if it means tax and spend.
 
'It Could Be a Lot Better'
 Mr. Curry is in a close race with Mr. Larson for delegates, but he has counted on a primary all along because his support is with the grass-roots organizations he has long worked with. With the perspective of an outsider, he disarms talk-show callers who gripe about the state government.
"It's never going to be perfect," he told one. "It's never going to be like a business. But it could be a lot better."
Senator Balducci and Mayor Ganim, with the fewest delegates, are under the most pressure to step aside for party unity. Mr. Balducci, praised for his leadership as House speaker in the state's 1991 fiscal crisis, has rejected overtures from Mr. Larson, Mr. Curry and state officials to run for lieutenant governor.
Mr. Ganim, his support limited to Bridgeport, has annoyed legislators in both Hartford and Bridgeport with television advertisements that take credit for reversing Bridgeport's fortunes while criticizing the Legislature for inaction this year.
Among the Republicans, Mr. Rowland is concentrating on raising money and trying to pry delegates from Mrs. Kezer to block a primary. At the Greenwich Town Committee, he attacked the state's new prisons as "Club Meds," vowed to eliminate the income tax, and cited his lead in the polls.
Talking about crime, he said, "You may think that here in Greenwich we're safe, but we're not."
Mrs. Kezer must make the case that a Republican primary is worthwhile, and her case is that Connecticut voters are more moderate than Mr. Rowland. She promised a voice for all voters, referendums and initiatives, term limits on state offices.
A town committee member asked grumpily how she would get state employees to work more than 35 hours a week. She replied, "They are paid for 35 hours, and the state can't afford to pay for more."
The answer, she said, was better management. "You'll never, ever be able to change state government if you go in and try to bash people over the head," she said. A handful of people applauded.

HEADLINE: Tire Recycling Works, And It's Also the Law

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The National Association of Counties has listed waste tires as its No. 1 solid-waste problem. Unfortunately, a well-financed special interest campaign is distorting the benefits associated with implementing a section of United States transportation law that requires federally supported highways to use a small percentage of discarded tires in highway asphalt (Section 1038 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act). 
 The use of asphalt containing "crumb rubber" is commercially viable, environmentally superior and cost-effective, and was wisely endorsed by both houses of Congress and signed into law by President Bush in 1990. It will reduce the long-term costs of highway maintenance and help improve our management of resources and waste materials.
Delay in putting this provision into practice would not only undermine the enormous efforts of cities and counties throughout the country to deal with waste tires economically and in an environmentally suitable way, but would also inflict great damage on enlightened investors who have put millions of dollars into this environmentally oriented market opportunity.

HEADLINE: Dedicated Lawyers for Indigent Are a Bargain;
Anti-Taxpayer Verdicts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Jury awards against public entities in personal-injury lawsuits have grown ominously. New York City's payout alone has gone up every year since 1986 -- the last time the State Legislature attempted tort reform -- from $103.7 million to nearly $260 million in this fiscal year. 
 Many claims are exaggerated, and some are downright fraudulent. Equally troubling, approximately one-third of every dollar paid goes into the pockets of a few hundred personal-injury lawyers. Nationwide, such lawyers collect more than $15 billion a year in contingency fees!
Yet a June 17 front-page article asks readers to believe there is no problem. Unfortunately, we are not told about the sampling methods your sources used. Moreover, the conclusion that jury verdicts have come out of the stratosphere is contradicted by the president of the local plaintiffs' bar association whom you quote.
In many cases that go to trial, the plaintiff has a significant injury but a weak liability claim. Such cases are more likely to wind up in a so-called defendant's verdict, but often they result in "sympathy" verdicts. When plaintiffs with essentially meritless claims read of a subway mugger who recovers millions, it encourages them to spurn nuisance-value settlements. Often in such cases the jury awards less than if the plaintiff were blameless. Any alleged falloff in the average award may have as much to do with an increase in frivolous litigation as with changing juror attitudes.
Even if we accept that verdicts in other states are holding steady, New York's have skyrocketed. Last year saw verdicts in successive weeks of $104 million (against the city) and $196 million (against private defendants). This fiscal year, New York City and its Health and Hospitals Corporation have been hit for five awards of more than $40 million, as against only three such awards ever before.
The Mayor has submitted measures to the State Legislature to tame runaway juries, especially in "noneconomic loss." The bills would limit the amount of pain and suffering-type awards to $250,000, and bar any such recovery unless a plaintiff can show that he or she incurred medical expenses of at least $5,000.
These measures would bring us in line with 39 states that have established reasonable limits to protect taxpayers, while giving the injured full economic recovery (medical expenses, lost pay) and a substantial recovery for noneconomic injuries.
The city is also supporting a measure submitted by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo that would result in having cases against the city tried by a judge sitting without a jury, exactly as against the state itself. Together, these reforms mean the taxpayers save money.

HEADLINE: 137 Cubans Land in Florida; Largest Boatload Since 1980

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 1

 BODY:
The largest single boatload of Cuban refugees to land in Florida since the Mariel boatlift in 1980 docked here today, joining a wave of Cubans fleeing their homeland that is the greatest since the 1980 influx, when 125,000 landed in Florida.
The 137 men, women and children who made the 90-mile journey from Cuba in a 75-foot steel-hulled freighter pushed this year's total to 3,854; of that total, 1,173 arrived in June. With the year now at the halfway mark, the number of Cuban refugees arriving by raft or boat has surpassed the total of 3,656 who fled here in all of 1993, immigration officials say. 
 "It's by far the busiest month and year since the Mariel boatlift of 1980," said Petty Officer Rob Wyman, a Coast Guard spokesman here.
The vessel was monitored by the Coast Guard for several days as it made its way near the Bahamas, Mr. Wyman said, and was escorted to shore by a Coast Guard patrol boat when it arrived off Miami Beach.
 
More Haitians, Too
 Agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service interviewed the Cubans and turned them over to Church World Services, an organization that helps refugees settle in the United States.
Along with the new influx of Cubans, the Coast Guard halted 1,667 Haitians in June, the highest monthly total since 1992, when President George Bush ordered the return of all Haitians found at sea.
Russ Bergeron, a spokesman for the immigration agency, said the refugees were leaving their homelands for different reasons.
The main reason for the influx of Cubans, Mr. Bergeron said, is a deteriorating economy at home. In addition, he said, the weather this year has been more favorable than usual for crossing the Straits of Florida in inner-tube rafts or small boats.
As for the Haitians, he said, many have fled partly because of President Clinton's announcement in May that those found at sea would be interviewed for possible political asylum, creating a heightened "anticipation of the opportunity of gaining some sort of relief."
 
Fear of Oppression
 Although both Cuba and Haiti are undergoing economic difficulties, some of the refugees say they have fled because they fear political oppression or violence.
Rolando Mora, a 30-year-old music instructor from a town near Havana, arrived in Key West this morning after a Coast Guard cutter rescued him and two friends from a raft made from gas cans and wooden planks. Mr. Mora said he had been jailed in Cuba for a year for speaking against the Government of Fidel Castro.
"I wrote a song about the Commandant," Mr. Mora said, referring to Mr. Castro. "It explains everything that is happening" in Cuba, he added, saying the the last verse ends with a vow to leave Cuba on a raft.
Since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the subsequent loss of Soviet subsidies, Mr. Castro has resorted to tight rationing measures. In Haiti, where military officers have ruled since September 1991 after ousting the nation's democratically elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, sanctions imposed by the United States have squeezed the Haitian economy.
Concerned about the possibility of another large influx of refugees, the Coast Guard has stepped up its patrols off Florida. Last weekend, Coast Guard officials said, 786 Haitians in 25 boats were intercepted.
Starting June 15, the Coast Guard has been taking any Haitians found at sea to a Navy medical ship off Jamaica, where they are interviewed to determine if they should be given a hearing for asylum. Those who are not granted hearings are returned to Haiti.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 4, 1994, Monday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about 137 Cuban refugees landing in Florida misstated the number of Haitians who were halted by the Coast Guard in June. It was 5,603, not 1,667.

Companies
Top executives of Federated Department Stores presented their plan to board members of R. H. Macy & Company for merging the two retail companies amid increasing signs that Federated's turbulent courtship of Macy may finally pay off. [Page 33.] 
 Competition has forced big food wholesalers like the Fleming Companies of Oklahoma City to move beyond their original roles, crossing into the retail food business and blurring the line between the grocer and the middleman. [33.]
 A unit of Pfizer has agreed to pay $10.75 million to settle Justice Department claims that the company lied to gain Federal approval for a mechanical heart valve that has fractured, killing hundreds of patients worldwide. [33.]
 Three banking companies announced merger deals, a sign of what analysts say is an increase in the pace of financial mergers. Banks, they say, are benefiting from rising stock prices and are acquiring other institutions to expand into key markets in advance of Congress's passing a nationwide interstate banking law. [33.]
 A merged CBS and QVC probably would not see a decrease in its earnings per share, analysts say, even after paying CBS shareholders about $2.9 billion in cash. [34.]
 First Brands plans to sell its Prestone antifreeze business to the unit's managers and Vestar Capital Partners, a New York investment firm. The terms were not disclosed. [35.]
Bally Entertainment has filed with the Federal Trade Commission for clearance to buy as much as 25 percent of Circus Circus Enterprises. But analysts said Bally would have difficulty raising the money for such a transaction. [35.]
 Nippon Telegraph and Telephone plans to list its shares on the London and New York stock exchanges to improve its profile abroad and help it raise funds more easily. [35.] ITT Hartford Insurance created a new type of corporate retreat with a social payoff when 60 of its employees painted a shelter for the homeless. [21.]
 
Markets
 The volume of new stock and bond issues tumbled in the second quarter to the lowest level since the third quarter of 1991 amid volatile financial markets and rising interest rates. [33.]
 Stocks rose in light trading as the dollar rallied against some leading currencies. The Dow rose 21.69 points, to 3,646.65. [34.]
 The dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen for the first time in a week and gained against other currencies. [41.]
 Copper prices climbed for a third consecutive session. Crude oil prices rose, but the Commodity Research Bureau's index slipped 0.36 point, to 230.03. [41.]
 Prices of Treasury securities seesawed in an abbreviated and thinly traded pre-holiday session. The yield on the long bond fell to 7.60 percent, from 7.61 percent on Thursday. [42.]
 
The Economy
 The chief gauge of economic activity was unchanged in May, the Government said, while construction spending rose slightly, providing more statistical evidence that the economy is advancing at a moderate pace. But a June survey of factory purchasing managers suggested that inflation may be set to rise. [42.]
 
Your Money
 Some companies and benefits consultants are creating extensive retirement plans that suggest just how diverse workers' investment options may be in the future. [31.]
 A low-risk variation of arbitrage can be played by individual investors who become shareholders in companies that sell their stock to the public at a discount. [31.]
 Ford is offering home equity loans that come with rebates on the purchase or lease of the auto makers' cars and trucks. But many lenders are offering more attractive deals. [31.]

HEADLINE: SPECTATOR SPORT;
R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr.

BYLINE: By Dinitia Smith; Dinitia Smith is a novelist and journalist in New York City.

 BODY:
DAVE GERGEN CALLED ME on Thursday," says R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., editor in chief of The American Spectator, the conservative monthly. David Gergen is the White House Counselor.
Tyrrell -- "Bob," as he is known -- is telling me about the call as we drive in his Mercedes through suburban Virginia to the supermarket to buy a pie. 
 "Gergen said, 'How ya' doing?' "
" 'Better 'n you, Dave!' I say.
" 'Why's that, Bob?' he asks.
" 'It's great to be a free man!' I say."
What Gergen wanted, Tyrrell says, was an advance look at the April-May issue of The American Spectator. In January, The Spectator had published "His Cheatin' Heart," by David Brock, an investigative writer alleging that four Arkansas state troopers arranged sexual encounters for then-Governor Clinton. Now there was to be a second installment of Troopergate.
Another trooper had come forward to say he had solicited sexual partners for Clinton and seized upon "residual" opportunities for himself. The article maintained that a trooper loyal to Clinton had had his state car repaired at a body shop he himself owned. And the list of malfeasance continued. Attempted seduction at the state fair, during a trip to the Arkansas-S.M.U. football game, at an Oriental barbecue restaurant in Little Rock. The energies of the Governor and his troopers seemed limitless.
"Boy Clinton!" Tyrrell nearly spits it out. "He's abused his power with these women! He's corrupted the entire State Police! He's involved in deception!
"Do you know what he did to Paula Corbin Jones?" Tyrrell asks. Jones is the Arkansas woman who sued the President for supposedly making a sexual advance to her. A secondhand version of Jones's story, one she disputes, first appeared in The Spectator in January. Clinton "had a trooper summon her," Tyrrell says, going on with a lurid description of the sex act that ensued, or didn't.
Bob Tyrrell talks like a man obsessed -- with the Clintons' sex life, with their tax returns, with their investments. During the 1992 Presidential campaign, The Spectator published a scathing piece on Hillary, "The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock." Another said Mrs. Clinton had asked state troopers to get sanitary napkins for her. Last year The Spectator published "The Real Anita Hill," by David Brock, who referred to Hill as "a bit nutty and a bit slutty" and said she returned exam papers to students with pubic hairs on them. To Tyrrell, feminists are bed wetters. And as for homosexuals, they're bringing about "an end to community," says Tyrrell. Plus, they have heads shaped like "butternut squash," The American Spectator once said.
All this annoys the White House. George Stephanopoulos, a White House adviser, says: "The American Spectator's journalistic standards are on a par with The National Enquirer's. It's pulp fiction! Trash! Tabloid! It's not journalism."
Maybe that's why, in just two years, the circulation of The Spectator has increased tenfold, from 30,000 to 300,000. The circulation of journals of opinion generally rises when the opposition is in power; today The Spectator's exceeds both The Nation's (around 90,000) and the New Republic's (around 100,000). The Spectator, redesigned with a glossy cover and now advertised on Rush Limbaugh's shows, has inched past the more sedate National Review, long the dominant conservative journal. "I think The Spectator is terrific," says William F. Buckley Jr., editor in chief of The National Review and a friend and hero of Tyrrell's. "That zany stuff up front," -- Tyrrell's column, "The Continuing Crisis" -- "the investigative stuff, is attracting a lot of attention," he adds.
"The image of conservatives has always been somewhat nerdy, 90-pound weakling types," says Wladyslaw Pleszczynski, managing editor of The Spectator. "Bob's is an athletic, vigorous conservatism. He has made it possible to think of conservatives as stylish and witty. He encouraged the neo-cons to come into the magazine's pages. He was instrumental in forming the Reagan coalition." Indeed, at The Spectator's 25th anniversary dinner, in 1992, virtually every important figure in the conservative movement showed up -- Irving Kristol, Jeane Kirkpatrick, John Sununu, Gen. William Westmoreland, Judge Robert Bork, Jack Kemp. The magazine, with its office on a quiet street in Arlington, Va., and 22 employees, is liberally financed by conservative groups like the Sarah Scaife Foundation and the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, and contributions from its affluent, well-educated and mostly male readers.
THE AMERICAN SPECTATOR IS BOB Tyrrell's creation. He assigns its big investigative pieces and plans its grand strategy. Along with the magazine's Swiftian satire is some serious reporting built on a consistent conservative philosophy: in February, a long piece by John Corry on M.I.A.'s; regular reports from Russia on its burgeoning democracy; continuing coverage of health care reform. (The Spectator says the Clinton health plan will fail because of an overburdened bureaucracy.) On foreign policy, The Spectator is pro-Israel and believes that the United States should defend democracies everywhere.
Each month Tyrrell invests his column with observations on everything from the death of former President Richard Nixon -- "he aged gracefully and died in the spring" -- to the Clinton Administration's failed Bosnian policy to sculptures at Evergreen State College, in Washington, that celebrate the power of women. One word that appears often is "Kultursmog," Tyrrell's term for "a politicized culture whose values, discourse and anxieties are polluted by the left's many contending interests."
Tyrrell is a small, compressed, bristling man of 50, with pale blue eyes, long eyebrows and a surprisingly high-pitched voice. "He has this Midwestern twang," says his friend Taki Theodoracopulos, a contributor to The Spectator. "I tell him, 'You've got to stay away from public speaking because of your terrible accent!' "
Tyrrell resembles the Irish cops who were his forebears on his father's side; he claims his great-great-grandfather, P. D. Tyrrell, a Secret Service agent, prevented a man from stealing President Lincoln's body from his grave. These days, Tyrrell disdains the Treasury Department because it houses the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. "Those people are against everything we believe in!" he says. The pages of The Spectator are filled with Tyrrell's essays in favor of alcohol, tobacco -- and fatty foods.
Tyrrell stops his car in front of his house, in a prosperous development near the Beltway. An American flag flies out front. "Just a stone's throw from Teddy Kennedy," Tyrrell says. "And I supply the stones!"
Inside hang autographed pictures of Presidents Bush, Reagan and Nixon. Tyrrell lives alone, though his three children, P. D. (Patrick), 20, Katy, 18, and Annie, 13, often stay over. Tyrrell has been divorced from Judy Matthews Tyrrell for almost five years. "He's very difficult to live with," says Taki Theodoracopulos. "He expects every woman to 'do her duty.' I think there was some tension there because she wanted to be independent." Tyrrell's book of observations and reminiscences, "The Conservative Crack-Up," contains a rather sour account of his marriage: "She resorted to tennis, then religion and then psychotherapy. Finally she tried divorce -- all common American coping mechanisms for navigating middle age." Ms. Tyrrell is now a divorce lawyer with Sandground, Barondess and West in McLean, Va., a firm known for its aggressive style. Bob Tyrrell boasts about his nights out at Annabelle's, in London, and his fondness for "physiologically well-appointed women."
Tyrrell's humor has a manic, compulsive quality. When he wants to say something, especially after he has had a couple of drinks, it's hard to stop him. "I like him except when he gets drunk," Theodoracopulos says. "When he gets drunk he speaks about The Spectator nonstop."
Tyrrell does most of his work from home, writing his column and his books, six to date. (Unlike many political columnists', Tyrrell's books are not simply recycled writings.) From his library, Tyrrell calls Wlady Pleszczynski, the 44-year-old son of Polish concentration camp survivors who runs the magazine on a daily basis. "Editor-in-chief-for-life here!" Tyrrell barks into the phone. "Wlady, is there anything I should know?" Pause. "The Ten Commandments? Ye-es." Another pause. "The Lord's Prayer? I'm being serious, for Chrissakes."
Tyrrell is a practicing Catholic -- "Practice makes perfect," he says. What influenced his political ideas? He responds oddly. "Yeats's absorption in magic was as inexplicable to me as some people's absorption in Chinese cuisine." Yeats is one of Tyrrell's intellectual heroes, along with Mencken and Luigi Barzini.
He was raised in River Forest-Oak Park, Ill. His mother came from a prosperous Chicago family, which has given Tyrrell financial independence. Tyrrell is vague about his father. Some accounts say he was a Pabst brewery worker. "I think he may have represented Pabst in some way," Tyrrell says. "My father was the most successful man I ever knew -- he never wanted to do anything in his life. And he never did anything." Tyrrell was educated by Dominican friars in high school and traces his love of language to them. He went to Indiana University because of its fine swim team, whose coach, James E. Counsilman, he counts as a major intellectual influence. During workouts, Counsilman would lecture on art and politics. "Mozart or Puccini might lilt over the public-address system," Tyrrell wrote in "The Conservative Crack-Up," "instilling a fear in many of the nearby students of physical education that homosexuals had taken the place over."
At Indiana, Tyrrell was in Phi Kappa Psi with Steve Tesich. "We were antifraternity people in a fraternity," Tesich remembers. Later, Tesich wrote the screenplay for "Breaking Away," a film about a group of Indiana students with intellectual pretensions, not unlike Tyrrell himself. Tyrrell went on to get his master's in diplomatic history. While a graduate student, he joined a conservative supper club, the "Beer and Pizza Marching Society," where he met a young law student, Dan Quayle. "We'd sit around and have little conspiracy meetings on how we could reduce government -- and put ourselves out of a job." says Quayle. "Tyrrell would pontificate about the virtues of less government. Of course, I needed a job!" (Despite their friendship, Quayle once told a reporter he had trouble getting through The American Spectator. Tyrrell took revenge by ridiculing Quayle in a cover story, "Why Danny Can't Read." "He's an engaging person," Quayle says now, "and his opinions come from a solid intellectual foundation.")
When Quayle and Tyrrell were students, the campus was in the throes of rebellion from the left. "It bothered him there wasn't the other side of the political spectrum being expressed by students," Tesich says. So in 1967 Tyrrell founded The Alternative (which became The American Spectator in 1977), publishing it from "a right-wing libertarian commune" in a farmhouse near Bloomington, Ind. Later, the paper was fortified with a grant from the Eli Lilly Foundation, established by the Indiana pharmaceuticals family.
In 1986 the Tyrrells moved to Washington to be near "the center of the political circus," he says. But Bob Tyrrell retains a kind of nostalgia for the good old days, when sex was "an extremely serious engagement, a mystery," when people could hurl racial slurs at one another without necessarily getting killed. In the old days, says Tyrrell, "there was far more ethnic and racial and religious integration in cities like Chicago. Men would refer to 'The Micks,' 'The Papists,' 'The Yids'! These were rich, flavorous terms -- though sometimes they would betray real enmity," he admits as we sit down to dinner at his house.
The dinner, veal and braised fennel, has been cooked by his Grenadian housekeeper, Doreen Gibbs. "In the Caribbean they don't talk about racism!" Tyrrell says, watching Gibbs serve. "I don't believe black people are less intelligent. Black people from the Caribbean are extremely well educated. What really hurt them isn't the color of their skin. They were impoverished people who came into American society when the welfare state was in place. Thank God it's not happened to Caribbean people who came into my kitchen! I love the lilt of their voices and the cheer they bring."
As Tyrrell speaks, Gibbs smiles -- mockingly, I think -- puts a dish on her head and marches back into the kitchen.
Tyrrell tells me about a PEN benefit where he was a guest of Ted Forstmann of the investment bank Forstmann Little. "A bore beyond belief!" Tyrrell says. "There was some moron from South Africa, then Peter Jennings talking about Reaganism as if it were Stalinism -- as though the Reagan years were not the longest period of economic growth in peacetime! I spent the rest of the evening blowing up a condom. Repeatedly, I'm proud to say. And let the air out so it sounded like a Bronx cheer. Somebody told me Barry Diller was appalled!"
Forstmann has contributed money to The Spectator. "Bob is a very bright guy, extremely well read," he says. "At times he's extremely witty. I don't think the PEN dinner is a good example of that wit. He was very unwitty at the PEN dinner. His behavior was unlike anything I ever saw."
The playwright Tony Kushner also spoke at the dinner. Tyrrell says, "His technique is superb; his message is idiotic." Two years ago The Spectator ran a piece by Michael Fumento, author of "The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS," saying reports of AIDS among women and heterosexuals are greatly exaggerated. "AIDS is lethal," Tyrrell says. "But they're forever trying to magnify a sensible point out of proportion. Heterosexual cases are practically nonexistent. The latest studies show that only 2 to 3 percent of Americans are homosexuals. Kinsey was wrong in saying it was 10 percent. There are thousands of years of moral teaching suggesting homosexuality is wrong."
The Spectator has written pieces disapproving of homosexuality, I point out, yet one of its star writers, David Brock, is openly gay. "He hasn't made it a goddamned issue!" Tyrrell says. "He hasn't bored me to death with discussions of his sex life."
It is getting late, but Tyrrell still has energy. He takes out a Montecristo No. 1, appraises it. "They're so whipped in that country," he says of Cuba, "they can't even make cigars."
THE NEXT DAY, I HAVE LUNCH with David Brock. It is an awkward conversation. Even Brock's mother was upset when he wrote his article criticizing Anita Hill. Then there had been a debate in the press about whether Brock's being gay made him a misogynist and affected his reporting.
As for his article on Hill, Brock says, "That was not misogynist," though "it may have been an exaggeration." His reporting of the Troopergate piece was criticized, I point out; some of the troopers had been accused of drunken driving and insurance fraud. "Any private citizen is going to have something in his background -- a broken marriage, a parking ticket," Brock says.
Does he have a problem as a gay man writing for a magazine, and an editor, critical of homosexuals? "The American Spectator has always been unlike other conservative magazines. I don't feel hypocritical that it publishes pieces critical of the gay life style; I find the people who edit the magazine quite tolerant."
That night, Brock, Tyrrell and I have dinner at the Jockey Club with Andy Ferguson, former assistant managing editor of The Spectator, and Tyrrell's son, P. D., a student at Loyola University.
Tyrrell mentions AIDS again. "Militant homosexuals have tried to keep up the hysteria about AIDS. AIDS is spread by promiscuous homosexual sex. Homosexuals, responsible and restrained, have been less of a problem."
"I'm in the responsible-and-restrained category," Brock interjects.
Tyrrell takes a party favor -- a hazelnut -- out of his pocket and bangs it against the table. A condom pops out. P. D. Tyrrell watches his father but doesn't smile.
To distract Tyrrell, I ask, "What are the major concerns of The American Spectator?" "Our major concern is freedom in America!" he cries.
The next morning Tyrrell and I have a last conversation on the deck of his house. His allergies are bothering him. The roar of planes from Andrews Air Force Base mixes with the noise of traffic on the Beltway.
I ask Tyrrell about a comment from Victor Navasky, on leave as editor of The Nation, that The American Spectator has become "part of the tabloidization of the press." "They appear to have bought into the same thing as the TV news magazines, in a lurid and irresponsible way," Navasky says.
Tyrrell replies, "When you have a President leading a tabloid life, those who report on him are going to sound like a tabloid."
I also ask Tyrrell about his views on feminists. In "The Liberal Crack-Up" he wrote: "The vast majority of feminists were disagreeable misanthropes, horrible to behold, uncouth and unlovely . . . burdened by a splitting headache, halitosis, body odor and other ailments too terrible and obscure to mention."
Tyrrell now says: "There was an element of exaggeration. It was there for poetic effect. Betty Friedan was the worst -- that charlatan!" He stops, glances at me for my reaction.
"You're embarrassed?" I ask.
"I am not!" Tyrrell says stoutly.
I turn to something less provocative: his predictions for the Clinton Presidency.
"The economy is going to get worse," says Tyrrell. "There are going to be more revelations about financial chicanery and political corruption in Clinton's personal life. I think it's entirely possible he'll be challenged for the 1996 nomination." Tyrrell says he believes that Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska might even take the Democratic nomination -- and that Senator Robert Dole of Kansas will be the Republican challenger.
Tyrrell and I say goodbye, and I pay Tyrrell's occasional driver, Jim Vetter, to take me to the airport. "He's really having a ball with this Clinton thing," Vetter tells me. "I guess a lot of liberals don't like it. But -- what the hell! This is America!"

American Center Finally Open in Paris

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
THERE may be a glimmer at the end of the tunnel, but you couldn't yet call it light. Bruised feelings abound and question marks remain. Still, after two years of crisis and nine months past its projected unveiling last September, the new American Center in Paris is open at last.
The opening party, with American and French V.I.P.'s prowling about Frank Gehry's playful, commanding new building on the Rue de Bercy and the adjacent new park, was on June 7; the public was admitted the next day. The June 7 date was chosen to connect with the June 6 D-Day celebrations, and perhaps initially in the hope that a Clinton or two might grace the center. In the end, center officials had to go over to the American Embassy in Paris for Hillary Rodham Clinton to proclaim the facility open. 
 But open it is, and physically, at least, it's a beauty. Mr. Gehry's design was criticized in some French quarters as not wild and crazy enough, as if the Los Angeles architect had pulled his punches for genteel, ladylike Paris. But Mr. Gehry deftly explained how his building had been inspired by Paris itself, and most of the post-opening articles in the French press positively purred with pleasure. In fact, the new center does blend Mr. Gehry's Krazy Kat deconstruction with functionality and homages to Paris, in its limestone surface and swooping mansard roofs.
Functional the building may be, but for what functions? The center dates back to 1931, and for decades it puttered along happily on the Boulevard Raspail in Left Bank Paris, offering English language courses and a lively array of then not-so-well-known American vanguard artists. In 1987, with their building decaying, center officials cut a deal with the City of Paris, which was seeking to develop its rundown Bercy district in the 12th arrondissement. The new center was built using nearly all the money from the sale of the old one, some $40 million. (The old site is now occupied by Jean Nouvel's spiffy new headquarters for the Cartier Foundation.)
But then the recession hit, fund-raising dried up and the second-guessing began. The old team -- meaning Judith Pisar, the board chairman, and Henry Pillsbury, the executive director -- was blamed for not holding back any of the Raspail money and for isolating their new building on the eastern outskirts of Paris. The newly hired programming staff was messily fired in 1992. The opening was delayed, and a board transition team, headed by Frederick B. Henry of the Bohen Foundation and Rachel Newton Bellow of the Mellon Foundation, organized the first year's programs.
Nearly everyone's feelings were hurt. Mrs. Pisar felt undervalued, and what appears to be an industrious public-relations campaign has burnished her image. Although Mr. Henry and Ms. Bellow kept a low profile at the opening party, both Mrs. Pisar and Mr. Pillsbury are still scheduled to relinquish their current titles at a September board meeting, and the search is on for a new executive director. The old programming staff is still bitter. Artists with postponed or canceled projects are disgruntled, as are a few younger artists who won fellowships for study in Paris and then complained the center let them down. (Mr. Pillsbury insisted there was only one real complainer and that the center had fulfilled all its obligations.)
Starving artists or no, the June 7 party was a corker, mostly paid for by Philip Morris, with lavish food and music by the Cajun band Loup Garou and David Byrne. Maybe this show of flashy bravado will convince enough donors that the center is a going operation worthy of support. Already, several million dollars for both the projected $25 million endowment and the $5 million annual operating budget are in hand, and vanguard events of one sort or another will partly fill the center to year's end.
With luck, Mr. Gehry's fabulous shell will slowly fill with life. That means not only its gallery spaces and black-box theaters and 400-seat legitimate theater and 100-seat film theater, but also its library and apartments and lobbies and foyers and concessions and restaurants. Mr. Gehry has said he wanted to build a self-contained city, teeming with life. So far, he's got a gorgeous monument to an as-yet unrealized cultural ambition.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Impala SS;
Heavy Metal Act Gets an Encore With a 60's Hit

BYLINE: By MARSHALL SCHUON 

 BODY:
"IT'S a funny thing," a colleague once said to me in Detroit. "You want to talk cars, you go to the Ford guys. They like cars. But if you want to buy a car, you go to G.M. The company is huge and gray and all that, but those guys turn out some really neat stuff."
True, even if it is a bit unfair to Ford and the rest, which have had their moments. 
 But consider this: the 1959 Cadillac, immense and drenched in chrome, with torpedo taillights and giant fins, was Detroit's most outrageous foray into conspicuous consumption. G.M., right?
Then there is the Corvette, a pure-zoom sledgehammer of a sports car that has been in steady production for 41 years and is as good as anything in the world. G.M., of course.
And G.M. has come up with such pleasant oddities as Pontiac's innovative plastic-body Fiero and Chevrolet's rear-engine Corvair -- which was terrific and could have become even better if G.M. had continued to develop it instead of caving in to attacks on the car by Ralph Nader.
All the same, none of these products were what one would expect from a corporation of bean counters and committees, committees, committees.
My friend was right. And that's why we shouldn't be surprised at the likes of the latest anomaly, the 1994 Chevrolet Impala SS.
 The Impala is, of course, a Caprice in drag, and it moves away from a stoplight faster than anything else its size. We'll get to that.
First, consider the basic Caprice, a full-size four-door sedan that is America's favorite taxi.
I first drove the Caprice in its cab-stand mode three years ago. That test car was New York City's first '91 yellow Caprice, with a light on its roof and a meter on the dashboard. If I'd taken money out of one pocket and put it into the other, it would have cost me $45.10 to get from Manhattan to my home on Long Island.
Such a fare might, in fact, have been justified, because the standard Caprice has a 5-liter V8 engine and it weighs 4,000 pounds, so the fuel economy is not quite a match for the small stuff from Honda and Toyota and Saturn. But that hasn't mattered to a certain segment of the population, even though Caprice sales have disappointed G.M.
In mufti, painted a more sensible color and wearing whitewalls, the Caprice has a base price of $19,570, and it sells 90,000 copies a year to taxi and government fleets and people like me who love old-fashioned iron.
The car is big. It has room in front, room in back. An automatic transmission makes it civil in town, but its true worth is out on the highway, and it glides effortlessly over America's concrete.
Now, though, General Motors has dressed its whale in muscles, creating the first Impala SS -- for Super Sport -- since 1969. The car elicited raves when it was introduced as a concept vehicle at the 1993 New York Auto Show, and this year's production model drew 9,000 orders. About 3,000 of those went unfilled because of a lack of production capacity. Next year, though, G.M. plans to make 15,000 Impalas.
It might have been even more attractive if G.M. had offered it as a two-door hardtop, and Chevrolet Engineering did produce two such cars at an early introduction, but they were simply toys for the designers. So what we have -- and what you can buy for $22,495 -- is a black (only black) version of the Caprice-as-muscle-car.
Instead of the standard Caprice's 170-horsepower engine, the Impala SS carries a 5.7-liter Corvette engine that produces 260 horsepower. The juice goes to the road through an electronically controlled four-speed automatic, and four-wheel anti-lock disk brakes are standard.
The low hood rises on dual gas struts, and the engine sits way back from the nose, mounted fore to aft and driving the rear wheels, as with other Caprices. When you're feeling mellow the engine drives the car with quiet aplomb. The Impala is basically docile, smooth and slick. But when you stamp on the accelerator, the SS becomes its namesake.
As might be expected, the car is f-a-a-s-t, and the engine screams. Zero-to-60 acceleration takes only 7 seconds, and the top speed is 158 miles an hour. On the road, the Impala handles well, behaving unlike most of its large domestic brethren. It is comfortable and has European manners, which is to say there is no wallow.
Standing still, you are struck by its sleek and swoopy body, with bumpers that sweep into the profile and aggressive molded wheels with wide openings that reveal the huge disk brakes. Modern as the body is, though, it harks to the past by sitting on an old-fashioned frame, unlike most of today's cars, whose unit-construction dispenses with a separate chassis.
 
A Chevy bow-tie emblem graces the mesh grille, and an Impala SS logo stretches for two feet along the rear fenders, just ahead of the wraparound taillights. Outrageous as the label is, it is subtle, too, because it is black and blends into the body. Chrome Impala emblems also dress up the rear-window pillars and the trunk, which has a small spoiler on its trailing edge.
Under the lid, the felt-wrapped spare -- smaller than the Impala's fat tires but still full size -- takes up a lot of space. The liftover for luggage is also fairly high, and the taillights intrude into the trunk, meaning there is less space there than might be expected.
Inside the car, though, there is room aplenty. The upholstery is done in gray leather, nicely finished and very comfortable. The driver's view is no different from that in other Caprices, with a soft plastic dash, dual air bags and the usual four-spoke steering wheel, the entire hub of which serves as a horn.
Like many G.M. cars, the Impala has a remote release button in the glove box that opens the luggage compartment. Unlike earlier cars, though, the button works with the ignition off, which makes it useful when you pocket the key and then remember that you needed something in the trunk.
Other remote buttons reside in the key fob, allowing you to open the trunk or lock or unlock the doors from afar. That feature is particularly useful when you want to get inside quickly and safely on a dark night in the city.
Power equipment is standard, and it includes things like an electrochromatic rear-view mirror to deal with those insensitive sons who barrel up from behind with high beams ablaze. The mirror, which automatically dims that glare, incorporates dual reading lights, and there are other nice touches as well, such as twin cup holders in the console that divides the front bucket seats and offers storage under a padded armrest.
All in all, I have to say it: I know that giant cars with huge V8's are not sensible or politically correct, but I love the Impala SS. And, yes, those corporate committees at G.M. have pleased me once again.
 
INSIDE TRACK: You might wish it were the classic '57 Bel Air convertible. It's not, but the born-again Impala SS is a latter-day muscle car worthy of the name.

HEADLINE: As a Tax Break for Some Condos Ebbs, Costs Soar

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
AS the 10-year tax abatements run out on condominiums built under the city's Section 421a program in the mid-80's, monthly carrying costs in these buildings are soaring -- in some cases equaling the once higher monthly costs of nearby co-ops.
This rise in what brokers call "out-of-pocket" charges in these condominiums has made the apartments generally harder to sell, according to many real estate agents. Some buildings, however, because of their location, size of apartments or cachet, may not have been hit as hard as others. 
 In Manhattan, the rise in monthly carrying costs for condominiums as taxes are phased in "certainly has had an effect in an already weak market," said Joan Ambrose, co-owner of Ambrose-Mar Elia Real Estate. "With the exception of the top-of-the-market buyer, out-of-pocket expenses are a big factor in decision making."
New multifamily construction in the 80's commonly took the form of condominiums, in which each apartment is independently financed and there is no underlying mortgage on the building. In Manhattan there were more than 21,000 condos built with Section 421a abatements, compared with about 900 co-op units, according to the City Finance Department.
Alan Nickman, a broker in Bellmarc Realty's Upper West Side office, pointed to the increasing trend toward parity of monthly carrying charges between comparable condominiums and co-ops as one of the most intriguing trends in the Manhattan market. Nevertheless, he said there would always be people who preferred condominiums.
"They like the more liberal attitude toward renting and selling, or for one reason or another, they can't pass a co-op board's scrutiny," he said.
Tax abatements, or the lack of them, can make a big difference in monthly carrying costs. At 60 East 88th Street, a posh 14-unit mid-block condominium between Madison and Park Avenues, one five-room apartment on the seventh floor that started with taxes of $106 a month in 1988 was up to $791 a month in 1994. In a 9 1/2-room apartment in the same building, taxes went from $252 in 1989 to $2,263 in 1994, according to the building's prospectus and recent sales listings. Nevertheless, brokers say apartments in this building are eminently salable because of its handsome post-modern-influenced design, its location and its small size.
The 40-story, 210-unit Kingsley, at 400 East 72d Street at York Avenue, is more typical. Built in 1984, its apartments range from studios to three-bedrooms. Real estate taxes for a typical mid-tower two-bedroom went from $191 in 1985 to $763 in 1994.
On the Upper West Side, the decade-long tax abatement program will expire in 1997 at the Park Belvedere, a condominium at 101 West 79th Street, at Columbus Avenue. There, real estate taxes on an average two-bedroom rose from 6 percent of the total carrying cost in 1987 to a current 41 percent. Carrying costs in condominiums also pay for building operations, as they do in co-ops. But in co-ops they also cover mortgage debt on the building.
The Section 421a tax abatement program was authorized by the state Legislature at New York City's behest in 1972 in an effort to stimulate residential construction at a time of recession. It was used in the construction of more than 67,000 apartments in the city -- the total includes condominiums, co-ops and rental buildings -- over 37,000 of them in Manhattan.
Under the 421a program taxes on new construction are phased in over 10 years, rising 20 percent every other year. At the beginning of the abatement period taxes are payable on the land only, or any property that had existed on the land within the preceding year.
The program was citywide and "as of right" until 1985; after that, builders in Manhattan between 96th and 14th Street had to provide a certain amount of low-income housing to get the Section 421a benefit. The expiration of the 421a benefit as an "as-of-right" program led developers to rush to get foundations in before 1986, said Douglas Lane, chief review assessor at the city's Department of Finance.
Fiscal 1986, covering November 1985, marked a peak in Section 421a applications. There were 61 for Manhattan, compared with 30 in fiscal 1985 and 30 in fiscal 1987. In fiscal 1994 there were four applications. The city's fiscal year ends on June 30.
Many buyers may not have understood that they would eventually have significant tax increases when the abatement expired, real estate lawyers said, despite requirements by the Attorney General's office that the workings of the program be spelled out clearly to prospective buyers.
"Were they fully warned by the Attorney General?" asked Kevin B. McGrath, a partner at Graubard and Mollen. "Were they told by their lawyer? Yes and probably yes."
"Did they understand it? Probably not," he concluded, adding that "human nature precluded their understanding it."
Shelly Friedman, a partner at Brown and Wood, said that the tax abatement "wasn't designed for buyers and it wasn't designed for sellers; it was front-loaded to create an incentive to build."
"Nobody was left holding the bag," he said. "People hear what they want to hear; they read what they want to read."
Prospective buyers of condominiums were warned of tax increases in offering plans. For example, the plan for Zeckendorf Towers, at 1 Irving Place, issued in 1986, could not be clearer. On the first page, the plan advises potential buyers that "this plan contains special risks to purchasers."
On the fourth page, the document warns in capital letters that "Application has been made by the sponsor for partial exemption from real estate taxes attributable to residential units pursuant to Section 421a of the New York Real Property Tax Law."
"Such exemption, if granted," it continues, "will be for a limited period of 10 years and will decrease progressively during such period."
"PEOPLE are entitled to feel they passed under a dark cloud," said Mr. Friedman, "but there's really no remedy."
At the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, Mara Neville, a spokeswoman, said the 421a program was"alive and well." The housing agency is primarily responsible for administering both the 421a and J-51 tax abatements. The J-51 program, which is also ongoing, covers rehabilitation of existing buildings; Section 421a programs cover new construction of all types of multifamily buildings, although 65 percent of buildings constructed under the program are condominiums, with 25 percent rentals, according to the Finance Department.
Jeff Levine, head of J.E. Levine Builders in Queens and president of the Queens County Builders and Contractors Association, says that 421a is only alive and well outside Manhattan.
"Right now I'm working on a project in Riverdale in the Bronx," he said. "I'm getting the 421a as of right -- I don't have to include 20 percent low-income housing, which some neighborhoods don't exactly love."
According to the city's housing agency, 154 units of low- or moderate-income housing have been built in the area between 96th and 14th Streets in Manhattan since the restriction went into effect a decade ago. A total of 1,140 have been built citywide since the original 421a program ended.
While the requirements of the Section 421a subsidy program have changed over the years, the full effects of the program's tax-abatement mechanisms are now being felt in many of the units built in the 80s. To some real-estate experts, the long-term effects are beneficial. Steven Spinola, president of the Real Esate Board of New York, called the abatement phase-out "positive," saying it has had the affect of putting co-ops and condos "on an equal basis" in the market.
"People ought to realize that co-ops are just as valuable as condos," he added.
To Frank Braconi, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, whose members include many in the for-profit and nonprofit development fields, the question of fairness is clear. "Sure, we've had complaints from people," he said. "But we believe the city should keep its bargains -- the city made a deal and the time is up."

HEADLINE: Peddlers Called Bane of Downtown

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In your "An Engine for Economic Improvement Downtown" on May 29 some industry leaders suggested measures for uplifting the area. However, not one mentioned the continued failure of the vaious city agencies in dealing with peddlers. Recently I visited a client in lower Manhattan. At 12:30 P.M., lower Broadway from Wall Street to the tip of Manhattan looked more like a market area for peddlers than the site of the New York Stock Exchange. 
 It is beyond me that we continue to permit a stream of peddlers selling everything from baseball cards to apparel with their vans illegally parked along the curbs, virtually eliminating one lane of traffic. For the life of me, I cannot conceive of anyone looking for office space in lower Manhattan if this condition continues to persist.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Tenant Options;
Landlords Dig In As Market Revives

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
A LOT of people thought it was a done deal: Burlington Industries was moving the bulk of its operation to North Carolina, leaving only a skeleton crew at Burlington House, the building at 1345 Avenue of the Americas at 55th Street in which it became the major tenant some 25 years ago.
It may still happen, but not just yet. Last month -- ironically, soon after Mastercard International began re-evaluating its much-publicized decision to make Burlington House its headquarters -- Burlington signed a new 15-year lease in its namesake building for 160,000 square feet. It is taking the space "as is," meaning no build-out costs for the owner, so it got a below-market rent. But far more important, Burlington got a "shed right" -- the right to turn back half of the space in three years. 
 "This flexibility gives them the best of both worlds," said Mitchell S. Steir, an executive vice president at Julien J. Studley who is Burlington's broker. "Those people who wanted to stay in Manhattan are very happy, yet Burlington gets to re-evaluate the decision a short time down the road."
Burlington's deal is not unique, but unlike a few years ago, it is no longer typical. As the real estate market continues to recover, landlords and tenants are in tugs of war over expansion and contraction rights.
"Everyone asks for them, but no longer does everyone get them," said Alan L. Stein, a senior vice president of Rockefeller Center Management.
Tenant brokers say it is worse than that -- that almost no one gets them anymore.
"Last year it was still feasible to negotiate shed rights and the like," said Robert Alexander, a senior managing director of Edward S. Gordon. "Today it is almost impossible."
Indeed, a couple of years ago Mr. Alexander helped Bank of America negotiate a very flexible lease at the World Trade Center. Now he is trying -- so far, unsuccessfully -- to negotiate a shed right for a financial services firm that wants to rent 90,000 square feet in midtown. "The landlord won't budge, he says he has people waiting in the wings for the space," Mr. Alexander said.
Most brokers concede that they could not currently negotiate the options they wrenched from landlords a few years back.
Two years ago, David A. Falk, a managing director of Williams Real Estate, negotiated a lease for 12,500 square feet on a 20,000-square-foot floor at 1675 Broadway, at 52d Street, for Publicis, the French advertising agency. The 10-year lease included expansion options for the rest of the floor.
"I can't imagine any landlord letting a 12,500-foot tenant effectively control a 20,000-foot floor today," he said.
Tenants are fighting harder than ever for flexibility, though. Many were stuck with excess space at over-market rents when the recession decimated their businesses, and are leery of again locking themselves into too much space. They are desperate for clauses that will let them expand if their businesses take off and contract if they hit a slow patch.
But landlords do not want to encumber their space with options or to bear all costs for rerenting space if a tenant wants out.
"When three buildings were chasing every one tenant, we had to give all kinds of flexibility," said Anthony E. Malkin, president of W & M Properties. "Now, with three tenants chasing every space, it's different."
W & M does still grant shed rights and some expansion options. Other landlords have stopped granting any flexible space clauses. Yet others are insisting on enough financial caveats and penalties to ensure that a tenant who exercises an expansion or contraction option bears any related costs.
For example, landlords once readily agreed to let tenants expand at whatever rent their existing lease called for. Today, landlords insist on the prevailing market rent at the time of the expansion.
Some are even removing the "optional" part of options -- they will agree to make more space available to a tenant at a particular time only if the tenant commits to taking it. If the tenant winds up not needing the space, it must find a sublessee.
Landlords are growing even more intractible about shed rights. At the least, they insist that the tenant reimburse them, on a prorated basis, for the brokerage commissions, build-out work and free rent.
OF course, there are exceptions to all rules. Tenants moving to lower-quality buildings, especially downtown, and those chasing space in buildings with huge vacancies are still operating in a buyer's market when it comes to lease flexibility.
That was one of Burlington's advantages. When it began negotiating its new lease, Mastercard had not yet signed up for the eight floors that Smith Barney, Harris Upham was vacating. The building looked like it was emptying out, and management was not in much of a bargaining position.
The law firm Kirkland & Ellis had a similar edge last year when it got five expansion options in its 15-year lease for 50,000 square feet at Citicorp Center, at 153 East 53d Street. Price Waterhouse was moving, and the landlord faced a 200,000-square-foot vacancy.
"Being the first deal there made a difference," said Mr. Steir, the law firm's broker.
Huge tenants -- or those that seem destined to become so -- can also still get ample options and shed rights.
Ammerati & Puris, the advertising firm, has over the last 12 years become the major tenant at 100 Fifth Avenue, at 15th Street. In its latest lease, it has expansion options and the right to turn back a floor of space at a small penalty. And the landlord agreed to share in any sublet losses.
That lease was written in 1992, but Barry Gosin, the head of Newmark Real Estate and the ad agency's broker, is certain he could have gotten a similar deal today.
"THIS tenant controls a significant piece of the building, and no landlord wants a tenant like that to move," he said.
Clearly, that's how the owners of Staten Island's Teleport complex feel about TCG Inc., the telephone company that is headquartered at Teleport. TCG, whose lease for 61,000 square feet would have expired in 1998, has been growing explosively.
"I don't want to ever have to split the company among locations because our headquarters couldn't accommodate our growth," said John J. Reiser, TCG's vice president of real estate.
TCG just signed a 10-year lease for nearly 134,000 square feet, with a potpourri of rights to grow or shrink. It has a one-time right to chuck the whole lease in 1998, as long as it reimburses the landlord's costs. It has an option to take another 5,000 square feet this October. It has all-inclusive rights of first offer -- meaning it gets first dibs on any space coming up in the building as long as the in-place tenant does not have a contractual right to renew. It has two renewal options, at a percentage of fair market value.
"The owners are betting on TCG as a long-term, growing tenant," said Franklin Speyer, a Cushman & Wakefield senior director who is TCG's broker.
Few tenants wield such clout. And many, anticipating a tightening space market, are reluctantly taking more space than they need now, lest they be unable to get it later.
Caleb D. Koeppel, vice chairman of Koeppel Tener Real Estate Services, just negotiated a 41,000-square-foot lease in a Rockefeller Center building for a tenant that needs only 30,000 square feet.
"A few years ago we could have gotten an expansion option, but this time we had to settle for unconditional permission to sublet," Mr. Koeppel said.
Those landlords who do grant shed rights and expansion options are those who are certain they can make money on the deal.
By last year Ceridian, an information services company that in 1987 took a 10-year lease for eight floors at 142 West 57th Street, no longer needed all its space. So Harry Macklowe, the building's owner, agreed to take back one floor and reduce the rent by $10 a foot on the others and to sublet two more floors from Ceridian if the tenant so desired. The payback: Ceridian had to extend its lease to 2002 and to agree to take 50 cents on the dollar in sublet rent.
Ceridian accepted the terms. "They say it as an insurance policy, a way to recoup at least half their money if they had to downsize more," said Joseph A. Fabrizi, the Cushman & Wakefield associate director who represented Ceridian.
Since then, Mr. Macklowe has indeed sublet back some of the space and rented it to another tenant in the building at far more than he is paying Ceridian. Ceridian was prohibited by its lease from subletting directly to another tenant in the building.

HEADLINE: A Landmark Returns to Its Opulent Past

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
THE Garde Theater in New London was built in 1926 during the era of the great movie palaces. Its tapestries, frescos and ornate lobby drew in people from workaday lives to a world of romance, adventure and exotic places. That glamour, faded over the years, is about to be restored.
The theater, now called Garde Arts Center, and its adjacent buildings are about to undergo a $16 million renovation and expansion that includes restoring the 1,500-seat auditorium to the brilliance of its movie palace past. The project, it is hoped, will act as a catalyst for the growth of new business and cultural activity in downtown New London. 
 "People who came to the opening of the Garde in 1926 were the economic lifeblood of the city," said Steven Sigel, the Garde's managing director. "They had factories here, and they lived and worked here. Much of that leadership has gone to the suburbs. The Garde gives leaders in the community an opportunity to come together, take back part of their territory, the arts, and say, 'Can't we do that again?' "
The first phase of the plan calls for expanded and improved lobby spaces, a new reception hall and improved plumbing, heating, air conditioning and electrical systems. The next three phases include an expanded backstage with a loading dock, a new rehearsal hall and dressing rooms, a refurbished main auditorium, classroom space and a 399-seat theater with flexible seating.
 
Sources of Funds

 
 The project has received support from the state through an $800,000 bond, which the center used to purchase two adjacent buildings and begin architectural drawings, and $2.5 million from the state bonding commission. A fund drive to raise the rest of the money is under way.
The Garde was originally built as a "combination house," with space and equipment for both movies and vaudeville. Like many theaters of its era, it was attached to an office building, the theory being that a reliable cash flow from rentals would sustain the fickle entertainment business.
In those days, theaters were as flamboyant as the movies themselves. The white walls of the lobby were once decorated with black and white marble and the doors were bronze. Frescos hand-painted in terra cotta, red, blue and purple still decorate the ceiling of the auditorium. Dust and decay have faded the colors, but the feeling of the exotic is still in the air.
Balconies on either side of the stage suggest a Moorish castle, and a bas-relief procession of elephants, camels, horses and figures wearing turbans is still visible under layers of white paint on the orchestra walls. The Garde was the first theater in the country to be decorated with the three-dimensional Mediterranean scenes in pre-colored plaster.
 
A Garde Heritage

 
 Walter S. Garde, a Hartford businessman, bought the theater site in 1925 and a month later sold it to Arthur S. Friend, a New York lawyer. But it was Mr. Garde who financed construction of the theater, and his name that remained on the building. On opening night, the "Star Spangled Banner," played on the Garde's Wurlitzer organ, led the program.
Mr. Friend quickly ran into financial difficulty and sold his interests to larger theater owners. By 1929, the days of talking pictures had arrived, and Warner Brothers, certain of a profitable investment, bought the Garde for $1 million, operating it as an RKO-Stanley-Warner outlet until its closing in 1977. Television, shopping malls and multiplex cinemas had brought down one more of the nation's grand theaters.
A nonprofit community organization, the Garde Arts Center, bought the building in 1985 with the intention of renovating and using it as a regional center for the arts. The Garde reopened in 1986, and the following year, the Eastern Connecticut Symphony Orchestra made the center its home.
Since the first performance season in 1988, restaurants and retail businesses have opened near the center, and two major buildings in the area have been restored. The 1991-92 season attracted 55,000 people.
 
Son of an Actor

 
 Mr. Sigel, 41, became managing director of the Garde in 1988 after working as managing director of the Berkshire Theater festival in Stockbridge, Mass., and general manager of the One Act Theater Company of San Francisco. Born and raised in Baltimore, Mr. Sigel was introduced to the theater as a boy accompanying his father, an actor, to community theater rehearsals and helping him read his lines.
"I was the child critic," Mr. Sigel said. "When I was older, I helped with the lights and music. And I saw how happy my father was when he was acting."
In the 1990's, video entertainment is keeping people at home, Mr. Sigel said, and one of the challenges for the Garde is to introduce families again to the pleasure of going out and mixing with neighbors they would not otherwise see. "Staying home is our greatest competition," Mr. Sigel said. "We want to create the excitement you can't get in the living room."
With that goal in mind, the Garde announced its first summer film series this year. Classics like "Singin' in the Rain," "The Sound of Music," "National Velvet," "Sunset Boulevard" and "The Abyss" are on the schedule. The theater recently installed two 35-millimeter projectors, Dolby sound processing and one of the largest screens in eastern Connecticut, which enables the theater to show everything from silent films to Cinemascope, said Laure Purcell, spokeswoman for the Garde.
The films link the Garde to its movie palace past, the excitement of the dimming lights, the parting curtains, the stirring music, the big screen. "That's what movie houses did in the 1920's," Mr. Sigel said. "For 25 cents, you could be treated like royalty. It was an escape experience, but very affordable."
Classics are also on the Garde's schedule of Broadway shows, which starts in the fall. The series includes touring company performances of "South Pacific," "The Secret Garden," "Oliver," "Evita" and "Guys and Dolls."
Mr. Sigel said he does not worry that the public's perception of cities as dangerous places will keep people away from the Garde. "New London does not have the level of crime anywhere approaching what other cities have," he said. "The best experience to help people overcome those perception problems is to come here."

HEADLINE: The Pleasures of the Land Draw Retirees

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

DATELINE: SCHOHARIE, N.Y.

 BODY:
COUNTRY life never seems to lose its appeal to those who spent a happy childhood experiencing it.
The yen to experience it again certainly never left Clyde V. Maughan, who grew up on a farm in Idaho and retired eight years ago after 36 years with General Electric in Schenectady, N.Y. Undismayed by the deporable condition of the main house, he bought a 120-acre farm in 1980 just outside the village of Schoharie, 30 miles west of Albany, thinking he would move there in retirement. 
 This plan did not sufficiently take into account the views of his wife, Norma. Her preference was to remain in the comfort of their house in Schenectady. And they have. But Mr. Maughan found time in the first few years to reconstruct the farmhouse, drain the fields and grow corn and alfalfa. He still goes to the farm regularly to work the fields. But he rents out the house.
"I like to see the soil turn over to beautiful loam," said Mr. Maughan, who is 68 and has been traveling extensively as a consulting engineer since his retirement. "You can't do it for the income. It's very expensive to keep up. You've got to like to do it and be willing to lose money on it."
It is probable that most people who buy rural properties as retreats for their retirement years do not have farming the land in mind to the extent that Mr. Maughan did. But they seem to share many of his views. This became clear in interviews with retirees in the countryside near the villages of Schoharie and Middleburgh nearby.
"For one thing, the man and the wife should both want to do it," said Mr. Maughan.
For another, it is useful to be comfortable with tools, and home repair generally. More than that -- fixing up property should be one of life's major pleasures.
"We wanted a handyman's special," said David L. Davies, 67, who got one and then some when he and his wife, Brenda, bought the 100-acre Barton farm off Barton Hill Road in Schoharie five months ago. They paid $145,000, planning to invest about a third more in bringing the property back from an advanced state of deterioration.
The former owner, Roy Barton, stopped farming the land in 1962. But he stayed on in the house until he had to leave for a nursing home as a widower in his 90's. His family put the property on the market and Mr. and Mrs. Davies bought it after a long search for just such a challenge. They have been living in the house and rebuilding it, with a contractor's help, ever since.
Then there are John and Maria Fuller, not truly of retirement age. But Mr. Fuller, 46, had to leave the New York State Police after 19 years last year because of an injury. His wife left her job in boat sales and they moved from Lindenhurst, L.I., to Norwich, N.Y., in Chenango County.
They are in a house on 144 acres off County Road 33, part of a farm that had been in the Barnes family for 150 years. They raise dogs -- lhasa apsos -- and plan to keep beef cattle, "maybe six to a dozen, not enough to make a living," said Mr. Fuller.
"It's not lonely here at all," said Mrs. Fuller, who is in her 30's and grew up in a rural part of what was then West Germany. "But you've got to be a little laid-back. You can't be wanting to go to the movies and parties all the time. You've got to like the outdoors." She likes the outdoors enough to spend five or six hours a day in it, mowing, weeding or repairing fences, or tending a garden that is 40 feet long and almost as wide. She grows corn, potatos, onions, peas, beans, cabbage, broccoli, lettuce, cucumbers, carrots and peppers.
In the long run, Mrs. Fuller says she may well try to find work in the area, and that happens not infrequently even with those who relocate to the country at or near retirement age, often after a strong taste of the life there during years of vacation time at a summer home.
But jobs are not in great supply in upstate New York. In many areas the economy is shaky, and there has been a slide in real-estate prices.
In the town of Norwich, the seat of Chenango County, Jim Antinore, the broker who found the property for the Fullers, said that the economy was depressed. Only last month Sara Lee Inc. announced that it would close its Champion Products division in Norwich, a knitting mill it acquired a year ago, with a loss of 230 jobs. The plant was founded as Norwich Mills in 1900.
"Prices have come down over the last three years," said Mr. Antinore. "What would have sold then for $150,000 is now down to the $100,000-to-$125,000 range." Condition and amenities determine price more than architectural style, he said.
The relocatees are often a welcome addition to the local economy. In Schoharie County, for example, per-capita income went from third lowest of the state's 68 counties in 1980 to 11th lowest in 1990, the county planning office said, in part because of an influx of retirees during the decade.
Farming, meanwhile, has been on the decline. The acreage in farming declined 22 percent from 1978 to 1987, to a total of 131,000 acres, the planning office said.
There are scenic and tourist attractions in Schoharie that draw people as visitors before they become buyers. Howe Caverns off Route 7 between Cobleskill and Central Bridge, and Secret Caverns nearby, are known to tourists nationally. And each village has its antiques shops and inns to draw the summer visitors driving through scenic hilly country, with vistas of farms and towns from Interstate 88 between Albany and Binghamton.
Interstate 88 has put rural parts of Schoharie County within easy reach of greater Albany and Schenectady and raised land prices as a result. But a sharp slowdown in sales took hold two years ago.
"For some reason we felt the recession later than most people," said Chris Nunaman, the broker at Century 21 Rural Estates in Schoharie. Even then activity was not at the level of the mid-80's, when sales were strong.
Mr. Nunaman estimates that about half of the 600 or 700 multiple listings in Schoharie County have substantial acreage attached to them and are part of what were once working farms. Because of the sales slowdown, listings of these rural properties have probably risen about 30 percent since 1991, he said.
In the northern part of the county, closer to Albany, rural houses in decent condition on 30 to 50 acres sell for $85,000 to $150,000, he said. Prices are about a third less in the more rural towns in the southern part of the county.
Similar country properties are available in a broad reach of central New York counties. Four of these counties, within an area roughly bounded by Schenectady, Binghamton and Syracuse, are Schoharie, Delaware, Otsego and Chenango.
In Delaware County, George Bergleitner at Delaware County Real Estate in Stanford said that second-home sales were poor last year. "And this year we had snow till April so no one came till after that," he said.
He said that buyers could find a "nice" house on 50 to 100 acres in such towns as Stanford, South Kortright and Bovina for $150,000 to $180,000. But buyers often don't want that much land. They take three-bedroom ranches on three to five acres in rural settings for $60,000 to $85,000. Prices are generally lower in the western part of the county, in such towns as Walton and Sidney.
Another reason for going slow on too much land is that it can be costly to hold. Taxes vary widely from town to town, often depending on the land's condition. Occasionally buyers seek out a long-term land-lease deal with neighboring farmers. Land leased for five years or more for farming purposes may be eligible for the state's "agricultural exemption," which sharply lowers taxes.
But more often buyers settle for private short-term deals with neighboring farms that allow the property owner to offset taxes while the fields are usefully maintained for grazing or growing.
In Chenango County, David Thomas of Chenango County Realty in Holmesville, 20 miles west of Oneonta, said that prices had been flat for the last four or five years, and sales were about half what they were in the early 80's, when many buyers were local people.
But people from the metropolitan area of New York keep coming up, often paying cash for property that seems low in price to them compared with prices back home.
One recent sale was to a New Jersey couple, Deborah and Barry Arnold of South Orange, N.J., who paid $72,000 for a four-bedroom farmhouse on 50 acres at the end of a dead-end road in Preston, five miles from the town of Norwich. Another property on the market is a 100-year-old three-bedroom farmhouse on 89 acres bordering Genegantslet Lake in McDonough, 45 miles north of Binghamton. The price is $98,000.
"These aren't fixer-uppers," Mr. Thompson said. "These are real nice houses. People come up and they say, 'God, I can get that for $150,000? And they pay cash."
Some of the older residents who began as relocatees eventually move on. One such is Dorothy D. Bagnall, who bought a century-old farmhouse on 250 acres in Oxford with her husband in 1946 and moved there from Hempstead, N.Y., after he died.
Subsequently she built a French Provincial house with more than 5,000 square feet of space on Glen Road, with 23 acres of land and a brook. For eight years she lived there alone. Now, at 83, she lives in Great Barrington, Mass. The house is on the market for $350,000.
In some cases, the retiree becomes a real estate agent and a regional promotor. The two are merged in Donald R. Allen, 60. He and his wife, Doris, moved from Connecticut three years ago after he was forced into retirement because his employer, a lingerie manufacturer based in Georgia, went out of business. Since 1979 the Allens had been summering in a 170-year-old house in Oneonta that they had bought as a derelict for $35,000.
Now he is working as a real-estate agent with Benson Agency in Oneonta, finding country properties for transplants like himself. A typical rural property with a rundown house on 20 to 40 acres can be bought for $55,000 to $60,000, Mr. Allen said. Land alone averages $500 to $650 an acre in towns such as Laurens, in Otsego County, so the house may be selling for $30,000 and the property for perhaps $25,000.
But there will be work to do. "Everything is kind of worn," Mr. Allen said. All the kitchen and bathroom equipment may have to be replaced. Drinking water may be coming from a stream instead of a well. A bank may require a new well before it makes a mortgage commitment. That will cost $2,000 to $4,000. A new septic tank may be needed, the old steel tank having rusted out. That's at least $2,500.
To put the house in first-rate condition with the help of a local contractor will "easily" cost $30,000, he said. But many buyers do the work themselves. They take their time. They are not in a hurry.
It was with Mr. Allen's help that David and Brenda Davies found the former Barton farm in Schoharie last year. Mr. Davies, who retired in 1990 as director of the Eleanor Naylor Dana Charitable Trust in Manhattan, is long-experienced in house restoration. He had already restored their own 1840 house in Ossining and was prepared to sink most of the proceeds of the sale into restoring a farm property upstate.
"We drove all around here looking," he said one recent afternoon, seated on his broad well-mown lawn under a maple tree, next to a modest old farmhouse in the throes of reconstruction. A gravel driveway flanked by tall trees provides a grand approach to the farmhouse from the road.
They have replaced 90 percent of the walls, torn out an old stairway to create a new bathroom where a landing once was, replaced the heating system and the electric wiring and put in new copper plumbing.
They jacked up the house from the basement to put in new support beams. They poured a new concrete floor. They replaced 20 windows.
All this has been done by the the couple themelves with the help of Pat Pierce, a local contractor. They have been working since they moved in last December, but still are not finished. The outside remains to be painted. Eventually they will put a dining room in a space behind the kitchen that the farmer had used for storage. But basically they have a rebuilt house of eight rooms and two baths on two floors.
Their task involves more than the house, however. There are 10 outbuildings of various sizes and description, in varying stages of decrepitude. Mr. Davies has thought of creating a workshop in a former horse barn.
"I almost had a heart attack when I heard what it would cost," he said. The estimate is $4,700 to hoist the barn and stabilize it with replacement beams. "We'll probably do it," he said.
The property also has three acres of apple orchards, untended for 30 years. The new owners have started pruning the trees, but completing the task will take several years. Two major fields of 40 or 50 acres have been planted with corn by a neighboring farmer, John Hayes, who first refenced the fields. The Davies look forward to the sight of heifers grazing on the hillside. They receive a nominal rent for the use of the land.
The couple has been working on the property 14 hours a day, seven days week since moving in, Mr. Davies said. They both take pleasure in painting, sawing, wallpapering, weeding -- "it goes on and on." They also take pleasure in visits from grandchildren, seven of them, all under the age of 10. "They all look forward to coming up to the farm," Mr. Davies said.
A few miles away, George H. Stenderhoff has been having a similar experience for 12 years, reveling as much in solitude as in farm labor. At 63, he has retired from the management of the family-owned Locust Point Marina in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx. He now spends more time than he used to on the farm he bought 12 years ago on Decker Road in the Schoharie County town of Middleburgh.
"Check out the water," he advises new buyers. It can be polluted, especially at former farms.
Mr. Stenderhoff bought 67 acres in 1982, and 21 more later on. Nowadays he spends much of his time there alone. He has a barnful of farm machinery, splendidly maintained. In the early years he kept cows, sheep and riding horses as a hobby. He has given these up, partly in favor of his latest hobby, competitive archery at the Middleburgh Rod and Gun Club.
But he still tends the fields and loses himself in country tasks.
"It's cheap living up here," he said. "Electricity is cheap, wood is cheap. If you pump water you don't have to pay the way you do in New York. You have to be able to enjoy yourself. If you have hobbies you can do them here without being interrupted.
"I work in the barns and the fields and I lose track of time. I love it. Back home there's nothing but problems."

HEADLINE: The New Faces of U.S. Manufacturing

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
IN his green surgical scrubs, Norman R. Jaffe entered the conference room as if he were a surgeon who had just implanted an artificial heart valve and had come to explain its features to the patient's relatives. A sample of the beige-colored valve, made from pig's tissue, was on the table in front of him. But there had been no operation. The conference room is in Mr. Jaffe's factory, not in a hospital. And Mr. Jaffe is not a doctor. Instead, he represents the best in American manufacturing: a scientist-entrepreneur restlessly trying to improve the heart valves that he manufactures.
"This second generation of heart valves that we are making appears to last longer in patients without having to be replaced," said Mr. Jaffe, using a pencil as a pointer to explain how the valve works. "We are developing a third-generation valve that should extend durability even more." 
 Southern California is honeycombed with innovative, high-tech companies like Mr. Jaffe's, and with manufacturers that rely on new technology like AST Research Inc., a personal computer maker, and the Rotoflow Corporation, a producer of gas turbines. The region is also honeycombed with small, low-tech companies that employ thousands of immigrants at low wages in the manufacture of nothing more complicated than apparel and furniture. As these various smaller companies proliferate, giant military contractors, like Lockheed and Hughes -- and big companies in general -- shrink their payrolls and migrate.
These are the faces of manufacturing today. They share the stage not only in Southern California but elsewhere in the nation. Together they are holding down manufacturing wages for almost everyone, avoiding unions and pushing efficiency. They are also allowing the nation's millions of immigrants to go up the economic ladder a rung or two. And they are constantly forming alliances to develop new products. The financing for Mr. Jaffe's latest heart valve, for example, comes partly from St. Jude Medical, a big Minnesota company on the hunt for fresh devices to market.
 
New Industrial Heartland
 Nowhere is the new look of American manufacturing more evident than in the six counties of Southern California, a zone that stretches from just north of Los Angeles to just south of San Diego, and inland to the San Gabriel Mountains and the Mojave Desert. With 1.1 million people engaged in manufacturing, the six counties constitute the nation's largest manufacturing belt.
That has not insulated the region from the decline in manufacturing employment endemic in America, nor the inroads of a recession that has endured in California for four years. But no other state in the Union has as many manufacturing jobs as Southern California -- although the hills and open country here, and the graceful industrial parks, tend to hide the concentrated factory life.
"Southern California is in many ways a microcosm of the future of America, particularly for manufacturing," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said. "Everything that is good about our future, as well as the things we worry about, seem to start in Southern California."
That ambivalence certainly applies to the thousands of small companies making the low-end products. They might never have been formed in the United States without Southern California's huge pool of immigrants to employ.
The apparel industry alone, having cut back elsewhere in the nation, employs 125,000 workers in Southern California, according to state government data. Most earn less than $6.50 an hour.
"Unless wages rise in the third world, you are faced with two alternatives: pay low wages here or send the production abroad," said Richard Rothstein, a newspaper columnist in Los Angeles and a researcher for the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. "So if you were not making the goods here, you would be importing them. Is this a good thing? The alternative, creating the jobs here, helps the immigrants, who spend their wages and pay taxes."
And they move up the job ladder, reinforcing Southern California as a manufacturing center. Immigrants or their children, for example, occupy most of the 35 jobs at Mr. Jaffee's company, Hancock/Jaffe Laboratories, in nearby Irvine. They have become owners of growing companies like AST Research, which three young foreigners started on a shoestring. The partners employ 1,500 Californians today in the manufacture of personal computers.
Immigrants are truly represented at Rotoflow, which manufactures giant turbines used in the natural gas industry. Frank van Gogh, the president, counts 30 nationalities among his 200 employees, most of them Asians and Hispanics.
Mr. van Gogh is Australian. He represents Atlas Copco, a Swedish company that purchased Rotoflow in 1990, from its founder, Judson S. Swearingen, a Texan who relocated in Los Angeles and often hired immigrants and trained them.
"We are an international business, and the work force that we found here has become our great strength," Mr. van Gogh said. "We got an order out of Korea, and we think one reason is that we sent a Korean-American who speaks fluent Korean. They trusted him. We are getting orders out of China and Taiwan, and we sent our Chinese people to negotiate them."
But wages are another matter. They are continually under downward pressure. The bigger companies apply this pressure by shifting some production to lower-cost states.
Others like Rotoflow, unwilling to give up their experienced workers, nevertheless manage to shed some. Last month, five left, replaced by computerized machinery. While Mr. van Gogh's engineers and shop foremen earn $40,000 and up, the automation has helped to keep the average blue-collar wage at $13 an hour.
"We stick to the pay that prevails in the marketplace," Mr. van Gogh said.
So does Mr. Jaffe, and the dozen or more companies like his that cluster near each other in Irvine and engage, successfully, in the single task of developing artificial human parts from animal tissue.
Mr. Jaffe's production workers, many of them women who painstakingly assemble the heart valves by hand, spending a day on each one, average $12 an hour, although a few who have been with Mr. Jaffe since he and a partner founded the company in 1987 earn up to $20 an hour.
"The industry is trying to move away from so much pay," said Mr. Jaffe, a 51-year-old former professor of medicine, whose valves sell for $3,000 apiece. "We recognize that manufacturing costs cannot be passed on to the end user forever, and we are trying to keep a cap on wages."
 
Need to Lower Costs
 So is AST Research, but in a different fashion. "When you reach a certain size in a high-cost state like California, you have to look at other choices," said Safi U. Qureshey, a Pakistani, who as a young immigrant recently out of college, helped to found AST with two friends from Hong Kong and is now its chairman.
While AST's headquarters, design center and one factory -- the factory where the newest products are first made -- remain in Orange County, 5,000 of the company's 6,500 employees work at factories in Texas, Hong Kong, Ireland and Taiwan, churning out older-model computers.
"We are trying to keep all the high-end new stuff nearby, so there can be contact between manufacturing, marketing and design," Mr. Qureshey said.
Until recently, AST had been making desktop computers at the Orange County plant. They have been switched to Fort Worth, and 600 jobs switched with them. Notebook computers, still in the development stage, have taken up residence instead at the Orange County plant.
The big military contractors -- most of them aerospace companies making warplanes, missiles and satellites for the Government -- practice a similar migration. These companies and their numerous suppliers still employ 25 percent of the manufacturing workers in Southern California, according to McKinsey & Company, a management consulting firm. But that number has been falling, to 235,000 from more than 350,000 in the 1980's.
Military contractors that once stayed put in communities like Palmdale, Irvine and Burbank still keep their front offices, research centers and design operations there. But the factories that were also present, providing blue-collar jobs at $15 an hour or more, have been shifting to states offering lower costs.
The recession that began four years ago and is just beginning to lift in California undoubtedly exacerbated this process. But even before the recession, Lockheed began to move warplane manufacturing from Burbank to a plant in Marietta, Ga. And others have engaged in similar migrations.
McDonnell Douglas, for example, is shifting helicopter production to a plant in Mesa, Ariz., and the Hughes Missile Systems Company is closing three missile plants in Southern California and consolidating production in Tucson, Ariz. -- eliminating 5,000 California jobs in the process.
"The strategy was to relocate to a modern facility in Tucson that was only 40 percent utilized," said Cal Kirby, a Hughes vice president. "And this was possible because we have good engineers in Arizona, as well as in California."
Wages in these states are often less than in California. So are taxes and the costs of workmen's compensation and of compliance with environmental rules.
Then there is politics: California's congressional delegation has not been as energetic as politicians elsewhere in lobbying for military business, says Robert Paulson, a McKinsey director and head of its aerospace practice.
"You want to be in a state with a Congressman like Sam Nunn, who puts his emphasis on defense spending," Mr. Paulson said. Mr. Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, heads the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Despite such lures, considerable aerospace production remains in California. Both Hughes and Lockheed assemble satellites, for example, in Southern California, and they intend to continue doing so, according to their officials.
Mr. Paulson even suggests that the aerospace industry's migrations from Southern California may be ending.
"All the stuff that is easy to move probably has been moved," he said. "The high-volume, blue-collar work is largely gone. What is left is the research and low volume production, or the production that is too costly to move, like satellite assembly. You need enormous chambers to build them."
Still, Lockheed's Burbank complex is a sobering sight. The huge gray and sandstone-colored buildings, where generations of warplanes were made, are empty and sealed. Wild flowers grow through cracks in the vast pavement, and 9,600 factory jobs are gone.
Seventy percent of these job losers have been re-employed in California, says Don J. Nakamoto, research director for the International Association of Machinists local that represented the Lockheed workers.
"People in the early layoffs managed for a while to find new jobs, often in aerospace, at just a little less than the $15 to $16 they had been earning at Lockheed," Mr. Nakamoto said. "But that has come down dramatically, and the average now in re-employment is $10 an hour."
 
A Start for Immigrants
 That is a hardship for aerospace workers, but very respectable pay at Fairchild of California, a family-owned company that manufactures inexpensive upholstered sofas and easy chairs. For many years, Walter Haigh ran the company, and now his son Scott, 33, is the president. The father, in his heyday, employed mostly Americans. Only two or three are left among the 100 employees. The rest are from Mexico, having started as floor sweepers and janitors, at $6 an hour, often before speaking any English.
Technology at Fairchild rises no higher than band saws. But in the world of small manufacturers dependent on immigrant labor for survival, Fairchild is a class operation.
Sales representatives, working on commission, market the sofas and easy chairs mostly in California, but also in other Western states, and even in Japan. Three-quarters of the workers have five years at the company, and they enjoy company-paid health insurance for themselves, but not their families.
Those who survive the first difficult weeks are encouraged to quickly take the first step up the ladder, from floor sweeper to the band saws to cut pieces for the furniture frames. "We make it clear when we hire, that we don't want anyone remaining as a janitor," Scott Haigh said. The next step is assembly of the frames and then on to upholstery, the most difficult task.
But going up the job ladder does not mean automatic raises. There are no raises. Instead, there are piece rates, which means extra pay for extra output. The best frame makers average $9.50 an hour, Mr. Haigh said, and in upholstery they can go as high as $15 an hour, when they work. A day off means a day without any pay.
Mr. Haigh has considered moving to Mexico, but uprooting a family business is a hardship that he rejects, and rebuilding an experienced labor force in Mexico might eat up all the savings from lower wages, he says.
What's more, Los Angeles keeps Mr. Haigh in the middle of his most important market. The apparel makers invoke a similar reason for being in Los Angeles, rather than Mexico.
"If you are making 200 or 300 shirts or dresses for fast delivery, then this is the place to be for these rush orders; there are a lot of mom and pop shops turning out small lots quickly," said Joseph Rodriguez, executive director of the Garment Contractors Association of Southern California.
Still, for Mr. Haigh, whose revenues reach $10 million a year, profit margins are very slim because price increases for his furniture, which sells for between $200 and $400, are hard to get, given the competition.
"If you have a garage and you buy lumber and upholstery, you can make furniture," Mr. Haigh said. "A lot of Asians do this, using family members or friends to make furniture for a cousin or an uncle or a brother who has a retail store. This easy entry holds down prices. In most industries, it is the big players who set the price points, but here it is the small people."
Nonetheless, Mr. Haigh makes a living, and some of his workers improve their lot.
Efren Tamayo, who is 51, has worked for the Haighs since 1977 and has run the frame department since 1980, now earning $435 a week. His oldest daughter recently earned a bachelor's degree in history and Chicano studies from the University of California at Los Angeles, and two other children are in college.
Mr. Tamayo's salary, however, has been frozen for two years, and while the company buys him health insurance, he can't afford any for his family. "That is a risk," he said, "but I feel proud of what I have done in this country."
 
Pushing Down Wages
 Mr. Tamayo's pride is hardly a feather in the cap of American manufacturing. Low wages and low technology are not a formula for raising the national standard of living. "There is an effort to meet the competition on cost by pushing down on wages and working conditions, which means competing more and more against the third world," said Allan J. Scott, an economist at the University of California at Los Angeles. "In the end, you can't win that game."
The military contractors might eventually move into new endeavors like electric cars, but so far their efforts in this direction have created very few jobs. The innovative, high-tech companies like Hancock/Jaffe or AST Research that proliferate in Southern California are an important solution. Everyone agrees on that point. But so far these companies have failed to generate the huge employment that came with the big investments and heavy Federal spending for weaponry -- and they may never do so.
"Employment in the entire medical device industry is not equal to the job loss at Lockheed," Mr. Scott said.

COMPANIES
 
Barry Diller Can Stop Sending Out His Resume
In its simplest terms, the huge CBS-QVC merger, one that reshapes the television industry, can be seen as a couple of guys changing jobs. Barry Diller, head of QVC, is rarin' to go at 52. He'd worked on programming at ABC and created the Fox network, and he's wanted to get back into prime time -- as witness his failed effort to buy Paramount. Laurence Tisch, at 71, has really treated CBS as an investment and is ready to cash part of it in. But don't think, as David Letterman suggested, that the "60 Minutes" stopwatch will now be "yours for $49.95." CBS will, however, get a desired foothold in cable. So why did both CBS and QVC stock jump so sharply? Perhaps because, as one CBS executive put it, Mr. Tisch just "put the money in the bank," and now Mr. Diller will breathe life, and growth, into the company. Or perhaps, heaven help us, we're in for another bidding war. (Disney has been mentioned as eyeing CBS.) 

Have Phone, Will Amble
Not long ago, the phone business seemed downright orderly (back when phones had cords and calls traveled over wires). AT&T and its rivals had long distance, the Baby Bells short distance. But then this wireless stuff started, and cable got mixed up in it, and now it's a free-for-all again. AT&T is trying to buy McCaw, the No. 1 cellular company, but Bell Atlantic is determined to take them on. Last week it agreed to merge its cellular holdings with Nynex's, locking up a big chunk of the East Coast, and it's eyeing other alliances across the nation. And as these giants battle it out, the competition should drive down those hefty rates for cellular calls -- and clog the sidewalks with people walking along having very serious phone conversations.
 
Once They Built a Railroad . . .
News about railroads is somehow comforting amid the talk of vast realignments in television, of phone calls swirling through the air. Railroads are so elemental, rolling bits of history. Since deregulation in 1980, though, they've been combining to cut costs, and last week saw two of the biggest join hands. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Pacific (owner of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe) plan to merge in a $2.7 billion stock swap. The new company will have 31,000 miles of track in the Midwest, Southeast and West. The new name's a mouthful, though. Can you imagine Judy Garland singing, "On the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company"?
 
Blue Cross Joins the Fray
The health care sands keep shifting before our eyes. For 60 years Blue Cross and Blue Shield has been the symbol of nonprofit sprawl, but that approach just may not work anymore. With insurers creating vast alliances, all the managed-care networks need to invest in fancy technology. So last week Blue Cross said, well, profit is O.K. after all -- and allowed its members to shed their nonprofit yokes and sell stock. The move drew some fire, with one critic fearful of seeing "healthy profits become more important than healthy patients." And what of battered Empire Blue Cross? Nonprofit is just fine, it said -- surely realizing investors would be scarce anyway.
 
The Intel Variation
Companies adore sports; with America's fixation on bouncing balls and swinging bats and grunting millionaires, any sponsor that shoves its name in front of fans gets big-time visibility. But chess? Uh, we'll just watch some paint dry, thanks. But now comes Intel, which says chess can be turned into a spectator sport, and is sponsoring the Professional Chess Association, led by the world champion, Gary Kasparov. Last week at the Javits Center, Intel assembled top world players, made them move before fans nodded off (maximum game time: 50 minutes), and added in big screens and fancy graphics. The Knicks? How's their pawn center?
 
A Pyramid for the West Side
Most people's real estate dreams are modest -- a first house, fixing a kitchen. But Donald Trump's dreams have always been of a different order. For a decade he's pined to erect a high-rise colossus along the Hudson from 59th to 72d, always to be delayed by debts and doubters. But last week his Riverside South -- 5,000 or so apartments, 16 towers -- suddenly seemed real. A group of Hong Kong investors came up with some big money (amount: unspecified) to get him started, and work could actually begin within a year. It's a "solid vote of confidence in New York City," said Mayor Giuliani. But critics, like the Coalition for a Livable West Side, still aren't cheering.
 
ECONOMY
 
Health Care: The Longest Battle
Has this endless health care battle been worse than Normandy? When Sam Gibbons, who grabbed the House health baton when Dan Rostenkowski was sent to the doghouse, was asked that, he said only, "It was longer." But for Mr. Gibbons's Ways and Means Committee, at least, it ended last week, as the panel barely passed legislation that includes two items on the President's must-have list: coverage for all, with employers picking up most of the tab. In the Senate, though, Pat Moynihan and Bob Dole faced off in the Finance Committee on a requirement for employers to pay for coverage, and Mr. Moynihan was soundly defeated. By the time this increasingly partisan jockeying is over, of course, the health industry may reinvent itself to the point that most "reform" is redundant.
 
Cuomo Finds a Soft Spot
"I can't give money away to make myself popular," Gov. Mario Cuomo said in February, referring to some state taxes that retired Federal employees had paid and now wanted back. In the late 80's, it seems, New York made Federal retirees pay taxes on pension income while exempting state workers. The Supreme Court put an end to that in 1989, and then retirees demanded the taxes back that they'd paid from 1986 to 1988, but Mr. Cuomo was balking. Last week, though, he said the state would refund some $62 million -- an average of $6,000 per retiree.
 
The Numbers Never Wilt
School's out, July 4 is upon us: this nation's thinking summer. But still the economic numbers come, like the sorcerer's merciless brooms, so pore we must over these wispy smoke signals. What does last week's batch tell us? A bit of this, a bit of that. New-home sales were strong, consumer confidence hit a four-year high, construction spending posted its third rise. That adds up to economic overheating, imminent inflation. But wait: the leading indicators, which are supposed to sum it all up, were unchanged for the second month -- and that, of course, means cool and steady. So flip a coin, have some designer seltzer, and don't think about it till Tuesday.
 
Smoke-easies? Not Just Yet
Tobacco companies have been taking out ads raising alarms about cigarettes being banned, but David Kessler, head of the F.D.A., said no such drastic moves are contemplated. In fact, he said, he hopes to avoid big regulatory changes -- in spite of recent disclosures about addiction. It gets tricky, though, because if the F.D.A. declares nicotine an addictive drug -- the almost inevitable next turn in this fast-moving plot -- the legal wheels start turning on autopilot: if it's a drug, the F.D.A. must declare it safe, which is impossible. . . .
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
The Coffee Shock of '94?
Modern life has a handful of essentials. Food, air, fax machines -- and, of course, coffee. So get ready for angry lines at the coffee wagon, alternate-day fill-ups at Zabar's. A cold snap just wiped out a third of the crop in Brazil, which produces a quarter of the world's coffee, and commodity traders reacted as if they'd had a cup too many, sending coffee futures soaring 25 percent in a day, to the highest price in seven years. And even though this was next year's crop, food companies cashed in quickly by raising prices.
 
Order on the High Seas
For two decades, many nations perched on the earth's land have tried to agree on a law for the earth's water -- a Law of the Sea treaty covering issues like fishing and oil exploration, a recognition that the oceans are a "common heritage of mankind." No way, said President Reagan in 1982, saying the pact violated the idea of free enterprise. But last week the Administration said that America would finally sign -- that the pact was friendlier to business now. (Though some conservatives still see too many burdens on business.)

HEADLINE: At Work;
Solving the Zoe Baird Problem

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble 

 BODY:
SOME people achieve celebrity and others have it thrust upon them. Just ask Zoe Baird, the erstwhile Clinton Administration nominee for Attorney General, whose nightmarish 15 minutes of fame may never end, thanks to the infinite ability of the English language to absorb new idioms. Whether the uproar over her revelation that she employed two undocumented aliens was fair or not -- and she has many off-the-record defenders -- the phrase "to have a Zoe Baird problem" has roosted in the vocabularies of the professional classes in any large American city with an immigrant labor force.
The phrase is now instantly recognizable code for failing to comply with any of the trillion or so immigration and tax laws that cover the employment of a foreign-born worker, especially a foreign-born worker who is not authorized to work. At a forum at the Association of the Bar of the City of New York last week, immigration lawyers and immigrant rights groups contended that the Zoe Baird problem was built into the process of finding and hiring someone to provide child care or other types of in-home care for family members. 
 The panel -- and several members of the audience -- urged changes in immigration and tax laws that would simplify the hiring process and protect workers who have an employer problem. The movement has no real legislative champion in Washington yet and, given the nativist mood in many parts of the country, may be hopeless for the foreseeable future. But the need, those present argued, is great.
The root of discontent is the Immigration Act of 1990, an attempt by Congress to diversify the pool of immigrants to the United States and to expand the number of individuals who could enter the country to work.
Congress expanded the number of visas available for employment-based -- as opposed to family-based -- immigration, but slotted most of the visas for professional or technically skilled workers, in the process virtually extinguishing the "other worker" category into which much home-care employment falls. It limited to 10,000 the number of visas for so-called unskilled labor, or any job requiring fewer than two years of post-secondary school education, training or experience, even though there is a shortage of caregivers, especially live-in caregivers.
Employers must receive Labor Department certification that they made a good-faith effort to find a native-born employee before hiring a foreign-born worker. To obtain legal status, immigrants must have the sponsorship of a close relative or employer. The latter category, according to immigrant rights groups, is fraught with opportunities for exploitation.
The immediate impact of the law, when it went into effect in 1991, was to throw unskilled workers -- including home-care employees who had already applied for permanent resident status -- into a Kafkaesque administrative holding pattern. In January, the last time the State Department did a tally, there were 94,000 people on the waiting list. The cases of people who filed papers as of May 1, 1988, are currently coming up, according to a State Department spokesman.
The practical effect of the law has been to extend the wait for a green card to a decade or more, some contend, from three or four years. "If I establish in 1994 that I can't find a U.S. worker and they approve it, is it rational that I have to wait for 10 to 15 years to hire them legally?" said Frances C. Berger, chairwoman of the Immigration Committee of the New York Women's Bar Association, who moderated the forum.
Theoretically, the foreign-born can work only if they are in the United States legally and have the correct documentation, but as everyone learned before a conveniently childless candidate ended the search for an Attorney General, the hiring of illegal caregivers is an endemic labor practice, among paralegals and secretaries as well as $250,000-a-year executives, in cities like New York, Los Angeles or Miami -- points of entry to the United States as well as centers of immigrant population. Cities with a baby sitter or nanny labor force tend to lack even the fragile, faint day-care networks that exist in other parts of the country.
Several proposals drafted by bar associations and immigration lawyer groups are in circulation. They aren't identical but share a concern to balance protecting the employment opportunities of native-born workers and the interests and rights of immigrants, legal or illegal, while expanding the pool of in-home care workers.
The proposal drafted by the Task Force on Quality Legal Child Care of the New York Women's Bar, for example, includes these provisions:
* Set up a new temporary visa category for foreign workers whose employers have received Labor Department certification. This would allow many workers to move from the limbo of being illegally unemployed -- and at risk of deportation -- into a legal category.
* Reclassify the home-care worker category to "skilled" from "unskilled." This would transfer many foreign workers out of the category for which there are only 10,000 visas annually and into one for which visas are more readily available.
* Require employers to comply with Federal, state and local laws and pay the prevailing regional wage for in-home care.
While many employers want to do right by their employees, some are obviously quite prepared to exploit the vulnerability of illegal aliens by paying them low wages, working them long hours and worse. Live-in workers particularly run the risk of ending up in virtual indentured servitude, at the mercy of sponsors with no compunction about threatening to call in the Immigration and Naturalization Service to extract more work.
Margie McHugh, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, said in an interview after the forum that she had not seen all of the proposals but that she supported requiring employers to pay the prevailing wage and the principle of detaching the immigrant's fate from the sponsor's. "We need to find a mechanism within the law to be sure that women can be independent, so they have work authorization that allows them to move from an abusive employer," she said.
Live-in workers are especially vulnerable. "They work around the clock in isolated conditions," Ms. McHugh said. "It's been extremely difficult to reach them. We feel desperate for a change in the law to improve their working conditions."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Coffee and Oil Feed Boom in Colombia

BYLINE: By James Brooke 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia

 BODY:
WORLD attention swiveled to Colombia last week after a freeze damaged coffee crops in Brazil and sent coffee prices spiking up to eight-year highs. But the world's second-largest producer of coffee is riding more than a bean bonanza.
For the first half of 1994, Colombia had one of the best performing stock markets in the world. Bucking a slump in emerging markets, Colombia's stock market index jumped to 1019.7, or 30.6 percent in dollar terms, this year, behind only Japan's market, which has risen 34.6 percent this year. Other top performing markets include Chile, at 21.7 percent, and Peru, at 15.4 percent. 
 In the first half of this year, volumes on Colombia's three exchanges -- in Bogota, Medellin and Occidente -- totaled $1.7 billion, nearly double the volume last year.
"The future outlook is good; the coffee price increase and the Cusiana bonanza are good news," said Hernan Valdivieso, general manager of Casa de Bolsa, a leading brokerage firm here. He referred to the enormous Cusiana oil fields that will start producing next year in eastern Colombia. "If we did not have the drug and violence problem," he said, "we could be another Hong Kong or Taiwan."
In recent years, Colombia's illicit cocaine trade harmed the country's image as an appropriate market for investment. But this seems to be changing after Colombian police shot and killed Pablo Escobar, the country's most notorious cocaine trafficker, last December. "When Escobar died, foreign investors started to look at the country in a more favorable light," said Alden Brewster, a New York trader in emerging markets.
Despite the relatively small size of Colombia's markets, foreign interest is now soaring. In the last 18 months, the number of foreign funds investing in Colombia's markets increased to 85 from 22. And the portfolio of foreign-held stocks in Colombia has more than quadrupled in the last year, to $400 million at the end of May.
Bogota's exchange, the largest in the Andean region, ranks as Latin America's fifth largest -- after the exchanges in Mexico City; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Santiago, Chile, and Buenos Aires.
Bogota's boom stems from myriad factors, starting with the healthy economy of Colombia, South America's most populous nation after Brazil. Colombia has the only large economy in the region to record positive growth rates for the last 20 years. Its economic growth of 5.3 percent last year may be repeated this year. Its corporate profits are expected to jump 22 percent this year.
To encourage investors, the Government has freed rates on brokerage commissions and has abolished local taxes on dividends and capital gains. At the same time, high interest rates have forced many Colombian companies to raise cash by issuing stock or by selling bonds. In the last year, the number of Colombian companies issuing stock jumped to 120 from 30.
Depository receipts have been issued in United States in the last year by four Colombian blue chip companies: two financial institutions, Banco Ganadero and Corporacion Financiera del Valle; a cement company, Cementos Diamante, and a supermarket chain, Carulla y Compania.
Fueling a thirst for investment credits, President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo slashed import tariffs, throwing obsolete industries into direct competition with efficient foreign companies. Ernesto Samper Pizano, who is to be inaugurated as the new President on Aug. 7, is expected to maintain roughly the same free market policies.
Further adding to stock trading volumes, the Government privatized several state banks this year, including Banco de Colombia, the nation's second-largest bank. Stock demand is expected to increase next year as private pension funds enter the markets.
"The majority of the pension fund money will go into fixed-rate funds, but we expect that 15 to 20 percent will go into stocks," predicted Luis Fernando Lopez, superintendent of the agency that regulates Colombia's stock market. Last year, only 7 percent of trading activity in Colombia's markets was in stocks. The rest was in bonds. So far this year, the portion of trading in stocks has increased to 17 percent.
After a leading group of equity funds crashed in the 1980's, Colombian investors became leery of stocks, preferring bonds or real estate. But with tightened oversight and the passage of time, the nation's investors are gradually returning to stocks.
In many Latin American markets, downturns came as portfolio managers in the United States called their money home to take advantage of higher interest rates. Yet in Colombia, foreign influence over the markets has been small. Last year, foreigners accounted for only 11 percent of stock trades in Bogota's market.
For investors, Cynthia Rosenberg, president of Baring's new office here, recommended the stocks of Banco de Ganadero, Banco de Bogota, Curulla, construction companies and cement companies. Her company is avoiding textiles, a sector that has failed to compete against foreign imports.
Stocks of such cement companies as Cementos Caribe and Cementos del Valle are bound to thrive on news that construction permits doubled in the first four months of this year and that the new Government plans to spend billions of oil revenues on public works projects. Colombia's annual per capita consumption of cement is already 453 pounds, just short of the 493-pound level for the United States.

HEADLINE: Who Says Shoreham Couldn't Be Evacuated?

 BODY:
"L.I. Power Authority to Consider Converting Shoreham to Gas" [May 22] perpetuates one of the myths used by the plant's opponents to frighten public. The article says, "The closing was based on findings that people could not be safely removed in a reactor accident." Findings by whom? Not by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which, after extensive hearings found that an operating license to Lilco. Had the N.R.C. determined that the area around the plant could not be safely evacuated no license would have been issued.
It was Nora Bredes, Gregory Blass, Peter Cohalan, Richard Kessel, Wayne Prospect and the other 20th-century Luddites whose opposition to the plant, against all environmental and economic logic, who perpetuated the myth that the area around the plant couldn't be evacuated and who also told the public that there was a "used and useful doctrine" that guaranteed that if the plant was never operated, the ratepayers wouldn't have to pay for it. 
 Mr. Kessel's role in this con game was particularly odious. When the "used and useful" fairy tale collapsed, he than advertised Governor Cuomo's deal with Lilco to close the plant as a savings for the ratepayers. Without blinking an eye Mr. Kessel assured us that it was cheaper to build a $5.5 billion plant, spend hundreds of millions decommissioning it and pay for other forms of power than it was to operate the completed plant.
This deal has given us the highest electric rates in the country, rates which will continue to increase for the rest of the century. The fact that Mr. Kessel is the chairman of the State Consumer Protection Board is certainly the height of absurdity. With friends like Mr. Kessel, New York State consumers don't need enemies.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Poor Health;
You May Fire When Ready, Senators

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

 BODY:
ONE of the real Bob Doles just stood up. Not the one Pat Moynihan had been counting on, the World War II veteran whose own life has been shaped by rehabilitative medicine, paid for by the government and his neighbors in Russell, Kan., and whose voice last fall was steady, or pretty steady, for the principle of making sure all Americans had health insurance. Mr. Moynihan, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has said for months that he and Mr. Dole would cut a deal.
Instead, the Bob Dole who stood up Wednesday to announce a Republican health care plan was the Dole who is all but running for President in a party where the political right is more dominant every year. He offered a plan for insurance law changes and $100 billion in subsidies for the very poor over five years, and sounded almost embarrassed about it, saying it was "not a gimmick." He boasted about other things it was not -- a program with a "big, big, big bureaucracy," or new taxes, or cost controls -- and insisted he'd never thought insuring all Americans was more than a "goal." His reconstruction: "I didn't object to everybody being covered." 
 The minority leader's choice of paths was one reason the Finance Committee seemed to be going all over the compass as it staggered to adopt a health care bill yesterday. But not the only reason. Mr. Moynihan had gambled on the committee's historic collegiality and led it gently while waiting for a consensus. He lost his gamble and the committee was already lurching about when Mr. Dole came to argue for a new course.
Still, as the debate over national health insurance approaches a new phase -- consideration, possibly simultaneous on the floor of the House and Senate -- the Kansas Republican is an example of how new characters will be taking center stage.
Move over, Harry and Louise, and Pat, and and maybe even Bill and Hillary. Not only Mr. Dole, but Newt Gingrich in the House will be leading the opposition. And Mr. Moynihan and all the other Democratic committee chairmen will no longer be starring, but playing supporting roles behind their majority leaders, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri. It will be their job to meld the bills that different committees in both houses have voted out -- and to try to assemble packages that can find majorities.
The ultimate questions are how to cover all Americans and to control costs. The obvious route to universal coverage is to get almost all the way there by requiring employers to insure their workers, and then requiring the rest to buy insurance, while subsidizing the poor. But the intense opposition of organized small business has made that very hard. That was President Clinton's proposal, and three Congressional committees before Finance followed it more or less.
Similarly, the Clinton plan depended on saving money by stimulating competition in the health care industry, with encouragement to health maintenance organizations and other cost-conscious styles of practice. But he and three Congressional committees relied on insurance premium limits as a backup. A bipartisan group that calls itself the "mainstream coalition" (Mr. Dole calls it "the midstream group") took over the Finance Committee with its commitment to competition; but it relied on taxing insurance policies and semi-automatic subsidy reductions, not premium limits, for cost control.
While finding a workable system that can attract votes and reach both goals may be daunting, Mr. Mitchell said Friday that was the task he has set himself, beginning this week when he takes both the Finance Committee's bill and the more Clintonesque product of Senator Edward M. Kennedy's Labor and Human Resources Committee home with him to Maine. He said in an interview: "I believe that the two goals are not only essential independently. But they are interrelated. You can't get effective cost control until you get everyone covered, and you can't get everyone covered unless you control costs in the process."
Everyone will be insisting that party politics has nothing to do with this, though few will do it with the cheek of the Republican National Committee, whose television advertisement on health care purports to be "a bipartisan message." But Mr. Gephardt is not counting on a single Republican vote, and Mr. Mitchell is not much more optimistic. Party strategists see the issue as critical: Democrats think they need a health care law to stave off serious election losses while Republicans feel that they can cripple President Clinton if they can beat him on the issue.
The added cast of characters may not only have new Congressmen and Senators in starring and supporting roles. Supporters of national health insurance are counting on thousands of extras. For months they have been talking about bringing the force of ordinary people, who heavily support both universal health insurance and making employers provide it, into the debate. But except for some lame efforts by the Democratic National Committee, they have done nothing to make it happen.
 
'Heart and Soul'
 Last week Mr. Kennedy, who worked with grassroots efforts for civil rights legislation and organized such an effort against the Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork, met every morning with organizations that can put the heat on their lawmakers. They talked of bus caravans to Washington, a unified message in black churches on July 31, organized telephone campaigns. The Massachusetts Democrat ran Friday's session like a revival meeting. To rhythmic cheers, he told the crowd, "If we have a battle for our nation's heart and soul, it is now, this is the time."
If Mr. Kennedy, who first introduced national health insurance legislation in 1970, has outside voices to cheer on this effort, Mr. Dole has the ultimate Senate weapon -- talk. He has almost enough supporters for his bill to maintain a filibuster, and could get the rest if somehow Mr. Mitchell manages to sidetrack the centrist "mainstream" group.
But on an issue as important as this, the filibuster is a weapon that could be self-destructive. Republicans fear the label of obstructionist; Democrats love to pin it on them. Purist conservatives try to dismiss those fears. One Republican strategist, Bill Kristol, argued last week: "We should make clear now that there will be no deal. 'Obstructionism,' when it comes to protecting our health care system, is no vice."
That allusion to Barry Goldwater's "extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice" may warm conservative hearts, but Mr. Goldwater suffered a crushing defeat. Mr. Dole has suffered three humiliating defeats as a national candidate, and it hardly helps to win the nomination in a way that makes the general election hopeless. Ask George McGovern. Or George Bush. So on the issue of filibuster, and, more than that, of compromise, the other Dole could still enter in the final act.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Fierce Combat on Fewer Battlefields

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Supreme Court term that ended Thursday was a struggle: While the Justices decided fewer cases than in any term since 1955, many of the decisions they produced revealed deep divisions and some bore the marks of raw ideological combat. On a Court largely without a prevailing ideology, cases have to be won and coalitions built case by case.
The fleeting promise of unanimity that an early ruling in a sexual harassment case appeared to offer back in November faded quickly once the Court began to wrestle with private-property rights, redistricting, religion and public schools, and the free-speech rights of abortion protesters. 
 Two voting-rights cases that disappeared from view after they were argued on Oct. 4, the first day of the term, finally emerged on the last day, and it only then became apparent what had taken so long.
Justice Clarence Thomas, in his most revealing personal statement since joining the Court three years ago, produced a 59-page attack on what he described as the "disastrous misadventure" of 30 years of judicial interpretation of the Voting Rights Act.
Writing a separate opinion in a Georgia voting-rights case, Justice Thomas said judges had mistakenly assumed power under the law to draw district lines on the basis of race. In doing so, he said, the judiciary had "given credence to the view that race defines political interest" and that "members of racial and ethnic groups must all think alike."
Only Justice Antonin Scalia joined his opinion. Four other Justices -- John Paul Stevens, Harry A. Blackmun, David H. Souter, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- attacked it as a "radical" attempt to argue policy rather than law.
While Justice Thomas's view has no chance of prevailing, the exchange itself highlighted the Court's current dynamic: Justices Thomas and Scalia at the extreme conservative end of the Court's spectrum, and Justices Blackmun, Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg occupying a place that, while certainly not classically liberal, can be defined as liberal relative to where the Court is today.
These four voted together in many of the term's closely divided and most important cases. They were on the same side in 11 of the term's 14 rulings that were decided by 5-to-4 votes, a group that included major rulings on property rights and criminal law as well as voting rights. In eight of those 11 cases, the four Justices were the dissenters. They prevailed as a group only in the three criminal-law rulings in which Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joined them.
Neither Justices Thomas, Scalia, Sandra Day O'Connor or Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist ever joined the four in a 5-to-4 decision. However, several of the term's most important decisions were 6-to-3 rulings, with a majority composed of Justices Kennedy, O'Connor, Blackmun, Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg. These included a decision that a public school district that New York State created for a village of Hasidic Jews was unconstitutional, and another decision barring jury selection on the basis of sex.
Justice Kennedy occupied the gravitational center of the Court. He was never on the losing side in a 5-to-4 decision, and he dissented in only five of the term's 84 cases. His most notable dissent came on Thursday, when he broke with the Chief Justice and joined Justices Scalia and Thomas in their view that an injunction against disruptive demonstrations at a Florida abortion clinic was unconstitutional.
Justice O'Connor dissented 10 times, the next-lowest number. The most frequent dissenter was Justice Blackmun, who differed 28 times. Justice Blackmun is retiring after a dramatic 24-year tenure that saw him traverse the Court's ideological spectrum to end his career as the Court's most liberal member.
President Clinton's nominee to succeed him, Judge Stephen G. Breyer, whose all-but-certain confirmation will follow hearings that begin July 12, will almost surely fit comfortably with Justice Blackmun's three allies. Just as surely, he will not be in a position to change the direction of the Court even if he were so inclined.
Justice Ginsburg, President Clinton's first Supreme Court nominee, made a vigorous debut that reflected her long experience on a Federal appeals court and her familiarity with many of the issues on the Court's docket. Of the four Justices in her wing of the Court, she was the closest to the Court's center.
In the 35 decisions that found Justice Blackmun and Chief Justice Rehnquist on opposite sides, Justice Ginsburg voted 19 times with Justice Blackmun and 16 times with the Chief Justice.
By contrast, Justice Souter voted 24 times with Justice Blackmun and 11 with the Chief Justice. Justice Stevens voted 30 times with Justice Blackmun and 5 with the Chief Justice.
This is a rough and mechanistic measure of a Justice's views; admittedly, cases are not fungible, and not all votes are equally weighty. But imprecise as they are, such statistics do give at least a snapshot of the Court's polarity at a given moment. In the 35 cases, Justice O'Connor voted 7 times with Justice Blackmun and 27 times with the Chief Justice. Justice Thomas voted 3 times with Justice Blackmun and 32 times with the Chief Justice.
Justice Souter's emergence during his fourth year on the Court as an anchor of the relatively liberal wing was one of the term's notable developments, although it was foreshadowed during the previous two terms.
While Justice Souter is in no way a liberal in the mold of Justice William J. Brennan Jr., whom he succeeded, his brand of moderate pragmatism and his willingness to engage Justice Scalia in direct intellectual combat is probably as responsible as any single factor for the failure of the conservative revolution that finally appeared on the verge of success with Justice Brennan's retirement.
Only one case this year could be counted as a significant victory for the conservative agenda: a 5-to-4 ruling that limited the ability of governments to place conditions on the use of private property.
The term's 84 cases marked a low point after several years of marked decline in the Court's argument docket. More cases than ever are reaching the Court -- more than 7,700 new appeals were filed this term, a record -- but the Justices are growing increasingly selective about the ones they hear.
In the early to mid-1980's, the Court commonly issued more than 140 decisions each term. The number this year was the fewest since the 82 decisions of the 1955-56 term. The Court actually heard 90 arguments this year, but six cases were dismissed after argument or decided without full opinions.
Following are summaries of the major rulings of the term.
 
Abortion
A Buffer Zone To Protect Clinics Is Upheld, 6-3
 The Justices did not revisit the question of the fundamental right to abortion, nor are they likely to in the foreseeable future. But cases spawned by the controversy over abortion continue to reach the Court; by a vote of 6 to 3, the Court upheld use of a 36-foot buffer zone, the core of an injunction a Florida state court issued to protect an abortion clinic against disruptive protest. Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion, Madsen v. Women's Health Center, No. 93-880, found the injunction consistent with the First Amendment; Justices Scalia, Thomas and Kennedy dissented.
In a second-clinic protest case, the Court was unanimous in ruling that abortion clinics can invoke the Federal racketeering law to sue violent anti-abortion protest groups for damages. In an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, the Court rejected a lower court's conclusion that the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) applies only to activity motivated by a desire for economic gain. (National Organization for Women v. Scheidler, No. 92-780.)
 
Criminal Law
Tough Tactics To Fight Drugs Are Viewed Skeptically
 In a term that was generally conservative on issues of criminal law, the Court nonetheless displayed some skepticism toward the aggressive tactics of state and Federal governments in combatting drugs.
The Court ruled, 5 to 4, that the Government may not seize a house or other real estate that it suspects of having been used in a drug transaction without giving the owner notice and a chance to contest the seizure at a hearing. This case, U.S. v. Good, No. 92-1180, involved a Federal forfeiture law; many states have similar laws. Justice Kennedy's majority opinion, based on the constitutional guarantee of due process of law, was joined by Justices Blackmun, Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg.
In a second 5-to-4 decision, with the same lineup of Justices, the Court ruled that states may not follow up a narcotics conviction by imposing a special tax on the illegal drugs. The majority opinion by Justice Stevens held that Montana's "dangerous drug tax," similar to laws in about half the states, violated the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy when applied to drugs that had already formed the basis of a criminal prosecution. (Montana v. Kurth Ranch, No. 93-144.)
In a death penalty case, the Court ruled that if the state seeks the death penalty on the ground that the defendant will be dangerous in the future, jurors must be told if the alternative to a death sentence is life without parole, meaning that the defendant would never in fact be released. The 7-to-2 decision, with a plurality opinion by Justice Blackmun, overturned a South Carolina death sentence reached under a state law that forbids informing the jury that a life sentence means life without parole. Justice Scalia and Thomas dissented in Simmons v. S.C., No. 92-9059. By an 8-to-1 vote, with Justice Blackmun dissenting, the Court turned back a constitutional challenge to California's death penalty law. (Tuileapa v. Calif., No. 93-5131.)
The Court ruled, 9 to 0, that prison officials can be found liable for failing to protect an inmate from violence at the hands of fellow prisoners if the officials knew of but ignored a "substantial risk of serious harm." The case, Farmer v. Brennan, No. 92-7242, involved the rape of a transsexual prisoner whom officials had placed in the general population at a Federal penitentiary. Justice Souter wrote the opinion for the Court. Justice Thomas concurred separately while reiterating his view that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment has no application to prison conditions.
Ruling, 5 to 4, the Court held that the police are not obliged to stop questioning a suspect who makes an ambiguous request to have a lawyer present. Justice O'Connor wrote the majority opinion, Davis v. U.S., No. 92-1949. The dissenters, Justices Souter, Blackmun, Stevens and Ginsburg, said the police had to stop long enough to clarify the suspect's wishes.
By a 5-to-4 vote, the Court ruled that Federal judges may grant a stay of execution to permit a state death row inmate to find lawyer to prepare a Federal court petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Justice Blackmun's opinion, McFarland v. Scott, No. 93-6497, was joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Kennedy.
 
Religion
Hasidic District Is at the Center Of Church-State Case
 In the term's only church-state case, the Court declared by a vote of 6 to 3 that a public school district created by New York State for the benefit of a village of Satmar Hasidim amounted to favoritism on behalf of religion and violated the neutrality required by the First Amendment's establishment clause. Justice Souter wrote for the Court; Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas and Chief Justice Rehnquist, dissented. (Board of Education of Kiryas Joel v. Grumet, No. 93-517.)
 
Individual Rights
Less Proof Is Required To Show Sexual Harassment In the Workplace
 The Court was unanimous in announcing a wide definition of sexual harassment in the workplace, rejecting the standard set by several lower courts that required plaintiffs to show that harassment had caused them "severe psychological injury."
Writing for the Court, Justice O'Connor said "no single factor is required" to prove to win a sexual harassment case under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the law at issue. Invoking what she called the "broad rule of workplace equality," Justice O'Connor said the law was violated when the work environment "would reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive." The case was Harris v. Forklift Systems, No. 92-1168.
The Court completed a revolution in jury selection by ruling that the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection bars the exclusion of potential jurors on the basis of their sex. In a 6-to-3 decision by Justice Blackmun, the Court extended to gender the analysis it had previously applied to prohibit the use of peremptory challenges to weed out jurors on the basis of race. The Chief Justice and Justices Scalia and Thomas dissented. The case was J.E.B. v. T.B., No. 92-1239. The Justices later declined to hear a case from Minnesota that posed the question of whether the same principle should also be extended to religion.
The Court ruled that the Civil Rights Act of 1991, in which Congress restored and expanded remedies for job discrimination in response to a series of restrictive Supreme Court rulings two years earlier, did not apply retroactively to the thousands of cases that were pending when the law was passed. The Court addressed different aspects of the law in a pair of 8-to-1 decisions, with Justice Stevens writing the majority opinions and Justice Blackmun dissenting. The cases were Landgraf v. USI Film Products, No. 92-757, and Rivers v. Roadway Express, No. 92-938.
In an important voting-rights case from Florida, the Court ruled that the Federal Voting Rights Act does not necessarily require creating the maximum number of legislative districts in which minority-group voters make up a majority. Justice Souter wrote an opinion for seven Justices while the other two, Justices Thomas and Scalia, said the Voting Rights Act does not apply to challenges to district lines. (Johnson v. DeGrandy, No. 92-519.)
By a 5-to-4 vote in a Georgia case, the Court ruled that the Voting Rights Act could not be used to challenge the size of a governmental body, in that case a single-member commission that runs rural Bleckley County. There was no majority rationale; separate opinions by Justice Kennedy, joined by the Chief Justice; Justice O'Connor; and Justice Thomas joined by Justice Scalia made up the majority. (Holder v. Hall, No. 91-2012.)
 
Government Authority
Developers Get A Break on The Environment
 In an important property-rights case, the Court set new limits on the ability of governments to require developers to set aside part of their land for environmental or other public uses. Under Chief Justice Rehnquist's 5-to-4 majority opinion, the Government has the burden of showing a "rough proportionality" between the required set-aside and the harm, such as flooding or increased traffic, to be caused by the new development.
The decision, Dolan v. City of Tigard, No. 93-518, was based on the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against a governmental "taking" of private property without compensation; Chief Justice Rehnquist said the takings clause should no longer be "relegated to the status of a poor relation" within the Bill of Rights. The dissenters were Justices Stevens, Blackmun, Ginsburg and Souter.
The Court ruled unanimously that the Government's choice of which military bases to close is not subject to challenge in Federal court. Elected officials from Pennsylvania and New Jersey had gone to court to try to stop the scheduled closing of the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the Court in Dalton v. Specter, No. 93-289.
By a vote of 9 to 0, the Court overturned a $52 million civil contempt fine a Virginia state court had issued against the mine workers' union in connection with a violent strike, ruling that such a fine could not be imposed without giving the union the procedural protections of a criminal trial. Justice Blackmun wrote the opinion, Mine Workers v. Bagwell, No. 92-1625.
 
Speech
Home Is Castle When It Comes To Posting Signs
 The Court ruled unanimously that cities may not bar residents from posting signs on their own property. The decision, City of Ladue v. Gilleo, No. 92-1856, struck down an ordinance that banned all but "for sale" and "sold" signs from the homes and lawns of a wealthy St. Louis suburb. Justice Stevens wrote for the Court.
In an important cable television case, a 5-to-4 majority endorsed a broad constitutional framework for Federal regulation of cable television while, at the same time, telling a lower court to reconsider its ruling that upheld a Federal law that requires cable systems to retransmit local broadcast signals. The Court will inevitably revisit the issue when the case, Turner v. Federal Communications Commission, No. 93-44, comes back after further proceedings. Justice Kennedy wrote for the Court while the dissenters -- Justices O'Connor, Scalia, Thomas and Ginsburg -- said the "must carry" law violates the cable operators' editorial freedom under the First Amendment.
In a high-profile copyright case, the Court ruled unanimously that parody -- in this case, the rap group 2 Live Crew's raunchy version of the rock classic "Oh Pretty Woman" -- is not necessarily copyright infringement but may be protected under the Federal copyright law as "fair use." Justice Souter wrote the opinion, Campbell v. Acuff-Rose, No. 92-1292.
 
The Environment
Steering the Flow Of Garbage Grows Complicated
 The Court decided an unusual number and variety of controversies over waste disposal and regulation. The most important ruling threatened an increasingly popular approach to waste disposal known as flow control, in which local governments try to make expensive recycling or incineration plants economical by insisting that all trash generated within their borders be sent to the designated facility.
The Constitution's protection against state interference with interstate commerce does not permit local governments to "hoard a local resource," the Court ruled in a 6-to-3 decision by Justice Kennedy. The Chief Justice and Justices Souter and Blackmun dissented in C. & A. Carbone v. Clarkstown, No. 92-1402.
The Court also rejected, as another protectionist offense against interstate commerce, Oregon's imposition of an extra dumping fee for solid waste brought in from another state. Justice Thomas wrote the 7-to-2 decision, Ore. Waste Systems v. Dept. of Environmental Quality, No. 93-70. The Chief Justice and Justice Blackmun dissented.
In another 7-to-2 ruling, the Court held that any toxic residue created by burning household and industrial waste in municipal incinerators must be treated as hazardous waste and not dumped in ordinary landfills. The decision, Chicago v. Environmental Defense Fund, No. 92-1639, interpreting a Federal environmental law, could substantially increase the costs of municipal waste disposal. Justice Scalia wrote the majority opinion and Justices Stevens and O'Connor dissented.
Upholding state authority in an environmental case, the Court ruled, 7 to 2, that states have broad authority under the Federal Clean Water Act to protect not only the quality of their water but also the quantity that flows through hydroelectric projects. Water must flow at certain levels to make it possible for salmon, trout and other fish to survive. Justice O'Connor wrote for the Court in Jefferson County v. Washington, No. 92-1911. Justices Thomas and Scalia dissented.
 
Business, Taxes
Juries That Grant Huge Damages Can Be Reined In
 In one of its clearest rulings on the contentious subject of punitive damages, the Court held that as a matter of constitutional due process, states must make some form of judicial review available as a check on the amount of punitive damages awarded by a jury. While only Oregon now fails to provide such review, the broad tone of the decision, Honda Motor Co. v. Obert, No. 93-644, is likely to invite more challenges to punitive damages. Justice Stevens wrote the majority opinion and Justice Ginsburg and Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented.
Sweeping aside years of lower court precedents, as well as Securities and Exchange Commission policy, the Court barred a common type of securities-fraud action under which accountants and other outside professionals could be sued for "aiding and abetting" a securities fraud. The 5-to-4 opinion, Central Bank v. First Interstate Bank, No. 92-854, was by Justice Kennedy.
The Court ruled, 9 to 0, that Congress did not violate the constitutional guarantee of due process when it amended a 1986 tax law retroactively to close an unintended loophole. Justice Blackmun wrote for the Court in U.S. v. Carlton, No. 92-1941.
The Court unanimously validated New York State's effort to curb tax evasion in the sale of cigarettes at stores located on Indian reservations, ruling that the coupon system New York plans to use to limit the availability of cigarettes to non-Indians does not conflict with Federal law. Justice Stevens wrote for the Court in New York v. Milhelm Attea, No. 93-377.
The Court upheld California's former approach to taxing the income of foreign-based multinational corporations. California has changed its law to conform to the rest of the country, but had the 7-to-2 decision in Barclays Bank v. Franchise Tax Board, No. 92-1384, gone the other way, California might have faced a $4 billion retroactive liability for refunds. Justice Ginsburg wrote for the Court and Justices O'Connor and Thomas dissented.

HEADLINE: The World;
Never Mind Yen. Greenbacks Are the New Gold Standard.

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
YOU want to know the oddest thing about the dollar story? Right at this moment when all the headlines are about the dollar crumbling against the yen, when traders in Tokyo are supposedly dumping American currency by the wheelbarrow, the dollar has never been more popular around the globe.
Always remember, the dollar is two things: It is a financial asset, the value of which floats against the currencies of other countries, going up or down at any given time. But the dollar has an additional life overseas. There, the greenback, that piece of crisp, folding paper with the picture of dead Presidents, is in demand not only as a financial asset for transactions, but also as a store of value -- like gold -- and as a trusty standard against which many developing nations are now pegging their own pesos, dinars or cruzeiros. 
 Yes, the dollar has been declining in value a little against the Japanese yen. For Americans who wanted to hail a cab in Tokyo or buy a Honda last week, that is bad news. But the dollar is actually holding steady or rising in value against most other currencies. That is why in the former Communist world and other developing countries, the dollar is viewed today as more solid than ever. Not only are more and more countries tying their currencies to the dollar, but in some of them the greenback is also becoming the day-to-day medium of exchange.
This phenomenon is now so widespread the Federal Reserve estimates that 60 percent of all of the dollar bills printed this year, compared with about 40 percent 20 years ago, will end up going overseas via American banks -- for use in Russia, Romania, Tajikistan, China, Vietnam and other countries where the dollar has become the official unofficial tender.
Whether these foreigners are stashing $100 bills in their mattresses to keep them for a rainy day, hiding twenties under their floorboards for insurance against local hyperinflation or swapping briefcases with stacks of fives for illegal drug deals, most of the world can't get enough dollar bills these days. The Federal Reserve estimates that about $190 billion in American bills are now circulating overseas, and that pile is rising at a rate of about $15 billion to $20 billion a year -- not counting counterfeit notes.
Behind this phenomenon are two economic trends that coincided in the last decade: global inflation and American disinflation. Since the mid-1980's inflation in this country has been under tight control; the dollar as a store of value against a basket of other major world currencies has been quite stable. At the same time, since the late 1980's, much of the former Communist world has disintegrated, and the developing world has increasingly opted for capitalism.
 
A Symbol of Stability
 But many of these economies, particularly in Eastern Europe, Latin America and the former Soviet Union, do not have their monetary affairs under control and have suffered hyperinflation as their governments have printed money to solve every problem. It's likely more countries have been gripped by hyperinflation in the last decade than during the rest of the century. This is one of the unexpected diseases of the new world order and explains why so many people prefer to store their wealth, or peg their exchange rates, in dollars or in a few other "hard" currencies instead of their local paper money.
Lithuania, like Argentina and Brazil, has formally pegged its currency to the dollar. Many others have done so informally. Estonia has fixed its currency to the German mark. It is not hard to understand why. In 1990 Argentina suffered from currency inflation of 2,300 percent a year. Its money supply was out of control. Three years ago, the government of President Carlos Menem decided to fix the Argentine peso, by law, at parity with the dollar. That forced the Argentine central bank to control its money supply to maintain that parity. The move brought inflation down to 3.4 percent in May, the lowest level in 41 years. For the first time in a generation Argentina has seen a return of coin-vending machines, because coins now hold the same value for more than a few weeks.
Brazil's inflation-weary population has long been paying cab fares with checks. They've tried six different currencies in the past decade. Last week, they began issuing yet another new currency, the real, but this time pegging it to the dollar on a one-to-one basis.
"This would not have happened in 1978-79, when we had high inflation at a rapid deterioration in the dollar," said William Poole, a professor of economics at Brown University. "But over the last decade, with inflation under control, people have become increasingly confident about using and holding dollars. It is still the only currency in the world that is acceptable everywhere."
Today so many foreign countries, Mr. Poole said, "have a tremendous need for a stable currency, and we are providing them with a benefit that they cannot get any other way."
Indeed there is no gold standard anymore -- that officially went out the window in 1971 -- but there is a dollar standard. And if some countries are pegging their currencies to the dollar, then what is the dollar pegged to? Answer: Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. America, and the world, are now on the Greenspan standard.
"The dollar is pegged to the political consensus of the American electorate," said H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company investment bank in New York City. "Basically, the Administration and Congress together define the national consensus on economic strategy, and the Federal Reserve chairman, even though he is independent, operates within that consensus. That consensus has been, and hopefully will be, for low inflation."
While this has costs for the United States, in the area of job growth and interest rates, it also has benefits. The United States has an advantage few other countries enjoy: It prints green paper with George Washington's and Ben Franklin's and Thomas Jefferson's pictures on it. These pieces of green paper are called "dollars." Americans give this green paper to people around the world, and they give Americans in return automobiles, pasta, stereos, taxi rides, hotel rooms and all sorts of other goods and services. As long as these foreigners can be induced to hold those dollars, either in their mattresses, their banks or in their own circulation, Americans have exchanged green paper for hard goods.
"As long as we maintain low inflation and currency stability, those dollars will circulate abroad forever," said Mr. Poole. "It's a very good deal."

Women Doing Crime, Women Doing Time

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
WOMEN wearing judges' robes or corporate pinstripes have become everyday images of society's changing gender roles. But what about women attired in Day-Glo prison jumpsuits?
The number of women in state and Federal prisons increased from 12,331 to 43,845 from 1980 to 1990, according to the Justice Department. That is an increase of 256 percent, compared with a 140 percent rise in the male prison population. 
 Arrests of women for serious felonies climbed 32.5 percent from 1988 to 1992, reaching 62,936 nationwide, according to a Justice Department canvass of more than 8,000 police agencies. The 1992 arrest figure is still small compared with the 452,453 men arrested for violent crimes that year.
The 8,000 law-enforcement agencies which responded to the canvass cover some 185 million Americans. While it does not list all people arrested in the United States, it is considered an accurate indicator of the types of crime being committed.
The fact that the rate of arrests for women under the age of 18 increased in those four years by 63 percent, compared with 45.4 percent for male youths, has attracted growing attention from law enforcement experts.
The swelling number of women being arrested and incarcerated raises questions about whether women are becoming more aggressive -- in other words, more like those men who get caught up in lives of violence.
For now, a wide array of criminologists have concluded that as long as organized crime, neighborhood gangs and narcotics networks remain bastions of male domination, the answer is no, or at least not yet.
Many criminal justice scholars attribute the rise in the female crime rates more to the growing poverty among young, unattached mothers and the new ways society treats women than to the wider opportunities they have. More men are abandoning their families, leaving women with the burdens of children, and with the temptations to commit crimes to care for them.
Meanwhile, many studies find that the justice system, after decades of imposing lighter sentences, is more likely to treat wayward women harshly, be they first-time drug offenders or women who fight physically with husbands or boyfriends, even if they say the men hit them first.
"Simply put, it appears that the criminal justice system now seems more willing to incarcerate women," Meda Chesney-Lind, a University of Hawaii criminology professor, writes in a book awaiting publication.
Female criminals remain different from male wrongdoers in many respects. The percentage of women in prison for drug and property crimes is considerably higher than for male inmates. A recent study in Massachusetts, for instance, found that only 22 percent of the women imprisoned there were incarcerated for violent offenses, compared with 48 percent of the men behind bars.
Nationwide, almost two-thirds of the women in prison for violent crimes had been found guilty of assaulting or killing relatives or intimates, the Justice Department said. By contrast, violent males in prison were more than twice as likely to have assaulted or killed strangers. (But that ratio may change if the new attention being paid to spousal abuse results in more assault convictions for abusive husbands.)
Still, some argue that crimes committed by women, although far smaller in number, may nonetheless be more serious for society at large than the statistics reflect since rising rates of illegitimacy and divorce have made women even more responsible for future generations -- thanks in no small measure to the irresponsibility of some men.
"Girls become mothers, and mothers influence the behaviors of their offspring," Joan McCord, a professor of criminology at Temple University, argued in an article published last year, "so that the net effects of antisocial behaviors may be greater for females than for males." A Justice Department study completed in March found that two-thirds of the women in prison have at least one child under the age of 18.
Early criminologists assumed that violence and criminal behavior were essentially masculine traits, and that the few women who did commit acts of violence suffered some sort of biological abnormality.
Caesar Lombroso, a 19th-century Italian physician, carted home bags of women's bones from the prisons of Turin to look for anatomical distinctions between criminal and noncriminal women. Lombroso's conclusion that abnormal cranium size and excessive body hair were the telltale signs of female criminal behavior were cast aside by the early 20th century.
 
Depicted as Deviants
 But the depiction of female criminals as sexual deviants persisted through the first half of the century, until most scholars concluded that criminal behavior was mostly determined by social and economic factors.
No longer was criminality a matter of testosterone. In the widely discussed book "Sisters In Crime: The Rise of the New Female Criminal" (McGraw, 1975), the criminologist Freda Adler foresaw a "rising tide of female assertiveness" that would lead tens of thousands of women to step "across the imaginary boundary line which once separated crimes into 'masculine' and 'feminine' categories."
At first glance, the increases in arrest rates of women for vehicle theft, arson, robbery and aggravated assault confirm the conclusions of the first generation of female criminologists. Just as surely as women were capable of running corporate boardrooms, they said, women who commit crimes would branch out from "traditional" offenses like prostitution and shoplifting.
If examples of this growing "diversity" are isolated, they are also chilling. Last September, a 20-year-old professional thief named Patsy Jones stung the Miami tourist industry after she was accused of fatally shooting a German tourist along the Dolphin Expressway with a sawed-off hunting rifle.
In Brooklyn recently, a teen-ager shot and killed a livery cab driver in broad daylight after he resisted her and two girlfriends during a botched robbery attempt.
But the link between changing gender models and the number of women in prison remains dubious. Female criminologists increasingly reject predictions that a female crime wave is imminent. They note that female participation in the ultimate violent crime -- murder -- remains extremely low.
The New York City police report that while women were accused of committing a third more felonies in 1993 than in 1975, 59 women were arrested for murder last year in the city compared with 120 women in 1975.
And while the growing number of women who work helps to explain why they are committing more forgery and embezzlement, the great majority of women in prison are poor and unemployed and not models of newly empowered, liberated women. "It's really difficult to discern whether women who commit crimes are any more liberated or have different gender-role attitudes than women who don't commit crimes," said Candace Kruttschnitt, a professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota.
"This is a murky area," she added.

HEADLINE: Economic Pulse: Indian Country;
Economies Come to Life On Indian Reservations

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PRIOR LAKE, Minn.

 BODY:
On this rolling expanse of tall-grass prairie, where many Shakopee Mdewekantan once eked out a living by stripping copper and selling cigarettes, or scraped along on welfare, tribal elders would remind children growing up in rickety trailers that life had not always been so stingy. The elders spoke of a time when great herds of buffalo thundered on the plains with a promise of abundance for American Indians.
Today, the thunder has returned. It is the unceasing sound of coins being poured into slot machines at the tribe's Mystic Lake casino. The gambling hall took in millions of dollars last year, enough to pay each of the tribe's 200 members more than $400,000. And this year's payments are expected to exceed $500,000 each. 
 A subdivision of new homes, not ostentatious but certainly comfortable, has risen on the reservation.
And while nothing compares to gambling, Indians are beginning to find signs of prosperity in other areas as well -- high-technology mining ventures, the tradition of herding bison, the surging growth of tribal colleges.
The leaders in Indian Country today -- from the bleached desert rock of the Navajo, to the windswept High Plains of the Sioux, to the Rocky Mountain foothills of the Southern Utes, to the Pacific fishing waters of the Quinalt -- say they see more cause for optimism now than at any other time in generations, perhaps even since whites arrived.
But the driving force behind these new hopes lies with gambling, what some have called "the new buffalo economy."
About 90 tribes have opened casinos, and dozens more are rushing to start gambling halls. While few tribes have realized the astonishing success of the Mdewekantan (meh-day-WALK-a-tan), gambling profits on all reservations exceeded $1 billion last year. That windfall is financing new schools, housing, roads and hospitals and providing a pool of start-up capital to diversify economies that have long been reliant on the Federal Government.
Mary Jo Gustafson, a 25-year-old Mdewekantan who grew up in a rough-at-the-edges neighborhood in St. Paul and moved to a small house here a decade ago, now spends her days playing with her three young children in a big, fenced yard in the shade of oak and apple trees.
"I know a lot of non-Indians are angry and resentful about this," she said, sounding almost apologetic. "They see Indians getting this big break. But you know, there have been a lot of other breaks that have gone the other way for Indians."
 
Signs of Hope Amid Despair
 Perhaps one-third of the nation's two million Indians still live in poverty, and the percentage is higher on reservations, where about one million live. In a sign of the despair, the rates of alcoholism and suicide among Indians still outpace the national averages. But new signs of hope are plentiful.
A burst of entrepreneurship on reservations in recent years has created jobs in manufacturing and retail businesses.
A new trade group, the Indian Business Association, now represents 5,000 Indian companies. Indian tourism has been booming, from the elegant Inn of the Mountain Gods resort at the Mescalero Apache reservation to guided nature and hunting tours on the Lower Brule lands in South Dakota.
Tribally run colleges, which have grown from a single two-year school in 1968 to some 26 colleges today, some with four-year degrees and graduate programs, are producing health workers, tribal government specialists and teachers in places like Rosebud in South Dakota, where most Sioux have grown up never seeing an Indian teacher.
In a first for any tribe, the Southern Utes in Colorado have recently bought a gas-drilling company, a far more lucrative and autonomous venture than simply leasing the land to non-Indian businesses, which has always been the arrangement on Indian lands. And the Navajos of the Southwest, stewards of the largest reservation, 26,000 square miles, the size of West Virginia, have organized an oil company that plans to start drilling in two years.
"There has emerged a consensus in Indian Country that if we're going to see economic growth, we're going to have to do it ourselves," said Wilma Mankiller, the principal chief of the Cherokee Nation. "Tribes have come to the realization that Federal resources are going to continue to decline, no matter who is in the White House."
After more than a century of Federal policies that ranged from extermination to assimilation, Indian nations have lately gained a greater degree of self-determination, symbolized by President Clinton's unprecedented meeting with 542 tribal leaders in April, and spelled out in the Supreme Court ruling in 1987 that liberated tribes, as sovereign nations, from most state gambling regulations.
And in what might reflect the sense of cultural and economic renewal on the Indian lands, the longtime migratory trend away from reservations to urban centers has slowed to a trickle.
"In some cases, we might even be seeing a movement back to reservations," said Matthew Snipp, a rural sociologist who heads the American Indian studies program at the University of Wisconsin. "The reservations are no longer quite the desperately poor places they were in the 50's. That doesn't mean they aren't poor. But today, at least, there are some jobs. There is now some incentive to stay home."
 
The Businesses
From Old Ideas, New Chances

The Choctaw in Mississippi assemble wire devices for automobiles. The Turtle Mountain Chippewa in North Dakota build house trailers. The Cherokee in Oklahoma produce parts for military contractors.
For the Indian people, long accustomed to scratching out a living from scant resources, survival has always depended on new ideas. And today, scores of ideas are being translated into economic opportunities, some of them grand and some of them modest, but all of them making a difference.
Evan Chasing Hawk, a homeless Sioux in his 20's, drifted from one home to the next on the Cheyenne River reservation in South Dakota, dependent on the kindness of friends for temporary shelter and a little to eat.
But Mr. Chasing Hawk can now depend on himself and his talents. He is making a living painting the skulls of bisons.
 
Going Back to the Buffalo
 The opportunity for Mr. Chasing Hawk came through the entrepreneurship of a tribal leader, Fred Dubray, who looked back into Sioux history in search of answers for the future.
"A lot of things have failed out here in Indian Country," Mr. Dubray said. "So we started to think back to the days when we were self-sufficient, back to the days of the buffalo."
Mr. Dubray founded Tote Hca Ka -- The Whole Buffalo -- a growing company that raises bison on the vast scrubgrass of the reservation. The business's Sioux name refers to the traditional Indian belief that no part of the animal should be wasted.
Besides the meat, the company is using the hides for clothing, the bones for utensils, the sinew for thread and the skulls for jewelry. The jewelry will be sold in a gift shop on the reservation.
To capitalize on the growing commercial demand for bison, whose meat is lower in fat and cholesterol than beef, some 28 tribes have started businesses to restore the hulking beasts to the Great Plains.
Bison meat sometimes fetches about double the price of beef, and bison calves often bring triple the price of beef calves at fall auctions. And there are related bison profits: the Lakota Sioux run a concession on the Badlands National Park selling buffalo burgers, and the Lower Brule tribe sells guided tours of the herds.
Like many tribes, the Sioux on the Cheyenne River reservation had kept a small herd of bison for generations, for symbolic and spiritual purposes. Since Mr. Dubray started the business, obtaining some of his bison from the surplus at national parks, the herd has grown in five years to more than 1,000 from 85.
For tribes with vast lands of native wheat and blue grama grasses, the bison fit perfectly on the plains, as they had for centuries before being driven to near-extinction in the late 1800's, devastating the Indian economy.
As the business grows, the Cheyenne River tribe is considering the purchase of a mobile slaughter plant, so that the bison can be killed in the fields, a much more efficient method than rounding up the animals and trucking them to distant cities.
The tribe is counting on profits from a planned casino to finance the mobile plant. Obtaining financing from a bank for new enterprises on reservations has never been easy. Indeed, one South Dakota bank was recently fined by Federal regulators for refusing to do business with Indians.
"We've got a lot of entrepreneurs out here," Mr. Dubray said. "But nobody wants to finance an Indian idea."
 
The Most Lucrative Business
 Before gambling, perhaps the most lucrative business in Indian lands was artwork. Fueled largely by the popularity of Southwestern design, Indian art has become a $500 million-a-year industry, from the $15,000 black pots designed by Margaret Tafoya, a Santa Fe artist, to the $8 bracelets made by people living in adobe huts.
In recent years, Indians have made inroads in publishing and broadcasting. There are now more than a dozen Indian-run radio stations, and a successful newspaper, Indian Country Today.
When Tim Giago, a Sioux journalist, decided to start the newspaper on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota 14 years ago, he got a $4,000 loan from a Nebraska bank, using a friend's antique car as collateral.
"The banker was a car buff," Mr. Giago said. "And he couldn't wait to get his hands on that old Chevy coupe."
But the banker never got the car. Now the newspaper, Indian Country Today, has grown successful enough to open a Southwest edition, with the first issue scheduled to roll off the presses in Arizona next month.
Indeed, the newspaper, with a circulation of 20,000 and advertising revenues of more than $1 million a year, is well on its way to becoming the first national Indian newspaper, with regional editions also planned for Oklahoma and the Great Lakes region in the next few years.
It employs 30 full-time employees, almost all of them Indians, including many who had been on welfare.
As it grows, Indian Country Today faces one serious problem: the shortage of Indian journalists.
"We've just about outgrown our supply," said Mr. Giago, who frequently gives speeches to audiences of young Indians in hopes of inspiring some to enter the news trade.
 
The Resources
From Leasers To Operators
 The remote and often forbidding lands of Indian Country have held some of the nation's richest resources. And the jobs in coal mining and oil drilling are usually the best-paying jobs on the reservation -- $15 an hour and more.
But the tribes have usually gotten only a sliver of the profits on the resources, since they have invariably leased the land to big energy companies to drill for oil and gas, or mine for coal.
The Southern Utes in Colorado, for example, allowed the corporations to dig and drill on the land, in exchange for a leasing fee of $1.25 an acre and a 16 percent royalty on the gross revenue.
The leases and royalties have provided about $6 million a year, the bulk of the tribe's income. But tribal leaders knew that they could earn many times that sum, if they were the operators themselves.
 
Forming Their Own Company
 Two years ago, using revenue from gambling, the Utes purchased some gas fields, and started their own drilling company, Red Willow. It was the first time any tribe had tried such a venture with natural gas.
"This has always been a dream of ours," said Leonard Burch, the tribal chairman. "We're just getting started, so it's modest now, but it's turning a profit."
For now, much of the drilling is still done by outside subcontractors. But since the Utes own the company, the control of operations -- and the profits -- stay with the tribe.
About half of the 30 workers are Utes, from office jobs to field workers. "Someday," Mr. Burch said, "we hope to fill all the jobs with tribal members."
Some tribes rich with resources, however, refuse to allow digging or drilling, viewing it as a sacrilege to harm the earth. In other cases, tribes that depend on logging, or those seeking to employ water rights, have met with resistance from environmental groups.
The Navajo nation has the biggest reserves of coal of any tribe. Leases and royalties, set at 12.5 percent, netted the tribe about $80 million last year, its biggest income-producer. Some 5,000 Navajos work for energy companies on the reservation, said to Duane Beyal, a spokesman for the tribe.
 
Moving Into Management
 In recent years, a growing number of Navajos have risen to the ranks of management.
Lawrence Lano, 46, grew up in a 12-by-12 foot shack with a dirt floor in a home where the Navajo language, Dine, was spoken. As a child, he was inspired by the accounts of Navajo heroism in the military and joined the Marines. He later used his military benefits to pay for schooling, and graduated from Northern Arizona University with a bachelor of science degree.
Today he works for the Pittsburgh and Midway Company, a subsidiary of Chevron, as an engineer. He earns $45,000 a year and still lives in the reservation town of Ganado, where he grew up. But he now lives now in a double-wide trailer, and plans to build a house soon.
 
The Gambling
Preparing for End To the Boom
 While casino profits have improved conditions on scores of reservations, it is uncertain whether gambling will turn out to be an economic savior.
The Mille Lacs tribe in Minnesota has built a water tower, paved roads and opened the first public school on the reservation. The Oneida tribe in Wisconsin has built an alcohol treatment center, bought a farm and built a sewer system. The Sycuan band of Mission Indians in California has constructed new houses for each tribal member, replacing dilapidated shacks, and opened new police and fire departments.
"Gaming is the one thing that's worked in 200 years of Federal Indian policy," said Tim Wapato, the executive director of the National Indian Gaming Association, a trade group for tribes running casinos. "Yes, in some cases, Indians have gotten rich. But what's wrong with that? Look at how much money Donald Trump has made on casinos. Nobody seems to mind that."
Virtually all of the casinos are being managed by white-owned businesses, which are paid a percentage of the profits. And in some cases, criticism has arisen from Indians over garish casinos that trivialize and cheapen the heritage. The Mashantucket-Pequot of Connecticut, for example, who run the biggest of the Indian casinos, have come under attack for dressing cocktail waitresses in skimpy skirts and festooning them with feathers in a manner that seems almost lampoonish.
And some tribal leaders have voiced concern that the casinos might attract Indian gamblers.
But such complaints have been in the minority. In general, Indian gambling halls casinos are far more low-key than any casinos blazing in neon on the Las Vegas Strip. Few of them, in fact, serve liquor.
The most pressing concern for tribes is how long the bonanza can last. The tribes are finding new competitors entering the gambling market, which presumably cannot grow forever. When Indian casinos started seven years ago, only two states allowed big-scale gambling: Nevada and New Jersey. Today some 20 states permit casinos.
The Omaha tribe in Nebraska for example, has prospered on gamblers coming mostly from metropolitan Omaha 120 miles to the south, but it was dealt a potentially devastating blow recently when Iowa approved casino gambling in Council Bluffs, right next door to the city of Omaha.
 
The Traditional Ways
White Standard For Poverty
 The rough dirt path to the Navajo sheep camp meanders between ancient dunes and slabs of sandstone rising in huge, shattered plates. A few rare trees, planted next to a hogan, or "cha ha'oh" -- a summer shade house made of branches -- stick up from an ocean of low greasewood. In some places, the skin of the earth has been peeled away by scouring sandstorms and washed clean by pummeling summer rain.
This is some of the rawest land on the Navajo reservation, a place where water must be hauled in barrels by pick-up from Tuba City, some 40 miles away, and where two elderly women, Dorothy Reed and Jeanette Lewis, survive by raising sheep and cows.
By most measures, American Indians are the poorest ethnic group in the country. On some reservations, unemployment exceeds 80 percent. Of the 10 poorest United States counties in the last census, four were Indian lands in South Dakota. On the Navajo lands, unemployment ranges from 30 percent to 40 percent, and shacks are more common than houses.
Income among Indians has not grown for the past decade. Some experts say those figures mask real progress, however, since a baby boom among Indians in the last generation has sharply increased the number of young people. Nearly 20 percent of Indians are younger than 10, twice the national rate.
To be sure, welfare payments account for a great share of the money on some reservations. And yet, tribal leaders say, there are two faces of poverty in Indian Country.
Rates of Indian suicide and alcoholism far exceed the national averages. Some reservations now have street gangs, a new phenomenon. And domestic violence continues to be a serious problem.
And yet, many Indian people are poor, but hardly broken. "It's important not to impose the non-Indian values of poverty on Indians," said David Lester of the Council of Energy Resource Tribes. "There are worse things than being poor. Don't get me wrong -- nobody likes suffering. But money is just not the measure of success."
Many of them value the traditional ways more than modern contrivances, and no Federal program could persuade them to follow a new way, even if it seemed easier.
"In the beginning, the earth was made for us by Changing Woman," said Mrs. Reed, referring to a Navajo deity. "My grandfather used to tell me that you were supposed to make a living from the earth and the sheep."
This is part of the Indian Country economy largely missing from Government charts and graphs on employment and production: traditional Navajos who raise their own food, or wait by the roadside to sell herbs they have picked from the hills or wood they have gathered or rugs they have woven by hand.
Many of them barter goods and services: a coat in exchange for a car battery, baby-sitting in exchange for repair work.
Some have never seen the inside of a bank. In some areas, the Indian economy has stagnated because banks are unwilling to count reservation homes as collateral, since the land is held in a trust. They will, however, lend money for trailers, since they can be repossessed and hauled away.
When Navajos run low on money, they sometimes drive or hitchhike to the pawnshops in the dusty town of Gallup, N.M., where they plop saddles and blankets and pieces of jewelry on the counter as collateral for high-interest loans. Often they are later unable to come up with the cash required to retrieve their belongings, which are then declared "dead pawn," and sold, frequently to prosperous tourists stopping off Interstate 40 in search of an Indian souvenir.
The Navajo women had been up since dawn, in a one-room house with bare sheetrock walls, with the front facing, to greet the sunrise, as tradition decrees it. There was fry bread for breakfast. Both wore the traditional attire for elderly Navajo women: velveteen blouse closed at the neck with a turquoise clasps, long tiered satin dresses, socks and inexpensive running shoes known by the young ones as "sani sneakers" -- grandma sneakers.
On this morning, some of their children and grandchildren had arrived to help round up some stray cows. As in many Navajo families, their children had become educated and moved to town, living in houses with plumbing and electricity. But they come back often, and help out with some money when they can.
Mrs. Reed's son, Willie, won a scholarship to attend an Eastern prep school, and then earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Stanford University. With his education, he could have landed a high-paying job and taken a home in the city, with air-conditioning and cable television and home-delivered pizza. Instead, he returned to a tiny house on the reservation, and now teaches science at a Navajo high school.

HEADLINE: Glitter of New York Beckons (Or Is It Tarnish Elsewhere?)

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
A city's image ebbs and flows with many tides. Prices rise, crime drops, perceptions follow. But precise turning points may slip past, slow to register on such popular barometers as housing prices and dinner-party talk.
The image of New York, of course, is never simple; it has always encompassed fantastic extremes of good and bad. But in recent decades, the bad has often eclipsed the good in the views of outsiders (and more than a few insiders, too). 
 Now some New Yorkers, at least, think the tide may be turning, and some even think this may be tied to the fortunes of other big cities turning sour. They see small signs in odd places: in what law students confide to law-firm recruiters, what executives tell headhunters, and what other Americans tell pollsters about the cities they fear most.
Some of the most striking evidence is coming from Columbia University and New York University: undergraduate applications have shot up, and admissions officers believe that one reason is that more students want to be in New York.
They are so sure of that point that they have overhauled their recruiting materials to try to capitalize on the city as a selling point. After years trying to ignore or explain away New York, they are now big boosters.
At Columbia, the admissions office dumped its old black-and-white booklets in favor of a glossy, 52-page, full-color magazine that opens with an expansive, aerial view of midtown Manhattan at night and follows that with photographs of bagels baking, the Stock Exchange floor, jazz musicians, a perpetually sunny New York.
New York University now sends out a homemade videotape about Greenwich Village, in which the university's voluble president, L. Jay Oliva, perambulates the neighborhood like a zealous tour guide, extolling its manifold virtues and chatting up local notables like Charles Kuralt.
Each school can also produce a list of professors and administrators it recently lured, or kept, from competing institutions elsewhere. Many say New York was a big draw; some say the city appealed to them in ways it had not 10 years before.
An image improvement, even if only among the likes of students and academics, would not be an insignificant event for New York, especially now that the region's economy depends increasingly upon highly trained professionals and less and less on its shrinking manufacturing base.
But if people are, in fact, seeing New York in a better light, the reasons may have less to do with the city than with perceived problems elsewhere. If New York's image is recovering some luster, one big reason appears to be that other cities and towns are losing theirs.
In the words of Dr. Herbert Pardes, Columbia's vice president for health sciences, who recently turned down a job at the University of California, Los Angeles, "You don't have the feeling that pain and drugs are the exclusive province of New York."
Much of the evidence is, of course, wildly unscientific.
Maria Alkiewicz, director of legal personnel for Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm, watched job applicants grow fearful for New York's future after the 1987 stock market crash. Now, she said, she has seen Seattle and California slipping down the list of favored places for young lawyers to settle.
 
Executive Interest
 John P. Bassler, who runs offices in the New York region for Korn/Ferry International, the executive-search firm, finds more and more people interested in returning to New York City -- a tendency he attributes to the possibility that other cities look in many ways increasingly like New York.
Even a Gallup Poll last September suggested marginal improvement (though not exactly the makings of a new advertising jingle): just 76 percent of people polled think of New York as unsafe, down from 85 percent in 1990. Miami had overtaken New York, according to the poll, and Los Angeles was closing in.
Some of the conclusions being drawn amuse Californians.
Robert Weisberg, Stanford University's vice provost for faculty recruitment and development, insisted that professors rarely pick their employers by geographic location, except to make sure that they can afford housing and that there is work nearby for their spouses, who are often in academia too.
"To say, as a general matter, that people would strongly prefer to live and work in New York City is crazy," said Professor Weisberg, a Bronx native who left the city at age 20 and who admits to being afflicted with a "typical, complicated, love-hate relationship" with New York.
 
'A Refined Taste'
 David O. Sears, a psychology professor and former dean at the University of California, Los Angeles, conceded that the spread of urban problems "levels the playing field a little bit among the big cities." But he insisted "big-city, urban life is a fairly refined taste for academics."
The idea that New York might have become a selling point came to Columbia several years ago from Jan Krukowski, a consultant hired by the university to figure out how to attract more applicants. Mr. Krukowski surveyed 800 possible applicants and found that the city was a powerful attraction.
So Columbia made its recruiting materials "much more sexy in their portrayal of New York," said Drusilla Blackman, dean of undergraduate admissions and financial aid. She feels that decision helps explain this year's 16 percent increase in applications, the largest ever.
Dean Blackman and others said there has been a surge of interest in big-city colleges in general. But she said the increase at Columbia was larger than that experienced by other urban schools.
New York University has seen a similar leap -- from 10,837 applications in 1992 to 14,463 in 1994. Administrators credit improvements in faculty and facilities, as well as a change in the way New York is viewed. "We are convinced at this point that the city is really helping us," said David Finney, associate vice president for enrollment services.
 
Columbia Reaching Far
 It is not known at whose expense the increase comes. But the percentage of New York University students from outside the New York metropolitan area is rising. Columbia has begun recruiting more aggressively in the Southwest, Southeast and Midwest. Meanwhile, out-of-state freshman applications to the University of California system have dropped by almost 50 percent since 1989, reflecting steep increases in fees and perhaps concerns about the state in the wake of recent earthquakes, riots and economic troubles.
Why New York might seem more attractive is not entirely clear. Mr. Finney believes one reason is specific to students in hard economic times: with its innumerable opportunities for internships and other off-campus jobs, students see New York as a place to make contacts and get a jump on careers.
Others believe city life is improving. The economy is growing, slightly, after years of recession; the crime rate and real estate prices are down. Many symbols are offered: air conditioning on the subway trains, improved snow removal, less graffiti, the disappearance of suitcase radios.
But mostly, people point to the shortcomings of other places. They say leaving New York is no longer an escape from crime, drugs, troubled schools, traffic. New York now shares those problems with many places, they say, but it still offers opportunities available nowhere else.
Dean Blackman of Columbia left the city in 1987, feeling it was becoming unlivable. It seemed unsafe and in a state of collapse. "Our feeling at the time was that we were going for good," said Dean Blackman, who took a job at Harvard University. "Our plan was to eventually downsize to a small town."
 
Liked the Intensity
 But she and her husband found Boston parochial and Bostonians hostile to outsiders. Over time, they began to plot their return. "We discovered that we were addicted to the level of services, activity, intensity and resources that New York provides and that we would not be happy with anything less."
After six years, they came back. She insists New York feels safer and seems to be addressing much of what had driven her out. "Leaving New York didn't mean you left those problems behind," she said. New York has drawbacks, but it also has "more positives than the average city."
Larry Kramer, a New York University law professor, first lived in New York in the early 1980's. He remembers it as decaying, its parks unkempt, its subway system subhuman. He moved to Chicago, then Ann Arbor, Mich. When he took a sabbatical semester in 1992, he looked for a place where he would never want to live again: "New York, for sure."
To his surprise, the city struck him as cleaner and more livable than before. He began to appreciate its virtues -- and feel the limitations of the other places. So, earlier this year, he left the University of Michigan and turned down a job at the University of Chicago to move permanently to New York.
"To some extent, it was my own development," Professor Kramer said. "But I found there were real differences in the city. I feel confident saying it's a better place now than when I left here in 1985."

HEADLINE: Homeless In a Land Of Affluence

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOHEGAN LAKE, N.Y.

 BODY:
For seven years, Maria Gonzalez and her three children have lived out of a suitcase, wandering from motels to welfare hotels to temporary apartments and now to a ramshackle bungalow colony -- all at public expense.
Ms. Gonzalez is homeless in Westchester, and odysseys like hers are almost the rule for homeless families in this wealthy county. 
 Homeless families in Westchester spend an average of three years and one month in shelters and other temporary housing before finding permanent apartments, according to statistics compiled by the county. That is five times longer than in New York City and more than 10 times longer than in other suburban counties, including Nassau and Rockland. It is also expensive, costing taxpayers $115,000 to provide one family with temporary shelter for three years: enough, advocates say, to buy a condominium or cooperative apartment.
 
'More Politically Palatable to Pay'
 But despite the cost -- there are currently 870 homeless families in Westchester -- little effort has been made to change the system. The alternative, building affordable housing in Westchester's more affluent communities, has been continually rejected by the people who live there.
"It's more politically palatable to pay than to find a place for people," said Thomas J. Abinanti, a Democrat who represents the town of Greenburgh in the County Legislature, which has no bills dealing with the homeless under consideration.
"The legislature," he said, "is reflecting the fears of the community."
Westchester has a higher percentage of homeless people per capita than any other county in the state, including the five boroughs of New York City. The problem, officials say, is rooted in the county's expensive housing market. With an average rent of $972 a month for a two-bedroom apartment, even moderate-income families find it difficult to live in Westchester. For a family of four, which receives $393 a month in rental assistance from the state welfare program, permanent apartments are virtually unattainable.
The only real way out of temporary housing, advocates say, is the Federal Section 8 housing program, which provides families with rental vouchers to bridge the gap between the state public-assistance allowance and market-rate rents. But with demand so heavy, the wait in Westchester for Section 8 vouchers is four years or more.
The county's Commissioner of Social Services, Mary Glass, said the plight of homeless families and individuals was her department's "single most important issue," on which $47.7 million will be spent this year. (Under a state formula, the county and the state each provide 25 percent of the money spent on families, and the Federal Government allocates 50 percent.)
But the County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke, said the search for permanent solutions, in the form of county-built housing, has been limited by the perception that public housing projects were rife with "guns, drugs and violence." Residents of Harrison, Ossining and Peekskill have recently fought off proposals to build such apartments.
 
Without a Will, No Way
 In the last four years, the county estimates, 828 affordable housing units have been built in Westchester, a small number, considering that an estimated 14,000 Westchester residents are believed to live in overcrowded conditions and that 3,646 are homeless.
"I think we've done a good job for what we have available," said Mr. O'Rourke, a Republican. "If our friends on the state and Federal level would become engaged in the process, as they used to be years ago, we could wipe this problem out in a few years."
Andrew Cuomo, an assistant secretary at the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington, said Westchester had ample resources to solve the problem, considering the tens of millions of dollars it has spent on temporary shelter. But he said he saw little political will to build affordable housing.
"Eventually, the decision would come down to the siting of a homeless facility, and wherever it is sited is in someone's backyard," said Mr. Cuomo, the founder of Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged, which provides interim housing to the homeless in New York.
To many advocates, including Jerry Levy, a lawyer with Westchester-Putnam Legal Services, the problem is "exclusion and racism." Because an overwhelming majority of the homeless are minority-group members, Mr. Levy said, many communities have balked at affordable housing.
 
Comparing Populations
 The situation is not improving. As of January, according to county statistics, it took a homeless family an average of 37 months to move from temporary to permanent housing, at least 12 months longer than in January 1991.
In New York City, by comparison, a homeless family spends an average of seven months in temporary housing before finding a permanent apartment. But New York has a wider array of affordable apartments from which the homeless can choose, thanks in part to renovations of vacant and decrepit buildings begun under the Koch administration.
In Bergen County, N.J., where 429 homeless families are in temporary shelters, state officials said families move into permanent housing within 17 months.
Nassau County said its homeless families spend only two and a half months, on average, in emergency shelters.
While Nassau's homeless population is much smaller than Westchester's -- Nassau officials said there were 26 homeless families in its shelters -- some advocates said the county was too quick to refer families to permanent housing that was substandard. Shelly Nortz, the director of state policy for the Coalition for the Homeless, said Nassau, unlike Westchester, sometimes referred homeless individuals to rentals in which several households lived under one roof.
In Westchester, homeless families are shuttled among several locations as they await permanent housing. Fifty-two families are scattered in motels, where no services are offered and all meals must be eaten out. Most of the homeless, however, are housed at some point in centers run by private social-service organizations like Westhab Inc. and Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged, which provide them with at least one room, meals, counseling and after-school programs. Still other families have been moved to temporary apartments, where they can stay for up to 18 months.
County officials said 90 percent of the families are originally from Westchester, and more than two-thirds are from Yonkers or Mount Vernon.
For Ms. Gonzalez, a mother of three who has been homeless for seven years, home for the last six months has been here at Lakeview Cottages, a former bungalow colony in northern Westchester that once catered to working-class families on vacation from New York City. For several years, Lakeview, which despite its name has no such vista, has been leased to the county. Last month, the county contracted with a private group, Hope Inc., to counsel the 52 families who live at Lakeview about matters like substance abuse and job training.
Ms. Gonzalez said she had become homeless after a dispute with a landlord in Yonkers. After a long period of unemployment, she said, she got a job in the laundry room of a nursing home a month ago. But she said her $7-an-hour wage would not cover the $1,200-a-month rent on a three-bedroom apartment for herself and her three children: Naomi, 16; Cynthia, 13, and Eddie, 5. She said she had tried for several years to obtain a Section 8 certificate.
The family lives in three rooms on the second floor of a small lodge, where Cynthia has turned an enclosed porch into a makeshift bedroom. The cabins and lodges are winterized camp bunks with kitchens and bathrooms, but each unit is supplied with one luxury, a cable-television hookup, because broadcast reception is said to be poor.
"There are a lot of us that need just a little help and we'll get back on our feet," Ms. Gonzalez said.
 
Crowded, but Under a Roof
 The conditions are worse at the Coachman, a run-down welfare hotel opposite the Social Services Department in White Plains, which the county bought in 1993. For the 74 families there, three microwave ovens in the worn lobby serve as a kitchen in between the three breakfasts and five dinners a week served in the hotel dining room. In some instances, as many as seven family members have been crammed into two tight, overheated rooms for more than four years.
To correct the problems at the Coachman, the county is undertaking a $4 million renovation, to be completed late next year. It has turned the management of the hotel over to Westhab, which offers counseling services, recreation programs for children and 24-hour security.
Living at the Coachman has been awkward for Deborah Stokes, 34, who has shared a single room there with her teen-age son and daughter for three months. But Ms. Stokes said she was grateful to the county for taking her family in when she could not pay the $545-a-month rent on her one-bedroom Yonkers apartment.
"We would be living out in the park or in the street," she said.
While advocates credit the county with putting roofs over the heads of virtually all of the county's homeless people, they say they are concerned that neither the county nor the state has been able to reduce the time that it takes families to find permanent housing.
"When you talk about three years," says Mary Brosnahan, the chairman of the Coalition for the Homeless in Manhattan, "you imagine developmentally how much a child changes from a 3-year-old to a 6-year-old, or a 6-year-old to a 9-year-old. The amount of damage that's done bouncing a child from shelter to welfare motel to temporary housing -- it's irreversible."

HEADLINE: In a Mexican Border Town, Dog Days Just Won't Quit

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: OJINAGA, Mexico, June 26

 BODY:
It's 119 degrees. The grim gray mountains shimmer. The asphalt of Free Trade Boulevard looks like black slush spilling toward the border. The only people in sight are Miguel Zaragoza and his brother Carmelo lazily crossing the boulevard on their chestnut mare. They've got a few dozen head of cattle to drive to the Ojinaga pens.
This is not quite the dynamic scene envisioned by city officials two years ago when they changed the name of their central street to Free Trade Boulevard from Chihuahua Avenue. The hope was that by rolling out a municipal red carpet they could insure that the benefits of the free trade agreement arrived in this sun-baked town of 40,000. 
 Six months after the trade pact took effect, there's no sign that anything has changed for better or for worse. Border officials say commercial traffic is about the same as it was before. Free Trade Boulevard, the first thing seen by travelers arriving from Presidio, Tex., remains a sorry sight, with empty lots and boarded-up stores. Among the few viable enterprises are a liquor warehouse and a shop that makes gravestones.
 
Nafta Stirs False Hopes

The North American Free Trade Agreement, which lowered tariffs on goods crossing the border, was expected to have an immediate impact on busy ports of entry like Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez that already had lots of commercial traffic. In nearly forgotten places like Ojinaga, 200 miles southeast of El Paso, changing the name of the main street seems to have stirred false hopes, and ultimately, deep disappointment.
"It's only for the rich," said Juan Francisco Reyes Campos, who is unemployed and not very thrilled about the future.
"We'll wait until December to see if there are any results," said Jose Isaac Uribe Alanis, the new opposition party Mayor, who thinks the previous administration probably erred when it raised people's expectations. "If not, we'll change the name."
A new name has already been picked: Peguis Highway, after a nearby mountain. It may not say much, but at least the mountain is already there.
O.J., as the locals refer to Ojinaga (named for a Mexican general, the town's full name is pronounced oh-hee-NA-gah), may be the town that Nafta forgot, but in truth it never had much going for it. The first Franciscan friars who tried to settle here in 1715 were run off by the Indians. Pancho Villa took the town in 1913 and reduced much of it to rubble. For the last 30 years Ojinaga's most successful businessmen have been drug smugglers.
In 1978, when border factories known as maquiladoras were sprouting up in every other border city with a highway and a 24-hour-a-day crossing to the United States, one of Ojinaga's loyal sons, Arturo Baeza Pantoja, came back to the city where he had spent the first 11 years of his life. He built a cinder-block factory, started sewing together shirts with material from the United States and planned to lease out the rest of the space to another maquiladora. Build and they'll come, he reasoned.
He waited 16 years.
A small maquiladora now finally makes wooden tables for vans. And in a few months a new factory should start turning out dog toys.
Ojinaga has been so dispirited the last few months that even the "dog factory," as it is referred to here, is seized upon as proof of progress. Otherwise, the scene is bleak. Near Mr. Baeza's factory, Ojinaga's adobe bullfight stadium is deteriorating, unused for at least 15 years. The city's zona rosa of stifling adobe backrooms and gaudy dance floors is as mean as the dogs in the city's junkyards.
Unlike border towns that have evolved into Mexican-American amusement parks, downtown Ojinaga remains down country. A hot spot is a 24-hour restaurant that specializes in menudo, a local tripe stew. A tourist brochure can list so few reasons to visit that it encourages Americans to take advantage of lower dentists' rates and "Come have your teeth cleaned!"
There is a small museum devoted to Pancho Villa, and an almost treeless little plaza.
And then there's the ball of fury.
 
A Mysterious Landmark
 On a downtown corner, near the public library, a metal ball measuring three feet in diameter is inexplicably cemented into the ground. No one can say for sure where it came from, just as no one can say where Ojinaga is going. One local legend says the ball is a meteorite.
"They uncovered it when they built the library," said Martin Pompa, who has lived in Ojinaga for all his 31 years and spends many unemployed hours in the shade of an abandoned building near the ball.
"Generally," said Mayor Uribe, "it's believed that the Spaniards brought it to mill wheat."
The relentless heat makes bars some of the most profitable businesses in Ojinaga. The Bikini Bar, on the central plaza, stays open till 2 A.M. and does steady business with Mexican-Americans crossing the border from Texas for a night out. Musical trios, like the one Marcos Chavez runs with his son Mario and another friend, spend the day hauling their instruments from one bar to another, playing for two pesos -- about 65 cents -- a tune.
"Seems to me they're washing the streets a little more often since January," Mr. Chavez said after belting out "Que Bonito es Chihuahua," a popular song in these parts. "But besides that, everything now is about the same as before."
The owner of the Bikini Bar, Hector Moreno Alonso, didn't have much to say about free trade, but he did offer an explanation for the ball of fury.
"It's part of a machine they used to use around here to break rocks," he said.
 
Even Here, Some Optimists

Even in a place as bleak as post-Nafta O.J., there are optimists. "Yes, we have a future," said Jose Santos Armendariz, head of the Ojinaga Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Santos, a pharmacist, mentioned plans for a new luxury train from Dallas, an improved airport and an interstate highway spur on the Texas side. He admitted the city's future was uncertain, as uncertain as had been its past.
"Ah, the ball," he said animatedly. "Well, we don't know for sure, but I think it was part of an anchor, a big one."
Ojinaga is, and was, at least 517 miles from the ocean.

Asked to Find a Winner, A Judge Declares a Tie

 BODY:
After a divisive campaign, a confusing election, three recounts, four lead changes and a month of accusations and recriminations, the race for the Democratic nomination for county executive in New Jersey's second most populous county, Essex, is officially a tie.
Judge Burrell Ives Humphreys of State Superior Court last week certified the results of a court-ordered recount of the June 7 primary between Thomas Giblin, the chairman of the county's Democratic Party, and Cardell Cooper, the Mayor of East Orange, that showed each candidate with 22,907 votes. 
 That has left the candidates frustrated, election officials bewildered and many observers flabbergasted.
"Statistically, the odds of a tie in a countywide race are as great as the United States winning the World Cup," said Walter L. Fields Jr., the state political director for the New Jersey State Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. "You would have better odds at winning the New Jersey Lottery."
Mr. Cooper, who is seeking to become the state's first black county executive, and Mr. Giblin are trying to win the right to face Mayor James Trefinnger of Verona, a Republican and a county Freeholder, this fall. In Essex County, capturing the Democratic Party primary has been tantamount to a general election victory.
Mr. Giblin's camp has called for a new primary election. Mr. Cooper is sticking to his claim of an outright victory based on 38 emergency ballots that the election board disqualified, and he said his lawyer would be in court this week to force the issue.
 
New York's Bond Ratings Languish at A, as in Abysmal
 An increase in New York's bond rating this year would have provided Gov. Mario M. Cuomo with a campaign emblem of his efforts to bring New York out of the recession. But both major Wall Street credit-rating agencies announced last week that they would leave New York's ratings where they were, at rock bottom.
In doing so, they weighed in on the recurring Albany debate about whether it really matters that the Legislature and Mr. Cuomo fail so persistently in passing a budget by April 1, the start of the state's fiscal year.
Before April 1, Mr. Cuomo typically lectures the Legislature about the importance of a timely budget. Once the deadline has been missed, he tends to downplay the significance. Lawmakers, meanwhile, argue privately that an on-time budget is less important than a budget that satisfies their needs.
The budget was not approved this year until June 8, the second latest date ever.
In their reports, the two credit-rating agencies made it clear that timeliness mattered to them, and that it contributed to an overall impression that New York's government did not work.
Moody's Investors Service kept the state's general obligation bond rating at A, the second lowest of all states. "While not an uncommon event, since the last budget enacted by April 1 was in 1984, the delay this year has been excessive," said the report. "The inability of the Governor and the two houses of the Legislature to reach budget accord is indicative of the partisan nature of the budget process and the divergence of priorities among participants in achieving ongoing budget balance."
Standard & Poor's echoed that sentiment, keeping the state's rating at A-, the lowest of any state.
 
Using a Campaign War Chest For Another Kind of Battle
 When Representative Stephen J. Solarz of Brooklyn lost his seat in Congress to redistricting and defeat in a crowded Democratic primary in 1992 -- despite a war chest of more than $2 million -- some New York politicians shook their heads and said he would have been better off to have simply taken his money and retired, instead of spending it in vain on costly TV commercials.
He qualified to keep the money under a provision that has since been abolished.
Now it turns out that Mr. Solarz did put at least some of the money to private use after his defeat. A study released last week by the Center for Public Integrity in Washington showed that Mr. Solarz spent $197,376 for legal fees. For much of last year, Mr. Solarz was facing a Federal inquiry into his dealings with a Hong Kong businessman with reputed ties to organized crime. The investigation ended without charges this winter, but it scuttled Mr. Solarz's nomination as President Clinton's Ambassador to India.
The study found that since 1979, when the House passed an amendment allowing members in office before 1980 to convert campaign funds to non-election purposes, 112 former members of Congress have done so. About $6 million went directly to personal use, or to the members' heirs, the study found. The other $4.5 million went to cover travel, entertainment or other expenses, or to pay legal fees. Twenty-three members who left office in 1992 converted about $2.4 million to such uses.
 
Rushing to Block a Veto, Council Trips Over Procedure
 The New York City Council got a lot of attention last month when it stood up to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani on the question of contracting out city services, overriding his veto of a bill that would give the Council some say over privatization.
But it turns out that the Council must vote on the override measure again because of a technical mistake.
The Council received the Mayor's veto message on June 13 and, riding a wave of Democratic resentment, promptly overturned the veto the next day by a vote of 43 to 7. (The seven Republicans stood by the Mayor.) Part of the rush was a fear among some members that the Mayor would use budget negotiations to discourage members from supporting the override.
The meeting on June 14, however, was technically the continuation of a meeting that began on June 9. That's because Council leaders had never adjourned the first meeting, preferring an indefinite recess so they could vote at a moment's notice on a budget agreement if one emerged.
But the charter says the Council can vote on a veto only at the next regularly scheduled meeting after it receives the message from the Mayor.
The Mayor's office, which is considering challenging the law in court, gleefully informed the Council of its mistake earlier this week and now a second vote must be taken. The vote has not been scheduled yet.
"I don't expect the result to be materially different," said Richard Riley, a spokesman for the Speaker, Peter F. Vallone.

Minerva Guillaume, bright-eyed and alert, rushed past hundreds of other children to the front of the food line. She was caught and whisked to the back. She flashed an impish smile.
"I am hungry," said Minerva, a wisp of a 7-year old, who wanted to get her share of the day's fare, gruel mixed with okra. "I want to eat." 
 Less than a mile away at a hospital, Dieulafanne Francen cuddled her 9-month-old baby, Donlegel Miton, his eyes sunken, his face gaunt, and his shriveled skin barely clinging to his bones.
"He is sick," said the mother, unsure of the cause of her son's misery."He cries all the time."
Every day tens of thousands of children holding plastic or aluminum plates line up in mud schoolhouses under thatched roofs, awaiting what will perhaps be their only meal of the day.
 
Malnutrition Widespread
 At nearby hospitals and clinics, hundreds of less fortunate children like Donlegel sit listless and hold on to dear life, suffering from kwashiorkor, a severe form of nutritional deficiency characterized by changes in pigmentation of hair and skin, bloated belly and stunted growth.
Haiti's children have borne the worst of the political and economic chaos that has gripped the country since its President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was ousted in a military coup in September 1991 and economic sanctions were imposed on the country. The infant mortality rate hovers at about 111 per 1,000 births.
The statistics tell only a fraction of the story. Aid officials say that complete numbers are not available, partly because they have been unable to undertake comprehensive studies since the coup. But a May 1994 U.S.A.I.D. Monitoring Report showed a 3.3 percent increase in the rate of the most severe malnutrition in Haiti.
And if the crisis persists, aid workers warn that the malnutrition rate, already one of the highest in the hemisphere, will reel out of control and that it may take years to reverse the health damage caused by the lack of food, if it can be reversed at all.
 
Feeding Programs Boosted
 In the last few months, aid workers have increased their emergency feeding programs from about 350,000 people to nearly 1 million a day and plan to expand to about 1.7 million people, or roughly 1 in 4 Haitians. Their main target is those most susceptible to malnutrition, children up to the age of 12 and pregnant or lactating women.
"This is a critical moment we're living through now," said Cothias Jean Martel, assistant administrator for CARE's Food Aid Project in Gonaives, 180 miles northwest of Port-au-Prince, the capital. "The Haitian people have a strong will to survive. That's why we're alive, but we're barely doing that."
As the malnutrition rate among children continues to soar, it will present yet another difficulty for the Clinton Administration, which has pressed for and won a tougher embargo against Haiti.
In an effort to isolate the country to force recalcitrant military officers to cede power and allow Father Aristide, the country's first democratically elected President, to return, the trade sanctions against Haiti have been tightened to the point of almost a total embargo.
Direct commercial flights to the United States have been suspended, visas to enter the United States have been revoked, and the foreign assets of Haitians living in Haiti have been frozen. Although the sanctions exempt food and medicine and are not aimed at the poor, there is no way protect them from some of the effects of the embargo.
 
Farm Fields Abandoned
 While famine is widespread in Haiti, it is more acute here in the northwest, in the poorest province of the hemisphere's poorest country, which is suffering the effects of a seven-year drought.
Farmers have abandoned their fields and are reverting to chopping down trees to make charcoal. Corn and millet stalks lie withered on baked soil.
Over the last three years, as countries cut off trade with Haiti, food has remained available, but the prices of staples like rice, beans and cornmeal have increased fivefold.
Moreover, about 10,000 people are expected to be squeezed because they cannot export mangos, their main source of income.
While CARE and other development organizations run more than 600 feeding centers throughout the country, the centers are out of the reach of many people.
 
Needy Far From Help
 Yolande Clovis, the mother of a 3-month-old girl, walked for more than an hour to get a large bowl of gruel and peas at a feeding center in Canal Bois, a village on the outskirts of Gonaives.
"I heard they were giving food here, so I came," she said. "It's food, and I thank God that I will have something to eat."
Dieudonne Altidor, 25, stood quietly in line with her son, Aliencin, as she waited her turn.
"I can't complain about the food," she said matter-of-factly. "I am a poor person. I am just happy for it."
At another feeding center in the Raboteau section of this city, hundreds of children waited silently in the scorching sun near an outdoor kitchen where cooks prepared large pots of food.
While relief workers hand out a 15-day supply of uncooked wheat, oil and peas to some families, they continue to cook for children to insure that they get at least one meal a day.
But as the tougher and less porous embargo takes hold, relief efforts are being hampered by a lack of spare parts for cars and motorcycles to transport the food from the docks of Port-au-Prince to the provinces, aid officials said.
"If we cannot get the food, it will be a catastrophe," said Antoine Jean-Baptiste, who runs a feeding center in Gonaives. "Many of the children will die. I have seen that happen."

HEADLINE: Rebels Have Little to Show for Efforts to Topple Saddam Hussein

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SALAHUDDIN, Iraq

 BODY:
In a small, nondescript house, with armed guards out front and the windows bricked shut, the men and women who would seize power from President Saddam Hussein plot their way to Baghdad.
In cramped, dimly lighted rooms they stuff miniature copies of their opposition newspaper into matchboxes to smuggle past Iraqi lines into the capital. They record blistering attacks against the Government to be broadcast on their radio and television stations. They pound new information into computers in an effort to flesh out profiles of officers who might be willing to stand with them against the Iraqi leader. And in a camp just outside town, 500 militiamen train with former Iraqi officers. 
 But three years after the Persian Gulf war, the Iraqi National Congress, the umbrella organization for Kurdish, Shiite Muslim and Sunni Muslim opposition groups, has little to show for its efforts.
 
Hussein Remains in Power
 Mr. Hussein not only remains in power, but with Iraq increasingly in compliance with the United Nations cease-fire resolution, it seems only a matter of time before sanctions are lifted.
The few coup attempts, only one of which, in June 1992, seriously threatened Mr. Hussein, were all swiftly crushed. The Clinton Administration last year scaled down a covert $40 million Central Intelligence Agency program to overthrow him. Administration officials said much of the aid had been distributed to groups and officers with no real following. Too much money, they said, went into the production of leaflets and propaganda that had little impact.
"The Americans always held out this hope that some mysterious officer would come along and rid the world of Saddam Hussein," said a senior Iraqi National Congress official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. "This hasn't happened, and isn't likely to happen."
Several million dollars is still given to opposition groups by the C.I.A. to finance broadcasts and other propaganda efforts. Iraqi congress officials refused to say whether they were included in the covert financing.
The group set up its operations a year ago in the northern "security zone" controlled by Kurdish rebels and protected by the United States and its allies, but much of its recent efforts have been devoted to separating warring Kurdish guerrilla factions.
In a sweltering television studio, Sermat Ilias, a political commentator dressed in a coat and tie, glanced at his script as the strains of Vivaldi's "Four Seasons" faded away. His recorded commentary would be broadcast on the group's television channel in the north that night after the evening news.
The news program, filled with scenes pirated from various satellite broadcasts, including those of CNN and the BBC, is beamed south each evening to Iraqis living below the Kurdish-held security zone.
The television and radio stations, frequently attacked by the Government-run press in Baghdad for spreading foreign propaganda, are often jammed. The dissidents insist, nevertheless, that their efforts are slowly eroding Mr. Hussein's authority.
"We do not put our faith in a magical coup," said Ahmed Chalabi, effectively the head of the Iraqi National Congress. "We are trying to mobilize support inside Iraq and spread the word to let people know we are here and offer an alternative."
 
Hussein Heads 'Wanted' List
 The dissidents demand that Mr. Hussein, 7 of his relatives, 5 of his top advisers and 27 army officers and officials of the governing Baath Party stand before an international tribunal for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. Mug shots of the Iraqi leaders to be brought to justice are tacked to the walls of the safe houses in this mountain town.
However quixotic such a demand seems, it is also meant to reassure Iraqi officials that any such measures will be limited to the top echelon.
"We want the army to know we can work with them," Mr. Chalabi said. "We do not reject all elements of the regime."
Despite all the pamphlets, newspapers, leaflets and broadcasts, it is hard to tell how widely the propaganda is spread and how effective it is.
"They have nice facilities and a lot of money," one senior Kurdish guerrilla leader said, "but I doubt many Iraqis even know they exist."

HEADLINE: New Proposal For Shutdown At Chernobyl

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: VIENNA, July 2

 BODY:
The United States and its allies are developing a strategy for closing the Chernobyl nuclear reactors permanently and helping to make Russian-designed nuclear reactors safer, officials at the International Atomic Energy Agency here say.
The immediate centerpiece is a substantial package of Western aid that is expected to be approved, at least in part, after the meeting of the seven biggest industrial nations in Naples next week. The money would enable Ukraine to close all four reactors at the Chernobyl site and complete construction of up to five new, safer nuclear power plants. 
 There was an agreement in principle by the 12 European Union countries in Corfu last week to supply up to $600 million for nuclear safety in Ukraine. And to provide the Group of Seven participants with specific examples of projects, energy officials from the United States and Ukraine released a report on Friday identifying new energy sources and conservation measures as alternatives to the electricity supplied by Chernobyl.
 
Common Standards for East
 The emerging strategy also involves two new international agreements intended to make Russian reactors safer.
One would encourage Western nuclear companies to upgrade Russian reactors by limiting the companies' liability for future accidents. A second, to be completed in September, sets common standards for reactor safety codes.
"All three developments fit together," said Morris Rosen, the American physicist who is the International Atomic Energy Agency's assistant director general for reactor safety. "We are finally getting somewhere."
After first agreeing to close down the whole Chernobyl plant in 1991, five years after the disaster there, the Ukrainian Parliament dismayed the West by deciding last October that energy needs required the country to retain the two functioning reactors and repair a third shut down after a fire in 1991.
 
Decision Is Protested
 In March, Hans Blix, director general of the international agency, protested the decision, telling President Leonid Kravchuk that "international levels of safety are not being met at Chernobyl."
A mission sent to Chernobyl by the agency said the sarcophagus encasing the burned-out No. 4 reactor, which exploded in 1986, spewing radioactive debris across much of Europe, was in danger of collapsing, posing a new radiation hazard.
It also found a serious shortage of spare parts and trained staff at the two functioning reactors. Some 40 percent of Chernobyl's top technicians have left in recent years, mainly because of falling living standards.
Experts from a dozen countries met in April to discuss the report, and a clear majority called for Chernobyl to be shut down as soon as possible, warning that it remained a threat to the rest of Europe.
But the Ukrainian delegation said it could not afford to close the plant until five new, safer nuclear reactors, currently under construction, have been completed.
The Ukrainians also said they would need some $196 million in foreign assistance to complete the first three on schedule by 1996, while finishing the two other units by 1999 would bring the bill to some $1.2 billion.
While Eastern countries are asking for foreign help in making their power reactors safer, many Western nuclear companies are reluctant to become involved until their legal liability for future accidents is clarified.
The World Bank has estimated they could earn up to $24 billion upgrading the 59 Russian-designed reactors currently in operation and 10 more under construction when demand for new reactors in the West is almost nonexistent.
 
New Guidelines Sought
 In an effort to overcome this obstacle to nuclear trade, officials here say the Clinton Administration will press for an agreement by next spring on a new convention that would shield nuclear construction companies from accident damage suits by putting primary responsibility for safety on the reactor operator.
In a paper circulated to International Atomic Energy Agency members recently, the Clinton Administration says it wants wide participation "in an international liability system providing for both prompt and adequate compensation for victims of nuclear accidents and for legal protection of nuclear suppliers."
More than 80 countries are expected to sign a new international convention on nuclear reactor safety.

HEADLINE: U.S. View of Sanctions: Turn Up Heat Half Way

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
It should come as no surprise that in his foreign policy showdowns, President Clinton has made economic sanctions his weapon of choice, even though such measures have, at best, had a middling record of success.
The reason sanctions appeal to Mr. Clinton, who is well aware that Congress and the public are uneasy with the use of force, is clear: They go beyond talk, but stop short of war. They send a message of toughness, they usually hurt their target and they cause little pain at home. 
 With these advantages in mind, Mr. Clinton has turned to sanctions, often working closely with other nations, in the diplomatic crises he has faced: Bosnia, Haiti and North Korea.
"We use sanctions because they can be effective," said an Administration official. "There is a lot of pressure to do something, and we're in an era when there's great concern about loss of life. Somalia showed there is very little tolerance for combat deaths these days."
 
Not Entirely Successful
 The problem is that the most exhaustive academic study of the subject concluded that since 1973, sanctions achieved their goals only a quarter of the time they were used.
They failed to persuade the Soviet Union to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, they have not gotten Saddam Hussein to change his ways in Iraq and they have not toppled Fidel Castro. Nor has a trade embargo against Serbia stopped its support of the Bosnian Serbs, who have occupied almost three-fourths of Bosnia.
At the moment, the Clinton Administration is carrying out sanctions -- in some cases under United Nations auspices -- against more than a half dozen countries, including Cuba, Haiti, Iraq, Iran, Libya, the Sudan, and the Yugoslav Federation of Serbia and Montenegro. And that list does not include the sanctions threatened against North Korea.
To be sure, previous presidents embraced sanctions as a weapon, but experts say sanctions are being used more frequently in recent years because the end of the cold war has made it easier to obtain international solidarity behind them.
 
U.S. Seeks Partners
 It was not long ago that the United States seemed content to go it alone in imposing sanctions, but increasingly it scours the globe for international support.
"Cooperation has become important because the United States is no longer the pre-eminent economic power that it was right after World War II," said Gary Hufbauer, an expert on sanctions at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
But in spearheading efforts to put together sanctions against different countries, Mr. Clinton has shunned the advice of most longtime students of the subject: Turn up the heat all the way, and turn it up fast. In this way, not only do adversaries see that you mean business, but they do not have time to prepare ways to make an end run around the sanctions.
 
Go-Slow Approach
 Instead, President Clinton has chosen a one-step-at-a-time approach to sanctions, partly because of his tentativeness on foreign policy and partly because some nations whose support Washington badly wants insist on a go-slow approach. Administration officials caution that if they use every weapon in their sanctions arsenal from day one, the only option left if sanctions fail is force.
The Administration boasts that its threat of sanctions pushed North Korea to agree, at least for now, to freeze its nuclear program. The phased sanctions that Washington proposed were to start with a ban on North Korea's arms exports and a cutoff of $15 million in United Nations aid.
Those were to be followed by a prohibition on all financial transactions. That would hardly affect the United States, but would have significant repercussions in Japan -- and could create tensions there -- because Koreans living in Japan send hundreds of millions of dollars to North Korea.
In the case of Haiti, the United Nations, with Washington's backing, imposed a trade embargo more than a year ago. But it was not until June that the Administration slapped on sanctions intended to hurt Haiti's economic elite, who have lent crucial support to the military leaders. These measures, taken in conjunction with Canada and other countries that have major business dealings with Haiti, include banning commercial flights with Haiti and freezing Haitian assets in the United States.
 
Approach Is Criticized
 Many experts say the Administration has taken a sloppy approach in targeting the sanctions on Haiti because these measures have squeezed the poor but have left the rich untouched, until recently.
"In commercial disputes, Administrations usually do a terrific job targeting sanctions, for instance, slapping tariffs on French wine because they know winegrowers have a huge amount of political clout in France," said Lisa Martin, a Harvard political science professor who has written extensively about sanctions. "But when we use sanctions for political purposes, we for some reason haven't paid much attention to targeting."
William H. Gray 3d, the President's special adviser on Haiti, all but admits that the Administration should have stepped up sanctions on Haiti faster and focused them better.
"Even though there have been a series of sanctions over the last couple of years, they really have not been very significant," he said. "These are the first sanctions that you've had that have had real teeth in them."
 
Easier on the Elite
 But even well-designed sanctions usually punish the masses more than the elite. When sanctions are directed at dictators like Saddam Hussein or Haiti's military rulers, these leaders can take the nation's wealth and divert it to groups like the military and presidential guard that are needed to keep them in power.
Another problem with sanctions is that they sometimes backfire. In the view of many experts, sanctions against Cuba have allowed Fidel Castro to claim that the United States trade embargo, not Communist economics, have wrecked his economy.
But the Administration recognizes that sanctions can kill several birds with one stone. While one official said diplomatic demarches amount to little more than words over tea and cookies, sanctions make leaders look tough at home and abroad. Rallying other nations around a sanctions program is a visible way of claiming world leadership. In addition, sanctions let other countries know they will pay an economic price if they choose to become international outlaws.
Last but not least, sanctions just might cause the targeted nation to stop its objectionable behavior.
"Sanctions are not a precision-guided instrument that can bring a solution to every problem," said a senior Administration official. "But they are effective at their fundamental purpose of exacting a cost for behavior that's repugnant, dangerous and destabilizing."
 
South Africa Cited
 Administration officials argue that too little attention is paid to the times sanctions succeed. Exhibit No. 1, they say, is South Africa, where a ban on loans, investments and many imports helped pressure the Government to end apartheid. According to many experts, what pushed white South Africans to abandon apartheid was not the economic pain from the sanctions, but the international opprobrium contained in those measures.
Administration officials point to other limited successes. The ban on flights and arm sales to Libya have pressured Col. Muammar el-Qadaffi to cut back on his support for terrorist activities.
The worldwide trade embargo against Iraq has gotten President Hussein to take some steps toward destroying his weapons of mass destruction, although not as much as Washington wants. Nonetheless, the sanctions have failed to get the Iraqi leader to recognize Kuwait's borders and stop harassing Iraq's Kurdish population.
 
Serbia Is a Question
 There is a debate raging about how well the embargo against Serbia has worked. Some officials say Serbia has been bitten so hard that it has pressured Bosnia's Serbs to agree to a cease-fire and engage in peace talks.
But many experts counter that the embargo has failed badly and that the Bosnian Serbs have agreed to peace talks only because they have conquered all the land they want. Under this view, the embargo has proved ineffective because of smuggling through Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Romania and other countries in the region.
"This is an example of a disastrous program," said Michael Malloy, a sanctions expert who is director of graduate studies at Fordham University. "The reason is it's been hard to get broad international and regional cooperation."

HEADLINE: For Student Debaters, Success on Their Terms

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 1

 BODY:
There are places in the land where the passion of high school debate nearly rivals that of high school football. New Jersey is not one of those places.
But New Jersey -- specifically, Newark -- is home to a nationally prominent debate team. In 12 years, the Science High School debate team has won 12 varsity state championships. This team has taken part in the National Forensic League finals for 10 years in a row and last month traveled to Kansas City to do so again. It is one of only 90 high schools in the country to hold a chair at the Barkley Forum, a debating honor society at Emory University. 
 If this is a surprise to many people, the debate team members no longer care.
"Some people think our economic situation has some bearing on our ability to be logical or persuasive," said Melissa Cooper, a graduating senior and member of the team. Sitting in a computer lab, surrounded by her teammates, Ms. Cooper laughed and shook her head in exasperation.
"We have the same mind as anybody else. They didn't have to do anything special to start a debate team in Newark. All they had to do for us was give us money."
 
The Coach's Import
 Money is important -- traveling to tournaments and camps for research is costly. But for a debate program to thrive, it needs a coach willing to dedicate 20 hours a week after school, willing to attend the weekend tournaments, willing to travel about the country supporting and encouraging his team. Science High School has Brent Farrand, a 42-year-old math teacher who has been the bedrock of the program since he created it 14 years ago. Mr. Farrand said he has loved debate since he first stood before a judge during his own high school days in Liberty, N.Y.
"It taught me a whole different way of looking at the world," he said. "It taught me that problems are caused by human beings, so human beings can solve them."
Science High School, one of Newark's three magnet schools, draws accomplished students from throughout the city. But Mr. Farrand said the best students do not necessarily make the best debaters.
"The speaking skills, the research skills, all those we can teach," he said. "But it's very difficult by the ninth or tenth grade to teach the rudiments of thinking. It's possible, but it's very difficult."
 
Two Types of Debate
 In comprehensive debate programs such as the one at Science High, students compete in both policy and Lincoln-Douglas debates. In policy debate, two teams of two debaters square off on a single, nationally assigned issue that they have studied and researched. The debaters must be prepared to attack or defend all aspects of the issue. There are proposals and attacks, cross-examinations and rebuttals, all conducted in intense, rapid-fire exchanges that can leave observers gasping for air.
By contrast, in Lincoln-Douglas debates a pair of students speak on a single moral or ethical question, seeking to persuade judges with their knowledge of history, philosophy and the social contract by which we live.
This year, policy debaters had to devise a national health care plan. Hassan Ceaser said that after hours of research, he and his partner argued that President Clinton's health care plan should be adopted as originally proposed, with the addition of comprehensive psychiatric and mental health care coverage.
"We argued that the mentally ill are very dehumanized in the present system," he said. "There's a very small number of symptoms you can show before you're just automatically put into an asylum. We increased outpatient services so people's families can take care of them.
"On the negative side, we said the proposal was really vague. We debated what 'comprehensive' meant, what 'all' meant, what 'American citizen' meant. We debated how doing this here would affect the rest of the world, since we're a superpower."
 
Repairing an Image
 The team's success is a balm for officials scarred by harsh criticism of the deeply troubled Newark district. For two decades, the 48,000-student system has been repeatedly cited for dismal student performance, high truancy rates and mismanagement. Its students routinely fall far behind state standards in reading and math. Last year, the state began steps toward a possible takeover of the district, despite bitter opposition from system officials.
But more than 92 percent of Science High's ninth-grade students passed all the 1993 state High School Proficiency Test. The state average was 82 percent, and Newark's nonmagnet high schools scored between 12.5 and 49.5 percent.
Five other Newark high schools have speech teams operating at various levels. But none has been able to recreate the full-fledged program at Science. "They get a lot of attention," said the principal, Christine Taylor. "Some other students who do things wish they were given as much attention as the debate team. But, generally, their fellow classmates are very proud of them."
These students feel keenly the pressure of representing their school, their city and sometimes their race. They are one of the few urban public schools on the national debate circuit and the only one, they say, whose members are all either black or Hispanic. Only the youngest has not been the sole Hispanic or black debater at a tournament, and felt a heart-stopping moment of profound alienation.
"Once in Washington, D.C., I was the only Puerto Rican, the only minority, in about 300 people or so," said Jose Caceres. "They didn't ask me about the program or the education system. They ask, 'How do you live over there? How do you get through the day?' "
What does he tell them? "I tell them it's normal."
 
Dealing With Racism
 Sometimes there is overt racism, the students said. But often the judges are fair and the competitors open and friendly. The struggle, they said, is to overcome prejudice where it exists, and to avoid seeing its specter where it does not.
"You definitely have to be self-confident," said David Murray, 16. "You know that other person isn't going to lose because of his race. You have to say, 'This judge is going to vote for me because I'm good.' "
"And you don't want someone to vote for you because they feel sorry for you," Ms. Cooper said. "You don't want them to say, 'Oh look, that's so cute. She's from the inner city and she can talk.' "
Their assistant coach, Diana Dunker, tells them the story of her own senior year, when she and her partner, both black, faced the pressure of competing in what was a predominantly white activity. At an important tournament, her partner became ill but resisted going to a hospital before the final round.
"She told me we had to debate them or else people were going to think we were scared of them," Ms. Dunker said. "That made me realize how much pressure we were under, that she would sit here and risk her life to debate this last round so people wouldn't think we weren't up to par."
These students said any problems they have faced dissolve in the honey of what they have gained: responsibility, an awareness of people and places and issues beyond Newark and the process of critical thinking.
Most precious of all, said Christiane Gabriel, 17, is confidence. Ms. Gabriel, who will attend Rutgers this fall, smiled as she recalled how easily intimidated she used to be.
"I agreed with anybody who told me something," she said. "It wasn't until I joined debate that I realized I have to have confidence in myself. Just because somebody else says something, if I don't agree with them, that doesn't mean I'm wrong.
"I learned that I am a strong person," Ms. Gabriel said. "I am intellectually smart."

HEADLINE: WORLD CUP '94;
Being Brazil's Coach Includes Ignoring 150 Million Opinions

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS GATOS, Calif., July 2

 BODY:
Ana Paula Olsen was explaining the fanaticism of soccer in Brazil. Every fan has a favorite player. And every fan has a favorite player's favorite body part.
"The television cameras will stop people on the street, and they will say, 'I like Dunga's legs and Rai's butt,' " said Olsen, a native of Brazil who owns a bikini shop in this Silicon Valley town, where Brazil's World Cup team is lodging. "It's always the legs and the butt." 
 Given this consuming passion, what would happen to the coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira, if Brazil somehow lost to the upstart Americans on the Fourth of July?
"If they lose, he should stay here, move to Utah," Olsen said. "Or maybe to Nepal."
 
Every Advantage, but . . .
 Brazil should not lose to the Americans on Monday at Stanford Stadium. Brazil has won three World Cup titles; until they beat Colombia, the Americans had won three World Cup games. Brazil has every advantage: speed, skill, experience, technical superiority. Brazil versus the United States in soccer should be the same as the United States versus Albania in basketball. A runaway.
Except for one thing.
Brazil has not won the World Cup in 24 years. People are getting edgy. A 1-1 draw on Wednesday with Sweden was denounced as a "tragedy" by the Brazilian news media. Anxiety has broken out like a national rash. It's not because the Brazilians are afraid of the Americans. It is just that, in Brazil, there are only two results: stylish victory and panic.
"We have not won in five World Cups; the sixth we have to," said Zetti, the reserve goalkeeper. "But when you have that much pressure and expectation, it can be a minus instead of a plus."
It is said that there are 150 million coaches in Brazil, each certain of what is best for the national soccer team. All 150 million are giving Parreira advice, whether he wants it or not. President Itamar Franco has offered suggested lineup changes. Even Parreiera's own mother said she would like to see Ronaldo, the 17-year-old sensation.
The most famous Brazilian of them all, Pele, is writing a newspaper column for USA Today, pointing out Parreira's mistakes, calling for replacements at forward, defense and midfield.
"Brazil cannot play any worse," Pele wrote on Friday.
And this is a team that has yet to lose.
Pele recommended six lineup changes for Monday's game. At least, Parreira's mother recommended only one.
"One is enough," Parreira said.
At a news conference on Thursday, more than 100 reporters grilled Parreira on the sad state of his team after the 1-1 draw with Sweden. But they didn't so much ask questions as levy their own harsh opinions.
"The Brazilian national coach has a job tougher than the director of NASA," said Ney Bianchi, a reporter for Brazil's Manchete magazine who has covered every World Cup but one since 1958. "At NASA, you lose your job only if a rocket explodes. In Brazil, all you have to do is lose a game. Or maybe get a tie."
It is estimated that 93 percent of all Brazilians will watch some portion of the World Cup. Soccer is a galvanizing diversion for a country rent in recent years by the impeachment of its president, galloping inflation, the killing of street children and the yawning gulf in income distribution between the richest and poorest citizens. Brazil's most charismatic sports hero, the champion race driver Ayrton Senna, died in a crash two months ago. Now the entire country looks to soccer for reassurance and regeneration.
 
No Second Place
 "Second place is a national tragedy," said Bianchi, the magazine journalist.
Certainly not of the magnitude that occurred in Colombia early this morning, when Andres Escobar, the man who inadvertently scored for the Americans, was gunned down. But such is the urgency of another World Cup title that segments of Brazil's daily practices are broadcast live on television; newspapers carry arcane diagrams showing every pass, every shot, every player movement. Broadcast journalists swarm around the coach and players, pressing cellular phones into their faces, sending their responses home live and unfiltered.
Parreira, to his credit, always makes himself available and remains cheery.
"Brazilian public opinion is more critical than any place in the world," Parreira told a group of English-speaking reporters on Thursday. "If we were 30 percent as good as the fans and the media expect us to be, we would be unbeatable."
"From now on, I do believe that FIFA has to find a special way for Brazil to participate in the World Cup," Parreira mused, referring to soccer's world governing body. "At least allow Brazil to play in the World Cup with six national teams. That might please half of the people. One team will just play attack football. Another national team will just play defense. The third will play creative football, the fourth will play fantasy football, the fifth will play competitive football. To please everybody with one national team is a big task."
That, in essence, is the key to Parreira's success and his sanity. It is impossible to please everyone, so he doesn't try. He ignores the suggestion that his team is too cautious, dismisses those who pine for the days of Pele and three forwards in attack, disregards the opinions that Rai is unfit for his role as playmaker and that Dunga and Mauro Silva lack the speed to play in tandem in the midfield. He even ignores his own mother.
 
Win or Lose, Parreira Will Leave
 "You have to have your own way; otherwise you are lost," Parreira said.
At 51, he and Bora Milutinovic, the Serb who coaches the Americans, are the only coaches to have led three different countries into the World Cup. Parreira coached Kuwait in 1982 and the United Arab Emirates in 1990. His first stint as coach of Brazil's national team ended with his firing in 1987. This time, win or lose, Parreira is leaving on his own terms after the World Cup, likely to land as coach of Valencia in the Spanish League.
He has scrapped the European-influenced sweeper defense that Brazil used futilely at the 1990 World Cup and imposed his own system and will. Instead of three forwards, Parreira employs two central midfielders and a pair of outside backs in Leonardo and Jorginho who charge forward voraciously on attack.
When the mercurial forward Romario presented disciplinary problems, Parreira left him off the national team until a victory over Uruguay was necessary during World Cup qualifying. But Parreira also knows his players must be allowed their freedom and creativity. Romario has responded with three goals in three games.
"This is the Brazilian way," Parreira said. "The only thing we stress is discipline to be well-organized without the ball. That's the only concern I have."
 
More Coaching Advice
 Millions are more than happy to worry about everything else. Olsen, the shop owner, called Rio on Thursday to place an order on bikinis. The woman on the other end wanted to talk soccer.
"Tell Parreira to bench Rai," the woman instructed Olsen.
Monday's game against the Americans is anticipated with hope and dread. Something unlucky has always happened to Brazil in recent World Cups.
If there is a satisfying victory, 20,000 Brazilians and Brazilian wannabes are expected to parade again through downtown Los Gatos as they did after a 3-0 shutout of Cameroon.
And advice for Parreira will flow like celebratory beer.
"He has a system and he believes in it," said Gerson Nunes, a midfielder on the 1970 championship team. "He doesn't want to change, although if he listened to a few suggestions, he'd probably win more easily."

To the Editor:
"False Promise of Development by Casino," (June 12) suggested that legalized gaming in regional markets negatively affects local economies. This is not an accurate picture, however, in markets where casinos are operating. 
 In Mississippi, the growth of the gaming industry is responsible for creating an estimated 40,000 jobs since 1992, and the reduction of unemployment figures from 10.8 to 5.4 percent. State records show that casinos have taken in $1 billion in gross revenue, of which the state has received $81.1 million from taxes and fees. A November 1993 study of United States economic recovery by U.S. News & World Report placed Mississippi first among the states in improved economic health.
Harrison County, which encompasses Biloxi and Gulfport, Miss., and is home to 11 of the state's 25 casinos, has shown tremendous growth in the last two years, including a 26 percent increase in the number of passengers arriving in local airports, a 17 percent increase in retail sales and a 60 percent increase in hotel sales tax collections.
Sixty-four percent of Mississippi's casino customers live outside the state, according to the state Center for Policy Research and Planning. The gaming industry has energized tourism in Mississippi, nearly doubling its income from $1.6 billion in 1990 to an estimated $3.3 billion for 1993. In a state where casinos are the largest employers, where management is hired regionally and casino companies are investing millions in their operations and community development, the success of gaming has been in the best interest of Mississippi.

HEADLINE: Wage a Cold War Against Serbia

BYLINE: By David Gompert; David Gompert, a Rand vice president, was a senior director on the Bush Administration's National Security Council staff. This is adapted from a longer article in the current issue of Foreign Affairs.

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has reluctantly decided to join our European partners in an attempt to end the war in Bosnia as soon as possible by giving half that country to Serbia. We are thus a step closer to blessing Serbia's victory and just a step away from pardoning this conquest by lifting the economic embargo on Serbia.
In Geneva on Tuesday, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev of Russia and their Western European counterparts are expected to approve a plan to divide Bosnia. The Bosnian Government and the Serbian side will then be asked to accept the plan before the summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial countries in Naples three days later. 
 If the Serbs balk at returning much of the land they have taken from Bosnia's Muslims, we can depend on our allies and Russia to ask the U.S. to press the victims of aggression to capitulate.
 The Clinton Administration did not bring us to this sorry state of affairs singlehandedly. It took four years of failed Western policies to get here -- four years of trying to shift responsibility and blame across the Atlantic and back, of toothless United Nations Security Council resolutions, of explaining away the savage destruction of a multi-ethnic European state as a hopelessly complicated civil war with all parties at fault.
Indeed, by being willing to use force, the Administration broke, temporarily, with the West's willingness to tolerate the intolerable in Bosnia.
But now it sees no way out. We cannot get a U.N. agreement to permit the victims of aggression to defend themselves. We cannot count on our allies to remain in Bosnia to protect humanitarian operations. We cannot count on Serbia's neighbors to abide by the trade embargo. There is no stomach in the U.S. or Europe for the heavy bombing that would produce a just peace.
 The Western position is now fundamentally indistinguishable from that of the Serbian strongman, Slobodan Milosevic: end the fighting, partition Bosnia, lift the sanctions. (Will clemency for war crimes also become negotiable?)
In its eagerness to stop the fighting, the West is presenting President Milosevic with the opportunity to become victor, peacemaker and father of Greater Serbia.
Weary of Secretary Christopher's "problem from hell," the U.S. may now have to send American troops to police the results of ethnic cleansing. Should we not pause to consider whether there may be some better, if imperfect, alternative?
There is -- if the West can summon the will to wage a cold war against Serbia until a democratic revolution discards its criminal regime. Economic sanctions and information warfare may take years to reform Serbia, but the outcome is certain.
Those who dismiss the eventual demise of Milosevic Inc. as unrealistic will be hard-pressed to explain the more remarkable results of Western steadfastness in defeating Soviet Communism and South African apartheid.
 In any case, ending Serbia's punishment and isolation now, in return for a flawed and unstable peace, would extend the life of this Balkan bully for years, bringing new crises and more atrocities.
 Would our allies see it through? In fact, the Europeans have proved quite firm in sanctions against South Africa, Libya and Iraq. In the case of Serbia, they can easily endure the limited damage to themselves. At any rate, if the allies believe sanctions cannot be sustained, why do they believe the Serbs will concede hard-won territory to get them removed?
 A more legitimate concern is with the harmful effect of the embargo on the frail new democracies of south-eastern Europe: Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Romania. The West cannot treat them as expendable.
Instead, the European Union and the United States should expand and sustain economic support so that these frontline states can survive even as Serbia falters.
 A quarantine of Serbia is more likely to succeed if accompanied by a campaign to inform the Serbs why they are being treated as lepers. To date, the Serbs may be miserable, but they believe they are right, and they blame the West, not Mr. Milosevic, for their plight.
But most Serbs only know what they see on the television station he controls. With Western help, television and fax networks -- the technology that riddled and helped wreck the Soviet system -- could break Mr. Milosevic's information monopoly. Serbs need to know the truth about their rulers, the atrocities in Bosnia, the reasons for their hardship and their options.
 During a cold war against Serbia, scattered fighting would be likely to persist in Bosnia. But now that the threat of NATO air strikes exists, the Serbs could be deterred from attacking the half-dozen Muslim enclaves in Bosnia's Serbian-controlled area, and even if the Muslims attempted limited counteroffensives there is little reason to think the fighting would spread or that the main battle lines would shift.
 The West cannot resolve this conflict on acceptable terms with limited air power. But it should leave no doubt that air strikes would be used to uphold U.N. decisions and protect peacekeeping troops. Humanitarian relief convoys would get through to affected populations if they had adequate ground and air escorts who were ordered to use all necessary force. Those who interfered with such efforts or harm U.N. personnel should be exposed to air attack and charged with war crimes.
To the French and British, who say they might pull out of Bosnia if there is not a quick deal with the Serbs, the U.S. should offer air cover and make the case publicly that the right stance toward Serbia is steadiness, not retreat.
 Even if sanctions did not produce sweeping change in Belgrade, a crippled Serbia is preferable to one that is given the chance to rebound.
Moreover, economic war in perpetuity against an unrepentant Serbia would send a strong signal to other tyrants that international aggression, whether it succeeded or not, would result in unforgiving punishment.
 There never was an easy solution to the Yugoslav problem. Although the West is not prepared to defeat Mr. Milosevic militarily, it is not obligated to cut a deal with him.
We can reach a more acceptable outcome in time with an acceptable Serbian leadership by showing the same steadfastness we did in the larger cold war.
Unless we hand him victory now, Mr. Milosevic will lose a cold war, and real peace can then come to the Balkans.

HEADLINE: John Dyson, Upstart From Upstate, Speaks Up (Again)

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
It was a John S. Dyson kind of moment.
Gov. Hugh L. Carey was in office and Republican state legislators were complaining about the appearance of Mr. Dyson, the 34-year-old Democratic Commerce Commissioner in "I Love New York" ads promoting New York State. 
 Suspicious that Mr. Dyson was promoting himself as well as the state, the lawmakers were considering legislation to bar the appearance of state officials in publicly financed ads. And Mr. Dyson, mocking it all, showed up to be questioned at a legislative hearing in a black Lone Ranger mask, prompting a Republican walkout.
It was the gesture of a man who never wanted to be a faceless bureaucrat, a commissioner with such a penchant for the flamboyant gesture or outrageous quote that even admiring former colleagues still groan that if there is a propeller he will walk into it, if there is no controversy he will create one.
And last week, Mr. Dyson, now 51 and a deputy mayor to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, struck again, in a dispute with City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi over whether a company owned by a black woman should be rehired to market New York City bonds. "The Comptroller ought to know the difference between a bid and a watermelon," he said to The Bond Buyer, in a remark that was denounced by many Democratic officials as racist or offensive and revived questions about whether Mr. Giuliani's administration is insensitive to blacks.
Mr. Dyson apologized, saying he had not intended to be offensive, but was trying to compare something "fixed and firm like a bid" to something he considered "soft and mushy" -- Mr. Hevesi's contention that two financial advisers could be used to market city bonds for the same price as one.
"Upstate we say about someone whose head is mushy, that he has a watermelon for a brain," he said. "It is not a racial remark in upstate New York. I didn't realize, in fact, how intensely it had become such a thing in New York City."
But that, Mr. Dyson's critics say, is just the problem: that he shows a lack of appreciation for the care needed by public officials in a racially divided city. State Comptroller H. Carl McCall was highly critical of the remark said he couldn't judge whether Mr. Dyson had intended to use bigoted language. "But in a city like New York one should understand that a remark like that will be perceived that way and you should avoid making them," said Mr. McCall, the lone black official holding statewide office. "If you don't understand that, you are out of your element."
 
'Enjoys Being Outspoken'
 Yet controversy has always been Mr. Dyson's way, across a decade of public life that saw him serve as State Agriculture Commissioner, Commerce Commissioner and then chairman of the State Power Authority, until 1985. One year later, he made a failed bid to win the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate, then returned to his Dutchess County home in Millbrook, where he ran his own investment firm and a winery.
"John enjoys being outspoken," said Phil Friedman, a political consultant who ran Mr. Dyson's 1986 campaign. "He is the kind of person who gives himself credit for saying things he believes other people won't say, and even though he apologizes later and retracts, he's managed to continue the pattern."
Mr. Dyson admits that some of his style is attributable to the freedom granted him by wealth. "It comes in part because I can afford to do it, you know, to be honest," he said. His father, Charles H. Dyson, founded an investment firm, now known as Dyson-Kissner-Moran, which has made the elder Mr. Dyson one of the wealthiest men in the country.
"He invented something," Mr. Dyson said of his father. "He invented the friendly version of the leveraged buyout." Forbes magazine estimates Charles H. Dyson's worth at $550 million. The Deputy Mayor indicated on financial disclosure forms required by the city that he earned at least $1 million last year in interest and from partnerships and investments.
But Mr. Dyson chose not to go into the family business, showing a zeal for government and politics. He made his first, unsuccessful bid for public office in 1968, running a close Congressional race against the Republican, Representative Hamilton Fish 3d. The Conservative candidate was the not-yet-notorious G. Gordon Liddy, who withdrew.
After Mr. Dyson served in Vietnam as an Army intelligence officer, he returned to New York and within several years was a member of the Carey administration.
In office, Mr. Dyson's ability to antagonize opponents was not limited to his masked appearance. He feuded publicly with New York City officials when he moved most of the Power Authority's operations from Manhattan to White Plains, because of a rent increase and lack of space at its Columbus Circle headquarters. He complained at the time that the city had made little effort to help him, while city officials said he refused even to consider space outside Manhattan. "Even here, we've had several people killed at Columbus Circle," he said at the time. "It's hard to persuade anyone to come to a place that has the reputation of being less safe than where they are now."
Mr. Carey, now a Washington lobbyist, still praises him as one of the more effective members of his administration. "What we did mainly is turn the city around, and the biggest thing we did is create job opportunities," Mr. Carey said. "John is one of the key three or four people around me who worked on jobs."
It was Mr. Dyson's record as Commerce Commissioner that led the Liberal Party leader, Raymond B. Harding, and the media strategist David Garth to recommend him to Mr. Giuliani as deputy mayor for finance and economic development.
 
'Sheer Ability'
 "When I think of John Dyson I think of sheer ability," Mr. Harding said.
As Deputy Mayor, Mr. Dyson has negotiated for the city in the sale of the Coliseum site to the developer Mortimer B. Zuckerman, and worked out the boundaries of the city's Federal empowerment-zone proposal with Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem. He solicited private donors to help support the city's museums and cultural institutions. And partly because Mr. Giuliani's other deputies are so studiously low-profile, Mr. Dyson has emerged as one of the most visible members of the government.
When he was negotiating the Coliseum deal, Mr. Dyson made public the Giuliani administration's offer to restore $50 million in capital funds to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, owner of the Coliseum site, to persuade it to come to terms with Mr. Zuckerman. Under criticism, Mr. Giuliani backed away from the proposal, saying, "That is John Dyson's proposal, not mine."
 
The 'Do Not Worry' Comment
 Last week was not the first furor for Mr. Dyson over remarks some perceived as insensitive to black New Yorkers. After a newspaper article asked whether Mr. Giuliani and his chief deputy, Peter J. Powers, were capable of governing a diverse city, Mr. Dyson wrote in a memo to Mr. Powers that was intended to remain private: "Do not worry. Two white guys have been running this city of immigrants for over 200 years."
At another point, after the administration held a Cabinet meeting on Staten Island, Mr. Dyson suggested that a similar Cabinet session was unlikely in Harlem, which he said had received "the vast proportion of the attention over the last four years."
But it was Mr. Dyson's reference to watermelon last week at prompted calls from some black and Hispanic lawmakers for his resignation. "There is no way he can come and make an excuse for what he said," said Councilwoman Una Clarke, a Brooklyn Democrat. Mr. Giuliani came strongly to Mr. Dyson's defense, even as others outside the administration questioned whether Mr. Dyson was becoming a liability.
And by 1 A.M. yesterday, Mr. Dyson had come full circle. Nominated for the M.T.A. board by Mr. Giuliani, he was again facing a Senate committee. And while Mr. Dyson ultimately won committee approval, the early morning hearing took on the tones of a morality play.
 
What He's Learned Recently
 "I would really like for you to articulate what you have learned from this very, very painful experience to so many people -- so many people that are not represented around this table or this legislature," said a weary looking Senator Norman J. Levy, a Long Island Republican and chairman of the transportation committee.
Mr. Dyson looked contrite. "I suppose it's hard to describe all the things that have gone on in the last 48 hours or so, but coming from where I come from in upstate New York, I've learned a great deal," he said. "'Will I be more careful in the words I use?" he asked "Yes. Have I made mistakes in what I've said in the past? Yes.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: STUYVESANT TOWN;
Cooler Days Are Here. Or Are They?

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
After sweltering every summer for nearly half a century, Stuyvesant Town is finally getting new electrical wiring that will allow the installation of air-conditioning. But now residents face a new frustration: a shortage of air-conditioners.
For years the lack of air-conditioning has been a recurring issue at Stuyvesant Town, which had not upgraded its electrical system since it opened in 1947. Cost has been a major consideration; the rewiring is costing $60 million for the 89 buildings. 
 With the heat wave in June, air-conditioners began selling out everywhere. It became especially difficult to find a model that fits Stuyvesant Town's specifications.
"We ran out of inventory," said Morris Portnoy, owner of a major local supplier, Bloom & Krup, whose crews installed about 300 air-conditioners in Stuyvesant town. Now more than 100 orders are unfilled.
"I could sell 500 to 800 more this summer, easily," he said, adding that, as the rewiring project nears completion, "next year demand will be into the thousands."
Another supplier, The Frenchmen, is still installing air-conditioners but has only about 100 left that fit the specifications. That supply is not likely to last more than a week. William Koniuk, who runs the company, said that while he was seeking other sources, "this is the worst season I've seen with manufacturers."
Hoping to capitalize on the burgeoning Stuyvesant air-conditioner market, both suppliers had advertised heavily in the Town and Village weekly newspaper to sign up customers.
One reason air-conditioners began selling out during the heat wave was a low inventory after strong sales last year. "The economy was uncertain, and manufacturers did not believe we would have two strong seasons in a row," Mr. Portnoy said. "It's a sad situation where people waited 47 years for the wiring, and now we don't have enough air-conditioners."
Also, he said, Stuyvesant Town's specifications have essentially limited buyers' choice to certain models by Friedrich, which he said are in demand everywhere.
Residents lucky enough to get on the top of the list are luxuriating in their comfort. "I loooove it -- it's the best thing that ever happened," said Ann Fink, whose building at 270 First Avenue was the first wired, last year. "We're here 19 years, and every summer we swore we were going to move. We had 10 fans -- ceiling fans, floor fans, wherever. Open the door and you got blown to the other end of the apartment. Now we bought three air-conditioners, for the living room and both bedrooms. I would buy one for the bathroom if they made it."
Not everyone in the 8,756 apartments is hooking up, however. Some object to the cost. The wiring entails a monthly rent increase of $27 per room, plus $20 a month per air-conditioner as a year-round electricity charge. The air-conditioners themselves range upwards from $700 for a living room model and $600 for bedroom models.
"I can't afford it," said Gertrude Petty. "I've been 42 years in this hot apartment -- I'm 86, don't you know -- and I tell myself, you lived here through this hell 42 summers, and you can make it through another." BRUCE LAMBERT

Fixing the Popping Windows

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
What do you do with 58,416 newly installed windows after 2,000 of them implode and shatter?
That's the issue in the latest battle over the implosion problem, an unusual mystery that has plagued Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village apartments since late last year. 
 It is an issue that is crucial to both tenants and the owner of the complexes. The state has held up a rent increase until the problem is solved.
The owner, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, has this answer to the problem: drill tiny holes in the double-pane glass to relieve the excess vacuum suspected of causing the breakage.
But tenant leaders question whether the planned repair will work. The windows were designed with argon, a nontoxic gas, between the panes to enhance their insulating effectiveness. Critics in the tenants' association say that holes will allow the argon to escape, defeating its purpose, and could also admit moisture and cause condensation inside the windows. Nancy Peskin, a Met Life spokeswoman, said the holes will be so small as to be virtually invisible, and there is no plan to reseal them after the air pressure is equalized.
"Nobody has any faith in this solution," said Jo-Ann Polise, vice president of the tenants association.
Citing the window problems, the tenants have opposed Met Life's request to the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal for permission to impose a $9-per-room rent increase to finance the $30 million project.
Now the tenants have won a preliminary victory. State officials advised Met Life that the window job must be satisfactorily completed before the rent can be raised. Unless Met Life wins a reversal in the state's position, it has lost out on a retroactive increases of hundreds of dollars for each of the 11,251 apartments. Ms. Polise said, "It's a considerable savings to tenants." B.L.

HEADLINE: African Despair, and Hope

 BODY:
Africa was given unaccustomed attention last week as the Clinton Administration held a two-day conference on the economic and political afflictions in 30 countries south of the Sahara. But what the conference unintentionally highlighted was the low priority Mr. Clinton has given to a region whose enormous promise is blighted by declining economies and soaring fertility rates.
The cold war's demise, however welcome elsewhere, has proved a setback for black Africa. Superpower rivalry once gave crucial influence to poor lands with prized real estate for military bases, or a grip on maritime "choke points," or large reserves of strategic minerals. But with the Soviet-American competition now over, the C.I.A. is closing 15 African stations. Actual U.S. development aid to sub-Saharan Africa has tapered to around $800 billion this year, as the industrialized world pumps an increasing share of multilateral development funds into the former Communist countries. 
 As The Times's John Darnton detailed in a recent series, Africa's leverage has markedly weakened during a grim decade when its gross national product declined 2 percent a year. A single figure underscores the disastrous state of the region's economy. Excluding South Africa, the total output in 1991 of all countries below the Sahara, with a combined population of nearly 600 million, was roughly the same as the gross national product of Belgium, home of 10 million people. And as output plunged, the region's foreign debt tripled, to $180 billion. Its population will double in 25 years, further straining resources, if the present fertility rates continue.
None of this justifies passivity or despair. Sub-Saharan Africa boasts far more arable land and mineral riches than other poor regions. And in an unforeseen windfall, South Africa, the region's industrial powerhouse, has ceased to be an economic and political pariah after a peaceful democratic revolution brimming with promise.
South Africa's salutary transformation is the region's most stirring event since the post-colonial surge to independence 30 years ago. Not only has apartheid been revoked, but President Nelson Mandela has shown how to turn bitter adversaries into political allies, providing a model for African states polarized by ethnic and political rivalries. And if Pretoria really opens its own frontiers to freer trade, it could jump-start stalled economies elsewhere.
Given a spell of peace and trade across open frontiers, plus the stimulus of a dozen new stock markets, sub-Saharan Africa's economy could grow by 3.9 percent a year in the coming decade, according to forecasts by the World Bank. But Africa is not a machine that can accelerate by itself; it needs the help of a world that has been too quick to take profits out of Africa and too slow to extend a helping hand.
Africa's immediate needs include debt forgiveness or at least a generous rescheduling of loans it cannot possibly repay; seed money for small-scale development rather than big-ticket prestige projects coveted by dictators, and aggressive diplomacy to help end wars and promote democratic reforms.
The Clinton Administration justifies the relative penury of its African development programs by pointing to competing needs. Maybe so. But that excuse cannot explain the absence of a single high-profile appointee to serve as an advocate and goad to conscience. Africa has fallen into the lap of anonymous bureaucrats and stagers of conferences. It deserves far better.

THE AGENDA
Inside the Clinton White House.
By Bob Woodward.
Illustrated. 352 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $24. 
 BILL CLINTON'S train wreck of an economic plan is headed for a roll-call in the Senate, and three White House missionaries are in hot pursuit of Senator Bob Kerrey, whose vote could pull the bill through. A rendezvous arranged, the persuaders arrive at the American Cafe in Union Station, only to find they are at the wrong American Cafe. They lurch off again, down Massachusetts Avenue, and finally meet up with the elusive Senator at the right American Cafe.
In one of the piquant moments that make "The Agenda," Bob Woodward's account of the Clinton Administration, such a compulsive, Grisham-like read, "Kerrey asked what was next for the White House. Paster [Howard Paster, President Clinton's Congressional liaison] mentioned something about how they were going to move on to health care. 'No, no, no,' Kerrey said loudly and dismissively, 'I don't mean legislative strategy. I mean, what's this Presidency about?' "
It's page 289, and we still don't know. After listening to the Senator from Nebraska's subsequent demolition of the Clinton Presidency, the President's men simply parrot back that their boss agrees with everything Senator Kerrey says. At this point in the book, this is a credible statement. At this point in the book, Mr. Clinton seems to agree with everything anybody says.
* It's April 1993, and Mr. Clinton is meeting with his health and economic advisers: "Where are all the Democrats? . . . We stand for lower deficits and free trade and the bond market. Isn't that great?" he yells sarcastically -- before going along.
* It's Memorial Day weekend, and Mr. Clinton is talking strategy with Paul Begala, a key political consultant, who argues that the economic plan looks soft on the wealthy: "I know this thing is a turkey," Mr. Clinton says.
* It's July, and Senator David Boren is arguing for an alternative that would cut the deficit stringently: " 'Oh, he's right!' Clinton said at one point soon after. There weren't enough spending cuts, he complained. They had not zeroed anything out completely -- that would have been dramatic. There weren't enough entitlement cutbacks."
* It's autumn, and key Cabinet members and advisers are pressing the President to stand up for the free trade agreement with Mexico: " 'I have to be a President beyond the borders,' Clinton finally said, declaring that he would go ahead. 'It is not an option to drop.' "
I'm assuming, of course, that everything in the book -- from the deepest thoughts of Robert J. Shapiro, an economist and Clinton campaign adviser, to the mood swings of Gene Sperling, the deputy director of the National Economic Council -- is true. It certainly rings true. And no one in the White House has seen fit to rebut. Sure, the book contains no major surprises (despite the publisher's hype) and, like Mr. Woodward's previous books, is animated by no coherent analysis and no guiding idea. But that doesn't make it any the less worthwhile as adumbrated, reliable gossip. Besides, Mr. Woodward has long since graduated from investigative journalism to what might better be called confessional journalism: the sources now come to him. We glean what's beneath from the scattering of arcana on the surface. And what's beneath is often worth considering.
Take the President of the United States.
Some commentators have read the book as showing Mr. Clinton as indecisive; in fact, he makes decisions throughout, sometimes belatedly, often with great difficulty, but always eventually. He makes complex calls on the economic plan, even down to line-item budget matters. He makes health care a priority, and takes a stand on the trade agreement. He is also not merely the passive receptacle of his advisers' agendas. It's clear from the book that Mr. Clinton is admirably adept at listening to a range of people and voices, weighing arguments, measuring responses. This is not the same as weakness (in many ways, it's a strength),
and it's why, in person, Mr. Clinton can be so impressive, why Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, could have been so charmed by his attentiveness and apparent agreement at their first meeting:
"Greenspan tried to evaluate the President-elect's sincerity. Was it possible that Clinton was pulling his leg? That it was all a show? That, Greenspan felt, would be really impressive. He would be disturbed if someone was that skilled at deceiving, but it would be remarkable. Clinton's performance was too straight."
No, the problem with Mr. Clinton is not a practical one -- he's not alone in being an executive who prefers a mixture of advice and takes his time to come to a decision. As Mr. Woodward details his ability to keep track of meetings, to mix politics with policy, to call dozens and dozens of Congressmen, to consult with a staff that stretches from the earringed David Dreyer to the courtly Southerner Thomas F. (Mack) McLarty, it's hard not to be overwhelmed by the sheer range of the President's political and social talent.
The problem is an intellectual one. In this book as in the daily newspaper, Mr. Clinton is not simply, as Mr. Woodward has Mr. Greenspan delicately putting it, "an intellectual pragmatist." He seems to live intellectually in a world where there are simply no contradictions; where nothing comes at the expense of anything else; where traditional big-spending liberalism is compatible with deficit-cutting neoliberalism; where welfare reform never actually hurts people; where deficits can be cut while Government investments in education and infrastructure are increased and entitlements left untouched. This is not a question of cynicism. Bill Clinton is no George Bush: he has not ceded everything to political expediency. And it's not a question of pragmatically splitting differences, which every practical politician has to do. With Bob Woodward's Bill Clinton, it's a question of not believing there are differences to split.
SO when the contradictions finally assert themselves, as they tend to do, Mr. Clinton's response is a mixture of shock, self-pity and rage. The most memorable outburst in "The Agenda" comes when Mr. Clinton is told that his economic package cannot both meet Congress's well-known spending caps and keep its ambitious investment plans. Some of his anger can be attributed to his staff's insufficient warnings. But some of it can't: "The President began to yell and shout questions. How? Why? When? . . . Slamming his fist down on the end of his chair, Clinton let loose a torrent of rage and frustration. He said he felt blindsided. This was totally inconsistent with what he had been told. Why hadn't they ever had a serious discussion about the caps? . . . The President turned red in the face. Why didn't they tell me? he asked."
The psychological origins of this intellectual blindness are not hard to discern. The Bill Clinton Mr. Woodward portrays is pathologically averse to real conflict. "I don't hate anyone," he remarks at one point. "I forget the people I'm supposed to hate." It's notable that throughout the book, Mr. Clinton never blows up at anyone his own size, or even at anyone in particular, but at the world in general, at an unnamed "they," at a minor flunky ("I want him dead, dead. I want him killed. I want him horse-whipped") or, if all else fails, at the long-suffering George Stephanopoulos, his senior policy adviser.
This is not, the book cumulatively reveals, the behavior of a bully so much as that of someone so traumatized by conflict that he will avoid it at any cost, and then abstractly rage at the consequences. At one point in the explosive phone conversation in which Senator Kerrey tells him he is going to vote against the economic plan, Mr. Clinton plaintively wails like a 14-year-old -- " 'Everybody said this is going to be the smart thing to do,' Clinton said, his voice rising with fury and defeat. 'I took this thing on head on and I gave a good-faith effort' " -- once again refusing to take responsibility for the genuine ideological disagreement his difference with Senator Kerrey was rooted in.
MR. WOODWARD'S judgments on the other White House players are less definitive, but often telling. Mr. Clinton's political consultants, Paul Begala, James Carville and Mandy Grunwald, turn out to be spectacularly wrong about almost everything. My favorite example is their "populist" insistence that the people had little desire for deficit reduction, when it was clearly the popular rage of 1993.
Mr. Begala, to his credit, eventually gets it; and Mr. Carville, to his credit, finally swallows the gas tax added to the economic program to help bring down the deficit. Still, they all pitch in (with Hillary Rodham Clinton) against pushing the free trade agreement rather than health care reform in the fall. Wrong again! In fact, wrong about the politics of health care altogether.
Ira Magaziner, the White House health care policy adviser, is a suitably comic figure, doggedly insisting that his enormously cumbersome plan was actually going to save money. And the Administration economic team comes off as remarkably sane and more liberal than Mr. Woodward's ideological rubric (which pits the neoliberal economic appointees against the paleoliberal political consultants) would suggest: Laura Tyson, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, fights a hard battle to soften deficit reduction, and Robert Reich, the Secretary of Labor, maintains constant pressure in defense of more Government spending on long-term investments like education.
Most surprising of all, perhaps, is Vice President Al Gore's political skill. He alone seemed to see the opportunity for Mr. Clinton back in early 1993 to cut a fresh figure as a deficit slayer and clearly establish his New Democrat credentials. He's a team player who doesn't always live up to his nice-guy image: "I want to know if you're going to screw us," Mr. Woodward tells us the Vice President demanded of Senator John Breaux at one point. And a by now often cited moment one day in the Oval Office is indeed wonderful. Mr. Clinton, lamenting "the endless compromises and delays" besetting the economic plan, turns to Mr. Gore: " 'What can I do?' he asked the Vice President. 'You can get with the goddamn program!' Gore answered tersely, his own exasperation boiling over." By the end of this book, the reader is left with the tantalizing thought of what might have been had the ticket been Gore-Clinton and not the other way around.
This is not, however, an account of the Clinton Administration as a whole. Mr. Woodward shares with Mr. Clinton an obsession with economic policy that blinds them to the political context in which economic policy must always be made. There is nothing, for example, about Bosnia in Mr. Woodward's account, and virtually nothing about a defining headache of the first few months of the Administration, the battle over homosexuals in the military. Even vital parts of the economic program such as the expansion of the earned-income tax credit, arguably Mr. Clinton's greatest social policy achievement, are given extremely short shrift because they don't fit into the plot line.
The entire Perot phenomenon is also essentially absent, although it greatly affected the climate in which Mr. Clinton's first year unfolded. Ross Perot's support in his 1992 Presidential race showed that populism in the late 20th century was an essentially antiliberal force; that it stemmed from a distrust of government, not a demand for more of it. Mr. Clinton and his consultants seem blissfully unaware of this fact, blithely talking up class warfare and redistribution of wealth. But if Mr. Clinton is unaware of it, so is Mr. Woodward.
There are other worries. Mr. Woodward elevates Alan Greenspan in a way that helps his plot line and his publisher's belabored hyping but does not exactly ring true. The notion that deficit reduction was actually good for the economy was not an idea that Mr. Clinton needed Mr. Greenspan to tell him; it's conventional wisdom, repeated a thousand times during the campaign and well understood by the neoliberals in the Clinton entourage.
MR. CLINTON adopted it not because of a tutorial with the chairman of the Fed, but because the voters had demanded it in 1992 and Congress insisted on it the following year. From "The Agenda" you might get the impression that 1993 was a year in which a popular President battled an unpopular Congress over how to run the economy.
But Mr. Woodward's broader failings are made up for by the pleasingly breathless style in which the story is told. Occasionally he overreaches: "Panetta looked out the large panels of windows. A summer thunderstorm was brewing. He was awed as it built, black and gray clouds approaching, then the rain and wind, and finally the storm itself passing through. He had watched, from a much greater distance, other Presidents go through similar turmoil." In general, though, Mr. Woodward makes even the ill-fated B.T.U. tax tick along briskly enough.
And with this Administration, Mr. Woodward's deeper flaws -- that he has no ideas to speak of, shows little sense of history and is unable to relate a narrative to a larger argument -- are strangely fitting. With Mr. Woodward and President Clinton, the journalism of mere process has met the politics of mere process. Mr. Woodward has finally found the President he deserves.

Sights on the Road
 THERE is an image of New Jersey that perhaps should be lost, but not if Peter Genovese, the author of "Roadside New Jersey," can help it. The hordes of writers waxing poetic over the gently rolling hills and wide sandy beaches miss the mark, Mr. Genovese says; what is great about the state is what he found and photographed while driving over hundreds of thousands of miles of roads. 
 "There was another New Jersey out there," writes Mr. Genovese, a Manasquan resident who is a columnist for The Home News, based in East Brunswick.
So get ready for an entertaining, whirlwind tour of the offbeat, beginning with unlikely though not necessarily enviable residences like a windmill in Barnegat, a log in Beach Haven and a castle on Route 57 in Mansfield fronted by this ominous sign: "Harley Parking Only. All Others Will Be Crushed." Published by the Rutgers Univerity Press, "Roadside" sells for $18.95.
The ubiquitous diner is immortalized here -- there are 31 pictures of diners -- as well as motels like the "queer little place, the green-and-white motel on Route 40 in Upper Pittsgrove" that resembles "a 1950's version of a spaceship" and whose owner "can't figure out" why people stop there.
The book's more than 400 photos, in color and black and white, include the street signs of Wit's End, Mount Misery and Sodom Lane along with other reasons to pause while driving: the Dog & Cat Deli for a pet-food store in Ocean Township, the Recessions Family Restaurant in Butler and Hairdresser on Fire in Roxbury.
Call this ideal travel literature, especially appealing for the character sketches of people Mr. Genovese met during his New Jersey travels: like Hubcap Jack, the octogenarian proprietor of Hubcap Pyramid, a 25-foot pile of hubcaps in Weymouth, or Helen Ertl of Vienna, who by tying the message "Help" around 11 maple trees fought the plan of the Department of Transportation to cut down them down -- and managed to save five.
And when the time comes for a thoughtful new state slogan for New Jersey, perhaps Mr. Genovese will submit one from a sign he discovered with the following advice: "Eat peanuts while you have your teeth."
 
Award for Art Essays
 The New Jersey Council for the Humanities recently gave its book award to Dr. Carol Duncan, the author of "The Aesthetics of Power," a somewhat benign title for a book that holds many a fiery message. Dr. Duncan, a professor of art history at Ramapo College in Mahwah, did not, according to the preface, intend that critical art history be perceived any other way.
In her world, as reflected in this collection of her essays, published by the Cambridge University Press ($16.95 paper; $49.95 hard-cover), art is neither neutral nor placid, and so she does battle with "the moral and political meanings that works of art have held in the past."
"The subjugation of the female" -- that is, equating the female sexual experience "with surrender and victimization" -- motivates modern erotic art, the author says. Further, she warns that although the significance of art is believed to be purely esthetic and "never bad for anyone," many so-called masterpieces with an air of authority "affirm the ideals of male domination."
Just who is Cheryl Bernstein, the author of the final essays of this book? In an interview, Dr. Duncan said that in 1970, "wanting to puncture the self-inflated and overly verbose world of art criticism, I invented a parody and called her Cheryl Bernstein."
How Bernstein was accepted in the art world, becoming known as "an astute, theoretically advanced critic" -- until the author voluntarily retired her in 1980 -- carries a message of its own about indistinguishability of parody and art criticism.
The New Jersey Humanities Book Award is presented to nonfiction works by authors linked to the state "by virtue of birth, residence or occupation" and whose work "invites critical reflection and makes scholarly knowledge available and exciting to a general audience." Winners get $1,000, and their publishers get $2,000 for marketing purposes.
 
Electronic Medical Manual
To say that one legendary title published in New Jersey has an enviable sales record worldwide is far from a boast, because The Merck Manual, printed by Merck & Company of Rahway since 1899, sold more than one million copies of its 15th edition. Its 16th edition, issued in 1992, is expected to exceed that figure by 20 percent.
Intended as a reference source for doctors, the $26 book now appeals to the vast variety of health care professionals and that amorphous group usually referred to as the medically curious. The manual provides information about the causes, symptoms, evaluation and treatment of virtually every disorder known to medicine.
What made news at the American Booksellers Convention, held in Los Angeles in May, was what Dr. Robert Berkow, the manual's editor, called abreakthrough: all 2,800 pages were turned -- perhaps "shrunk" describes it better -- into a half-ounce Read-Only Memory (ROM) card, two and one-fourth inches high.
The card fits into a Digital Book System, a hand-held electronic book, 5 inches by 3 inches by 1/2 inch, made by Franklin Electronic Publishers ofMount Holly. A combination of the electronic version of the manual and the digital book reader is being offered for $199.95 by Franklin (800-762-5382). Otherwise, the two items, if purchased separately, would total about $300.
Whether you enter cholesterolosis of the gallbladder or snoring, the speed with which the electronic book finds each reference is fraught with possibilities for even the mildest hypochondriac.

HEADLINE: Early Signs Point to Strong Shore Season

BYLINE: By LEO H. CARNEY 

 BODY:
IF the appearance of dolphins just beyond the breakers in Ocean City is an economic indicator of a good summer ahead, then Virginia Berwick's saltwater taffy and fudge shop on the boardwalk should do a booming business.
"The dolphins were out there just yesterday," Mrs. Berwick said with a smile and an optimistic tone on a recent day. Gazing out the window of her store, she added, "If the weather is good and the beaches stay clean, it will be a great summer." 
 Mrs. Berwick's qualified prediction of the 1994 Jersey Shore tourism season is shared by environmental and tourism officials alike. Other important factors, like the national economy and how much disposable income families think they have, will have a bearing on vacations along New Jersey's 127 miles of ocean beaches. But good weather and the perception of a clean coastal environment are the fragile variables that make all the difference.
"We are still holding our breath," Robert C. Shinn, director of the State Department of Environmental Protection and Energy, said, "but we feel positive about this being a good summer."
Karen Shaffer, a spokeswoman for the state division of travel and tourism, said that "preseason business at the Shore is a barometer of what is coming, and we have received all positive reports from real-estate agencies, hotels and other establishments, which are doing more business than they did this time last year."
Ms. Shaffer said that although an extensive economic survey had never been done, the division's reported tourism revenues for 1993, according to an independent survey, were $18 billion.
Shore tourism accounted for $9.5 billion of that, she said, with about $3 billion of the Shore tourism figure attributable to casino gambling in Atlantic City. So traditional Shore tourism, minus Atlantic City gambling revenue, generated $6.5 billion last year. According to Ms. Shaffer's figures, this was $700 million more than the $5.8 billion reported for 1992, when the total with casino gambling was $8.8 billion.
Although optimistic preseason predictions are usually easy to come by in any area that relies on tourism, real-estate people and other business owners, as well as tourism officials, said in recent interviews that 1994 shows signs of becoming the best summer in years. And that, they say, would mean that the Shore will have recovered from its disastrous economic decline of the last decade.
Starting in 1987, garbage and medical debris on beaches, as well as high bacteria counts in the water from malfunctioning sewage treatment plants, forced some ocean beaches to close occasionally. Widespread news reports exacerbated what was a precipitous decline in Shore tourism through 1990. In 1988 and 1989, for example, that economy was said by officials to have lost $1 billion.
All the bad news coincided with a general downturn in the economy that was particularly severe in the Northeast and what tourism experts said had become in the 1980's a national trend toward shorter, less expensive vacations. The trend continues in New Jersey, with extended weekends and one-week vacations being the most common getaways, real-estate agents say.
But at least some of the problems of the 80's may have ended. "Each year since 1990 has been a little bit better, until last year, when it was substantially better," said Andrea Schlosser Carter, a real-estate agent in Lavallette in Ocean County, who is also a director of the Ocean County Board of Realtors.
Ms. Carter said last year was the best one for rentals since 1985. But rentals this year are up by 20 percent, she said, raising the possibility that the Shore economy has turned the corner. "There seems to be a renewed interest in the Shore," Ms. Carter said.
 
Prospect for Clean Beaches
 Nevertheless, what will allow Mr. Shinn and others to relax and exhale come September are a sunny, dry summer and clean beaches. Big storms or frequent rains can still flush millions of gallons of pollutants from land-based sources like treatment plants and storm sewers into the Atlantic. Along with things like contaminated sediment from rivers and bays that are stirred up by storms, the pollutants can produce the high levels of bacteria that shut down beaches.
At least two beach closings have occurred already, said Barbara Derer, a spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Protection and Energy. One was at Cape May on June 8, the other at Seaside Heights on June 15. In both instances, Ms. Derer said, the closings were due to high bacteria counts and lasted just one day.
Cindy Zipf, director of Clean Ocean Action, a coalition of environmentalists and 300 Shore-related businesses, said much has been accomplished in recent years to improve the monitoring of coastal pollution and to clean up beaches and harbors. For instance, Ms. Zipf asserted, "New Jersey's ocean water quality testing is now second to none."
Federal, state and local environmental and health officials have joined in several programs that more closely monitor pollution and clean up harbors and beaches before Memorial Day and during the summer. Mr. Shinn said in an interview that a state program removed 5,000 tons of debris from harbors and beaches before Memorial Day this year.
 
Losses in Earlier Years
 Exactly how much damage has been done to Shore tourism since the 1980's has never been officially assessed by Trenton. But many individual businesses and municipalities reported losses of 30 percent to 60 percent between 1987 and 1990. Beach resort towns in Monmouth and Ocean Counties reported the heaviest losses for that period, while Atlantic and Cape May Counties suffered somewhat less.
Whatever the precise losses and gains, the declining Shore economy of the 1980's galvanized groups that had long been divided over how to keep the ocean clean and how clean beaches should be.
"The reality is that the Shore economy is directly tied to the quality of the environment," Ms. Zipf said. "It is now an accepted, adopted philosophy that in order for towns and businesses to be successful they need a clean ocean."
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, addressing a recent gathering of some 250 representatives of environmental and Shore-related businesses in Ocean City, said state funds for tourism promotion were being well spent. She said she had approved a coming legislative appropriation, raising the total for statewide tourism promotion in the 1995 fiscal year by $1.1 million to $5.9 million.
While it was not immediately known how much of the total will be spent on the Shore -- most advertising presents the entire state as a single destination -- Mrs. Whitman said it was a rare increase in state spending that would pay off. Each dollar spent on tourism promotion brings $100 in revenue to the state's economy, she said.
The Governor encouraged regional tourism agencies and others to continue "bundling and packaging" recreational, historic and environmental attractions, which has been part of the new marketing strategy since business dropped off several years ago.
 
Help From Private Sector
 Help is coming from the private sector, too. Five utility companies with substantial investments at the Shore announced that they would spend $500,000 to promote Shore tourism. Ron Marano, a spokesman for the Jersey Central Power and Light Company, one of the participants, said in an interview that the utilities were members of the Jersey Shore Partnership, a group of businesses interested in promoting the coastal economy.
Mrs. Whitman also told the gathering in Ocean City, which was called Coastal Alliance '94, that physically protecting the resources of the Shore was another key concern of her administration because "the Shore is a large part of who we are in New Jersey."
 
Shore Protection Fund
 A $15 million Shore Protection Fund, which was originally proposed under her predecessor, Gov. Jim Florio, was passed by the Legislature last year and is now available as the state's first stable source of money for Shore protection projects, the Governor said. The fund is for rebuilding and fortifying beaches and man-made coastal structures damaged by perennial erosion and storms.
James F. Hall, director of the division of natural and historic resources in the Department of Environmental Protection and Energy, said the $15 million would allow the state to qualify for matching Federal funds, which often cover 65 percent of the total cost of projects. This formula will see about $40 million generated each year for beach protection in the state, Mr. Hall said.
Mr. Shinn said in the interview that a computerized Geographical Information System, which is being programmed by the department to include data like the locations of stormwater and sewage treatment outfall lines and ecologically sensitive coastal areas, is still being developed. Eventually, he said, it will allow the state to regulate development of the Shore and track pollution more scientifically.
As Mrs. Whitman declared in her address, "We are no longer entrusting the Shore's integrity to pure chance."

HEADLINE: Asylum Seekers Need Only a Reasonable Fear

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The concern about the fairness of the procedure and the confusion about the criteria in the screening of Haitian boat people aboard United States ships described in June 17 and 18 articles from Kingston, Jamaica, are symptomatic of a political and not a legal dilemma. The law is well established. The controlling standard was laid down by the Supreme Court in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Cardoza Fonseca. 
 The essence of this decision was that applicants for asylum in -- or refugee admission to -- the United States are not required to show that they would be singled out for punishment if sent back to the country from which they fled. Nor do applicants have to demonstrate the likelihood, let alone the clear probability, of such punishment. A reasonable possibility of persecution is, or should be, sufficient to support an asylum or admission request.
Since the refugee legislation of 1980 was meant to bring United States law in concordance with the United Nations Convention, the Court felt at ease in adopting criteria developed by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It quoted approvingly the refugee agency's explanation that an applicant's fear in general "should be considered well founded if he can establish, to a reasonable degree, that his continued stay in his country of origin has become intolerable for him for the reasons stated in the refugee definition, or would for the same reason be intolerable if he returned there."
And the Court, to make quite clear how it wanted the new standard implemented, stated in a memorable caveat: "There is simply no room . . . for concluding that because an applicant only has a 10 percent chance of being shot, tortured or otherwise persecuted, that he or she has no well-founded fear of the event happening."
Fear is a subjective reaction. And it was this aspect of the Court's decision, delivered by Associate Justice John P. Stevens, that Justice Harry
A. Blackmun addressed in his concurring opinion.
He pointed out that the term "well-founded fear" demanded a particular type of analysis -- "an examination of the subjective feelings of an applicant for asylum, coupled with an inquiry into the objective nature of the articulated reasons for fear," the sort of analysis for which Justice Blackmun commended the "well-reasoned opinions of the courts of appeals that almost uniformly have rejected the I.N.S.'s misreading of statutory language and legislative history." And he ended with a stern admonition:
"The efforts of these courts stand in stark contrast to -- but, it is sad to say, alone cannot make up for -- the years of seemingly purposeful blindness by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which only now begins its task of developing the standard entrusted to its care."
These words were written seven years ago. Alas, they are still apt in the Haitian context. It is as easy to impugn the motives of asylum seekers as basically economic as it is difficult for an outsider to comprehend fully and to untangle the components that lead people to conclude that life in Haiti has become intolerable. But as long as there is a possibility, and be it only a 10 percent possibility, that an individual upon return to Haiti will be exposed to the retaliatory vindictiveness of a murderous regime, that person is protected by a decision of the United States Supreme Court.

HEADLINE: Hospitals Learning The Not-Subtle Art Of Self-Promotion

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

 BODY:
Lenox Hill Hospital sends newcomers to the neighborhood a "health kit" that offers would-be patients "free diet and nutritional counseling" and a "free cosmetic surgery screening," along with a "free gift" for those who fill out an enclosed card. (O.K., it's a refrigerator magnet.)
Last summer New York Downtown Hospital offered tourists coupons good for $25 off on a visit to its emergency room. And Elmhurst Hospital Center has hosted tax seminars, classes in English as a second language, even a community dance to coax prospective customers. 
 Under intense new pressure to compete for patients, New York area hospitals have jumped into the business of wooing patients. In the last year to 18 months, hospital administrators say, most local institutions have begun advertising either for the first time or more aggressively than ever before. Many have hired consultants, and some are considering celebrity spokesmen and women.
Hospitals have begun offering prospective customers everything from free key chains to new high-tech services and amenities such as guest accommodations for family members. One even promises superior food, replacing lime gelatin and cottage cheese with low-sodium Chinese food.
Until recently, hospitals generally disdained all but the most discreet marketing efforts -- a lecture series, perhaps, or a health fair -- and most institutions simply waited for referrals from staff physicians.
But with managed care gaining ground and the demand for hospital beds steadily declining, both because of medical advances and fixed reimbursements that encourage shorter stays, hospitals are facing dim prospects. Many experts believe that one in five hospitals in the region will be out of business by the end of the decade. So the competition to stay alive is intense.
"It's insane," said Carol Hauptman, director of public relations at North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College in Manhasset, L.I., which she said is reluctantly following suit, starting its first major marketing campaign in the coming weeks. "Every five minutes," she said, "we hear another hospital touting another medical program, some of which are not exactly in-depth medical programs at institutions that are not exactly world-renowned, along with the renowned ones, too."
Even New York City's public hospitals recently entered the fray, with a plan for an initial outlay of $1 million on marketing to hold on to Medicaid patients courted by health maintenance organizations aligned with private hospitals.
 
'The Wild West'
 "It's going to be the Wild West for the next few years," said Dr. Bruce Siegel, president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs the city's 11 public hospitals.
Yet even as the competition mounts, local hospital administrators seem torn about what they are doing: How far can the definition of 'public health education' be stretched to apply to sophisticated advertising campaigns? And how far should hospitals go to compete without compromising their central mission of healing the sick?
"It's diverting millions of dollars from the bedside," Dr. Philip Lanzkowski, acting medical director of Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, said of the current marketing blitz. "I'm not sure about how ethical it is do to that. This is not big business in the sense that we're G.E., and I'm personally very opposed."
Most hospital administrators declined to say how much they are spending on these new efforts, Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said most medical centers still only spend a tiny percentage of their budgets on traditional advertising and marketing -- a maximum of $2 million to $3 million a year. But with the entire definition of what constitutes hospital marketing in flux, he said that dollar amount significantly understates the money being spent to make hospitals more competitive.
And administrators are also debating which ones will prove effective.
The frenzy in the New York area comes about three years after the hospital wars first flared in the rest of the country, because doctors in the Northeast in general and New York in particular have been slow to accept managed care. And some marketing experts say strategies popular in New York, such as direct mail and heavy advertising, have already failed elsewhere. Administrators of several West Coast hospitals said they consider most direct appeals to consumers a waste of money because it is health maintenance organizations, and not individual patients, that ultimately make most decisions about what hospitals to patronize.
"What happens when you spend all of your money promoting cardiovascular doctors and then managed care companies say, 'You may have a big name, but we're not using you,' " says Dr. Paul Keckley, a Nashville-based marketing consultant to hospitals across the country. "Everything will depend on who gets results at the lowest cost."
Meanwhile, local hospitals are simultaneously trying a variety of approaches to see what works.
Small community hospitals, which are the most vulnerable in the industry shakedown, are particularly busy adding services they hope will distinguish them from the pack.
Last year, St. Agnes Hospital in White Plains opened a Beneath the Sea Hyperbaric Medical Center. The center is staffed by "experienced scuba divers," according to a hospital brochure, and is equipped with a hyperbaric chamber to treat divers with the bends and other diving-related maladies. Currently, the hospital is building a guest house for family members of patients receiving bone marrow transplants.
But larger institutions, too, are specializing.
"In the end, not all of us are going to do the same kind of procedures," said Dr. Benjamin K. Chu, vice president for clinical affairs at New York University Medical Center. "In the end, how many of us are going to be able to do state-of-the-art cancer surgery or cardiovascular surgery?"
And more hospitals are using extensive marketing surveys and focus groups to find untapped corners of a shrinking market.
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center found that many people did not use its services because they did not want to travel to Washington Heights, the upper Manhattan neighborhood where the hospital is located. So last month, it opened a medical center on the Upper East Side, "to capture people who didn't want to come to Washington Heights for their first visit," said Richard Kearns, executive vice president for external relations.
Englewood Hospital and Medical Center in New Jersey built what it calls an exact replica of a Japanese health center after research showed gaps in the service provided the area's 200,000 Japanese-born residents.
For the center, the hospital imported design plans, medical equipment and hired an all-Japanese staff, even stocking it with kimono-style robes and videos of Japanese cartoons for the children.
Under an expanded definition of what constitutes marketing, some New York administrators also said that cost-cutting measures suddenly qualify as smart marketing that makes them more attractive to the ultimate consumer, the managed care company.
Both small and large institutions are affiliating madly, with the smaller hospitals able to offer H.M.O.'s a wider range of services, and the major centers tapping new sources of patient referrals.
Many are also diversifying on their own, opening primary care centers and nursing homes, hoping to provide the "cradle to grave" service that managed care companies favor.
"We're doing a lot of things to position ourselves strategically and operationally," said Barry Freeman, director of Mount Sinai Medical Center, which has links to 13 other hospitals and four nursing homes.
At the same time, Mount Sinai is also using more old-fashioned pitches for name recognition, such as one television ad in which a nurse puts fresh sheets on the hospital bed in a sunny, flower-filled corner room with two commanding views of the New York skyline.
Irma Damhuis, vice president of public affairs and marketing for Mount Sinai, said, "the message is slightly heightened at this point, in part in reaction to the clutter that's out there."
In other examples of current advertising, White Plains Medical Center in Westchester County is running magazine ads that say, "In its search for an ally in the fight against cancer, Johns Hopkins' choice was obvious: White Plains Medical Center."
On the radio, the mother of a child with asthma says using Beth Israel Medical Center's Physician Referral Service is "the smartest move I ever made."
Even Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore has been advertising in New York, with radio ads and small announcements in the Playbill programs passed out to theatergoers.
"But I'd say right now we're somewhat schizophrenic in our approach," said Dr. Toby Gordon, vice president for planning and marketing at Johns Hopkins. "We have invested in some marketing but we haven't fully committed, and with everything happening in health care we're probably going to have schizophrenia for another year."
Among the regional hospitals that have already committed to a single marketing strategy for example, is Danbury Hospital in Connecticut, a hospital that retooled its marketing strategy within the last year.
"I could advertise until I was blue in the face, but if I'm not that managed-care company's panel, then I'm wasting my time," said C. D. Peterson, vice president of planning and marketing at the hospital.
Cost-cutting pitches to H.M.O.'s are probably the most controversial marketing plan of all, because of questions about how economies can compromise the quality of patient care.
 
Cost-Effectiveness
 Mr. Peterson, who insisted that cost-trimming measures at Danbury had actually increased patient satisfaction, said that in an effort to cut the expense of specific medical procedures, the hospital had, for example, reduced the number of available hip replacement prostheses from 9 to 3. Each required specialized training for employees, he said.
After reviews showed that the bulk of one large local employer's health care dollars were being spent on drug treatment for its employees' adolescent children, the hospital developed a shorter-term inpatient treatment program, combined with outpatient services.
Currently, he said, the hospital is working on a more cost-effective way to treat those who suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome. The condition, a repetitive stress injury caused by repeated finger, hand, and wrist motions such as those used in computer typing, has become a leading cause of workplace disability.
Mr. Peterson said hospital officials asked managed care executives, "If we could come up with a product that pulled together doctors, physical therapists, and work site review, would that interest you?"
"The answer was yes, so now we're moving forward in the hope they'll send us many more people" who suffer from the condition, he said.
"That, in my estimation, is what marketing is today. That's the only way you're going to become a winner."

At 60 M.P.H., Arafat's Progress in Gaza Is a Blur

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GAZA, July 3

 BODY:
If it is the task of presidents to roar along the highway in motorcades, to blow kisses at flower-bearing children, to dedicate factories and to move from one photo opportunity to another, then Yasir Arafat was unquestionably a president today in the country of Palestine that he hopes is aborning.
Anyone remotely aware of the rituals and excesses of American-style Presidential trips would have instantly recognized the patterns in Mr. Arafat's journey across the Gaza Strip on his third day here. Yet it was also a bit like looking at an image in a fun-house mirror. Yes, it was familiar. But somehow it was not quite right. 
 For starters, presidents usually keep to schedules. As best as one can tell, the word "schedule" is not in Mr. Arafat's vocabulary.
Presidents, at least in the United States, usually do not zoom along the road at 60 miles an hour, trucks and cars roaring behind in convoy, each with soldiers leaning out the window with rifles and pistols in the air and doing a good job of looking as though they are just waiting for someone to make their day. Usually, presidential security men do not ride in a stretch Mercedes with its license plates reversed, to hide the fact that the plates are Israeli and the car quite possibly stolen.
Still, the recognizable trappings and symbolism of high office were all there. Mr. Arafat has carefully touched important political bases -- visiting refugee camps as a reminder that the issue of Palestinian refugees is alive, talking with people crippled in the anti-Israeli uprising, touring prison cells where Israel had held Palestinians and meeting with Arabs holding Israeli citizenship.
A highlight today for the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization was a visit to a new factory that processes citrus fruit into juice. Financed by Italy and the United Nations Development Program, the plant exemplified the importance of "reconstruction and development" for impoverished Gaza, Mr. Arafat said.
His was a vintage presidential tour for the electronic age, down to the shoving, swearing mass of cameras and pens that surged through the factory with him. If inane questions and answers are also a part of being president, then Mr. Arafat has arrived.
"Do you like orange juice?" someone asked.
"Yes, I like it," he replied.
And it was on the record.
 
Glad-Handing Is Out
 What Mr. Arafat has not done, out of security fears, is to wade into crowds. For many Gazans who lined the roads waiting to glimpse him as he passed by standing in his open-roofed car, the most they saw in the last three days was a blur of a checkered headscarf under which presumably stood the short P.L.O. leader.
No one seemed to expect him to leap out of his car, Gorbachev style, to show the common touch, and so one cannot really say that people were disappointed. But while excited, many also were not ecstatic over having merely seen him. As soon as the motorcade passed, Gazans in most places lost little time going about their business.
 
Above It All
 On Tuesday, assuming all goes according to ever-shifting plan, Mr. Arafat will fly over Israel. It is difficult to overstate how implausible that sentence would have sounded not many months ago.
Aides say he would take a helicopter ride on Tuesday morning from Gaza to Jericho, to see the other sphere of the Palestinian self-rule that has been in effect for two months. The only way to do that is to cross Israeli air space, maybe even pass over Jerusalem, the forbidden city to the P.L.O. leader for now.
Together, Israeli and Palestinian security officials have been working out the delicate logistics of the Jericho trip, which should be Mr. Arafat's last major event before he leaves for Paris. Attempts by Israeli settlers this weekend to block the roads to Jericho reinforced the conclusion that taking a car to the West Bank town is a bad idea.
The journey to Jericho has lengthened Mr. Arafat's expected stay by a day. One reason, explained Nabil Shaath, a close adviser, is that Egyptian helicopters have yet to arrive and flight procedures must be arranged.
Why not use one of several helicopters that the P.L.O. itself has?
"They need a lot of overhaul," Mr. Shaath said.
 
The Stones Fly Again
 An important element of the self-rule deal is that the 5,000 Israeli settlers in Gaza are to stay where they are, their fate to be negotiated further down the peace road.
The potential for friction with Gaza's roughly 800,000 Palestinians was underlined on Friday only minutes before Mr. Arafat's arrival at an entrance to Gush Qatif, the main bloc of settlements along the coast. There, under their army's protection, the Israelis insisted on flying flags of their country next to Palestinian flags planted along the Arafat motorcade route from the Egyptian border. Indeed, unless he was not looking, the P.L.O. chairman could not have missed the Israeli banners as he passed.
At one point, a bearded settler driving out of Gush Qatif became enraged when he saw the Palestinian flags and tried to yank one down. Immediately, stones started flying at him from a group of angry Palestinians who were watching.
Armed Israeli soldiers posted at the Gush Qatif were models of restraint. All they needed was for one of them to shoot a rock-throwing Palestinian with Mr. Arafat on his way. In no time, they hustled the settler into his car and whisked him away. The stoning stopped.
 
Goodbye and God Bless
 It has been noted here that the P.L.O. leader came without his wife of the last four years, Suha Tawil. Mrs. Arafat says that the suddenness of the trip, announced hastily only four days ago, had caught her unwares, along with the rest of the world.
"To live with Arafat means to live with many secrets," the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot quoted her today as saying in Cairo. "He doesn't involve me. He tells me when necessary. When he told me he was leaving, I only said three words, God bless you."

HEADLINE: Clinton Trip to Stress European Unity Hopes

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
President Clinton heads to Europe on Tuesday for the third time this year to begin a weeklong tour that advisers hope can restore some shine to his foreign-policy credentials.
The main occasion for the trip is the annual meeting of the Group of Seven economic powers, which will open on Friday in Naples, Italy. But Mr. Clinton has framed that stop with visits to Latvia, Poland and Germany to show he is a champion of efforts to forge a truly integrated Europe. 
 From a celebration in Riga, Latvia, of the Baltic countries' hard-won independence to a ceremony in Berlin marking the end of the American military's presence, Mr. Clinton will proceed along stepping stones chosen as reminders of what the cold war's passing has brought and may yet promise.
With his stops in Riga, Warsaw, Naples, Bonn and finally Berlin, Mr. Clinton clearly hopes to retouch his portrait so he is given more credit for his efforts to rebind a recently divided Europe in ways that would make it more prosperous and more secure.
 
Outline of Clinton's Theme
 In an interview last week with a German reporter, Mr. Clinton sketched out what he said would be his theme as he becomes the first American President to visit a Baltic country and the first to set foot in Germany since the collapse of the Berlin wall.
"My message will be that we've torn down the walls, but now we have to build the bridges," the President said. "We have to unite Europe, and we have to move forward on security issues, on economic issues, to make a better world."
Mr. Clinton's advisers have made clear that they intend to spend the week trying to redress what they regard as an injustice -- that Americans' attention to trouble spots like Rwanda and Haiti has taken attention from policy successes central to the transformation of Europe.
Nonetheless, the President will also have to contend on this trip with problems that have dogged him since his foreign debut, including the war in Bosnia, tensions with North Korea over nuclear weapons and the plunging value of the American dollar.
The White House has thrown much of its energy for the last week into planning what promises to be a complicated journey. When Mr. Clinton visited Europe last month for the D-Day commemoration, he acted mostly as commentator and spectator; this week he is to hold what may in some cases be rancorous talks with at least 13 heads of state, including President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.
Mr. Clinton will fly from Washington on Tuesday night directly to Riga, the Latvian capital, where he is to speak on Wednesday in Freedom Square to a crowd swollen by visitors from the neighboring Baltic countries of Lithuania and Estonia.
Now that Russian troops have withdrawn from Lithuania and are scheduled to be out of Latvia by the end of August, the President's visit is intended in large part to celebrate an end to five decades of occupation that the United States never recognized.
 
Issue of Estonia Pullout
 Russia has not yet agreed to terms for the pullout of its forces from Estonia, however. After meeting with Estonia's President, aides say, Mr. Clinton intends to tell Mr. Yeltsin in Naples that it is essential that Russia abide by its promise to withdraw all of its troops from the three Baltic countries by Aug. 31.
In Warsaw, where he is to arrive Wednesday night, Mr. Clinton hopes to reassure Poland and the leaders of other Eastern European countries that the United States does not regard them as falling under some new Russian sphere of influence, even though Washington and its allies are not yet ready to include them in NATO.
Mr. Clinton's speech before the Polish Parliament on that issue was conceived by his advisers as the main one of his European trip. Administration officials said last week that they were determined that he convey to the former Communists who have gained in power in Poland that the road to prosperity and security still leads westward.
Mr. Clinton proceeds later on Thursday to Naples, where he will hold a series of meetings including his first encounter with Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama of Japan.
 
Precarious Situation in Japan
 Mr. Murayama has just become Japan's first Socialist Party leader in 46 years, and his position at home remains so uncertain that Mr. Clinton made clear in an interview on Friday with a Japanese reporter that he saw little hope for quick progress in trade talks between the two countries, saying of the confused situation in Tokyo, "Nothing is stable forever."
Mr. Clinton's meeting with Mr. Yeltsin comes on Sunday, when the Russian President joins political discussions for the first time among the Group of Seven. That big meeting is likely to produce a statement endorsing a detailed proposal for peace in Bosnia due to be issued on Tuesday by the four-nation Contact Group. But the session could expose more frictions over North Korea's nuclear program, with Russia seeking a bigger role in the search for a solution.
The President's final stop, in Germany, was planned in part to soothe any hurt feelings left by the exclusion of German officials from the 50th-anniversary celebration of the Allied landing in the Normandy. But advisers say a main theme of his discussions in Bonn next Monday will be that Germany, a reluctant player since World War II, should now take a more active role in international affairs, assuming burdens befitting its size and power.
On Tuesday, July 12, the last day of his trip, Mr. Clinton will seek in an address at the Brandenburg Gate to recapture the spell cast 32 years ago by his political idol, John F. Kennedy, who spoke to 150,000 Berliners at the height of the cold war.
Mr. Clinton described that speech last week as "one of the formative political images of my childhood." But the final image of his trip will send a very different signal as he takes part in the deactivation of the Berlin Brigade, formed in 1961 at the height of the Berlin wall crisis. Its departure this summer will bring an end to an American military presence in Berlin that has been constant since 1945.

HEADLINE: Haiti Invasion Not Imminent, Envoy Says

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
Amid mounting speculation that the United States is moving closer to an invasion of Haiti to oust its military rulers, William H. Gray 3d, the Clinton Administration's special envoy on Haiti, said today that an invasion was not imminent, but that the United States was prepared to take action to protect the thousands of Americans there.
In an interview on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," Mr. Gray said that the fate of Haiti was of "vital interest to the United States, but added, "The United States is not contemplating an imminent invasion of Haiti." 
 While stressing that sanctions must be given time to work as the Administration tries to restore the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power, he repeated President Clinton's warnings that "we don't rule out any option, including the military option."
Other senior officials said that the huge flow of Haitians fleeing the country by boat in recent days had dramatically illustrated the shortcomings of the current policy.
 
'A Terrific Mistake'
 In five hours of meetings on Friday, Mr. Clinton and his top national security advisers discussed whether the Administration should speed up its planning for a military invasion, senior officials said. As Mr. Gray suggested today, however, the officials added that a decision about whether to invade remained weeks or even months away.
Other officials said that Mr. Clinton could decide at any moment to order an invasion and that such a decision would be made both quickly and secretly.
Speaking on the same program, Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, said that although the Pentagon opposed military intervention, "within the State Department and the White House they are clearly making plans toward an invasion." He added, "I think it would be a terrific mistake."
A number of senior officials believe that the refugee problem should not be used as the basis for an invasion to oust the military and restore Father Aristide, who was overthrown in September 1991, to power.
Indeed, Mr. Gray today laid out a different justification for an invasion: the protection of American citizens still living in Haiti.
 
'Great Concern' Noted
 "The President has a responsibility to protect American lives, and we have an embassy there with staff, and in light of the escalating human rights violations and the repression, which is really the driving force behind these refugees' leaving, there is great concern that we must be prepared to protect American citizens," he said.
He added, "The President and his advisers are looking at all potential options as we go through the process of applying economic and diplomatic sanctions."
A number of lawmakers have told the White House not to undertake any military action within two months of the November midterm elections. In addition, Mr. Clinton will be host at a summit meeting of Latin American leaders in Miami in December, and White House officials said they did not want the event to become a post-mortem for a Haiti invasion.
If those constraints hold and the Administration wants to take military action, Mr. Clinton has to decide whether it would be better to invade before Labor Day or after Christmas.
For the moment, policy makers are focused on persuading other countries to receive Haitians fleeing by boat and on moving faster to prepare other processing centers. The Administration has also intensified discussions with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to help find ways to resettle Haitians.
Mr. Gray took exception to criticism from Capitol Hill that economic sanctions, although well intended, were causing such hardship that they were forcing poor Haitians to flee. Instead, he blamed Haiti's military dictatorship, saying, "If you want to stop the outflow of refugees, you must instill democracy."
The rush of Haitians has quickened since June 16, when Mr. Clinton reversed his policy to immediately return Haitians fleeing by boat and the United States began interviewing refugees on ships. Mr. Gray, who has argued strongly for a more permissive refugee policy that allowed more Haitians to make their case for refugee status, did not say whether the new policy had caused the recent exodus.
About 7,000 Haitians have fled Haiti in the last two weeks, severely straining Coast Guard rescue missions. The refugees are taken either to a ship off the coast of Jamaica or to the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they can make formal applications for asylum. Another refugee-processing center is to be set up in the Turks and Caicos Islands.
 
Radio Plan Stalled
 An American plan to set up a radio station to broadcast anti-military programs to Haiti has been stalled because Father Aristide has refused to use it to call on Haitians to stay home, senior officials said.
Father Aristide must approve the radio station, and Administration officials are concerned that he could use it to repeat his depiction of Haiti as "a house on fire" from which everyone who can should flee.
Mr. Gray did not respond directly to questions about how many Haitians he expected to leave or how many the United States would accept.
He also declined to say whether there was a deadline for the sanctions to work before the United States decided to invade.

HEADLINE: In World Cup, Business Just Sees Net

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
More than halfway through the World Cup, here is the inescapable fact: you can't escape the World Cup.
Television ratings are perhaps double what ABC and ESPN expected, and greater than what tennis from Wimbledon or the United States Open Golf Championship has drawn. And who would have thought that the biggest sports event of the summer so far would be today's match between the United States and Brazil at 3:30 P.M.? 
 Canon, Coca-Cola, Mastercard, Snickers and other sponsors are happily hawking their image and their soccer connection to global audiences. Licensed tchotchkes are everywhere.
Hotels are generally drawing more tourists than they would in early summer, even if World Cup organizers may have overestimated the number of soccer-in-their-blood visitors to the United States and how much they would spend.
"It's a net 100,000 more bookings than we would have had anyway," said Dan Wheedock, the president and chief executive of ITT Sheraton, which has 53 hotels in the nine World Cup host cities.
 
 
'One Long Super Bowl Party'
 Carol Gifford, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Hilton and Towers, said, "It's been like one long Super Bowl party." Chicago had its fifth and last World Cup game on Saturday.
What must be understood about the business of this World Cup is that it cannot be compared with previous World Cups in the United States, because this is the first.
The average ABC rating for World Cup games has been a 4.8, including a best-ever American soccer rating of 6.8 for United States-Romania. (Each rating point is equal to 942,000 households.)
ESPN is averaging a 2.1 rating (or 1.3 million of the households that receive the cable channel) for 19 live telecasts. At Univision, home to the Spanish announcer Andres Cantor's 10-second "Goooooaaaaaaalllllll" calls, the network has averaged 12.3 ratings for 19 live games (with each point equal to 65,200 households), peaking with a 16.5 rating for Norway-Mexico. Mr. Cantor has turned into a cult figure worthy of bookings this week with Regis and Kathie Lee, and then with David Letterman.
 Sponsors appear pleased with their World Cup links, which cost five companies $20 million each. Yet there have been bumps along the way.
McDonald's pushed "The Flintstones" movie in a domestic marketing blitz, rather than making the same commitment to the World Cup. Mastercard and Sprint battled in court over who had credit card rights. Mastercard won. Anheuser-Busch nearly popped its pop-tops because of an early threat to ban beer sales at the World Cup stadiums. And perhaps, some marketers said, the World Cup did not push itself early and often enough.
"Leading up to World Cup, there were serious questions about the value they were getting because there was so little hyping of the World Cup," said Steve Disson of D & F Consulting, a Washington marketing firm that represents McDonald's. He said McDonald's chose to make a bigger impact internationally, where most of the chain's growth exists. Domestically, the choice was between soccer's feet and Fred Flintstone's feet-propelled car. "Could they have done more in the U.S.? Yes, but that wasn't their goal," he said.
 
 
Different Marketing Goals
 Most sponsors, and companies paying less to be marketing partners, like American Airlines, have various goals. Snickers is hawking youth soccer. General Motors is marketing GMC trucks to soccer fans in the United States, Chevrolet in Latin America and Opel in Asia and Europe. Canon simply wants broader global exposure of its name.
"It's the most popular event in the world, and you wouldn't sponsor the World Cup if it were just a domestic event," said Dave Farr, senior vice president and general manager of Canon U.S.A.
There is no way to quantify the effect that the spending, as with any sports sponsorship, has had on sales or brand exposure. And although the World Cup's effect on American television ratings is puny compared with that of the Olympics, the World Cup has an edge that makes sponsors happily wacky: advertising boards are allowed to adorn every inch of the perimeter of the World Cup stadiums, allowing for regular television exposure of the sponsors' names.
The sponsors hardly seem miffed by ABC's and ESPN's decisions to air the games continuously, rather than interrupt for commercials, except at halftime and after the game. To compensate for no spots during the game, the logos of each of the five sponsors alternates with the running time and score in a box in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. Each sponsor gets nearly 18 minutes each.
 "We've received a number of complimentary calls from viewers thanking us for buying telecasts without commercial interruptions," said Charles Fruit, vice president and media director of Coca-Cola. Mr. Fruit added that other sports might adopt the sponsored clock to replace annoyances like leaderboards, trivia quizzes or plays of the game, which now bear sponsorship.
Mary Ellen Dougherty, a spokeswoman for Snickers, said there was no way to quantify whether viewers were paying less attention to the 30-second commercials that follow the first or second halves because those were the only times the viewers could take breaks after uninterrupted action. "But we're satisfied," she said.
Time Warner Sports Merchandising, the licensing agent for World Cup merchandise, also sounds satisfied, expecting to sell $1 billion in goods worldwide, including $350 million in the United States. "We're doing very well, but we haven't received final numbers," said Ralph Irizarry, a vice president. "Of course, there will probably be some companies that may not have met their internal goals."
 
 
'The Euphoria Hasn't Built'
 One of those was Logo 7, the Indianapolis-based maker of athletic apparel. Tom Shine, the company's president, said: "Retail wasn't what we hoped for. I keep hearing it's not as strong as others had hoped for, too. The euphoria hasn't built. But we're doing much better at the nine sites, which is where we're getting 70 percent of our business."
The luck of the World Cup draw determined which teams played where in the first round. Thus, some of the nine host cities got teams with big followings, like Brazil, Italy and Ireland, and others had to fill stadiums with teams from South Korea, Morocco and Cameroon.
The impact for the New York-New Jersey area, estimated at $400 million previously, has been revised to $600 million because of the first-round Italy-Ireland game. The impact for Orlando, Fla., is estimated at $110 million, up from $80 million to $100 million.
Dallas sold out two of its first four games (drawing two games each with Bulgaria and South Korea, which are not noted for sending over thousands of cash-spending soccer revelers). But the city expects its quarterfinal game next Saturday, featuring the winners of the Brazil-United States and Ireland-Netherlands matches, to rustle up more interest than a Jerry Jones humility hoedown.
"The Brazilian Consul General told us to expect 15,000 Brazilians coming to Dallas, looking for tickets," said Jim Graham, co-chairman of the Dallas World Cup host committee.
World Cup organizers predicted a $4 billion economic impact before the draw last year. But Dallas does not expect its direct spending from the World Cup to reach much more than $125 million in direct spending. Boston will come close to reaching $255 million, without any Italian or Irish games. Jim Trecker, a World Cup spokesman, said the impact estimate had not been reduced.
 
 
Some Disappointments
 "The impact in Boston itself was not as dramatic as forecast," said Pat Moscaritolo, president of the Greater Boston Convention and Visitors Bureau. "Instead of the 70,000 visitors forecasted over the four weeks, we'll get maybe half that." Visitors have stayed for two days on average, not four or more, and many have stayed closer to Foxboro Stadium, 30 miles south of Boston.
But you look for business everywhere you can, especially when a team like Saudi Arabia, which did not expect to get far, lands in a second-round game in Dallas against Sweden.
"The C.E.O. of one of our local companies, Fina, got a call from a limousine in Saudi Arabia, asking for 20 of our most expensive tickets," Mr. Graham of the Dallas World Cup committee said. "And we got them."
The biggest problem for hotels serving World Cup visitors was a policy by the World Cup accommodations bureau to reserve huge blocks of rooms last year and then release them as they revised their visitor estimates downward. In some cases, the hotels did not have enough time to resell those rooms.
 
 
A Summer Boost for Hotels
 Yet for most hotels, World Cup business, even a disappointing amount of it, has bolstered the usually low summer occupancy rates. "We entered into a contract for 10,000 room nights," said Jim Howard, general manager of the Hyatt Regency in Dallas. The commitment kept getting reduced, "until last December when deposits showed it would be 1,000," he said.
The booking policy affected the two Sheratons in Manhattan and the Sheraton Meadowlands, near Giants Stadium, which had to hustle for business when the World Cup blocks faded. "Reservations weren't as strong as we expected," said Leora Halpern, a Sheraton spokeswoman, "but our occupancy was up 16 percent in July for the Meadowlands and 10 percent for the New York Sheraton."
Mr. Wheedock, the chief executive of Sheraton, said: "On balance, the news is good. Over all, we're only down in bookings 5 or 10 percent from what the original World Cup bookings were going to be."

HEADLINE: Fire Islanders Claim Victory On the Beach, and Over It

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FAIR HARBOR, L.I., July 1

 BODY:
Jack Gellatly held a fistful of sand as if it were gold dust and proudly showed off the vast expanse of beach that he and his neighbors created just a couple of months ago.
At this spot last summer during high tide, water would have been rushing around his ankles. Now there was a 200-foot-wide beach in front of him and the waves rolled gently up the bottom of a 14-foot dune. 
 "Isn't this beautiful?" said Mr. Gellatly, a Manhattan advertising executive who has summered here for 24 years. "People come up to me and say it's a miracle."
More than a year after storms ravaged this community on Fire Island, destroying 28 ocean-front homes and washing away much of the dune that sheltered the town from the waves, Mr. Gellatly and dozens of his neighbors have defied nature. They have taken their shoreline back from the Atlantic -- at least for now.
Usually such beach restoration projects are the domain of Federal and state agencies, but people in Fair Harbor and six other Fire Island communities have done it on their own, largely independently of government. Since October, they have pumped almost one million cubic yards of sand -- enough to fill Grand Central Terminal's main concourse twice -- onto their shores.
The state and Federal governments resisted undertaking such a project, questioning whether it made sense to support expensive beach homes with public money and arguing that nature should be allowed to take its course. Faced with such resistance, many Fire Islanders chose to forge ahead alone.
 
Vast Dredging Project
 One by one, the communities hired a company, Land Use Environmental Corporation in Baiting Hollow, L.I., to coordinate a vast offshore dredging project, and agreed to tax themselves about $8 million to pay for it. With one exception, the incorporated village of Saltaire, they did this outside of any government entity, relying instead on special coastal erosion control tax districts they set up.
Now they face tax increases totaling roughly $3,000 a household, assessed over 1 to 15 years, varying in each community depending on the number of houses and the scope of the job. Still, organizers say there have been few complaints from homeowners, noting that the alternative would have been to watch property values steadily decline, the rental market dwindle and potentially lose a place they cherish.
Although such an approach has been employed in other parts of the country, it is relatively new to New York, coming amid widespread debate over how to balance the cost between coastal homeowners and the government for the protection of the state's fragile shoreline. And it suggests that coastal communities may bear a greater financial burden for such projects in the years to come.
"This shows that they are accepting the fact that government is not just going to bail them out," said William W. Daley, chief of coastal erosion management for the state's Department of Environmental Conservation. "They have to accept a larger and more direct role."
A few decades ago, the Fire Islanders would have expected the state to shoulder this task, and indeed, until the mid-1970's, the state did extensive beach replenishment projects here, providing hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of sand.
But in recent years, the state has been reluctant to help the island. While it soon may offer some assistance, Mr. Daley cautioned that the state would expect property owners to share in the cost of that project as well.
Fire Island is a fragile 32-mile-long barrier beach, a spit of sand a few thousand feet wide that sits across the Great South Bay from Long Island's south shore, its dunes blocking the mainland from the Atlantic. It is a place without cars, mostly Federal wilderness area, with the remainder state and local parks and 17 small summer colonies totaling about 3,500 homes, ranging from the rustic to the opulent.
In December 1992 and March 1993, two northeasters buffeted the island, drastically changing its landscape. Some houses were destroyed, and many others, which once sat snugly atop dunes, were left perched on their posts, as high as 20 feet above the beach, with the water running under them at high tide.
Coastal engineers said that another serious storm could create breaches in the island that would allow the Atlantic to flow through to the South Bay, and there were dire predictions about the island's future.
The state reacted by commissioning a study, which islanders knew meant there would be no action for months. And Islip and Brookhaven, the towns in Suffolk County whose jurisdictions include Fire Island, were too financially strapped to offer assistance to summer residents who are only a fraction of their constituency.
"We had no choice," said Mr. Gellatly, who led the effort in Fair Harbor. "Either we could do nothing and watch a large part of what we love get washed away, or we could try to save it."
 
More Modest Projects
 Eventually Saltaire, Fair Harbor, Dunewood, Seaview, Ocean Bay Park, Point O'Woods and Fire Island Pines elected to dredge, while other communities, which had less damage or lacked the resources, chose more modest projects, building dunes from the remaining sand on their beaches. Together, the seven communities amounted to about two-thirds of the island's households and covered about four miles of shoreline.
The work was completed last week, with the final beach at Fire Island Pines.
Although this was the largest dune reconstruction and beach replenishment program on Fire Island in years, Chuck Bowman, the project manager and president of Land Use Environmental, said it did not present a great technical challenge. "This would be a normal project for the Army Corps of Engineers," he said.
The main difficulty was getting clearance from a host of local, state and Federal agencies, and doing it quickly. It required easily more than 100 permits, he said.
As an incorporated village, Saltaire was able to tax itself to finance the project, but it was more complicated for other communities. Several established erosion districts, and others that already had them needed to get approval from the local town governments of Islip and Brookhaven for the tax. To raise the money for the project, the towns had to borrow money on behalf of the district through bond sales, and then the districts would repay it in taxes.
Mr. Gellatly recalled an Islip town meeting to discuss Fair Harbor's bond proposal in which dozens of angry summer residents turned out to demand that hesitant town officials allow the plan. "We had to convince them that we wanted to tax ourselves," he said.
 
'A Gentle 1-by-5 Slope'
 On Wednesday, Mr. Bowman surveyed the work of a bulldozer that was putting the finishing touches on a new dune at Fire Island Pines, pushing sand closer to the homes and underneath their decks.
"Perfect," Mr. Bowman said, noting its "soft curve" and "gentle 1-and-5 slope," meaning one foot in height for every five in width. "It's not too steep for playing frisbee, and the waves will run up gently rather than smashing against it," he explained.
The sand is coarse and brown, noticeably different from the fine white variety there before. It was specially selected for all of the beaches, because it is more resistant to wind, wave and storm.
Dredges scooped up the sand from a site two and a half miles offshore, and then it was pumped through a pipeline to the beach. While usually the sand came gushing out onto already existing dune, Mr. Bowman noted one instance, in Ocean Bay Park, where there was no beach, and the land literally emerged from the water.
Cathy Goldman, a homeowner in Dunewood, said she sat on a friend's deck when they did her community's beach and watched late into the night. "All of a sudden there were huge mounds of sand," she said. "It was unbelievable."
Her husband, Don, agreed. "It took just four days to rebuild it, and suddenly we were not at the mercy of nature," he said.
But some critics oppose this work.
Dery Bennett, executive director of the American Littoral Society, a coastal environmental group, said: "I prefer to think of this as a real-estate investment rather than beach replenishment. Those residents with shore-front property want to hold the line rather than let the beach move back naturally."
While he favored having Fire Islanders foot the bill for such work, he warned that it was likely to lead to future government subsidies, such as flood insurance and more extensive restoration projects. He also questioned whether it was a fair solution, as poorer or smaller shore-front communities might not be able to afford it.
And ultimately, he noted, even the wealthiest communities may have difficulty continuing to finance it. "I think that anything that perpetuates the idea that you can make nature stand still at the ocean front is misleading," he said.
Fire Islanders acknowledge that this effort is only a temporary solution that will last only a few years at best, if there are no severe storms. Ultimately, to avoid future damage, the government must embark upon a larger program for much of the South Shore of Long Island, they say.
Although no project will be permanent, they contend that the cost of maintaining Fire Island is surpassed by the economic and ecological benefits it provides the region.
And their desire to save the beach comes from more than just a fear of declining property values.
"This is a place that means more to me than anywhere else," Mr. Gellatly said. "People say you shouldn't build on a barrier beach, and they're right. The problem is these communities have been here 100 years."
"And once you've been here," he explained, "you can't help falling in love with it."

HEADLINE: Five California Republicans Stalling Bill to Preserve Desert

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
The biggest land conservation act in more than a decade has stalled in the House, as five California Republicans whose districts include parts of the eight million acres that would be designated as wilderness fight a rear-guard action.
The five concede that the bill will eventually be passed, but they have promised to prolong a debate marked both by deep philosophical differences and unusually vituperative exchanges on the House floor. 
 The measure, the California Desert Protection Act, would create 74 wilderness areas and 3 new national parks, largely in the state's arid southeast corner. The protected area, which would include Death Valley and the 1.2 million acres of the East Mojave National Scenic Area, would put substantial tracts of the fragile desert off-limits to miners, new livestock grazing and, most controversially, hunters.
The proposal is the biggest land conservation measure since the 1980 Alaska Lands Act, which protected 103.4 million acres from development. The desert region has the world's largest forest of cactus-like Joshua trees, the only known dinosaur tracks in California and more than 760 species of wildlife, including the endangered desert tortoise.
 
Backed by Administration
 The bill has the strong backing of the Clinton Administration, but that is part of its problem. The Republican opponents say the measure extends what they call the Administration's war on the West, even though it was conceived long before Bill Clinton became President.
Representative Jerry Lewis, one of the five Republicans, says elitists and environmental zealots who do not live in the desert want to protect it, while those who live there want to allow mining and other development to continue to maintain the economy. He says the East Mojave alone contains 14 rare-earth minerals that have enormous industrial potential.
The Mojave "has almost none of the elements that justify designation as a national park," Mr. Lewis said. "It has endless thousands of miles of roadways through it. There are transmission lines used by utility companies." In addition, a site designated for low-level radioactive waste is next-door.
It had long seemed that the Senate would pose the biggest hurdle to the bill. But now that California has sent two Democrats to the upper chamber, the Senate passed the bill in April. Most of the credit went to Senator Dianne Feinstein, who campaigned in 1992 on the issue and built compromises to have the bill passed.
 
Opposition Explains Tactics
 The five Republicans opposing the bill -- Mr. Lewis, Bill Thomas, Duncan Hunter, Al McCandless and Howard P. McKeon -- say they have had to use stalling tactics on the floor because the chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources, George Miller, a Democrat from the San Francisco area, rode roughshod over their concerns. They say they have been forced to address their concerns in the 45 amendments they have attached to the bill. Since discussion on the bill began on the House floor in May, only four amendments have been debated and voted on, with time-consuming roll-call votes, only to pass nearly unanimously. Members have debated the bill for almost eight hours and barely made a dent in the legislation.
For the most part, the Republicans simply repeated the same speeches on each amendment, raising Mr. Miller's ire and prompting bickering on both sides.
Finally, Mr. Miller went to the Rules Committee on June 20 and asked for a time limit on the debate, saying the Republicans were engaged in a "mischievous display of dilatory tactics." The time limit was denied.
Mr. Lewis says Mr. Miller then called him for the first time in the nine years that the measure has been considered to seek his help in speeding passage.
Mr. Lewis says he told his colleague that he wants a fair hearing for several amendments.
 
Compromises to Date
 Some compromises have already been reached or are on the table. The bill as introduced would have phased out grazing in 25 years; it now allows grazing at current levels in perpetuity in the Mojave and Death Valley parks. Unresolved questions include what level of law enforcement will be allowed and whether the armed forces can continue using established flight patterns over the area.
Opponents are especially eager to allow hunting to continue. A similar bill that passed the House in 1991 included an amendment, which passed 235 to 193, to allow hunting in the Mojave. But this year, a measure to allow hunting was defeated in the Natural Resources Committee by 25 to 17. Both sides say the hunting amendment remains a central element of contention.
The House bill in 1991 passed 297 to 136. The Senate bill passed in April by 69 to 29. Reminded that he did not have the votes to hold up passage of this bill, Mr. Lewis said, "We certainly don't, as of this moment." But, he added, he hopes the Republican amendments can influence the final bill when the House version is reconciled with the Senate version.
Both sides say work on the bill will resume after the Fourth of July recess with an eye toward getting the House version to conference by the mid-August recess. Pressure to act is increasing from Democrats, who see passage of the bill as important to Senator Feinstein's re-election, which in turn is central to the Democrats' maintaining their majority in the Senate.

HEADLINE: Investors Find 2d Quarter Better Than 1st, but Full of Traps for the Unwary

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Most everyone felt like a loser in the first quarter. Stock traders spent the last two months of the quarter in shock at what the Federal Reserve Board had wrought, raising interest rates for the first time in five years in February and then again in March.
After a spectacular rise in January, stocks plummeted. Issues in the Standard & Poor's 500 index lost value in the first quarter at an annual rate of more than 16 percent. 
 Then, in the second quarter, things changed. Traders became more Fed than the Fed, browbeating the Federal Reserve for acting too late against an inflation that is still not in evidence. The Fed replied with two more increases in short-term interest rates, and in the discount rate, to boot.
The surprising result: Traders over all started making money, if only a little. Stocks in the S.& P. 500 gained value in the second quarter at an annual rate of more than 5 percent.
 
More Issues Decline
 But if one thing is clear, it is that winners can become losers with shocking rapidity. The Fed, stock traders and the traders in bond, commodity and especially currency markets must contemplate a changed financial world. Because of modern high-speed technology, short-term investing means the next minute and long-term investing may mean this afternoon.
Of the 6,101 issues selling at $5 or more a share tracked by Media General Financial Services, 2,452 rose, while 3,388 declined in value during the second quarter. Two hundred sixty-one emerged unchanged.
On the nation's biggest exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, Glendale Federal Bank rose 90.9 percent to $10.50 a share from $5.50. It helped that Glendale, like most financial institutions, benefited from the Fed's repeated raising of interest rates -- in effect, a continuous marking up of its inventory. Late in the quarter, securities analysts also talked up Glendale as a possible takeover candidate.
A takeover also figured in the price appreciation of Nichols Institute's class A shares. On the American Stock Exchange, it rose 137.6 percent to $11.88 a share from $5, after Corning Inc. agreed to acquire Nichols, a clinical testing services company, for $325 million.
Griffith Consumers, whose stock symbol is FUEL, also rose at a triple-digit rate, in Nasdaq trading. The Maryland petroleum distributor was up 103.3 percent to $15.25 a share from $7.50. An acquisition of another petroleum concern last year helped expand the company.
Of the losers, which were more numerous than winners, the price drops were almost of the same magnitude.
On the Big Board, RMI Titanium had the biggest plunge in price -- 84.6 percent, to $2.50, from $16.25 a share. RMI, a producer of titanium metal products for the military and industry, helped bring about part of its drop. The company instituted a rights offering for shareholders to buy stock at $2 a share, when the market price was more than $9 a share.
USA Classic Inc. had an even steeper fall of 94 percent in Nasdaq trading, down to just 31 cents a share from $5.13 a share. The dive was not a complete surprise because USA Classic, a designer and seller of men's and women's clothes, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and was later delisted by Nasdaq during the quarter.
Wilshire Technologies, a financially troubled maker of disposable products for surgical and other use, foundered in the first quarter and its troubles continued in the second. Wilshire did not trade from mid-April to June. And only last Monday did the company file its annual report for the fiscal year ending Nov. 30, 1993.

HEADLINE: The City And Arts Team Up On Funds

BYLINE: By SHEILA RULE 

 BODY:
The approval of New York City's new budget has kicked into motion an agreement between the city government and its cultural institutions that is intended to increase overall financing for the arts and encourage arts groups to raise more private money.
Under the agreement, announced in February by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, leaders in the city's art world offered to raise $10 million in private contributions if the Mayor restored the $4.2 million he wanted to cut from the arts budget. In addition, the city and state would have to match the pledge of private money with $5 million each. The city and state allocated the money in their new budgets, which were approved last month. 
 The funds budgeted for cultural programs were increased by $7.7 million, bringing the total to $93 million for the fiscal year that began on Friday, said Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson. Although the culture budget is just a small fraction of the total city budget of $31.6 billion, its importance is disproportionately greater, given the city's concentration of museums, galleries, dance groups and concerts. These are magnets for tourist dollars translating into thousands of jobs for New Yorkers, as well as tax revenues for the city and state.
 
'Culture Is Not Just Charity'
 "I hope this combination of private, city and state money will symbolize a heightened level of support for culture, by both the private and public sectors," said Wilbur L. Ross Jr., who participated in developing the plan as a co-chairman of the New-York Historical Society, a post he left in April. "Public officials seem now to understand that culture is not just charity but very much economic development."
The city provides financing for more than 400 cultural groups, including the 31 major institutions on city property (known collectively as the Cultural Institutions Group), and any group or artistic program would be eligible to apply for the matching grants for any new contributions.
A ceiling is to be set on the amount of money a single group may receive, and the larger institutions would have to show that the grants would be used to improve the public's access to the arts. Smaller groups could use their grants to pay the rent or other necessities.
"A cultural facility might want to stay open on Saturday afternoons for high school students to visit and couldn't afford to stay open without an extra $100,000," said Mr. Dyson, who was involved in negotiations with the city's cultural and arts establishment. "They would raise $50,000 from the private-sector contributions and the city and state would each give $25,000. We want new money to be raised."
Mr. Dyson caused a furor shortly after Mr. Giuliani's election when he suggested that the city might benefit more if it focused its cultural budget on the institutions that attracted tourists. In an interview last week, he said that the city's arts funds would be distributed according to a formula in which some 60 percent goes to members of the Cultural Institutions Group, which includes the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum and the New York Shakespeare Festival.
Some 20 percent goes to the other recipient arts groups in the city, he said, and another 20 percent to cultural institutions that had not previously received city money, including the Whitney Museum for American Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. In recent years, the major institutions traditionally received 85 percent of the arts funds and the other recipient groups got the remaining 15 percent.
The city's Cultural Affairs Department, whose head is Schuyler G. Chapin, is to oversee the matching-grants program in conjunction with its private sponsors.
"We are in discussions with the state arts council to put together a simple set of guidelines for organizations," Mr. Chapin said, "and as soon as we have all of that done we will be making a public announcement about the fact that this opportunity is available for institutions, and how people can apply. I hope this will be done in the next couple of weeks."

HEADLINE: Europe's Economy Looking Up, But Long-Term Worries Linger

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 3

 BODY:
Led by Germany, Western Europe is at last emerging from its first post-cold-war recession, but with its economic aspirations tempered and its policy makers still grappling with the momentous changes that have swept the Continent.
 So far the comeback has been driven primarily by increased exports to the United States, where the economy began picking up two years ago, and by the rapidly growing economies of Asia. European companies in crucial industries like automobiles are beginning to report higher sales. Inflation is largely under control. 
Assuming the nascent upturn continues, it would mark the end of a recession that cut short the euphoria that swept Western Europe after the collapse of Communism in the east and the reunification of Germany.
 Political and business leaders here are clearly hoping that a return to economic growth will give European nations a chance to turn their attention from domestic problems back to issues like strengthening the ties among the 12 members of the European Union and integrating the emerging capitalist democracies of Eastern Europe with the West.
 But European leaders also acknowledge that recovery, whatever its magnitude, will not carry away all of the region's woes.
 As President Clinton and the leaders of the world's six other leading industrialized nations -- Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy --gather for a summit meeting opening on Friday in Naples, they will confront a Europe that remains in the midst of economic upheaval.
 Sales and profits may be improving, but businesses continue to lay off workers, sending already high unemployment rates higher, sapping consumer confidence and keeping the political outlook unsettled for leaders in most countries.
 "The recovery is there, but it is still weak and insufficient," Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of France said in a television interview last week.
 The outlook has not been helped by the recent turmoil in the world's financial markets. The decline in the buying power of the dollar is hurting exports of goods to the United States from Germany and to a lesser extent France as well as Japan. Long-term interest rates have risen sharply this year in Germany, making mortgages and loans for business expansion more expensive.
 Governments have yet to devise a strategy for reducing unemployment and stimulating the creation of jobs, an area in which Europe badly trails the United States, without slashing a social welfare system that most Europeans consider a birthright.
 Though they are making progress, companies have yet to reverse a worldwide loss of market share and prove that European industry, in many cases overstaffed and slow-moving, can remain competitive.
 The single European market, once seen as the key to growth, has not lived up to its promise since the end of the cold war, and plans for a single currency have foundered. Although Germany is shifting its sights eastward, most other Western European nations are still trying to decide whether the emerging capitalist democracies of Eastern Europe are an economic opportunity or a threat.
 "We've reached a critical couple of years in Europe," said Suzy Symes, the director of the Europe program at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London.
 
Signs of a Rebound
 After seeing its economic output decline by 1.3 percent last year, Germany, traditionally Europe's economic engine, is beginning to hum along again. Its economy should grow by 1.8 percent this year and 2.6 percent next year, according to projections released on Thursday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Paris-based research group financed by the major industrial nations.
 "Growth will be modest, but it's much better than was expected only a few months ago," said Rainer Veit, head of the Germany department at Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt.
 After shrinking by 0.2 percent last year, the Western European economy is expected to grow 1.9 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 1995, according to the economic cooperation group. France, Italy and Spain, among others, are projected to resume growth this year, joining Britain, whose recovery is now in its second year.
 Signs of the improvement are apparent all over Western Europe. Fiat, Italy's largest private-sector company, said on Thursday that its sales were up 10 percent in the first four months of the year and that it expects to make a small profit for the full year after suffering its worst-ever loss in 1993. Cie. des Machines Bull, France's largest computer maker, said sales for the first five months of the year were up 14 percent.
 
German Inflation Reversing
 In Germany, the central bank, the Bundesbank, appears to have extinguished the inflationary pressures that arose from unification in 1990. The inflation rate, which was 3.9 percent last year, is projected to fall to 2.8 percent this year and 2.0 percent next year even as economic growth resumes.
 The Bundesbank, which has been cautiously reducing official interest rates despite a rise in long-term rates caused by the turmoil in the financial markets, is coming under increasing pressure from the United States to make further rate reductions to help strengthen the dollar.
 With the immediate strains of the recession ending, Governments and the European Union will have the opportunity to turn their attention to Europe's underlying economic problems, said economists, analysts and business executives. But it is unclear, they said, whether recovery will breed new cohesion and purpose among the Western European nations.
 
Deeper Problems Remain
 "The news is good, even though the economic data do not point conclusively to economic growth," Edgar S. Woolard, the chairman of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, said in a speech on Wednesday in Brussels. "At the same time there is a danger that many in the business and government sectors will sit back and expect cyclical economic recovery to solve deeper problems."
In Naples, the leaders of the Group of Seven nations will be able to point to the salutary effects of the agreement they completed late last year to liberalize world trade.
 But the United States and Japan will arrive with little hope of breaking the impasse over reducing Japan's trade surplus. And European industry, which depends heavily on exports, will be watching carefully to see whether the seven nations make a strong commitment to supporting the value of the dollar.
 "Whatever the benefits of the trade agreements signed by the major powers, nothing is possible in the long term unless we achieve true monetary equilibrium that avoids situations like the current scandalous undervaluation of the dollar," said Jean-Rene Fourtou, the chief executive of Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals company.
 The Group of Seven leaders will also discuss ways of creating jobs and reducing unemployment, which stands at 12.7 percent in France, 11.6 percent in Italy and 24 percent in Spain, and is expected to increase in Germany from 8.3 percent now to 10 percent by year-end.
 A distinguishing characteristic of the European recovery so far, in fact, is that it shows few signs of solving unemployment. Although economic recoveries typically do not create jobs in their early stages, this one seems unlikely to spur large-scale hiring even when fully established.
 That is largely because European industry, saddled with the costs of comprehensive social welfare benefits, is in the process of paring back employment in an effort to get its costs down and remain globally competitive.
 Britain, among other countries, will argue at the Group of Seven meeting that the best way to promote creating jobs is to reduce the laws that make it difficult for European companies to hire and fire workers.

HEADLINE: Officials in Panama Say They'll Accept 10,000 From Haiti

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PANAMA CITY, Panama, July 4

 BODY:
The Government agreed today to accept as many as 10,000 refugees fleeing the political crisis in Haiti.
The decision comes in response to a request by the United Nations, said Tomas Altamirano Duque, the Vice President-elect. The United States government has also asked Panama to help with the refugee crisis, but he did not say whether that was a factor in Panama's decision, or when Panama would start taking in refugees. It was not immediately known what screening procedures would be used. 
 The decision will take some of the heat off the United States, which has been inundated with asylum-seekers since it liberalized its policy on Haitian refugees last month.
About 10,000 Haitians have been intercepted by the United States Coast Guard in the last 11 days, including a record 2,628 by late today.
White House officials said Mr. Clinton personally requested Panama's help in a telephone conversation with President Guillermo Endara.
Panama has supported economic sanctions on Haiti and has backed the suspension of commercial flights to Haiti, and sought to stop the sale of goods to Haitian citizens in the free economic zone in Colon, Panama.
Mr. Altamirano Duque said the United Nations would cover the costs of feeding and caring for the refugees, who would be taken to San Jose Island on Panama's Pacific coast.

Refugee Drownings Reported
 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, July 4 (Reuters) -- More than 100 Haitians fleeing their homeland are believed to have drowned when their boat capsized, survivors said today.
 The survivors said they thought that between 100 and 150 people died when their overloaded craft overturned after leaving an area near the western town of St Marc. A similar number are thought to have survived, said two survivors at the the scene.
Although radio stations in Port-au-Prince reported the accident, there was no confirmation of the number of casualties. A Coast Guard spokeswoman in Miami said the Coast Guard had no details of the incident.

HEADLINE: Hevesi Rejects Compromise On Bond Sales

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Rejecting a compromise proposed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi recommended yesterday that the city temporarily retain two companies to act as financial advisers for two important New York City bond sales.
Mr. Hevesi also proposed that a panel of three to five independent financial experts be consulted on the issue, in which Mr. Hevesi has urged the hiring of two financial advisers, while Mr. Giuliani has advocated hiring just one company. 
 The dispute has evolved into a fight about more than just bonds. Last week Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson suggested that racial preference had been the basis of Mr. Hevesi's desire to retain P. G. Corbin & Company of Philadelphia, which is owned by a black woman.
But the issue became even more charged because Mr. Dyson, disputing Mr. Hevesi's contention that the cost would be the same whether there was one firm or two, said Mr. Hevesi "ought to know the difference between a bid and a watermelon." The comment drew angry complaints from a host of elected officials, who said that Mr. Dyson's comments were racially insensitive. Mr. Dyson later apologized for his remarks, saying he did not mean them as a racial slur.
 
Powers Rejects Use of a Panel
 Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers said yesterday that the administration would study Mr. Hevesi's proposal to use two financial advisers, but he rejected the idea of assembling a panel of outside financial experts.
"The device he's suggesting, a commission, abdicates the responsibility of elected officeholders," Mr. Powers said. "People are elected to make decisions, and not to appoint commissions."
Under the charter, the mayor and the comptroller jointly select financial advisers and underwriters for the city's bonds. Typically, the choice is handled by the staff of both officials, and the process seldom produces conflict. But this year, the selection has become a public and emotional issue between the Republican Mayor and the Democratic Comptroller.
Mr. Giuliani's office has maintained that the city needs just one bond company, Public Resources Advisory Group of New York. Mr. Hevesi, on the other hand, has argued that the city would be well served by having two advisers, and that the city should retain the second firm, P. G. Corbin. The two companies have been acting as advisers for the city since 1990.
The Mayor has maintained that it would cost the city hundreds of thousands of dollars to do business with the two companies, a contention Mr. Hevesi said was untrue.
As a compromise, Mr. Giuliani suggested on Saturday that the city use a single adviser for the two important New York City bond sales that must be completed within the next six weeks while putting off a final decision on whether to hire another. The sales include a refinancing of bonds that would save $225 million and keep the city's budget balanced.
But Mr. Hevesi, in a letter to the Mayor, said that accomplishing the two in such a short time "would tax the resources" of Public Resources and added that "there is a risk that these two critical financings would not be completed in the most cost effective manner available."
Mr. Hevesi recommended that he and Mr. Giuliani convene an outside panel of experts to review "the overall structure of the debt program, including financial advisers, the underwriters and the various counsel."
In an interview in The Bond Buyer, Mr. Dyson disputed a claim by Mr. Hevesi that the cost of financial advice would be the same whether one or two companies were retained. Mr. Dyson said each company had submitted a bid for a fixed fee, thereby making the cost of one half as expensive as two. "The Comptroller ought to know the difference between a bid and a watermelon," Mr. Dyson said.
 
Suggestions for a Panel
 Commenting on the events of the last week, Mr. Hevesi said that Mr. Dyson's remarks had made "reaching agreement on the substantive differences between our staffs more difficult and time consuming than either of us originally expected."
Mr. Hevesi suggested a number of names for an outside panel of financial experts. They included Harrison J. Goldin, the former City Comptroller; Eugene J. Keilin, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation; Sally Hernandez-Pinero, who served as Deputy Mayor for financial and economic development in the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins.
Also on the list are Raymond D. Horton, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission; Carol O'Cleireacain, who served as budget director under Mr. Dinkins; Richard D. Parsons, chairman and chief executive of the Dime Savings Banks of New York, who headed Mr. Giuliani's transition team; Heather L. Ruth, president of the Public Securities Association, and Barry F. Sullivan, chairman of the New York City Partnership and a former Deputy Mayor under Mr. Dinkins.
Mr. Hevesi, who was in England and Ireland yesterday for meetings related to the city's pension funds, said in a telephone interview that he believed his recommendation offered the best short-term solution to the impasse between him and the Mayor. And he recommended essentially extending the two companies' contracts for the fiscal year that ended June 30 until after the two bond transactions have been completed.
"The Mayor is proposing that we get past the immediate problem of two bond deals that have to be completed in the next month or so," Mr. Hevesi said. "They are complex deals, and we don't believe we should jeopardize any financing by having less than the total package of expertise that is now available."

HEADLINE: Crop Subsidies: Help and Headaches

SERIES: The Family Farm: A Year in the Field -- Third in a Series

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHAMPAIGN, Ill.

 BODY:
David Rothermel could have hardly asked for more from employees of the Federal Department of Agriculture when he dropped by the agency's county office on a nondescript cul-de-sac at the outskirts of this town last week.
Promptly, pleasantly, even sympathetically, they helped him through a stack of documents that would allow him to receive tens of thousands of dollars for growing corn this year. 
 Like many farmers, Mr. Rothermel praises the Government's efforts to become more helpful, without sounding grateful for its involvement. While state and Federal extension agents occasionally provide useful technical advice, Mr. Rothermel views many of his dealings with the myriad Government programs and regulations as a drain on the time he needs to spend on the 2,900 acres he has planted in corn and soybeans.
"The contract you get for the payments program is ridiculous," Mr. Rothermel said shortly before last week's meetings with the agency. "It basically says, 'This is what you get, unless we change it,' and there's lots of fine print."
The fastest growing area of regulation affecting farmers is the environment, but financial, employment, safety, marketing and transportation rules are also important and constantly changing.
"I never cease to be amazed at the number of regulations impacting these people," said Kay Shipman, who writes about such issues for the weekly newspaper of the Illinois chapter of the American Farm Bureau Federation, a trade group for more than four million farmers.
Some rules are hard to fathom and others hard to take seriously. Mr. Rothermel, who is 40, expressed wonder that a bone-dry patch of a soybean field can be classified as a wetland. And he spoke derisively of transportation regulations that he says require him to surprise himself with random drug tests to drive the semitrailer he uses to carry grain to market.
The Government program that means most to Mr. Rothermel and most other Midwestern farmers is the one that pays them billions of dollars a year to grow corn. The general belief among big grain farmers here is that the income support program -- which also covers wheat, rice, cotton and several smaller crops -- is a necessary evil to allow the United States to compete with more heavily subsidized foreign farmers in world markets.
"Individual farmers cannot go up against the treasuries of foreign countries," said Terry Francl, senior economist with the American Farm Bureau, which is based in Park Ridge, Ill.
But subsidies help keep less efficient farmers in business. That usually leads to overproduction of important crops, which depresses the long-term profitability of commercial farmers like Mr. Rothermel. It also keeps consumer prices low, which many farmers say is the Government's main objective.
The total subsidies for many farming sectors, including grain, have been declining sharply in recent years. Government payments for the major subsidized crops fell from a little less than $14 billion in 1987 to an estimated $5.5 billion last year, not including disaster payments, which are still being processed, stemming from last year's heavy rains in the Midwest and drought in the Southeast.
The subsidies remain large enough that the threat of losing them gives the Government leverage to influence what many farmers grow and the practices they use to grow it.
Here in the Corn Belt, the target price the Government sets for corn, the estimated yields on which it bases support payments and the amount of acreage it allows farmers to put into the corn program heavily influence how much land farmers plant in corn versus beans or other crops. And the carrot of the subsidies is used to get farmers to conform to wetlands preservation and soil conservation rules, whether they like them or not.
 
 
Subsidies Control Farmers
 "The subsidies are what give the Government control over us," Mr. Rothermel said. "Most farmers around here do not like the Government programs, but you push the pencil and then go along with what brings in the most money."
Like many large farmers, Mr. Rothermel's acreage consists of a number of farms, some of which he owns, on his own and in partnership, while others are rented. That gives him some flexibility in arranging which ones will be in the Government programs and which will not, but it also offers complicated choices with significant financial consequences.
Farms like Mr. Rothermel's, which gross more than $250,000, produce more than half the nation's output, measured by cash receipts. Although they make up about 5 percent of the two million farms, they received nearly a third of the Government payments in 1992, the most recent year for which the Agriculture Department has statistics.
In some cases, Mr. Rothermel has forgone much of his potential Government support. He grows a large portion of his corn for Frito-Lay and also grows crops that will be sold as seed next year by seed companies. To satisfy their needs, he has sometimes had to plant more corn than the Government would allow farmers participating in its programs. In 1991, his first big year with Frito-Lay, Federal payments accounted for just $6,159 of his $919,000 gross.
 
More Corn for Government
 This year, with corn stocks low, the Government said farmers would be allowed to plant corn on every acre they had traditionally put into the crop, without losing eligibility, thus making its program more attractive.
As a result of the Government's move and his decision to cut back on dealings with Frito-Lay until it raises the price it pays, Mr. Rothermel put much more land into the corn program.
Mr. Rothermel has received more than $35,000 in Government payments on this year's crop, either directly or by selling options that the Government gave him the money to purchase. The total is less than 5 percent of his projected gross receipts of $750,000. Under the complex rules of the price support program, Mr. Rothermel may end up receiving several thousand dollars more for this year's crop if corn prices fall, but may have to pay thousands back if prices exceed the Government's target of $2.75 a bushel.
Mr. Rothermel's misgivings about having Uncle Sam as a partner are usually private. He is not much of a complainer to begin with and, compared with many other farmers, his burden from the Government's regulatory efforts has been light.
His "wetland," which covers less than a half an acre and takes several days longer than the rest of the field to dry out after a heavy rain, falls into the category of land that is already farmed. He can continue to do anything on it that he does to the rest of the field, as long as he does not improve drainage. At the moment, a tiny patch of land at the edge of the field is a bigger concern. Mr. Rothermel recently discovered marijuana growing among the weeds there, a legacy of World War II, when marijuana was cultivated to make rope.
"The law says I've got to get out here to spray," he sighed.
 A Federal law aimed at reducing soil erosion has a bit more impact on Mr. Rothermel. The law requires all farmers to have Government-approved plans in place this year for controlling soil loss from "highly erodible land." He has only one 160-acre field that the Government has deemed hilly enough to fall under the law -- in contrast with farmers in southern Illinois or the western Corn Belt states who may find their entire farm covered -- but it has already given him some headaches.
Mr. Rothermel planted wheat on the field last year. He planned to follow with soybeans, planting each crop directly into the residue of the other. Such "no-till" farming reduces erosion by eliminating plowing. Combined with terracing on the field, it was a strategy that would keep soil loss within allowed limits, according to Government formulas that predict what will happen in various conditions.
Unfortunately, heavy rains left the field rutted by the equipment used in the wheat harvest last summer, and the wheat residue slowed evaporation on the field. As he waited in vain for the land to dry this spring, clover and other weeds grew rapidly. By late May, when he called in herbicide experts, he was told that his chances of controlling the weeds with chemicals were slim, even if he were to spend $35 an acre, more than four times what he would normally apply. So he burned off the wheat residue, plowed the field several times to dig up the weeds' roots and planted the beans.
 
 
'I'm Going to Do What I Have to'
 "It's the exact opposite of what the Soil Conservation Service wants, but at that point, I'm going to do what I have to and worry about it later," Mr. Rothermel said. At current bean prices, planting the field is worth more than $50,000 to Mr. Rothermel, assuming an average yield.
When he explained his actions to Government officials here last week, Mr. Rothermel received supportive suggestions rather than threats to seek deductions in his corn payments. Although he described the residue coverage after his actions as "virtually zero," in contrast with the plan's requirement that 30 percent of the soil be covered, he claimed 4 percent in his meeting here after an Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service representative suggested that there must be some residue left.
Then, Russ Miller, the Soil Conservation Service official supervising Mr. Rothermel's compliance, used the 4 percent figure as a calculation that Mr. Rothermel had not broken the rules. Other factors included a liberal allowance for how much fieldwork it would have taken Mr. Rothermel to get rid of the ruts and the fact that Mr. Rothermel followed the contours of the hill in planting.
When Mr. Rothermel pointed out that the beans, unlike corn, were not planted in rows, so that following the contours had no real impact on erosion, Mr. Miller nodded but said, "It still counts."

HEADLINE: IRAN'S DIFFICULTIES LEAD SOME IN U.S. TO DOUBT THREAT

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 4

 BODY:
In the three years since the Iraqi defeat in the Persian Gulf war, Iran's drive to become a regional superpower has been thwarted by a worsening economy and an internal political struggle.
Despite the Clinton Administration's official portrayal of Iran as a rogue regime with similarities to Iraq before its invasion of Kuwait, Teheran lacks the money, military equipment and trained personnel to seriously threaten its neighbors, say a number of experts on Iran outside and even within the Administration. 
 According to this revisionist view, Iran is getting weaker, not stronger.
"The regime is facing serious internal problems with no solutions," said Shaul Bakhash, author of a forthcoming book on Islam and politics in Iran. "This is an exhausted revolution. It is a regime out of touch and talking to itself, not one that can afford to project its power abroad in a major way."
For several years, the Government has suffered from high inflation and unemployment, a rapid population growth, a mounting foreign debt that it can no longer repay and waning popular support for the Shiite Muslim clerics who control the country.
The bombing last month in Meshed of the holiest Shiite shrine in Iran on the most solemn day of the year, killing at least two dozen pilgrims, has added to the Government's sense of vulnerability.
Because of declining world oil prices, Iranian oil revenues have fallen more than 30 percent over the last year. And because of declining production ability, Iran is unable to meet its full OPEC oil quota.
"The Iranians desperately need to rebuild their oil fields," said Vahan Zanoyan, an economist and senior director of the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting firm based in Washington. "They have serious production problems, primarily because they have not been able to get all the necessary spare parts and do all the maintenance work."
Although most of Iran's imports from the United States are oil-related equipment, Iran has been forced to buy less. Imports for the first quarter of this year totaled $90 million, compared with $217 million for the same period last year.
President Hashemi Rafsanjani has been repeatedly blocked in his five-year battle to control the bureaucracy, privatize the economy, unify the foreign exchange rate and promote economic development to conservative religious leaders and an obstructionist Parliament.
His standing has sunk so low that he is now regularly vilified in Parliament. In a speech to Parliament two weeks ago, Mohammed Saleh-Taheri, a member from Khorramabad, railed about the price of cucumbers and said that while Mr. Rafsanjani might be "the guardian of policy, culture, society and religion, economics is another matter."
 
Tussle Over Price Controls
 Instead of dismantling price controls as Mr. Rafsanjani has recommended, the Government put into effect a law two weeks ago requiring every bazaar merchant to put price tags on all products.
But the infighting in the Government is so intense that even as municipal officials soldered shut the gates of merchants who did not comply, Interior Ministry officials went around the capital cutting them open again.
Under the Iranian Constitution, Mr. Rafsanjani, who is a senior cleric although not an ayatollah, cannot run again when his second term runs out in 1997.
A number of Western and Asian diplomats in Teheran predict that his successor could be even more inward-looking, and more hostile to the West. Despite his flaws, they say, Mr. Rafsanjani combines political savvy with the religious authority to stand up to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's spiritual leader since the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989, and can therefore risk economic reform and diplomatic overtures to the West.
Although Iran has succeeded, despite American objections, in rolling over about $7 billion in debts with private banks in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Italy, Japan, Denmark and Switzerland in the last year, the Government has been unable to secure significant amounts of new credit or foreign investment.
 
Oil Deals With U.S. Companies
 Paradoxically, even though the United States bars imports from Iran, American oil companies have emerged as a major supporter of the Iranian economy. Some oil industry experts say these companies bought as much as $3.6 billion last year in oil in legal transactions for resale outside the United States.
Iran's economic woes are so severe that some Administration analysts have begun an informal reassessment of Iran's military abilities, although not of its expansionist intentions.
In 1992, Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence in the Bush Administration, told Congress that Iran was spending $2 billion a year on arms, could pose a threat to the United States and its allies in the gulf within three to five years and have a nuclear weapon by 2000.
James Woolsey, who succeeded Mr. Gates in the Clinton Administration, told Congress last year that Iran would need 8 to 10 years to build a nuclear weapon, perhaps less time with extensive outside help.
Now, Pentagon officials and others say Iran spent only about $800 million on foreign arms last year and has made much less progress on its nuclear weapons program than expected.
Although Administration officials have amassed substantial evidence that Iran is committed to developing nuclear weapons, recent intelligence reporting indicates that infighting inside the Iranian Government over how to spend shrinking resources has slowed down its nuclear program. Unless the Iranians can buy a nuclear weapon outright, it could take much longer than 10 years for them to develop one, some intelligence analysts have concluded.
 
Arms Purchases Slashed
 Iran has had to slash weapons purchases and cancel about $5 billion in arms deals, some independent estimates say.
Moscow is holding up the delivery of a third Kilo-class submarine until Iran proves it can pay for it. During a recent visit to Iran, a Russian Deputy Foreign Minister said publicly that his country's trade with Iran was plummeting because Teheran had not paid its debts. There are unconfirmed reports that Russia has canceled the sale of two nuclear power reactors because Iran cannot finance them.
China is poised to deliver 10 fast-attack missile patrol boats and an undisclosed number of anti-ship missiles with a range of 83 miles to Iran, Pentagon officials said. But these officials also said Iran's financial problems could delay a deal with China to build a nuclear reactor for Teheran.
Even North Korea has not delivered on its promises to send new long-range missile technology to Iran.
"What appears clear is that Iran's military buildup so far has been modest," an Iran specialist, Shahram Chubin, wrote in a book of essays published by the National Defense University in April. "It will be some time before it is translated into military effectiveness."
He cited the limited availability of resources and the Government's ambivalence about creating an effective military capable of using advanced weapons.
This trend does not mean that Teheran, with its contradictory foreign policy goals and its support for terrorist groups, has transformed itself into a Government with benign intentions toward the West.
Pentagon officials, for example, are convinced that Iran could terrify naval insurers and deter ships from using the Strait of Hormuz, the outlet from the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, simply by announcing that their two Russian-made submarines were in the Gulf of Oman and that the strait was closed.
 
'Containment' Questioned
 But the trend does call into question the Clinton Administration's policy of "dual containment" articulated in May 1993 by Martin Indyk, the chief specialist on the Middle East at the White House. That approach justifies an increased American military commitment to the Persian Gulf because, Mr. Indyk said at the time, "the current Iraqi and Iranian regimes are both hostile to American interests in the region."
Other senior Administration officials subsequently modified that grim assessment and stressed that no matter how badly the Iranian clerics behaved, they were simply not in the same league as President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
But in March, Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, not only revived the term "dual containment" in an article in Foreign Affairs, but also lumped Iran and Iraq together as two of a handful of "reactionary backlash states" that "seek to advance their agenda through terror or intolerance or coercion" and therefore have to be neutralized, contained and pressed to change.
Indeed, senior Administration policy makers remain so suspicious of Iran that they interpret recent conciliatory remarks by Mr. Rafsanjani about the Arab-Israeli peace talks as a cynical tactical maneuver to seek debt rescheduling agreements from countries that have repeatedly questioned Teheran about its opposition to a lasting Middle East peace.
At a news conference on June 7, Mr. Rafsanjani said Iran would take no action to disrupt the talks, although Teheran would maintain its policy of formally opposing them and the carrying out of last September's agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. "We do not wish to intervene in practice and physically disrupt the process," Mr. Rafsanjani said.
 
Cleric Reviles Arafat
 By contrast, Ayatollah Khamenei last year described the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, Yasir Arafat, as "that puny, ill-reputed blackguard," and called his agreement with Israel "treachery."
Similarly, Administration policy makers are generally dismissive of a statement by Ayatollah Ali Akbar Meshkini, speaker of the Iranian Assembly of Experts and one of the Government's most senior clerics, that Ayatollah Khamenei has the authority to change religious decrees issued by others.
Since it was a religious decree by Ayatollah Khomeini that condemned the British writer Salman Rushdie to death for blasphemy, the new ruling theoretically could provide an opening to lifting the death sentence.
But a suggestion in 1990 by Mr. Rafsanjani that the death sentence could be lifted was quickly denounced by other leading clerics, and Ayatollah Khamenei stated clearly last year that the death threat must and would be carried out, no matter what the consequences.
Such contradictions in Iran's policies have inhibited the Administration from formally reassessing Iran's intentions and abilities. Indeed, the subject is so sensitive and divisive within the Administration that despite the Central Intelligence Agency's professed policy of openness, Mr. Woolsey has banned his analysts from giving press briefings on Iran.

HEADLINE: Russia Lurches Further Along the Capitalist Road

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 4

 BODY:
Nearly two years ago, Russia embarked on the most crucial part of its effort to become a market economy: selling the property of a state that once owned everything and thus founding a nation of property owners with a stake in the success of economic reform.
When the end of price controls wiped out savings, the Government chose to conjure up a middle class by giving away most state property, issuing 144 million vouchers free to every Russian to turn into shares. 
 Now, with most businesses and two-thirds of the Russian work force formally under private control, the voucher program has effectively ended and real capitalism, using real money, finally begins.
This second stage will be the stiffest test of whether the free market will really catch on in this vast distorted economy. Private companies are being thrown into a perilous environment where credit is hard to get, debts among companies are high, management is weak, crime is rampant, taxes are punitive and consumers are poorer than they were three years ago.
This month, with some exceptions, the Government will begin selling its remaining enterprises -- for cash, not vouchers. The companies, many of them now starved for capital, are to get 51 percent of the purchase price.
Private enterprises will also be able now to own and sell land, and private investors should be able to exercise more control over management.
 
The First Stage Of Capitalism
 On its face, privatization has been one of the few economic successes of the Russian Government.
More than 100,000 state companies -- from small shops to oil conglomerates to enormous (and enormously inefficient) factories -- have been transferred to public ownership, at least formally. The 15,000 factories involved represent two-thirds of industry and 60 percent of the industrial work force. The 85,000 shops that have been privatized represent 70 percent of the national total.
More than 138 million vouchers have been invested. There are over 600 registered voucher-investment funds, embryonic mutual funds, really, with 40 million shareholders, and another 1 million people own small businesses.
In the second stage, selling companies for cash, there will at last be real capitalization. Companies will have cash with which to invest and retool. A real stock market should develop, and the shareholders, who have invested cash, are likely to throw their weight behind change.
But Russia's real transition to a market economy is only beginning.
W. Michael Blumenthal, Treasury Secretary in the Carter Administration and chairman of the Fund for Large Enterprises in Russia, a new investment bank funded by the United States Government, has few illusions. "Privatization itself means nothing if the organization doesn't change," he said. "Privatization really must mean making it efficient and competitive."
 
Politicians Send Conflicting Signals
 As with much else in the new Russia, nothing is simple. While Russian leaders plead for foreign investment, they also change their instructions almost daily. President Boris N. Yeltsin issues multiple and contradictory decrees. The Government, one Western businessman said, is acting "like a drunken sailor," altering tax, customs and investment rules without consistency or clear instructions to officials, thus furthering corruption and inefficiency.
Politics is never far away. Parliament could still amend the privatization program, and critics from Communists to free marketeers like Grigory Yavlinsky charge that "privatization without capital" has produced little management change and deluded people into thinking they own something of value while cheating them of any real share of the country's wealth.
A fight is raging over the scope of privatization, with Mr. Yeltsin choosing to allow Moscow and some regions to have their own rules, as if they were exempt from national laws and decrees. There are strong incentives to privatize, but in another compromise with Cabinet conservatives, there will be no list of companies that must do so.
A quieter struggle is underway over whether the last well-known reformer in Government, Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais, will keep his job. Mr. Chubais challenged the populist Mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, over his insistence that Moscow have its own program.
Mr. Yeltsin, who is indebted to the unelected Mr. Luzhkov for his political support, including the timely dispatch of police to surround rebellious legislators last October, backed him over Mr. Chubais. In a news conference, Mr. Yeltsin said bluntly that he had told Mr. Chubais "to keep his hands off Moscow," effectively creating another set of rules.
Asked about his future in a recent interview, Mr. Chubais said: "The only reason for my survival is that I never try to survive."
 
Daunting Challenges For New Businesses
 Assuming Mr. Chubais stays, many considerable problems remain. Inflation is still 10 percent a month. With interest rates high, it is hard for even profitable companies to get long-term loans.
Among the many tasks facing Mr. Chubais and the Government are these:
*Implementation of the bankruptcy law in order to close or reorganize companies that are a drag on the economy.
*Establishment of capital markets, which would require a new legal foundation for everything from regulatory agencies to the control of rampant fraud among voucher funds to the protection of shareholder rights.
*Attracting investors, domestic and foreign. Foreign investment last year was a paltry $1.5 billion, a figure depressed by political, economic and legal uncertainties that have only been compounded by new confusions over taxes and customs duties.
At last, however, Russia is getting Western aid specifically for this most important of transitions. A system of investment banks and 10 regional funds, with Western investment capital and technical assistance, are being set up all over Russia to give new private companies a chance.
Mr. Blumenthal is chairman of one such bank, whose aims include conversion of the military industry; E. Gerald Corrigan, former chief of the New York Federal Reserve, heads another, aimed at smaller businesses. Together, they will work with nearly $500 million of capital provided by Washington, with further aid from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, or OPIC, a for-profit agency that provides risk insurance for United States companies.
"They want to save themselves but don't know the first step on how to do it," said Maksim Boyko, director of the Russian privatization center. "What's important is to see whether this formal transfer of ownership will lead to changed behavior, and it will."
There are lots of examples of change in now private factories. The once huge Uralmash machinery manufacturer has broken itself into more competitive units and shed nearly 10,000 workers from an initial 28,000. LOMO, a defense and optical company, used American consultants and European banks' money to restructure and successfully sell its shares.
But many more are like Lespromservice, a private forestry company still controlled by its managers and workers, who successfully defeated a management challenge from a young American investor who had bought 23 percent of the company through vouchers.
 
A Moscow Company Makes Its Own Way
 The Koloros factory, Russia's largest maker of dyes, is a good example of the complications. The 115-year-old company, which began as a branch of I. G. Farben, the Germany chemical manufacturer, privatized itself, breaking off from the Ministry of Chemical Industry in 1989. The workers and managers formed a collective and "bought" their business from the state in 1992 for a song -- about $20,000, then formed a closed stock company. All shares must be sold to the directors, who must approve any new sales. The company is not open to outside investment.
All this contradicts the Chubais model, but was authorized by Mayor Luzhkov. The company's president, Aleksandr N. Ulyanets, 45, wants no outsiders buying up his company and perhaps defrauding it. As for vouchers, he said: "Let the teachers privatize their schools. Why should we share our factory with teachers? I know what Chubais wants for the country. I think Chubais is wrong."
At the same time, with the reinvested profits of a very profitable plant, Mr. Ulyanets has cut the work force by 15 percent, to 900 employees; replaced 400 of those with "harder workers and specialists"; set up a marketing department; found new business in dyes for leather and suede; started a store that sells directly to consumers; and begun a financial division, including a bank.
Koloros pays its workers $200 a month, twice the Moscow average, and decent dividends on their stock, and it has invested in new equipment to reduce pollutants. The factory, is only 400 yards from the Moscow River and still pollutes it, but the company, once one of the country's worst polluters, has made a deal with Mayor Luzhkov to build a water-filtration system in the next 18 months in lieu of local taxes.
Mr. Chubais himself acknowledges there is room for many different paths to the market. Russia, a stunningly rich country that has been mismanaged in ways few outsiders can fully understand, needs above all a commitment to profit, like Mr. Ulyanets's, even if his wealth results from luck as much as from talent.
Sergei I. Guzinets, 38, is a foreman with 11 years at Koloros. Work is harder, he says, with more responsibility. But he is paid decently, and gets stock dividends now. Would he or his colleagues go back to the old system? "To communism?" he asked, incredulous. "Are you kidding?"

HEADLINE: Military Making Less Into More, But Some Say Readiness Suffers

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CAMP PENDLETON, Calif.

 BODY:
At this sprawling Marine Corps base, which would send thousands of marines to the Korean peninsula if war erupted there, Col. Jeff Scheferman is busy training troops on a no-frills budget.
Marines practice shooting at home-made papier-mache dummies instead of costly cardboard targets. Officers run command-post drills outside their office windows and pretend to be in the field to avoid using expensive batteries. Marines trek 17 miles to their training ranges to save on fuel, truck tires and maintenance. 
 "The trade-off is that they spend one day hiking up and one day hiking back when they could be doing something else, but we're trying to get a bigger bang for our dollar," said Colonel Scheferman, the regimental commander the 3,900-member Fifth Marines.
As the Pentagon budget dwindles, a debate is raging over whether the cuts are compromising military readiness. Some lawmakers and many commanders say the Clinton Administration is cutting too far, too fast, and spending much of what is left on weapons like the $2.4 billion Seawolf submarine instead of on training and pay raises for troops.
"Readiness and capability are good right now, but the cracks are beginning to show," said Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican on the Armed Services Committee who was a career Navy officer.
Military surveys show that fewer young men and women want to join the armed forces, but the trend is more pronounced among men. The United States' shrinking ranks are serving in more peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, from Iraq to Haiti, and divorce rates are rising in some units whose troops are away from home two-thirds of the year or more. To pay for training, many commanders are deferring maintenance on equipment like trucks, helicopters and even warships.
Administration officials, not wanting to appear soft on national defense but needing Pentagon savings to help pay for domestic programs, say their budget pays for smaller forces that are still well-trained and well-equipped. Pentagon officials say they are closely watching potential trouble spots and suggest that some commanders are crying wolf to stave off more cuts.
Even the Joint Chiefs of Staff are divided on the issue. Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan, the Army Chief of Staff, says the Army is on "the razor's edge of readiness." But Adm. William A. Owens, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, disagrees, saying tersely: "We are not on the razor's edge of readiness. It is our highest priority to never undercut our readiness."
The potential political fallout for the White House is enormous. No Administration dares to be blamed for causing a return to the "hollow forces" of the late 1970's, when Army units were severely undermanned, drug use soared and morale plummeted.
 
Warning Signs Are Real
 Visits to a half-dozen bases nationwide, as well as interviews with military and civilian Pentagon officials in Washington, suggest a complicated answer. The armed forces are clearly being asked to do more with less. The warning signs of potential problems are real. But much of what is being cut is fat, and some commanders are finding cost-cutting innovations that do not harm readiness.
At Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, commanders say they have saved more than $1 million in the past year, largely by repairing parts rather than buying new ones. For example, it costs $315 to fix an oil-pressure gauge that costs $2,295 new. The 24th Mechanized Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Ga., is saving thousands of dollars a year by using fewer portable toilets on field exercises and substituting video-conferences for travel.
"When the budgets come down, it makes us more inventive," said Rear Adm. Dennis C. Blair, commander of the battle group with the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk. "The trouble is that, with a few exceptions, we don't reward efficiency and innovation. We haven't institutionalized it."
Indeed, the armed forces are still struggling to adjust to the end of the cold war budgets after years of largesse in the Reagan Administration. President Clinton has pledged to cut military spending by more than $100 billion by 1997, and to reduce the military to 1.45 million troops by then from 1.8 million in 1992.
 
Facing Greater Risk
 But with American ships steaming off Haiti and the former Yugoslavia, warplanes patrolling no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq, and Army forces in Macedonia and Saudi Arabia, commanders say they are being asked to do more with less. This higher operating tempo has strained equipment and troops and will lead to serious problems if unchecked, commanders say. "Over the long run, the military will have to accept more risk," said Gen. Michael P. C. Carns, who was the Air Force's vice chief of staff until recently.
More broadly, some senior officers express unusually blunt criticism that the Administration's budget cannot pay for the forces needed to carry out the military's stated goal of being able to fight and win two regional wars nearly simultaneously.
"I don't think the President understands the implications of this budget, and just how risky it is," Adm. Henry H. Mauz Jr., commander of the Navy's Atlantic Fleet, said in late May at a symposium in Fort Worth.
The White House and Pentagon insist that maintaining combat readiness is a top priority. The Pentagon has formed a council, headed by Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch to oversee readiness. Defense Secretary William J. Perry has proposed increasing the Pentagon's operations and maintenance budget to $93 billion in 1995 from $88 billion this year. But only about 20 percent of that $5 billion difference would go toward activities directly related to combat preparation, with the rest going toward purposes like civilian Pentagon employee pay raises.
 
Readiness Tough to Measaure
 But measuring and maintaining readiness is still an elusive issue. "We don't know precisely how to budget for readiness," said Edwin Dorn, Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. "We do not know the relationship between a dollar input into maintenance or operations, and output in terms of one of these readiness measurements."
When commanders talk about the essential components of readiness, they cite three areas: personnel and quality of life issues, modernization of equipment and training. The armed services have detailed measurements of current readiness, but are virtually blind when looking ahead several years.
The most immediate concerns center on personnel. Although 1993 was the Pentagon's third-best year for recruiting quality -- behind 1991 and 1992 -- surveys show that fewer young men want to enlist. The military is now actually paying people to leave, so this may not pose a serious problem until the armed forces increase their recruiting goals toward the end of the decade.
Keeping the military's best people in uniform is a more pressing problem. The overall gap between civilian and military wages is 13 percent and growing.
The Administration proposed a pay freeze on military salaries last year and only a 1.6 percent increase this year, which is below the rate of inflation.
"A 1.6 percent pay raise is an insult, especially with the longer working hours and less time at home," said Master Chief Petty Officer Mike Cronin, the senior enlisted sailor on the carrier Kitty Hawk.
Military personnel live rent-free in military housing or receive allowances to live off base, but commanders have been forced to defer renovations or new construction to pay for training, maintenance and other bills.
Specialized units are spending more time overseas and on exercises. Some Patriot anti-missile crews are on their fifth six-month overseas tour since the Persian Gulf war. Many marine battalions are gone 60 percent of the year.
Divorces have become common in the Air Force's last F-4G radar-attack plane squadron, where the same small group of pilots are rotated through assignments in northern and southern Iraq every few months. "I don't have much a family left," said Maj. Gary Gray, an F-4G pilot who is separated from his wife of 10 years.
Grumbling over pay, housing and deployment rates, many troops are looking toward the exit. "I'd been considering the Navy for a career, but not now," said Petty Officer 3d Class Matt Gielow, a 25-year-old seaman on the destroyer Curtis Wilbur.
For the next few years, Secretary Perry is delaying modernization of most weapons and equipment, counting on savings from base closings and streamlined acquisition practices to allow replacement of equipment by the end of the decade.
Combat troops credited their lopsided victory over Iraq largely to rigorous training. So the military has shielded training from deep cuts, particularly for troops who would be the first sent to fight.
But commanders are juggling tough choices between paying for training and for morale-boosting items, like child-care centers. Gen. David Maddox, the top Army commander in Europe, reduced tank crews to 600 training miles a year from 800 miles in 1993 to put more money into base housing.
In another cost-saving step, troops increasingly rely on sophisticated computerized simulators to practice dog fights and tank battles. But "you can't simulate getting in a plane with the weather, anxiety and intensity," said Col. William R. Looney 3d, commander of the 33d Fighter Wing at Eglin Air Force Base.
Some senior officers say the military can pare training and still be effective.
"We might have been doing a few too many exercises and not getting the most out of each one," said Gen. Dennis J. Reimer, the commander of Army forces in the United States. "If we conduct fewer training events, let's get more out of them, and milk them for all we can."

HEADLINE: Hoboken: Having It All, Then Leaving It

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HOBOKEN, N.J., July 4

 BODY:
At times like this, when her son is twirling around monkey bars with his friends and she is standing on playground rubber chatting with hers, Annette Vidal Lisa would rather live here than anywhere else. But her boy is almost 3 years old, so she figures it is time to leave.
"It's a shame," she said. "But when my son reaches full-time school age, we want to be ready." 
 In Hoboken, that's life. People start moving out as soon as their children are out of diapers. The city enjoys a reputation as a hip and urbane yet quaint and neighborly place. But it suffers from the notoriety of its school system.
In a way, the city is like any where the public schools are considered poor performers: middle-class parents can choose private schools. But in Hoboken, almost no one can afford to ignore the public schools. Property taxes are among the highest in the state, with 60 cents of every dollar funneled to the ever-shrinking school district. As enrollment keeps dropping, the district loses state aid, even as the cost per student goes up.
"People wonder why they're paying for all these taxes on top of private school for a system that doesn't work," said Ms. Vidal Lisa, who was born in Hoboken, went to the public schools and has nothing good to say about them. "It's why so many look elsewhere."
 
A Revolving Door
 "For Sale" signs plaster apartment windows and dangle from the railings of brownstones and rowhouses all over the city. "Usually the people who move to Hoboken do not have children," said Ray Fiore, a longtime broker. "When they move on, other professionals come in, and so on." In other words, Hoboken has become a revolving door, a glaring example of how much the life of a community is affected by its schools.
On the face of it, Hoboken looks like a haven for young families. Parents pushing strollers crowd Washington Street, the city's main avenue. Playgrounds jam in good weather. Groups of new parents meet in cafes. The city's population, however, is shrinking -- from 42,460 residents in 1980 to 33,400 in 1990, according to the Census Bureau. The share of households consisting of families with children under 18 has dwindled from 52 percent to 39 percent.
The 1980's real-estate craze has played a role. Larger, poorer families, many of them Hispanic, were forced out by rising rents and condo conversions; then they were replaced by middle-class childless couples, said Grizel Ubarry, a public policy consultant who has studied Hoboken and its schools.
"People always used to say if you can bring the white middle class back, you can eventually improve the schools, the theory being that because they are educated and have more resources they'll fight to improve things," he said. "Hoboken is clearly a case where that theory has a chance to be tested and it is failing miserably."
 
Not the Marrying Kind
 To the school district's defenders -- it does have some -- the middle-class professionals who began flocking to this old working-class port in the 1980's have always treated Hoboken as a good-time date, one you would never consider marrying. Yuppies, they say, use the public schools as an expedient excuse to return to the suburbs from which they sprang.
"I think a certain group of people use the schools as the reason for moving, but it's not the real reason," said Louise Boscia, president of the teachers' union. "The urban living that Hoboken is famous for, the night life, is wonderful when you're 21. When you have children, you're not that interested in going out."
Ms. Boscia said racism and class bias may also prompt whites to leave. As in most cities where the public schools are a last resort, minorities are the majority in Hoboken's schools. Hispanic residents, 30 percent of the population, provide 65 percent of the students. Non-Hispanic whites, 62 percent of the population, account for roughly 20 percent of the schools' enrollment. Blacks, Asians and East Asians make up the rest.
"What it comes down to sometimes, for the people who can afford to come and go, is when little Johnny has to sit next to the children from the projects. They would rather he be in a familiar setting," Ms. Boscia asserted.
 
Had a Bad Reputation
 Hoboken's schools had a bad reputation before the real-estate boom. Italian and Irish-American families, for decades Hoboken's two largest ethnic groups, began sending their children to the Catholic schools in large numbers in the 1970's, when Hispanic families in large numbers began moving in, said Dr. Edwin Duroy, the district superintendent.
Hoboken teachers, city officials and school board members have also long sent their children to private schools, and they still do. In 1980, 35 percent of Hoboken's school-age children were in private schools, including parochial schools; in 1990 the figure was 40 percent.
Only now, it takes a much healthier income to afford private school and own a home than it once did. In 1980, houses here sold for about $50,000. The same houses now sell for $250,000 to $375,000, more than twice that of neighboring Hudson County towns. The average homeowner pays more than $6,000 in taxes a year.
"I'm paying $8,000 in taxes -- for what?" said Phyllis Spinelli, a school board member who was elected on a slate called Choice for Change. Her son, who just finished the first grade, is leaving public school for Catholic school this fall.
 
Two Schools Close
 The school system, which had about 8,000 students in 1980, now has under 3,000. Two schools have closed. The remaining six -- three elementary schools, two middle schools and a high school -- are all under capacity. One reason the district's per pupil costs are so high -- close to $13,000 -- is that as it has whittled down, the district has developed a senior staff. None have less than 16 years of experience, and close to 80 percent earn salaries at the highest end of the pay scale (about $59,000).
Compared with many urban districts, Hoboken's does not seem so troubled. In a city where the biggest policing problem is a rowdy weekend bar scene, inner-city plagues -- crime, homelessness, rampant teenage pregnancy -- have barely touched the system. There are no tales of gun fights in the hallways or graffiti. Schools have enough supplies. Student-teacher ratios rival those of suburban schools. While the drop-out rate is nine percent, 60 percent of the graduates go on to college, 49 percent to four-year schools. Last year, for the first time, the district began offering advanced placement courses.
Most people still remember, however, that until two years ago, Hoboken hovered at the bottom of New Jersey's district rankings in student test scores and was threatened with a state takeover.
It was not until last fall that the district was removed from state monitoring and accredited for five years, a move that means the district is meeting minimal passing standards.
 
Bitter Factionalism
 At the same time, the politics of the school system tends to pit the city's newcomers against the old-timers, or born-and-raised Hobokenites, leading to bitter animosities.
"It's hopeless here," said Anne-Marie Pelletier, who was president of the Parent-Teacher Organization at the school where her son completed first grade. She echoed the most enduring criticism of the system, that after years of little teacher turnover, it is rife with cronyism.
She and her husband, who moved here from Montreal five years ago and now have three boys, are considering a move to Ridgewood or Summit, affluent suburbs noted for their public schools.
"I do think some who leave are ready for grass," said Maureen Singleton, a real-estate broker whose three children graduated from Hoboken High School. Recently, she said, she listed the brownstone of a couple with two children moving to Montclair. The Essex County suburb is known as Hoboken West because so many Hoboken families migrate there. "I assumed they were moving because of the schools," Ms. Singleton said. "It turns out they're putting their kids in private school."
Beth Welsh, a Choice for Change school board member whose son just finished the first grade in public school, said she did not plan to move or pull her children from the system. "How long can I keep them in the public schools?" she said. "With home enrichment, probably 12 years."
It is probably no accident, however, that Hoboken is becoming a mecca for single college graduates in their first job, no strings attached. Rentals are in such demand that brokers put ads in the local newspaper begging for apartments.
"Everybody knows Hoboken is a transitional place," said Joe Calhoun, a 25-year-old unemployed writer who lives in a three-bedroom rental with two roommates. "You have a lot of bars and real estate offices. Like everyone's saying: 'Have fun and split.' "

HEADLINE: Rate Rise Is Called Unlikely

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 4

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers, who begin an eagerly awaited meeting Tuesday afternoon, will probably decide after long and spirited debate that the economy is slowing enough that they need not immediately raise short-term interest rates again.
This is the view -- not a consensus so much as a blend of opinion that masks sharp disagreement -- that emerged late last week from the comments of analysts on Wall Street and elsewhere in the private sector. 
 Such an outcome would mean denying the dollar -- which has been battered of late, particularly against the Japanese yen -- the support of higher rates that would make it and American investments more attractive.
 
 
Not a Fed Priority
 But defense of the dollar is not often a high priority for the Federal Reserve, and the Clinton Administration, which sets general policy on the dollar, so far has made no serious move to shore up the currency in advance of a meeting of the Group of Seven industrial countries in Naples at week's end.
Still, as analysts anticipated the two-day session of the Federal Open Market Committee that will plot monetary strategy for the next six weeks and set tentative targets for 1995, they said they would not be surprised by a rise later this month or at the next meeting of the committee on Aug. 16. Such a rise could come if the economy continues to be thought likely to expand faster than its long-term potential, or should inflation -- or the expectation of inflation -- rise.
The Fed could also be moved to act if the dollar plunges in an unarrested slide. A weak dollar adds to inflation, probably more than import volume suggests, some analysts say.
 
 
Data Coming on Friday
 But for now, another force tending to keep the central bank on hold until Friday at least is that it is not until then that the most important monthly batch of economic statistics, the Labor Department's survey of jobs, unemployment, wages and hours, will be published.
The unemployment rate -- in this instance, for June -- is considered a backward-looking indicator, and the Federal Reserve is particularly interested these days in looking forward to head off inflation before it becomes evident. But analysts will be watching intently to see whether the four-tenths of a point drop in May, to 6 percent, will be sustained.
The committee meetings that start Tuesday will also be the first in which Alan S. Blinder, the Princeton economics professor who has just been sworn in as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, will participate. Mr. Blinder has been serving on the President's Council of Economic Advisers, and analysts expect his influence, though probably not immediately visible, to be on behalf of holding rates steady.
"I would say no," said Barry Rogstad, an economist who is president of the American Business Conference, a group of fast-growing companies, of the prospect of a rate rise this week. "I'm just not seeing where there's inflation potential there."
 
 
'Almost Inconceivable'
 But Robert T. Falconer, a longtime Fed official who is now senior vice president at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a Wall Street firm specializing in Government securities, expressed the strongest conviction that the Fed would not increase rates.
"It's almost inconceivable that they would move at this meeting," he said, pointing to aggressive half-point increases in both the Federal funds and discount rates, to 4 1/4 and 3 1/2 percent, respectively, on May 17. That day, the open market committee raised the rate on Federal funds; immediately after its meeting the five committee members who make up the Fed board adjourned to the office of the chairman, Alan Greenspan, and raised the discount rate.
At that time, Mr. Falconer noted, the Fed declared that its actions "substantially remove" the stimulus that low rates had long provided.
Mr. Falconer and other analysts pointed to definite, though not unmixed, signs that the economy is slowing well before this year's rate increases take full effect. The Fed had raised the funds rate by a quarter point in February, March and April, moves that mostly pushed long-term rates up as well, even though they were intended to push long rates lower.
 
 
Angell Urges a Big Rise
 The polar opposite view to Mr. Falconer's is represented by Wayne D. Angell, who as a Federal Reserve governor until early this year was one of the strongest anti-inflation hawks. He is now chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company.
In a letter to clients last week, while making it clear his was not a forecast but a recommendation, Mr. Angell pointed to sharp price increases for various commodities and a continued high gold price as evidence of "marked increase in inflation ahead" and called on the Fed to boldly raise rates this week by three-quarters of a point.
He told clients that the Fed "needs to take dramatic action to reassure the holders of dollars, both in the United States and abroad, that it is committed to the path of price stability."
Most economists, however, seemed to believe the Fed was likely to take either minimal action or none at all.
"This meeting is a 50-50 proposition," ventured John Mueller, chief economist at Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon Inc. in Arlington, Va. He noted that futures markets now reflect hedging against a small rise, which Mr. Mueller said could come at either the July or August meetings.
Friday brought the latest signal of an economic slowdown ahead. The Government's index of leading, or predictive, indicators was unchanged for a second straight month in May and the nation's purchasing managers reported slightly reduced growth in manufacturing for June.
 
Urging a Steady Policy
 At the same time, however, factories paid higher prices to suppliers, pushing the group's index to the highest point in nearly six years. This could count more heavily with the Federal Reserve, analysts said, than the Labor Department's report that imports excluding petroleum rose a scant two-tenths of a percent in May.
Mr. Mueller agreed with the overwhelming sentiment among economists that the Fed neither would nor should subordinate domestic factors to the plight of the dollar.
And Stuart G. Hoffman, chairman of an American Bankers Association advisory panel, said, "To raise it next week if they were reacting to the dollar would not be something we're recommending." Another voice for a steady policy this week is Marilyn Schaja, money market economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
"Absent foreign exchange considerations, no immediate policy shift is in the offing," she advised clients, citing three reasons the Fed would not do so for the dollar alone. It would roil stock and bond markets around the world with no certain benefit to the dollar, whose slide, in any event, does not appear inflationary on a trade-weighted basis.
What is more, Ms. Schaja contended, "any significant increase in interest rates at this juncture carries considerable risk for the United States economy."
The situation is an agonizing one for the Fed, said David B. Bostian Jr., chief economist at Herzog, Heine, Geduld. Mr. Bostian predicted a "contentious" meeting with a 55-45 percent likelihood that the Fed committee would decide the economy was strong enough to justify a small rate increase.

HEADLINE: Dollar's Sellers Are Acting On Caution, Not Conviction

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
As the dollar has plunged almost daily to new lows against the Japanese yen, it is easy to conjure up images of hyperactive traders in speculative frenzies, selling wave after wave of dollars. After all, that's what was seen on the trading floors of Europe in the dog days of 1992, when a global run on the British pound drove Britain out of the European Monetary System.
That was then, and almost everybody was making money. This is now. Everyone -- or almost everyone -- has been losing it, and trepidation has triumphed over adventurism. 
 The dollar set a record closing low against the Japanese yen in Tokyo yesterday before recovering to end slightly higher in London. [Page D4.]
Most speculators who borrowed enormously to place large bets on the pound's fall in 1992 are now sitting on the sidelines. The only players still in the game are motivated as much by caution as by conviction -- American and European investors backing out of bets that the yen would fall and Japanese exporters dumping dollars rather than holding them. Even the strength of the German mark is rooted in a conservative impulse: a desire for the investment that is least likely to lose value.
"There is no one left to buy the dollar," said the head of the government bond trading desk at a leading New York investment house. "All of the speculative pockets of money went long on the dollar at the beginning of the year, lost money and bought it again. Now they say if that hasn't worked, why not try the other way?"
That is exactly what the many investors who think the dollar is undervalued and should rise have been doing. Through the long cold winter and into the early spring,, both speculative hedge funds and other investment vehicles with a longer perspective sold yen and bought dollars. When the yen did not fall, they sold the dollars and bought back the yen.
Faced with political turmoil in Tokyo and uncertainty in Washington, most players are simply moving to a neutral portfolio, although some are cautiously trying to earn back some of the losses they suffered after the yen rose.
"There are a lot of disappointed bulls," said Robert Allen, who manages international bond mutual funds for G. T. Capital Management in San Francisco. "Heading into the year, we were pretty much fully hedged into dollars. But recently we've been playing to the dollar weakness, but we are not aggressively negative on the dollar."
That is not the case with the Japanese, by far the most significant buyers of yen and sellers of dollars. Because the United States imports more than it exports, Japan receives a trade balance of some $5 billion a month. In the 1980's, the Japanese used these dollars to buy bonds, businesses and real estate in the United States. But since 1985, when Washington and its allies agreed to reduce the dollar's value, hoping to increase American exports, the yen has risen and most of those investments have lost money.
"Virtually all Japanese investments in the United States have been losing money from a yen point of view," Robert Z. Aliber, a finance professor at the University of Chicago, said. He estimated those losses at $50 billion to $100 billion.
So now Japanese exporters are largely selling the dollars they earn as soon as they receive them, though this is getting more painful every day. Large Japanese investors, like life insurance companies, have been selling overseas investments and moving their money home.
"No Japanese want to hold anything but yen-related securities," said a top executive of a large trading firm. "No matter what they buy, they hedge. They have been so burned."
 According to one Japanese currency trader in New York, some Japanese corporations had been holding their dollars, hoping to wait until the dollar rose to 105 yen -- the level at which most corporations did their 1994 profit plans -- before converting them back to yen. But as the dollar has continued to fall, many are taking their losses, selling on any rise in price.
"The exporters aren't chasing the dollar down, but when buyers come into the market they run into resistance from the exporters," Jack Grifin, head currency trader at Fuji Bank in New York, said.
The rise in the German mark, by contrast, stems more from deliberate moves taken by global investors who are attracted to European markets largely for their slightly higher interest rates and lower risk of inflation.
"Three or four weeks ago, we shifted some money back into European currencies from the dollar," Robert Sinche, a money manager at Alliance Capital Management, said. Alliance moved mainly because the yield on short-term bonds is higher in Germany than in the United States, he said.
 
 
Yen's Strength Perplexing
 Over all, the movement in the mark has not been especially unusual. Some traders say that at its recent level of 1.57 to the dollar the currency is somewhat overvalued. But the mark is well in the middle of its trading range over the last two years.
It is the unexpected strength of the yen that continues to perplex investors and traders.
"The markets are not responding the way traders are able to predict, or even to make sense of after they moved," said Virginia R. Parker, managing director of Ferrell Capital Management, which runs a fund that places money from large investors with a variety of currency and bond traders at banks and trading firms.
At the beginning of the year, both the traders who base their moves on analyses of fundamental economic factors and those who simply follow market trends were bullish on the dollar. In the last month and a half, the "fundamental" traders moved largely to the sidelines and the technical short-term traders began to bet the dollar would fall.
 
 
Funds More Cautious
 Ferrell, like other currency traders, has made some money as the dollar has fallen, but it has little conviction that this is a sustained trend. The fund has pulled more than a third of the money it had placed with currency traders, diverting it to bond traders.
Similarly, the large hedge funds -- essentially speculative mutual funds for rich people -- have become much more cautious. In 1992 and 1993, they borrowed many times their capital to augment their bets that interest rates would fall in the United States and around the world. When those leveraged bets backfired this year, the funds substantially reduced their borrowing and, thus, their trading.
"None of the large hedge funds has any significant profits this year to date," said Antoine Bernheim, president of the United States Offshore Funds Directory, a guide to hedge funds. "They either have large losses or small profits. As a result, the leverage factor tends to be much lower than it was in the last few years."

HEADLINE: Dollar Falls to Another Record Low Against Yen in Tokyo

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
In trading becalmed by the Fourth of July holiday in the United States, the dollar set a record closing low against the Japanese yen in Tokyo yesterday before recovering to end slightly higher in London.
Gold closed at $386.95 an ounce in London, up $1.80 from Friday's close. 
 There was no trading in the United States as all American financial markets and commercial banks were closed for the national holiday. Trading in the United States will resume today.
In Tokyo, the dollar hit a new closing low of 98.67 yen, below the record of 98.78 yen on Friday. But the closing low was still more than the exchange rate of 97.73 yen that was set in intraday trading on Friday.
Reaction was muted, however, as the market took a rest after the dollar's wild moves last week and awaited crucial monetary policy meetings later this week.
"We are waiting, waiting, waiting," said one trader at a leading American bank in London. "Until all these meetings are out of the way, nothing will happen."
A Japanese bank dealer said of the dollar-yen decline: "We did not pay any particular attention to market moves here today ahead of the U.S. holiday. What is more important is the G-7 meeting and what the world leaders plan to do for the dollar."
This week's Group of Seven summit meeting in Naples is expected to focus on the impact of the dollar's fall and rising bond yields. The group is expected to issue a joint declaration seeking a return to stable currency markets.
In the absence of a strong signal from the Group of Seven, dealers are likely to carry on pummeling the dollar, at the risk of damaging chances of Japanese economic recovery and pushing up inflation in the United States.
Investors also fear that the Federal Reserve's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, at its meeting today and Wednesday, will raise American interest rates for the fifth time this year.
Market activity was further stifled by caution before a meeting on Thursday of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, although few experts thought the meeting would result in an interest-rate cut by the German central bank.
In London, the dollar was at 98.87 yen and 1.5960 German marks in late trading, compared with 98.71 yen and 1.5947 marks at the European close on Friday.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Quarterly Review;
Losses Prevail for the Second Time This Year

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Mutual fund investors are getting used to pain.
For the second consecutive quarter, a majority of mutual funds lost value, as stocks, bonds and the dollar all tumbled. Though many municipal bond funds had tiny gains, funds investing in taxable bonds fell, as did those investing overseas. Hardest hit were funds that invest in American stocks, leaving them down almost 6 percent so far this year. For the quarter, they were down 2.5 percent. 
 The bad news affects millions of Americans who have flocked to mutual funds in the last few years and who now have more than $1.5 trillion in stock and bond funds.
To be sure, this is not the first time in the 90's that equity fund investors have suffered a bleak six months; in the first half of 1992, stock funds fell more than 2.6 percent. During that decline, Americans hung tough and continued to pour money into stock funds. But in the following quarter, they curbed their fund purchases drastically.
This time, investors don't seem to be waiting, perhaps because the declines are sharper. In June, fund companies started seeing increased interest in super-safe money-market funds and a slowdown in equity fund sales. Though money does continue to move into stocks, most of it -- 60 percent at giant Fidelity Investments -- is coming from people participating in retirement plans, who may not worry much about short-term market moves.
Such an attitude is recommended by investment advisers. "I've been getting a lot of calls, and I tell people, 'Go to the park, smell the roses, get a frozen yogurt and forget about all this,' " said Gerald W. Perritt, editor of the Mutual Fund Letter in Chicago. "If you're not out of the market by now, plan on sticking around, because only bad things can happen to you if you sell now."
Investors looking for income are clearly spooked and have pulled billions of dollars out of bond funds. And no wonder; after seven years of falling interest rates had lulled investors into expecting nothing but profits, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in February, and the bond market panicked.
Taxable bond funds dropped 1.3 percent last quarter, bringing their year-to-date losses to 3.7 percent. And despite an average gain of six-tenths of 1 percent last quarter, municipal bond funds remain down 4.7 percent for the year.
"The fixed-income numbers aren't as bad as we expected," A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, said. "But I'm wondering how good those numbers really are." Mr. Lipper was referring to the difficulties some funds have had setting realistic prices for their securities, especially when those securities are exotic or seldom traded or demand for them has dried up. Such problems plagued certain sectors of the mortgage-backed securities market last quarter; the worst performing fund was Piper Jaffray Institutional Government Income, which plunged 18.8 percent.
Even though the market may bounce around a bit more, some money managers expect long-term bond rates to stabilize or even to come down a bit. "All the market has to do is stop being hysterical," said Paul D. Kaplan, who manages the $6 billion Vanguard GNMA Portfolio and the $3 billion of bonds in the Vanguard Wellington fund.
Though some savers who probably should not have been in bond funds in the first place should probably bail out, Mr. Kaplan said he did not think anyone who could look ahead a year or two should get out of bonds, or even move to shorter-term securities. "Given a reasonable tolerance for risk, a tolerance for volatility, I wouldn't shorten up now," he said. "It's a little late for that."
The contention of many money managers is that inflation fears are out of hand, an argument that may be bolstered by the poor performance of gold. Though gold has traditionally served as an inflation hedge, gold funds were last quarter's worst group, dropping 7 percent.
What struck some observers about the quarter, and, indeed, about 1994 so far, is how consistently mediocre the returns have been for stock funds. "Usually, there will be some guy up 52 percent and another down 20 percent, and things are spread out all over," Ralph Wanger, manager of the Acorn fund, said. "This year, things are very compressed."
Of course, not every stock fund ended last quarter in the red. But it says volumes about the current state of the market that the top diversified stock fund was Dreyfus Strategic Growth, which gained 5.7 percent. This is one of the few funds that can and does take big short positions, betting that stocks will fall.
It is run by Robert K. Jermain, president of Osprey Funds Management in Baltimore, which mostly manages hedge funds. Mr. Jermain got the job in January on the recommendation of one of the fund's former managers, Stanley Druckenmiller, who is now George Soros's right-hand man.
Today, 40 percent of the fund would benefit from falling stock prices, Mr. Jermain said. Most of the fund's short positions are in small-cap stocks.
Many such stocks have already been hit, and hard. High-tech funds fell 6.7 percent last quarter, aggressive growth funds fell 5.9 percent, and small-cap funds fell 5.5 percent. The quarter's worst performing stock fund was Fidelity Select Software and Computer Services, which dropped 17.5 percent.
The bright spots in the United States were the financial stocks, which gained despite rising interest rates. "The reason it's happened has been banks' relative earnings stability," said Douglas Pratt, manager of Invesco Strategic Financial Services Portfolio. Even though interest rates have risen, the spread between the amount banks pay for deposits and the amount they receive from loans actually increased in the second quarter, he noted.
This happy situation will eventually come to an end, Mr. Pratt said, adding that if short-term interest rates continue to rise for six to nine months, "that is going to overtake the ability of banks to price up." But on a selective basis, he added, some financial stocks will continue to do well, especially some of the smaller issues not widely followed on Wall Street.
All gains in the United States pale against those in Japan. The quarter's hottest fund, up 13.9 percent, was DFA Japanese Small Company, which is also the year's top performer. The fund, which remains fully invested and does not hedge its currency exposure, gained not only because Tokyo's stock market rose, but also because the dollar dropped against the yen.
The falling dollar, which makes foreign assets worth more for American investors, also aided the quarter's top-performing fixed-income fund, Franklin International Hard Currency. The fund invests in countries with low inflation, and now holds securities from Denmark, Japan, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and Switzerland, said Neil Devlin, its manager.
The dollar is likely to keep sinking, at least for two or three months, Mr. Devlin said. "The United States has a huge current account deficit, and it has been getting wider," he said. "Until that capital outflow is stopped, the dollar needs to go lower."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Quarterly Review;
Varied Strategies for Overseas Investors

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
After a strikingly good 1993, the international investing scene has proved disappointing so far this year.
With the notable exception of Japan and Italy, returns have been weak. For an idea of what to expect for the rest of 1994 and beyond, three portfolio managers with strong records recently explained their performances and described what they were doing. 
 The Scudder Latin America Fund has not fallen as far this year as the other nine funds investing in that region for one reason: cash.
At times, the fund's cash hoard has risen to more than 15 percent. "We felt that some sectors of the Latin American markets had become richly valued," said William F. Truscott, co-manager of the $620 million fund, which is down 7.7 percent for the quarter and 8.2 percent for the year.
It's a far cry from the tack the managers took when they started the fund in late 1992. Through the end of last year, the managers were bullish on Latin America and kept little cash.
Asked why prices were so rich, Mr. Truscott pointed to soaring investor interest because of the North American Free Trade Agreement and in emerging markets over all. Mexico is the fund's biggest bet. "We expect strong economic growth in the years to come," he said. "There would have been stronger growth this year had the country not undergone such a high degree of political turbulence."
Brazil and Argentina remain at roughly 20 percent of the portfolio each. The small chunk invested in Chile is through American depository receipts because direct investment there is difficult.
Mr. Truscott describes his current view as "reasonably cautious." Coming elections in Mexico and Brazil have injected uncertainty into those markets. And higher domestic interest rates have caused a downturn in Argentina, which has a dollar-linked economy.
The rest of 1994? "That depends on whether we see more certainty in the political picture and whether interest rates stabilize," he said.
Small and midsize European stocks make up nearly half of the $600 million Fidelity Worldwide fund, and its manager, Penelope Dobkin, plans to keep it that way.
In Europe, big stocks outperformed small ones from late 1989 through mid-1993, Ms. Dobkin said. The cycle reversed as interest rates fell and economies hit bottom. At that point, she shifted her emphasis to small stocks, figuring they would have an edge for two to three years or more.
She dumped the fund's investments in the emerging markets and Southeast Asia in the first four months of 1994 because of poor performance. That move helped raise her second-quarter gain to 1.2 percent and her year-to-date gain to 2.8 percent.
Contributing to that solid performance was an increased weighting in Japan, which now accounts for 14 percent of assets, compared with 10 percent at the start of the year. There, Ms. Dobkin is concentrating on domestic investments -- department stores, automobile parts companies and construction companies. "It's the Japanese consumer that has the greatest wealth, and they haven't been catered to," she said.
Ms. Dobkin trimmed her United States holdings three percentage points in 1994 by selling cyclical stocks like farm equipment companies. Domestic holdings are mostly in health care, oil and computers.
Although she has not sold anything in Latin America, she has not bought either, letting the region's weighting (mostly in Mexico) slip by half.
Finally, the fund has a large amount of cash, but not intentionally, she said. It merely reflects the huge sums of money investors have moved into overseas investments this year.
The $239 million Sogen Overseas, started in September, called the bets right in 1994 with an astonishing half of assets in cash. As a result, the fund is up three-tenths of 1 percent for the quarter and 6 percent for the year.
Its manager, Jean-Marie Eveillard, who also manages Sogen International, is "embarrassed" by the huge cash position but blames sloppy foreign markets for it. "Europe was cheap 18 months ago but no longer is," he said. "Most European markets are down 8 to 10 percent in local currencies since the start of the year, and the second strike is that the bond markets have deteriorated."
But Mr. Eveillard stills likes Europe for the medium to long haul. The region is "cheaper than the U.S. or the Pacific Rim," he said.
Although the fund's broad diversification probably will not change, he has been buying shares and hopes to be fully invested in 6 to 12 months.
For the long haul, he likes the Pacific Rim, calling it the world's major center of economic growth over the next 5 to 10 years. He eventually aims to buy stocks in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and South Korea, though he considers them pricey now.
Japan, the top performer of the first half, is not on his list. "My suspicion," he said, "is that Japan is in a political and economic transition, which will lead to modest economic growth over the next 5 to 10 years, like the mature economies of the U.S. and Europe."
The fund also holds few Latin American stocks. Opportunities in the region are limited, he said. "When American dentists own Telmex, what's left to be discovered?"

HEADLINE: China Gains In GATT Bid

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: BONN, July 4

 BODY:
The German Government fully supports China's attempts to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said today after talks on the first day of a visit by Prime Minister Li Peng of China.
"We have talked intensively about this, and I've promised my personal support," Mr. Kohl told his Chinese counterpart at the opening of a conference on economic cooperation between the two countries. "For me, it's an important goal to build up relations with your country." 
 He said China would receive "full support" from Germany when GATT, or its successor, the World Trade Organization, decides whether to admit China as a member.
China has accused the United States of blocking its eight-year-old effort at entry by demanding what it sees as the impossibly high price of developed-country status with no preferential trade terms.
"China is a developing country," Mr. Li said. "But China is a land of trade, and should be integrated into the world trade system."
Last year, China was Germany's largest Asian market for capital goods. During Mr. Li's visit, $2.5 billion of business contracts will be agreed upon, and $1 billion signed.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Quarterly Review;
Sluggish Results for 5 Experts

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
Perhaps the best thing that can be said about the second quarter is that it's over.
Given the tough sledding for stock funds, "We all should have indexed the S.& P. 500 and gone on vacation for three months," said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds and one of five experts who created hypothetical retirement portfolios for The New York Times a year ago. 
 Vanguard's S.& P. index fund rose four-tenths of a percent in the last three months, compared with a 2.5 percent decline for the average diversified domestic equity fund, according to Morningstar Inc. in Chicago.
Three of the five hypothetical portfolios lost money this quarter, though none more than 2 percent. Eric Kobren of Insight Management, in Wellesley, Mass., was the best performer, gaining about 1 percent. Since tracking began on July 7, 1993, Sheldon Jacobs, who edits the No-Load Fund Investor, in Irvington, N.Y., still leads the five fund experts, with a gain of 11.6 percent, compared with a 5.31 percent gain for the Lipper average of all equity funds.
 The portfolio performance, tracked quarterly by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. in Summit, N.J., excludes transaction costs, sales charges and taxes. The five experts can shift money quarterly, although the portfolios are intended to grow for 20 years.
Mr. Rekenthaler plans to take advantage of market weakness. He is increasing his portfolio's risk on the theory that high-risk funds have been so down in the trenches this year that they are due for a rebound.
Echoing that approach, Mr. Jacobs is bailing out of a couple of high-risk funds that have not been up to snuff, but plowing the money back into funds with similar risk under different management.
Mr. Rekenthaler replaced Fidelity Balanced Fund with Fidelity Global Balanced, which has the same manager. He described the action as "shifting a little further along the risk curve by buying a fund that is similarly structured but which owns more overseas companies, smaller-cap stocks and somewhat riskier bonds."
He also swapped 10 percent of his holdings in Scudder Global for Columbia Special, "to add some small-cap and technology stock exposure to the portfolio."
Part of Mr. Rekenthaler's relatively strong performance this quarter came from a stake in Vanguard Specialized Energy, up 7.8 percent. The fund had sharp losses late last year and early this year, severely crimping his cumulative return. Finally, he said, it "filled its role as a hedge against rising interest rates."
Mr. Jacobs is replacing PBGH Growth Fund, which fell 12.6 percent last quarter, with the Montgomery Growth Fund. "If you hold on long term it will be fine," he said, "but I'm worried about near-term volatility."
Besides PBGH Growth, Mr. Jacobs is dropping Fidelity Emerging Markets, which recently added a 3 percent sales load, because he shuns funds with such charges. For a replacement, he chose Lexington Worldwide Emerging Markets Fund.
The all-Fidelity portfolio developed by Mr. Kobren was pulled along mostly by its big stake in the Fidelity Value Fund. The fund's strong performance this quarter (up 3.7 percent) comes from health, commodity and financial services stocks, plus some Japanese shares, he said.
But the Short-Term Bond fund, which excelled last year because of its emerging markets debt, stumbled this year. Sharp declines in that debt, plus rising interest rates, took a heavier toll than expected, Mr. Kobren said. Even though most of the damage is probably done, he is shifting that money into the Fidelity Canada Fund, a bet on rising commodity prices. Nearly half that fund is devoted to energy and basic industries.
Harold Evensky and Jack A. Brill made no changes.

An Unbalanced Guide On the Road to Paradise

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:
The Kingdom of Matthias
A Story of Sex and Salvation in 19th-Century America
By Paul E. Johnson and Sean Wilentz
222 pages. Oxford University Press. $25.
A charismatic leader who calls himself the Prophet and preaches an apocalyptic doctrine of redemption. A band of devoted followers willing to abandon their earlier lives. Rumors of sexual misconduct, followed by other allegations of criminal behavior. Tension with the local community, culminating in a sensational showdown. And finally, raucous tabloid headlines decrying the cult, fanaticism in general and the social disorder overtaking the country. 
 Sound familiar? Although the events described by the historians Paul E. Johnson and Sean Wilentz in their riveting new book will remind readers of events in Jonestown, Guyana, and Waco, Tex., the story set forth in these pages took place in New York in the 1830's. Indeed, "The Kingdom of Matthias" impresses upon the reader the remarkable continuity of a single thread in American religious experience: this nation's susceptibility to volatile cults and revivals, its New World propensity for millennial beliefs, and its tolerance of fundamentalists, enthusiasts and visionaries of all sorts.
Blending carefully detailed scholarship with raw narrative verve, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Wilentz turn the story of Matthias the Prophet into a wonderfully vivid philosophical thriller, while at the same time teasing out the story's historical and cultural implications.
They begin by succinctly sketching in the historical backdrop of the Second Great Awakening, the early 19th-century religious revival that occurred (not coincidentally, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Wilentz say) during "the peak years of the market revolution that took the country from the fringe of the world economy to the brink of commercial greatness." The movements spawned by the Great Awakening helped reshape the landscape of mainstream American Protestantism. They also gave rise to new cosmologies that spoke directly to the uneducated and the poor, and helped galvanize social-reform campaigns for abolition, temperance and women's rights.
In the decades before the Civil War, evangelical reform in the North was associated with preachers like Charles Grandison Finney, who opposed Calvinist beliefs about predestination, teaching their followers that they could achieve salvation by choosing to do good. "With their championing of personal autonomy," write Mr. Johnson and Mr. Wilentz, "Finneyites also reassessed all aspects of everyday life": men were encouraged to pray for release from anger and passion and to delegate day-to-day authority over domestic affairs to their wives. The doctrines of the Prophet Matthias -- like those of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, who later denounced Matthias as an emissary of the Devil -- would stand in stark contrast to these middle-class reforms.
"Against the Finneyites' feminized spirituality of restraint," write Mr. Johnson and Mr. Wilentz, "Smith and Matthias (each in his own way) resurrected an ethos of fixed social relations and paternal power. Yet as they saw things, they were defenders of ancient truth against the perverse claims of arrogant, affluent, and self-satisfied enemies of God. And a majority of those Americans who were exposed to Finneyite evangelicalism apparently shared their anti-Finneyite views, if not their spiritual inventions and revelations."
Although the former Robert Matthews articulated many discontents abroad in the America of his day, he also seems to have been a deeply troubled man: self-dramatizing, self-aggrandizing and quite possibly mad. Having grown up a pious boy, indoctrinated in the patriarchal Scots Calvinism of his upstate family, Matthews lost both his parents when he was 7. Later, married and the father of several children, he suffered another devastating set of reversals: his business suddenly went bankrupt, and two of his sons abruptly died. Matthews began suffering from violent mood swings and took to beating his wife frequently. About this time, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Wilentz report, he also started making strange religious pronouncements.
Over the years, Matthews's religious seeking had taken him from Calvinism to Methodism to Judaism, and in 1829 he made an effort to join the Fourth Presbyterian Church in Albany but was turned away for his erratic behavior. By 1831, he was busy inventing a religion of his own. He preached that 1,800 years of Christian misrule were coming to an end, that "all real men" would be saved in the new Kingdom, that they would all enter a beautiful paradisal world, surrounded by worshipful children and happy, dutiful wives.
Amazingly enough, Matthias, as the penniless Matthews now called himself, soon found a coterie of wealthy followers in New York City who included Elijah Pierson, a devout businessman, grieving over the untimely death of his wife; Sylvester Mills, another merchant, given to severe bouts of depression; Isabella Van Wagenen, a former slave reputed to possess mystical powers; Benjamin Folger, a handsome (and some said shallow) hardware merchant, and Folger's seductive wife, Ann.
Under Matthias's influence, the group soon moved to the Folgers' country estate on the Hudson, where elaborate meals and communal baths became the order of the day. Matthias -- who had taken to wearing a green frock coat, fancy pantaloons and a black leather Merlin-the-Magician hat -- made Ann Folger his "match spirit" while giving the hand of his own daughter Isabella in marriage to Benjamin Folger. As reports of these sexual shenanigans spread throughout the countryside, a confrontation between Matthias's Kingdom and the community at large became inevitable, a confrontation that the authors of this volume narrate with dexterous dramatic skill.
With "The Kingdom of Matthias," Mr. Johnson and Mr. Wilentz have given the reader a small historical gem: a book that fascinates and entertains, even as it illuminates a dark, persistent vein in American history.

HEADLINE: Rabies, Rampant in U.S., Yields to Vaccine in Europe

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE 

 BODY:
CONTINENTAL Europe and the United States share an ancient plague: the deadly scourge of rabies. But although public health measures on both continents have made the disease rare among humans, Europe has moved years ahead of the United States in fighting the disease among wild animals.
In the last three years, Europeans have been bombarding red foxes, the continent's main carriers of the disease, with pellets of food laced with a potent new vaccine. 
 The European program, carried out by fleets of helicopters and airplanes, has been so successful that a similar campaign to airdrop oral vaccine doses to wild dogs will be undertaken next year in Tunisia, Turkey and parts of southern Africa, the World Health Organization reported last month.
Most public health experts agree that rabies can never be entirely eliminated, in the way that smallpox was wiped out more than a decade ago. But by immunizing most of the animals that carry rabies, it is believed, entire nations or continental regions can be largely freed of the contagion.
This has become possible partly because of the development of the new vaccine, which is based on recombinant technology. For the last four years, this molecularly engineered vaccine, known as VRG (for vaccinia rabies glycoprotein) vaccine, has been field tested with great success on animal populations in Europe and America. Trials in the United States were conducted in Virginia in 1990 and in Pennsylvania in 1991 and are now in progress in New Jersey and along the Cape Cod Canal in Massachusetts.
VRG is the first laboratory-engineered, live vaccine ever to be released into the environment in the United States, and exhaustive tests of its safety and efficacy have slowed its general use in this country, said Dr. Warren B. Cheston of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, which was one of the original developers of the vaccine but is no longer associated with the program.
But Western Europe has moved ahead rapidly with VRG oral vaccination programs for free-ranging carnivores, using fleets of helicopters and airplanes to blanket large sections of France, Belgium and other countries with red fox bait treated with the vaccine. It is manufactured by the Rhone Merieux Company of France, which has a branch in Athens, Ga.
Results have been so promising that the European Commission announced this spring that it expected to rid Western Europe of fox rabies within four years and that the oral-vaccine campaign was already pushing eastward into Poland and the former Soviet bloc.
Despite the success of the European program, progress in the United States has been slow. Dr. Charles E. Rupprecht, chief of the rabies section at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said that many questions still remain to be resolved and that conditions in the United States are not identical to those in Europe.
"Is controlling rabies in free-ranging land animals feasible by using VRG oral vaccine?" he asked. "The European experience suggests that it may be, but that's far from saying whether it's practical, or politically correct or economically valid. Let's just say that everything that makes the United States different from Canada and Europe affects some of the problems of oral vaccination."
Worldwide, the World Health Organization said, more than 33,000 people die each year from rabies, most of them in Africa and Asia. Once symptoms begin to develop, the disease is agonizing and incurable, and victims are invariably doomed to death. In most places, the main defense against rabies continues to be the prompt inoculation of anyone bitten by or exposed to a rabid animal with a prophylactic course of injections. But rabies is now being attacked on a broader front, by immunizing the wild animal populations that spread the disease.
Although a few field tests of oral antirabies vaccines have been successfully conducted in the United States, the VRG vaccine is not yet licensed in this country for uses more extensive than limited field trials.
The United States, and New York State in particular, are in the grip of a historically severe rabies epizootic (the animal equivalent of a human epidemic) that affects raccoons, bats and many other animals, all of which can infect human beings. Charles Trimarchi, director of the rabies laboratory of the New York State Department of Health, said that in 1993 his laboratory diagnosed rabies in 2,746 animals, a national record for a single state.
 
Few Americans Infected
 Reflecting the increasing exposure of New Yorkers to the bites of potentially rabid animals, about 3,000 residents of the state underwent rabies inoculations after being exposed to the disease last year. The comparable number in 1989 was only about 100.
Paradoxically, however, the very effectiveness of public health safeguards against human rabies in the United States has impeded the initiation of wild-animal immunization programs like those of Europe. For one thing, laws insure that most dogs and cats in this country are vaccinated against rabies, thereby eliminating most domestic pets as carriers of the disease. Also, the public health system has created a very effective net for identifying and treating human beings exposed to rabies.
One result is that so few human beings in the United States contract rabies that officials have great difficulty obtaining funds to immunize wild animals.
In 1993, only one human rabies death was recorded in the United States, that of an 11-year-old girl in Sullivan County, N.Y., who succumbed to a strain of the disease common among bats, but one that could have been transmitted by another animal infected by a rabid bat. So far this year, one man has died of rabies, a California resident who also contracted a bat strain of rabies. The victim did not recall being bitten by any animal, but before he became ill he had been caring for a sick kitten, which might have been exposed to a rabid bat.
Since 1980, only 19 people in the United States have died of rabies. (By comparison, up to 200 Americans are killed each year by lightning.) Of the 19 rabies fatalities, eight victims acquired the disease outside the United States. Of the 11 cases contracted within the United States, eight came from bat-transmitted strains of the disease.
But despite the extreme rarity of human rabies in the United States, public health officials believe that mass immunization of wild animals would be useful, and well worth the cost. A single dose of VRG vaccine, disguised as a tasty snack for some target animal, costs more than one dollar, and many millions of doses must be dropped over wide areas to be effective.
"But each time a human being is exposed to rabies infection," said Mr. Trimarchi of the New York State Health Department, "he or she must submit to prophylactic rabies inoculations, which cost about $1,000 per person. The cost adds up."
 
Controlling Rabid Raccoons

The species most affected by the current rabies epizootic in the Eastern United States is the raccoon. Raccoons are dying of the disease in enormous numbers, and the infected region is spreading northward from the middle Atlantic states at a rate of up to 40 miles a year. It has already reached Vermont and New Hampshire, and has covered about 65 percent of New York State.
In Massachusetts, state authorities are trying to keep Cape Cod free of the rabies infection by orally vaccinating wild animals in the vicinity of the Cape Cod Canal, a natural barrier against the epizootic. But experts say it is probably too late to create similarly immunized zones to prevent the imminent entry of rabies into Ohio from Pennsylvania, or into North Carolina from neighboring states to the north and south.
The death rate among raccoons and other affected animals peaks shortly after rabies spreads to the region they inhabit. As most of the local raccoon population dies out, the disease seems to become less virulent, eventually becoming "enzoic," permanently present, but not deadly enough to kill all the raccoons in the area. Public health strategies for controlling the disease in enzoic areas differ from those used to check the incursion of rabies into uninfected areas; once a region is infected, a vastly larger animal immunization program is needed to reduce the incidence of disease.
A great advantage of the VRG oral vaccine, aside from the fact that it can be easily spread over huge areas, is that it immunizes virtually all animal species against rabies; the only modifications needed are in the bait used to attract different types of target animals, not in the vaccine itself. Fish meal bait has been found effective in attracting raccoons. Although it may be eaten by other animals, it is not wasted, since it confers immunity on them as well. No attempt has been made to immunize bats with oral vaccine, partly because the many species of bats have very different diets. It would hardly be practical to target bats that live on flying insects, for example. In principle, VRG vaccine could even be used to immunize human beings as well as animals, although experts say it would be difficult to obtain regulatory permits for human use of the vaccine.
Conventional rabies vaccine used for both animals and human beings is based on a rabies virus that has been killed or weakened enough to prevent it from being infective. Antigens in the vaccine condition an animal's immune system to fight the full-strength rabies virus if it should ever enter the body.
The new VRG vaccine, however, is not a killed or attenuated rabies virus. It is based on vaccinia, a close but harmless relative of smallpox virus. To make VRG, a protein coating containing rabies antigens is added to the vaccinia virus using recombinant methods. The coating does not change the genetic coding of the vaccinia virus, but when the virus enters the body of a target animal, it stimulates an immune response capable of protecting the animal against rabies.
Experts agree that slaughtering raccoons or other animal species to prevent the spread of rabies is neither effective nor economical; trapping experiments aimed at reducing animal populations have failed to control disease, Mr. Trimarchi said. "Besides," he added, "the public today wouldn't stand for eradicating vector species like raccoons."
Why is it taking so long to mobilize the United States against the rabies epizootic that is sweeping the country?
"I don't think there's been any large, organized opposition to recombinant oral vaccination of wild animals," Mr. Trimarchi said. "It's just that our mechanisms move slowly when applications of biotechnology are involved. And so far, the eradication of rabies in wildlife populations hasn't had high priority in public health agendas. But maybe things are changing."

HEADLINE: Acorns Sprout Among the Oaks Of the Telecommunications Field

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Eighteen months ago, Shant S. Hovnanian was a home builder in New Jersey. Now he is the chief executive of a small telecommunications company in Manhattan, pushing a technology that did not exist a decade ago and preparing to do battle with some of the biggest names in corporate America.
"This is the mecca of technology being born," he said of greater New York. "Everybody's got a new idea." 
 Mr. Hovnanian, 35, exemplifies the entrepreneurship that is bounding through the New York metropolitan area in telecommunications, as technology and loosened regulation coalesce to make the region a national incubator. His company, Cellularvision, uses wireless cellular transmitters to send cable television programming. It has tested the service for two years in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, and this summer will begin expanding into the larger, more competitive markets of Queens and midtown Manhattan, where conventional hard-wired cable still rules.
But Cellularvision is just one of many acorns hoping to become oaks.
"This whole area is the hothouse of what the future is going to look like," said Peter A. Bernstein, a telecommunications industry analyst at Probe Research in Cedar Knolls, N.J. "There's never been the kind of frenetic activity you're seeing now in terms of pushing forward, in terms of new opportunities."
Throughout the region, new ventures and new companies are popping up. The Omnipoint Corporation, a Colorado company, is planning to try out its new cellular telephone technology in New York. The World Telecom Group, a California company, sells telephone service debit cards for people who phone a lot from the road. Some such ventures involve investments of hundreds of millions of dollars, but there are low-overhead mom-and-pops as well. Ken and Alison Hamje sell long-distance accounts from their home in Mendham, N.J.
And old companies are learning new tricks. Bell Atlantic, operator of the local phone system in New Jersey, is poised to enter the television business. Time Warner, a cable company going in the other direction, is seeking to provide telephone service in New York. In Connecticut, Southern New England Telecommunications, the parent company of Southern New England Telephone, is planning to offer everything from cable television to long-distance service under one roof.
"New York is probably the most competitive local communications market in the country and possibly the world," said Eli M. Noam, a professor at the Columbia University business school and director of the university's Institute for Tele-Information. He said the trend will only accelerate as it becomes easier for companies to stake a claim. "The barriers that once seemed formidable have continuously become lower," he said. "And for technological reasons, the hardware has become cheaper."
 
Blurring Lines
 To a degree, the New York region pioneered competition in telecommunications. Companies like Teleport and Metropolitan Fiber, for example, have offered telephone alternatives to big-business customers in Manhattan for about 10 years in competition with Nynex, which provides local phone service in New York and much of New England.
The difference now, and particularly in the New York metropolitan market, is that there are more players and more plays to make than ever before. The lines between telephone service and television programming have become blurred by innovation in computer technology. That means more market niches, more choices for consumers and -- every sales executive's dream -- rampant confusion about what it means and which deal is best.
"Confusion always creates opportunity," said Geoffrey W. Crowley, a vice president at Phoenix Network, a small long-distance telephone carrier that opened its first New York sales office in January. He said that small-business owners, the main target of much of the new competition, are being overwhelmed with choices.
"They're bombarded, really," he said. "They don't know the difference between their long-distance and local service, and virtually 100 percent of the time they don't know what they're paying per minute."
 
'Who Is This?'
 Regulators have continued to loosen the reins: New York City, for example, now has six companies authorized to offer local telephone service in addition to Nynex -- four got their franchises in December. In Connecticut, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. recently signed a bill opening every telephone market in the state -- from the local exchange provider on up -- to competition. So far, 63 potential service suppliers have applied, including companies like Hertz, the car-rental company, which wants to sell excess capacity from its internal network.
"We take a look at the names and we go, 'Who is this?' " said Beryl Lyons, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control. "We have no idea who some of these people are or how long they're going to last."
The region is also home to some of the most aggressive of the established players in the industry. Most notably, Bell Atlantic has pledged to begin an interactive fiber-optic home television system by early next year in four New Jersey communities -- Chatham, Florham Park, Madison and Dover Township -- and to have perhaps the second statewide interactive system in the nation by 2010. S.N.E.T. in Connecticut has vowed to be first, with a fully wired system by 2009.
 
Increased Demand
 And those expanded menus of channels -- Time Warner already offers 150 in a test market in Queens -- means more demand for programs, at least some of which will be produced in the region. One early entry: a pharmaceutical network, partly operated by several New Jersey-based drug companies that will allow doctors or their patients to call up a video brochure on prescription medicines. Television studios at the Arts & Entertainment Network and the Tribune Company in New York are developing niche cable channels for history buffs and food lovers.
There is also ample cross-fertilization. Bell Atlantic, for example, a minority investor in Mr. Hovnanian's Cellularvision company, will manage the network as it expands to its target of one million homes by October. Nynex recently began a "video dial tone" test in Manhattan with three cable companies. Customers get their television service through the Nynex line, then choose which cable provider to take after that.
Nynex and Bell Atlantic also announced last month that they would merge their cellular telephone businesses, creating a company serving most of the Eastern Seaboard. Cablevision Systems, meanwhile, which provides cable television service in Westchester County, in Connecticut and on Long Island, said it was considering a direct competitive assault on northern New Jersey.
Whether all this deal-making and investment will create new jobs is an open question, however. Economists say that while there has been some job growth, the scale is small and offset by the thousands of jobs being shed as competition compels telephone companies to slim down. Between April 1989 and April 1994, the region lost about 15,000 communications industry jobs, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 
Fortunes to Be Made
 But business people emphasize that the region is still mainly in the investment phase, and that new fortunes are mostly yet to be made.
"Our biggest problem is finding good people," said Charles L. Bakes, president of International Telecommunication Data Systems in Stamford, which provides computer billing software for cellular phone companies. He said revenue at his four-year-old company has doubled every six months for three years. The company has 69 employees now, up from 11 at the end of 1991, and up from just the four founding partners in 1990.
More common are start-up companies like Modalink, a computer network that went on line last month in Manhattan aimed at the fashion industry. The idea is to put copies of models' and photographers' published work in a telephone-linked information bank. Advertising agencies around the world, who might be looking for that certain sultry look, can then peruse offerings from their own computer screens.
Modalink has only six employees, all working in a 21st Street loft. As an information provider it probably will not need more space or workers, no matter how successful it gets, said the president, J. Randall Brockett.
 
Newcomer Versus Veteran
 The central belief behind most of these new ventures is that the New York region has entered a new gilded age in which a good idea, or a new of selling an old one, will find its market. Strip away the high-tech chatter, and the competition washing through the region is the same human-scale story that has always played here, like a Broadway show that will never close: Bright-eyed Newcomer Meets Battle-Scarred Veteran.
These are the stories of people like Aaron Chan. From the one-room office at Phoenix Network overlooking 34th Street in Manhattan, Mr. Chan, a 24-year-old resident of Queens who repaired tank engines in the Army until last year, was in his shirt sleeves on a recent hot afternoon, cold-calling business owners. Mr. Chan's task: convince people to reconsider their long-distance telephone allegiance on behalf of a company they have probably never heard of.
"I got two appointments," he said of his morning's work.
 
'I'm Always Awed'
 Douglas G. Smith's tiny Colorado-based cellular telephone company, Omnipoint Corporation, doesn't even have a New York City office, and he has yet to hire even the first of the thousand-odd employees he says he will need. But his ambitions, too, have been unleashed: Pending final regulatory approval, Omnipoint plans to blanket the area with up to 900 cell sites, then cut access charges to beat the competition and make cellular phones as common as beepers.
"I go to the top of the Rainbow Room," Mr. Smith said, "and I think, we've got one of the most enormous tasks imaginable -- I'm always awed."
But the new players also say that much of where they are now depends on chance, on getting financing, on meeting the right people. Mr. Hovnanian, for example, said it was a call from an old high school friend that put him on the road he is now. The friend, a stockbroker, had encountered an electrical engineer who was developing a wireless video system and was looking for a backer. Mr. Hovnanian was hooked.
"What we have is an opportunity to create a whole new industry here," he said. "I've made this the focus of the rest of my career."

Chart: "IN THE REGION: Telecommunications Projects"
 
CONNECTICUT: Southern New England Telecommunications has begun construction of a fiber-optic network for voice, video, information and interactive television that the company says will connect every customer in Connecticut by 2009. S.N.E.T. is now providing television service to 355 homes in West Hartford, and is awaiting F.C.C. approval to expand to a 150,000-home area in Hartford and Fairfield Counties, possibly as early as this fall.
 
NEW JERSEY: Bell Atlantic has filed what it says is the first application in the nation to provide full interactive video service over telephone lines in four New Jersey communities beginning early next year. Long-range plans would extend those services to every customer in the state by 2010.
 
NEW YORK: CellularVision, a new wireless competitor to cable television, offers 49 channels in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, and is to expand next month into Park Slope and other Brooklyn neighborhoods, with service available to 1 million homes in Queens and Manhattan by October.
NYNEX has announced plans to build 1.5 to 2 million fiber-optic lines by the end of 1996, but has set no specific schedule or plan for New York customers. The company has begun a test in three apartment buildings on Manhattan's Upper East Side providing cable television access through phone lines.
Time Warner, which now offers 150 television channels in a test market in Queens, is awaiting final approval to become the first cable television company in the nation to enter the telephone business, competing for local customers in Rochester.

Groggy With Health

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER; 

 BODY:
Written after deep health-care immersion:
America faces a grave health-care crisis, though maybe not. 
 There are five, or maybe nine or ten, different bills in Congress for dealing or not dealing with the crisis or non-crisis, depending on whether it is a crisis or not.
One of these is the Dole plan, and it is much too confusing to go into here, as are the other four, eight or nine plans, as the case may be, none of which will be enacted anyhow, permitting us to move ahead to the real questions. These are:
1. Why do you have to go bankrupt before you can die?
2. Is it true that Newt Gingrich is wearing President Clinton's old hair?
3. Whither coronary thrombosis?
4. Is Ira Magaziner the brilliant criminal-defense lawyer known as "the great white shark" who was seen being interviewed on television the other night about O. J. Simpson's health-insurance policy?
The answers will not be known until Senator George Mitchell starts melding the bills on the Senate floor, provided of course that the Senate's bill melder, which has been on the fritz for years, can be repaired.
If not, Senator Mitchell will become the baseball commissioner. This job will confront him with an entirely different health-care mystery; to wit, why the sudden decline in rotator-cuff surgery and the corresponding increase in medial-ligament operations on the knee?
Fortunately for people heavily invested in insurance companies, the insurance industry will continue to thrive, no matter whether a bill of any sort is passed or not. Everybody who counts, from Clintons to Evers to Breaux, fears American medicine will collapse if deprived of the insurance industry's genius for converting everything from colic to Huntington's chorea into easily collectable profit.
Most of the bills being proposed frown on the insurance industry's past practice of canceling their coverage of people who become ill. Senator Gramm of Texas would deal with any such insurance company by sending a note home to its mother.
Of utmost importance is universal coverage, because President Clinton has threatened to veto any bill that does not provide universal coverage.
But what does universal mean? Some say covering 90 percent of the population would be universal, and some say 95 percent. In other words, the universal coverage being discussed is not universal, nor should we expect it to be. Established theory holds that any politician who means precisely what he says is unfit to revise and extend his remarks in the Congressional Record.
Some say covering 90 percent of the population one of these days in some future century would fill the bill. Others say giving everybody the right to buy insurance from a private company would satisfy the universality requirement.
Since this is exactly where we seem to be at present, universality-wise, pessimists worry that Congress lacks the necessary zeal for universal coverage, which might compel Mr. Clinton to use his veto or face the classic question asked many years ago by a Minnesota Congressman named Blatnik. The Blatnik question:
"Why you Demos talk so much, do so nothing?"
Shocking though it is, politics also seems to figure in the health-care debate. This is because elections will be held not only this fall, but also in the fall of 1996.
The curse of elections is that they require politicians to attack each other. This is because the theatrical demands of the 10-second TV commercial for an audience marinated in gunplay and car crashes not only insist on violence, but also rule out sensible discourse .
So, our custom of incessantly holding elections requires a constant supply of government failures for which politicians can blame each other in campaign commercials. This explains why our statesmen are compelled to avoid trying to solve civic problems.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Quarterly Review;
Investors Show a Willingness to Take On Risk

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
Although they pulled back somewhat toward the end, mutual fund investors showed a strong stomach for risk last quarter.
Money flowed into stock funds at home and abroad, despite wild swings in stock prices here and some poor performances in foreign markets. Money poured out of the supposed bulwarks of safety, bond funds and utilities funds, as both suffered big losses because of the rise in interest rates orchestrated by the Federal Reserve. 
 Weekly cash flows into stock funds were, in fact, positive throughout the first half of the year except for one week, the first week in April, when a big drop in stock prices starting in mid-March apparently did unnerve investors.
But fund investors just as quickly returned to stocks and a total of $26 billion flowed into equity funds from April through June, down a bit from the relatively calm previous quarter, according to AMG Data Services, in Arcata, Calif. The two largest categories showed impressive gains, with growth funds adding $7.3 billion and the more conservative growth-and-income funds up $5.4 billion.
Aggressive growth funds showed the biggest percentage gain in the quarter, gaining $2.5 billion, or more than 8.5 percent. The equally risky emerging growth funds had inflows of $1.1 billion, up 2.5 percent, AMG said.
Investments in foreign funds showed a big increase in the quarter, to $8.2 billion. Earlier in the year, less than 10 percent of the money moving into funds went abroad; for the quarter, it was 30 percent, despite a very small outflow in the last two weeks.
Investors' willingness to take on risk surprised some of the "smart money" -- hedge fund and other professional money managers who had been predicting that individuals would sell shares into a declining market, magnifying the downward spiral for all. But experts say the new acceptance of risk is a reasonable strategy, as the unusually high fixed-income returns of the last decade settle into more historical ranges.
"The free ride given by the prolonged period of falling interest rates is over, and you'll have to be in stocks, foreign securities and other higher-risk investments to get good returns in the next decade," said Don Phillips, vice president of Morningstar.
That's not to say that fund investors may not yet get frightened by a prolonged bear market, or even by some events that roil the market. In fact, although money continued to flow into stock funds at the end of the quarter, the amount dropped markedly, from about $2 billion to $2.5 billion a week to less than $600 million, as the weakening dollar upset stock prices in mid-June. But inflows jumped again in the final week of the quarter, to more than $800 million, driven by big gains in aggressive growth and emerging growth funds, AMG said.
And so where from here for fund investors?
Six advisers agreed on little but one thing: that the "free ride" is indeed over and making money is not going to be as easy as before. Some urged investors to take less risk, at least in the short term, while others advised riding out the current bumpiness and aiming for the long term.
Robert D. Bingham, partner in Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough, investment advisers in San Francisco, has pulled back on equities in general, but where he sees value it is in smaller stocks. At least half of domestic equities should be invested in smaller stocks, he said, because even though they aren't the screaming buys they were three years ago, they are still relatively attractive. He likes Royce Premier, Dreyfus Small Cap Target Value and Vanguard Explorer.
Among small-cap value funds, Anthony J. Ogorek, an investment adviser in Buffalo, likes Royce Premier and Greenspring. Growth favorites of Craig Litman, a San Francisco-based adviser, are Montgomery Small Cap and Brandywine ($25,000 minimum).
But Mr. Litman says big-cap growth stocks are looking good now because valuations have lagged for more than two years. "We don't see a lot of downside risk," and the sector has upside potential in a fairly flat market, he said. Three favorites: Vanguard U.S. Growth, Janus Fund and Harbor Capital Appreciation.
By contrast, "we believe," Mr. Bingham said, "that the recent correction in the stock market hasn't been significant and the U.S. market, particularly large caps, are overpriced." So, he said, "our clients are in fewer stocks than they would normally be."
Mr. Bingham advises aggressive investors to reduce stock allocations to 50 percent from 70 percent; others, to 40 percent from 50 percent. Before starting to move back into stocks in a big way, Mr. Bingham wants price-earnings ratios to fall below 18 from today's 19.5.
Also bearish is Charles E. Cain, a New York-based adviser who would keep 50 percent in cash. He is worried about the impact on stocks if the Fed is forced to push up interest rates again, sooner than it may have planned, because of the weak dollar. He is steering money into conservative funds like Mutual Shares and Fidelity Equity Income II.
One-third cash is good enough, said Robert J. Markman, an investment adviser in Minneapolis. The rest he would split 60-40 in the United States and abroad with managers "that have shown consistent results, particularly in sloppy markets like these," he said. Three favorites: Mutual Shares, Lindner Dividend and Sogen Overseas, which is "worth the load," he said.
Since the year began, utility funds have been the only equity losers, with money flowing out in all but three weeks of the last six months. The funds are sensitive to interest rates and have been badly hurt as rates rose.
But low prices are not enough to make the group attractive to A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J. "There's a long-term issue of industrywide competition that has changed the equation that had made utilities attractive in the past," he said. The problem: deregulation and competition mean smaller dividends ahead.
In terms of investing abroad, Mr. Litman sees potential in emerging markets debt, which he said investors have been dumping unreasonably. He expects gains of roughly 15 percent in the sector over the next six months to one year, and recommends Scudder Emerging Markets Income and Fidelity New Markets Income.
Mr. Cain would split stocks equally between the United States and Japan because of "strong indications" that the Japanese market "may move onto a new uptrend." He likes Scudder Japan, Fidelity Japan and T. Rowe Price Japan.
By contrast, Mr. Markman said the long-term potential for the Pacific Rim is strong, except for Japan, where fundamentals are very negative. He likes two diversified funds: T. Rowe Price New Asia and Newport Tiger.
When it comes to bonds, the picture is very different. Money has flowed out of most bond funds in the latest quarter to the tune of $7.6 billion for taxable funds, and $10.8 billion for government bond funds. That trend reversed in late May, but most of the reversal was attributable to the attractiveness of junk bond funds, which remained strong until they dipped in the final week.
At this point, Mr. Bingham said, junk remains "a decent market to be in in any situation" for diversification. He recommends that 10 to 20 percent of the domestic bond portion of a portfolio be in junk. He likes the Vanguard and Federated High Yield funds.
As for corporate and Government bonds, short- to intermediate-term is still best, the advisers say.

HEADLINE: How Downsizing Diminishes Bennington

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Radical Answer to a Small College's Woes" (news article, June 23), on the drastic transformation of Bennington College, is uninformative. The idea of a college's attempting something like "corporate restructuring" may be amusing, but tells nothing about consequences. 
 Here is what the board of trustees has decreed: all the literary critics and scholars have been fired and the study of literary history has been terminated. Students who wish to study a foreign language or literature will have to make arrangements with local teachers or others in the not exactly cosmopolitan region of Bennington, Vt. The same arrangements must be made by students studying musical instruments. (This for a tuition of $23,000 a year.)
 Other vital disciplines have likewise been eliminated, including art history, sociology, politics and economics. The board says that the college, faced with "financial exigency," must reduce faculty and resources.
Under the most intelligent scheme this would be a perilous act; when Bennington decided to expand its faculty and enrollment in the late 1960's, it reasoned that a modern college had to achieve a minimum size and diversity to remain academically solvent. Today this principle is even more compelling: a downsized college is always in danger of losing its place in the company of respectable educational institutions.
But the way the board has gone about its trimming is imbecilic, a parody of pragmatism in which a do-it-yourself education is presented as a superior alternative to having qualified professors on hand.
A college cannot be jump-started. It is an intricate institution, whose character derives from history. Its faculty cannot be swept away in massive numbers -- there have been at least 26 firings from a faculty of 60 -- and replaced like Job's children.
We merely mention the human costs: the firing of tenured professors, who in many cases have served the college for decades, and the predicament of students, who have been robbed overnight of their education.
We received our bachelor's degrees from Bennington in literature and languages in 1992. The majority of professors with whom we studied are among those who have been fired. We are certain we are not alone in lamenting the disastrous new "reformations" that will destroy a once-great school.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBAT: BEHIND THE SCENES;
First Lady's Health Strategy: Accept Less or Gamble It All?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 4

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton faces a dilemma, and it can be summed up in a barb she once tossed at health-care lobbyists in a private bargaining session here. "We were trying to work out varying ways of dealing with some of the differences" over national health insurance, recalled Pam Bailey, who heads a coalition of hospitals and medical companies, "and suddenly she said to us: 'Bill and I did not come to Washington to fudge the issue.' "
That was January. Now, in July, many experts say a national health insurance plan will be passed by Congress only if the Clintons fudge the issue, relaxing their bottom-line demand that the insurance cover everyone and casting the passage of a less ambitious plan as a victory for society. If the Clintons hold firm, they will be taking a high-stakes political gamble that they may easily lose. It is a contest of politics and principle, and it is the mark of Mrs. Clinton that principle remains a contender, at least in the minds of people who know her well. 
 It is also why some suggest that Mrs. Clinton, whose tenacity many credit with pushing health care to the House and Senate doorsteps, is less suited for the double-jointed bargaining that is probably needed if an insurance plan is to become law.
"Her biggest attributes are also her biggest weaknesses," said a Democratic Senator at the center of the political debate. "I think she's a person with very firm convictions. I think her husband is much more willing to say: 'I've got to compromise. I've got to get things done.' "
Of course, this is the stereotype of the Clintons: the inflexible, ideological and rather lawyerly First Lady as spine-stiffener for a malleable, anxious-to-please President. Some White House officials say that portrait is a half-truth and that Mrs. Clinton's poker face is just the mask of an extremely tough negotiator.
In the White House, aides say, she is the senior adviser and senior strategist on health care, meeting every few days with the President and perhaps a dozen policy aides and political advisers to map the legislative and public-relations campaigns. She meets somewhat less often with Democratic leaders and individual legislators in Congress.
"She's a pragmatist," said an official who has worked on the plan, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "She won't send health care down the tubes -- no doubt about it. For one thing, she doesn't want to blow her husband's Presidency after two years in office. And face it, that's what this is."
Mrs. Clinton will not tip her hand one way or the other. In the midst of a speaking campaign for the Administration health plan, she declined last week to be interviewed. Still, with national health insurance on the brink of epochal legislative victory, or maybe ruinous defeat, she seems unflinching so far.
That stance is most notable on the major sticking point in the negotiations: the repeated warning that Mr. Clinton will veto legislation that does not guarantee insurance to everyone.
 
Firm Opposition
 The notion of guaranteed insurance is popular, in part because it would spread insurance costs over the entire population and simplify accounting. But its political prospects seem dim to some because the small-business lobby, most Republicans and some Democrats oppose the only realistic ways to get there: raising taxes, or forcing people to buy insurance against their will.
In a White House meeting three Sundays ago, on June 19, both Mrs. Clinton and the President sharply rejected advice by some political and economic advisers that the time for bargaining was running out and that the odds against passing legislation would rise unless some movement was made toward an accord with opponents on universal coverage.
Mrs. Clinton went into private meetings to give fist-shaking speeches to supporters in unions, consumer groups and retired people's organizations, warning that universal health coverage was in grave danger. That helped stall one attempt in the Senate Finance Committee to back away from guaranteed insurance.
The Senators said nothing publicly, but some who believe that guaranteed insurance is politically unrealistic were privately furious. "We would have been in the reality zone a long time ago," said one senior aide, had it not been for what he called Mrs. Clinton's "health care cult."
Whether this is standing on principle or simply political calculus is hard to tell. "What in the world is she supposed to do?" asked a second Democratic Senate aide. "The President has said he will veto a bill that doesn't have universal coverage. That's her position, too."
If it is a ploy, it is the wrong one, said Ms. Bailey, whose Health Care Leadership Council opposes many features of the Administration's plan. She argued that inflexibility had only stiffened the resolve of Democratic supporters without luring votes from other factions.
"If she'd been more in a consensus-building mode earlier, we could have moved this a lot earlier," she said. "At the end of day, she's going to have to help sell a compromise to the very groups she's been working closest with from the beginning."
 
Criticizing Her Leadership
 Some outsiders, and even some Administration advisers, now say that whatever Mrs. Clinton's strengths, the White House decision to place its entire health care agenda in the hands of the strong-willed First Lady has resulted in a plan that will be harder to sell.
"I would periodically hear from people outside and inside the Administration who had fundamental qualms about some aspect of the plan and weren't going to raise it because of who she was," said Gail Wilensky, a health care adviser in the Bush Administration who is now a senior fellow at Project HOPE, an international charity. "Nobody was going to cross Hillary Clinton."
While Mrs. Clinton can appear inflexible and even didactic on this issue, many experts say health-care legislation would probably not be an overriding issue this summer -- for the first time in almost 30 years -- had she not been so fervent.
By the count of her aides, the First Lady has spoken on behalf of national health insurance to nearly 300 local and national groups in 30 states since the Clintons' political crusade began last year. Her summer schedule is salted with meetings with important health care constituencies.
A sampling of speeches, supplied by her office, shows that they can be preachy. Mrs. Clinton talks about people who were denied care for lack of insurance, including one heartbreaking account of a child who died of meningitis as a result. But she is quite capable of appealing to logic as well. Before the Economic Club of Washington last week, without a prepared text or notes, she gave an almost seamless economic analysis of health care for some 30 minutes, never even pausing for an "uh."
Medical costs, she argued, will overwhelm the public and the Government unless they are controlled, and medical costs cannot be controlled until the uninsured pay their share of the bill. Therefore, everyone must be insured.
"Like Ronald Reagan before her," said John Rother, an Clinton ally who is the chief lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons, "she understands that to be in the strongest possible position, you've got to state your case forcefully and as much on principle as you can."
No one disputes that Mrs. Clinton has been a superior saleswoman for national health insurance. To the extent questions exist, they turn on whether zealousness and a steamroller approach can succeed in a town whose motto is "split the difference."
 
Standing Her Ground
 "When she thinks she's right, she'll stand her ground with anybody," said Charlie Cole Chaffin, who served with Mrs. Clinton when she led an education task force in Arkansas and who is now a candidate for lieutenant governor there.
But in Washington, Mrs. Clinton's singlemindedness in pursuing what she sees as right has hurt politically. She was roundly criticized last year when, as her husband touted his efforts to form a bureaucracy that looked like America, she summoned 500 experts and political allies to Washington to research and draft health-care legislation in secret.
The result was a 240,000-word bill that attacked health care costs with price controls and new Government boards. Conservatives pounded on it as we-know-best bureaucracy run amok. Although Mrs. Clinton campaigned for it and the White House said ordinary Americans would soon rally behind it, the groundswell never developed and Congress has since discarded large chunks of it.
To save what remains -- especially the commitment to universal coverage that is in most of the plans now moving to the House and Senate floors -- the Clintons clearly are betting that public support will sweep away political resistance.
Supporters liken the coming health-insurance debate to the great debates over social legislation in the 1960's, when tides of citizen activism washed away opposition to laws protecting civil rights, health care for the elderly and care for the poor. The job of rallying the troops is likely to fall to Mrs. Clinton, who will intensify her speaking schedule once Congress begins to address legislation seriously.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 7, 1994, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
(July 6, 1994, Wednesday) A chart yesterday describing the work of Congressional committees on health care gave an incomplete description of legislation proposed by the House Education and Labor Committee. In addition to a version of President Clinton's plan, the committee also approved a bill that would create a Canadian-style single-payer system. This bill would provide all Americans with a standard package of benefits, paid for by a payroll tax of 8.4 percent on big companies and 4 percent on small ones, a 2.1 percent tax on incomes, an increase of the cigarette tax to $2 and a tax on ammunition.
Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about Hillary Rodham Clinton's health care efforts referred incorrectly to the beneficiaries of Project Hope. The organization -- which employs Gail Wilensky, a former Bush Administration health care adviser who was quoted -- provides health care assistance to developing countries, not to residents of public housing in America.

Chart: "THE DETAILS: The State of the Health Care Debate: Five Committees, Four Bills"
 When theSenate Finance Committee approved a healthcare bill onSaturdya, it brought to an end the first round of Congressional action on the subject. Five committees considered the plan put forward last fall by President Clinton. One, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, deadlocked and produced no bill. The bills approved by the four others will now go the Democratic leadership to be melded into proposals that will be presented on the House and Senate floors in late July or August. Below is a comparison of the major provisions of the Clinton plan and the bills that emerged form the committees.
 
CLINTON PLAN
 
BENEFITS: Basic benefit package includes doctor, hospital and emergency services; some coverage for mental health and drug and alcohol abuse; prescription drugs; rehabilitation services; hospice, home health and extended nursing care services; preventive care, and lab and diagnostic services.
 
ALLIANCES: Requires most Americans to obtaincoverage through regional insurance purchasing alliances. All companies with 5,000 or fewer employees must buy coverage through an alliance.
 
FINANCING: Requiresw employers to pay about 80 percent of the costs of the average health insurance plan in their areas for a single person and about 55 percent of the cost of the average family plan, but no more than 7.9 percent of their payrolls. Companies with 75 or fewer employees and average annualwages of less than $24,000 are eligible for subsidies that limit employers' costs to 3.5 percent to 7.9 percent of the payroll. Individuals pay up to 20 percent of the premiums.
 
TAXES: Requires a 1 percent payroll tax oncompanies with 5,000 or more workers. Raises the current 24 cents-a-pack cigarette tax by 75 cents, to 99 cents.
 
SENATE LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCES
 
STATUS: Approved by committee June 9.
 
BENEFITS: Follows outlines of Clintonpackage but provides additional benefits for women, children, the disabled, low-income people and for mental health and drug and alcohol abuse. Provides increased coverage for preventive examinations and long-term nursing home care.
 
ALLIANCES: Individuals have three options: 1. buying private insurance; 2. participating in states' consumer health purchasing cooperatives, or 3. participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, which currently offers a variety of insurance options.
 
FINANCING: As in Clinton plan, most companies pay 80 percent of the average premium for individuals and 55 percent for families. Businesses with a low average wage and fewer than six workers are exempt and instead pay a 2 percent payroll tax; their employees buy their own insurance but pay no more than 4 percent to 6 percent of their annual wages.
 
TAXES: Requires companies with 1,000 or more employees to pay a 1 percent payroll tax. Increases the cigarette tax to $1.49.
 SENATE FINANCE
 
STATUS: Approved Saturday
 
BENEFITS: Provides a standard package of benefits, comparable to those provided now to Federal workers. Includes a new home health care benefit for the disabled.
 
ALLIANCES: Creates voluntary insurance purchasing pool open to individuals and small businesses.
 
FINANCING: No mandate for employers. If changes ininsurance rules, subsidies and voluntary measures do not produce coverage of 95 percent of Americans by 2002, a national commission makes recommendations to Congress on how to go further.
 
TAXES: Increases the cigarette tax to $1.24. A 1.75 percent tax on insurance premiums supports academic medical centers. Raises $14 billion to $17 billion over five years through a tax on high-cost insurance plans. Affluent Medicare recipients face higher premiums and co-payments.
 
HOUSE EDUCATION AND LABOR
 
STATUS: Approved June 23.
 
BENEFITS: Follows outlines of Clinton package, but expands benefits for mental illness, dental coverage and women's and children's care.
 
ALLIANCES: Eliminates mandatory alliances, replacing them with consumer purchasing cooperatives established by the states on either a voluntary or a mandatory basis. Companies with 1,000 or more employees are excluded from the cooperatives and are permitted to establish their own plans.
 
FINANCING: Retains the Clinton provision but provides greater subsidies for the smallest employers, who are not required to pay more than 2 percent of their payrolls.
 
TAXES: Requires a 1 percent assessment of employers of more than 1,000 workers. Retains the tax recommendations in the Clinton package.
 
HOSE WAYS AND MEANS
 
STATUS: Approved Thursday
 
BENEFITS: Less generous than the Clinton plan. The basic package would include everything covered under the current Medicare program, plus coverage of prescription drugs, improved mental health and drug and alcohol abuse benefits, pregnancy-related services and preventive services for children.
 
ALLIANCES: Expands Medicare to allow individuals not covered elsewhere to enroll in a new Part C. States have the option of creating mandatory alliances.
 
FINANCING: Retains the requirement inthe Clinton package that employers pay up to 80 percent of premiums for their employees. Allows employers with more than 100 employees to insure themselves. Provides tax credits to small businesses: inthe case of companies with 25 or fewer employees, the maximum credit reduces the employer share to 40 percent of premium costs; for companies with 26 to 50 employees, employers could pay as little as 50 percent of premium costs.
 
TAXES: Increases the tobacco tax by 45 cents by 1999. Imposes a 2 percent tax on premiums.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Quarterly Review;
Vanguard's Ace Stock Picker Is Back on Top

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: VALLEY FORGE, Pa.

 BODY:
JOHN B. NEFF, the man behind Vanguard's giant Windsor fund, has been vindicated this year after a highly publicized slump.
"He has had a good turnaround, not only on an absolute basis but when compared with his peers," said Ken Gregory, editor of the No-Load Fund Analyst, an industry newsletter based in San Francisco. 
 Mr. Neff's approach, buying stocks that are underpriced, has never changed. But that style, called value investing, fell out of favor for several years, and even when the fund advanced in 1991, it lagged behind competitors. Some analysts began to wonder whether Mr. Neff and some like-minded managers, including Michael Price of the Mutual Series Fund, had lost their touch.
"You don't like to stink, obviously, and we did quite badly in '89 and '90," Mr. Neff said in an interview at his Vanguard office here.
But as Mr. Neff's 30-year record at Windsor suggested, the tide would turn -- eventually. Among stock funds seeking growth and income, Windsor posted the best performance for the second quarter, with a 3.8 percent total return. Among all mutual funds with more than $5 billion in assets, the $11 billion Windsor fund is on top for the quarter and for the year.
Of the down years, Mr. Neff complains not of an overdemanding or fickle public, but of a stock market that was irrational. It assumed the worst about the battered bank and savings and loan group in which he had sunk 30 percent of assets.
The ensuing rally in that sector mocked the theory, beloved in academe and ridiculed on Wall Street, that security analysis had become such an exact science that one software-armed portfolio manager was as good as another.
"Everybody's got a master's degree now and there are computers and instantaneous electronics and history that's been well massaged," Mr. Neff said, putting aside a copy of Value Line, an advisory service he peruses regularly for corporate snapshots. "But the market still isn't very efficient, very intelligent or very bright."
Mr. Neff's investing approach relies on uncovering hidden value in downtrodden stocks and on a willingness to back decisions with exceptionally large bets. No timid diversification for Windsor, which in the halcyon 1980's attracted so much money that it has been closed to new investors since 1989.
His fans, though, have alternatives. Mr. Neff also manages Gemini II, a closed-end investment company trading on the New York Stock Exchange with a portfolio similar to Windsor's, albeit with more convertible bonds. For added attraction, Gemini II sells at about a 12 percent discount, which becomes guaranteed profit when it converts to an open-end fund in January 1997.
A paler alternative is Windsor II, which follows the Neff value-oriented approach but is run by four outside managers. It rose 2.6 percent in the second quarter.
In sizing up a company, Mr. Neff looks at the rate of earnings growth, the price-earnings ratio and dividend. This is preceded, of course, by his analysis of economic conditions, which occupies 25 percent of his time.
"You have to be half an economist and be able to develop some convictions to capitalize on your portfolio," Mr. Neff said.
Suggesting the Federal Reserve has hit it about right in raising short-term rates, he has wagered that no rate increases are imminent despite the weakness of the dollar, which he considers "undervalued." In fact, he recently bought a bunch of 14-year Treasuries, a rather unusual wager for stock-oriented Windsor.
While Mr. Neff's comeback has been powered by financial stocks -- and aided by positions in Chrysler, the oil and gas sector, chemicals and European issues -- he contends that the banks have a lot further to go.
"What you've seen so far is recovery from an unduly low point," Mr. Neff said. Most banks still sell at just half the average price-earnings multiple. Because they are loaded with capital, he expects them to be actively repurchasing shares and raising dividends by 12 to 14 percent a year. Windsor, consequently, has 20 percent of its portfolio in the sector.
The fund is also investing heavily in Atlantic Richfield, a position that went from nothing to the legal maximum of 5 percent in just a few months. The reasoning is that ARCO stock, which the fund has bought and sold five times previously over three decades, offers the highest leveraged play on the price of crude oil and has not yet risen in response to the latest jump in oil.
Windsor is building a fresh position in technology, with a speculative parlay in Seagate, Intel and Advanced Micro, which have been beaten down to the point that they sell as a group for about eight times 1994 earnings.
Mr. Neff, who will be 63 in September, could certainly afford to retire -- his holdings of Windsor and Gemini II alone are worth some $90 million. But a life of full-time travel, golf and tennis on his court at home is not yet in sight.
When it comes, there seems little doubt that his successor will be Charles T. Freeman, the assistant portfolio manager who has worked with Mr. Neff for 25 years and weathered the bear market of 1973 and '74.
Big-time investing "isn't like finding the ultimate microprocessor and coasting for 30 years," said Mr. Neff, who took over when Windsor was a $75 million fledgling. "It's as big and broad as life itself."

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Mutual Funds Quarterly Review pages of Business Day on Tuesday about John B. Neff, the money manager of the Vanguard Group's Windsor mutual fund and the Gemini II closed-end fund, misstated the value of his holdings in the two funds. They total about $6 million, not $90 million.

HEADLINE: In Shift, U.S. Will No Longer Admit Haitians at Sea

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5

 BODY:
After a sharp increase in the number of Haitians seeking asylum, the Clinton Administration abruptly shifted policy today and said it would no longer allow refugees intercepted at sea to be resettled in the United States.
Instead, Haitians fleeing by boat who qualify for asylum will be taken to Panama or other Caribbean countries until the political crisis in their country is resolved. 
 "Those who take to the boats will not have resettlement possibilities in the United States," William H. Gray 3d, President Clinton's top adviser on Haiti, said at the White House.
The new policy comes just three weeks after the Administration stopped returning all those picked up at sea to Haiti and began hearing their claims for asylum aboard Navy ships. That move was part of a broader shift aimed at mollifying critics like Randall Robinson, who went on a hunger strike and protested that the Administration was ignoring the plight of Haitians who opposed the military Government.
Some experts warned then that the policy might set off a mass exodus. In fact, the State Department says, more than 10,000 Haitians have been picked up at sea since June 15.
With the policy announced today, the Administration has in effect tried to buy time by handling the flow of Haitians in a humane way while it waits to see if economic sanctions will force out the military. Under the new policy, only Haitians applying for asylum at the United States Embassy in Port-au-Prince will be eligible for settlement in the United States.
"If we're going to be able to withstand the surge in refugee outflow, we've got to do things to discourage that as well as to absorb them," a State Department official said. "Now you can make it to ship, but that ship's going to Panama, not a U.S. base. These countries are not necessarily an improvement over Haiti."
The Pentagon said today that it was sending four ships carrying 2,000 marines to join the flotilla near Haiti so they could rescue any Americans who might be in danger. The marines returned just 10 days ago from six months in the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean. The decision to send them to Haiti marked an unusual departure for the Navy, which has sought to limit time at sea.
While Mr. Gray described the dispatch of the marines as a precuation, he acknowledged that the White House was keeping open the option of a military intervention.
"There is no military invasion imminent," Mr. Gray said. "However, the military option is on the table. 'Imminent' is defined as something that is going to happen in a few days."
The United States has been screening refugees at Guantanamo Bay and on a hospital ship anchored at Kingston, Jamaica; another center is to be opened soon in the Turk and Caicos Islands.
"They will be processed to seek to learn whether or not, just as we have been doing over the last few weeks, there is a real and credible fear with regard to political persecution," Mr. Gray said. "Those who are found to have such a fear, those who are granted asylum, that asylum will be granted at the refugee camp in Panama, and later, as we bring on board other safe havens, they will be granted status there."
Those that do not qualify will be sent back to Haiti.
Other Administration officials said, however, that the precise standards for deciding who would be sent to Panama and who would be returned to Haiti were still being worked out. The standards for sending Haitians to Panama may be less strict than those for admission to the United States.
At first the Haitians sent to Panama will be housed on United States military bases; eventually, they may be moved to an island off Panama. Mr. Gray said the United States and Panama had agreed on a limit of 10,000 refugees sent to Panama.
The Panama plan is being supported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and American officials expect that group to play a major role in running the camps.
Other camps are to be set up in Antigua and Dominica and possibly elsewhere, State Department officials said.
 
Criticism by Rights Groups
 Arthur C. Helton, the director of the migration program at the Open Society Institute in New York, urged the Administration not to screen the Haitians too strictly.
"Screening people in the midst of flight has failed and will fail again," he warned.
Amnesty International today assailed the move, saying Haitians face tougher standards than other groups in trying to settle in the United States.
"It appears that the Clinton Administration and the U.S. Congress are still afraid of Haitian refugees," said the Rev. William F. Schulz, executive director of Amnesty International U.S.A.
But an Administration official rejected this criticism, insisting that Washington was being true to the logic of its policy: that Haitians who have reason to fear persecution will be granted a refuge.
"The fundamental policy is to provide protection to those who need protection," the official said. "The means were adjusted today to make that policy more workable."
 
As the Odds Improve
 In recent weeks, about a third of the fleeing Haitians have been given refugee status in the United States. According to the State Department, of the 1,705 refugees who have been interviewed in Kingston, 515 have been approved for refugee status and 1,190 have been denied.
The possibility of asylum has prompted many more Haitians to flee. On Monday, the United States reported picking up more than 3,000.
Administration officials noted, however, that if the Haitians continue to take to the seas, camps throughout the region will soon be filled, and there will be new pressure on Washington to consider military action to remove the military leaders of Haiti.

Chart: "FOR THE RECORD: The Administration on Haiti"
 President Clinton on May 8, announcing the policy of interviewing Haitian refugees at sea:
 "I have become increasingly concerned that Haiti's declining human rights situation may endanger the safety of those who have valid fears of political persecution, who flee by boat, and who are then returned to Haiti, where they are met at the docks by Haitian authorities before they can be referred to in-country processing. Therefore, I have decided to modify our procedures. We will continue to interdict all Haitian migrants at sea, but we will determine aboard ship or in other countries which ones are bona fide political refugees. Those who are not will still be returned to Haiti, but those who are will be provided refuge. We will also approach other countries to seek their participation in this humanitarian endeavor."
 William Gray, special envoy to Haiti, announcing a change of policy yesterday:
 "What we are providing is a safe haven -- safety from persecution and from the fear of persecution for all. Those who take to the boats will be offered safe haven in camps in Panama. Those who go to in-country processing sites will be offered the potential for resettlement after the processing in the
United States." (pg. A8)

HEADLINE: Colleges Caught in Middle As Parents Seek Best Deal

BYLINE: WILLIAM CELIS 3d 

 BODY:
To get into the college of his choice, Lyndon Allin knew that he needed good grades, high scores on his college entrance examination and a lot of financial aid. He also needed some gamesmanship.
Mr. Allin, one of the nation's top-ranked high school graduates, was accepted by some of the nation's leading institutions. Northwestern University, which costs $24,283 a year, offered him $8,700 in scholarships and loans; Vanderbilt University offered $13,000, about half its annual costs. 
 But Duke University, on which Mr. Allin had set his sights, offered him just $2,140 to help cover its $25,487 annual costs. So Mr. Allin called Duke about the competing bids, noting as he had in his aid application that his family's financial status might soon worsen. The next day, he said, Duke increased its offer to $14,250 a year, saying it had erred in calculating his aid package.
Duke does not bargain with students over financial aid, said James A. Belvin Jr., Duke's financial aid director. But, Mr. Belvin said, it is always willing to review aid packages if there are changes in a family's financial status.
And students like Mr. Allin are bombarding colleges and universities with calls for such reviews, playing one institution against another, pointing up their own merits and their financial needs as would-be undergraduates.
Mr. Allin, for example, was the 1994 valedictorian of Woodrow Wilson High School in Washington. He is a National Merit Scholar whose combined score of 1510 out of 1600 on his Scholastic Assessment Test for college admissions put him in the top 1 percent of all high school graduates.
"You have these cards and you have to play them," said Mr. Allin, whose father, a retired Federal employee, and mother, who works for a nonprofit foundation, declined to disclose their combined incomes. "I'm being a good consumer."
But such consumerism is fast becoming a nightmare for college financial aid officials. The combination of high college costs and smaller amounts of available aid has particularly made higher education more expensive for the middle class. Some families will seemingly try any bargaining ploy to pry a few more dollars out of an institution.
 
About 60% Receive Aid
 "Parents are not just willing to say that my kid is an extremely good student and take what they get in financial aid," said Lynn Caldwell, director of counseling at the Highland Park Independent School District in a Dallas suburb and a former member of the College Board's committee studying financial aid issues. "It's a consumer-conscious market."
Nearly 60 percent of all full-time college students receive some type of aid, according to a Federal Education Department survey in 1990, the last available. Given higher college costs and dwindling aid, that figure could grow by two percentage points when the department's new survey is released later this year, college aid officials say.
To insure that all needy students receive the aid they needed and to curb bartering, the Ivy League and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for decades met to compare their aid awards to the same student. The Justice Department called that practice anti-competitive and had it halted in 1992. But last year M.I.T. won right to compare financial data with other institutions, with some restrictions. Financial aid officials said that would help cool the wheeling and dealing that occurs among all universities.
 
Reports of Financial Woes
 But still, the competition has heated up for top students among colleges in the second and third tiers. Indeed, as families demand more aid or push for more scholarships over loans, some applicants and their parents do not think twice about faxing competing offers to colleges and writing at the bottom: "Can You Match This?"
College officials also tell of families who will call the same aid office several times a day, literally sobbing into the telephone for more aid.
Last month Tennessee Tech University in Cookeville received calls from the parents of two students who said that religious beliefs prevented them from accepting loans. They asked the university to eliminate the loans from their children's financial aid packages and replace them with scholarships. Tennessee Tech balked.
"There are things happening out there that would curl your hair," said Elizabeth Coleman, president of Bennington College in Bennington, Vt., which last month announced restructuring plans that included reducing its tuition, now $25,800 a year, by 10 percent over five years to help increase enrollment. "We make our decision, and that's it."
Still, some institutions encourage families by bidding for students who offer special skills or come from minorities, and both economics and demographics explain why institutions fan the competitive war for good students.
Nearly 2.3 million students graduated from high school this year, a level that has remained relatively flat in the 1990's and is down by nearly a half million students from the early 1980's. Second- and third-tier colleges and universities rely more on enrollment to generate revenue than do their larger rivals, where enrollment revenue is overshadowed by income from endowments.
 
Meeting Enrollment Goals
 As a result, the smaller institutions -- and sometimes even the pre-eminent giants -- will enrich financial aid packages to insure that they get all the freshmen they need to meet their enrollment goals. But even institutions that do not have the money to award scholarships do so anyway -- by discounting tuition.
While every institution has a fixed amount of scholarship money available to apportion among needy students, the number of discounted tuitions that can be made is limited only by the institution's ability to absorb the lost revenue.
The practice of offering discounts is defended by the institutions.
"We don't like to do it," said Michael White, financial aid director at Coe College, a liberal arts institution in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which says it will look at competing offers presented by students and occasionally increase aid. "The reality is you still need to meet your enrollment objectives to keep the college functioning. It's a revenue question."
The haggling over financial aid noticeably surfaced in the 1980's as college costs began climbing, sometimes outstripping the rate of inflation. It has accelerated in the last five years, and more colleges have crossed the $20,000- and $25,000-a-year thresholds in total costs.
At some institutions, like Dickinson, a private liberal arts college in Carlisle, Pa., which costs $25,670 a year for tuition, room, board and fees, the bargaining "has easily doubled over the last five years," said Donald Raley, the college's financial aid director.
Congress unwittingly gave the jockeying new impetus two years ago when, as part of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965, lawmakers ordered the Education Department to simplify its financial aid forms. The new form asks fewer questions about a family's finances.
Gone, for example, is the question on home-ownership. That is important, financial aid officials said, because families that own their dwellings can take out home equity loans and assume a greater part of college costs.
Some colleges and universities have added the home-ownership question to their own financial aid forms while others have not. As a result, disparities of several thousand dollars in college aid packages arise from institutions working with different financial data from the same student. Thus, the bidding begins.
 
Offer as Bargaining Tool
 At Dickinson, for example, one father called trying to sweeten his son's financial aid package. Mr. Raley said the father told him that the son was not interested in Dickinson but wanted to use its financial aid offer to squeeze more money out of Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, which his son wished to attend.
"After I closed my mouth, I told him to take his approach elsewhere," Mr. Raley said. "It was so tacky."
Coe and Buena Vista College, a small private liberal art college in Storm Lake, Iowa, can top that. Last month, a Buena Vista officials said, a mother berated the college for not sending her son a financial aid award while Coe had. Never mind that the son had never even submitted the forms to Buena Vista, the officials said. Leanne Valentine, the director of financial aid at Buena Vista, called Coe to ask for a copy of the student's financial aid forms. The student was clearly bright, having scored 30 out of a possible 36 on the American College Test, and had received a substantial award from Coe, which costs $18,440 a year.
But as Buena Vista began reviewing the financial data, the mother called Coe, telling officials that Buena Vista had put together a financial aid package covering all but $200 of its $17,103 annual cost and that all of it was in the form of a scholarship.
Not true, said Ms. Valentine, who said she learned of her college's phantom offer when she telephoned Coe officials for the student's financial aid documents.
The student eventually enrolled in Coe, which did not increase his aid package.
Relieved that the ordeal was over, Ms. Valentine of Buena Vista, said, "To be honest, I was thankful that this student did not come here."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mixed on Hints Nations Don't Plan Support

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed against leading currencies yesterday amid signs that leading industrial nations would not take steps to support the dollar when they meet later this week in Naples.
A draft of the economic document to be considered at the meeting of the Group of Seven made no mention of the dollar. Instead, it called for looser regulation of the world's labor market, freer trade and continued support for economic reforms in Russia. 
 "It looks like the dollar will be left vulnerable," said Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst with Smith Barney Inc.
The dollar was quoted in late trading yesterday at 1.5810 German marks, down almost 2 pfennigs, or 1.1 percent, from 1.5972 marks on Monday in European trading. United States markets were closed on Monday in observance of the Fourth of July.
The dollar settled at 99 yen yesterday, up from 98.75 in New York on Friday.
Traders were less willing to sell the dollar aggressively against the yen because it is near the post-World War II low of 97.73 yen set in Tokyo on Friday. Trading was sluggish yesterday as many market participants had not yet returned from the holiday weekend.
Speculation that the Group of Seven would mount a dollar rescue faded after President Clinton was quoted as saying that "great care should be taken before unusual actions are taken" to prop up the dollar. Mr. Clinton's comments came in a transcript of an interview with foreign reporters on Friday, which the White House released on Monday. "Over the long run, the markets tend to align with market realities," the President said.
 
Less Backing Seen
 So far this year, the dollar has fallen 9 percent against the mark and 11 percent against the yen.
"It's becoming clear that no one wants to do anything to support the dollar," said Amy Smith, senior currency market strategist at IDEA, a consulting firm. "It looks like the G-7 is having the meeting only because they have to."
The dollar fell against other currencies yesterday. The British pound was quoted at $1.5440 late in the day, up from $1.5390. The dollar fell to 5.4180 French francs from 5.4700, and weakened to 1.3260 Swiss francs from 1.3403 francs. It fell to 1,566 Italian lire from 1,584. The Canadian dollar was steady at 72.09 United States cents.

HEADLINE: Drownings of Haitians Rise As Island Exodus Continues

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, July 5

 BODY:
As the number of Haitians seeking to flee the country by boat continues to rise, the number of people drowning at sea is also mounting.
Many here say that rough seas and the flimsiness of the craft many Haitians use in attempting their flight will create even more casualties if the exodus of people by boats continues. 
 In the latest accident, about 150 people drowned on Monday near the coastal city of St.-Marc, about 100 miles northwest of Port-au-Prince, the capital. According to news reports and diplomats, more than 300 people were crammed aboard a 40-foot vessel when rough waves capsized it.
The danger is all too familiar to Haitians, who refer to attempts to flee by sea as "taking a shark visa."
 
Four Killings a Day
 For many here, a boat trip, despite its risks, is more attractive than staying in Haiti, where military leaders have increased their campaign of terror. Every morning at least four mutilated bodies are found in the capital. A common method of killing is to put a bullet through the temple. The victims' arms are usually tied behind their backs and the bodies are dumped in garbage heaps.
Human rights workers here say that the campaign of violence increased last fall, after the military realized that diplomatic efforts to restore the country's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, had failed.
The terror campaign, aimed largely at wiping out resistance to the military's rule, has relied on other techniques, like raping women and burning down entire neighborhoods, human rights workers say. The workers say as many as 20 rapes a month have been reported in recent months.
In a communique issued late Monday, the military-backed government of Emile Jonassaint accused the United States Coast Guard of picking up Haitian fishermen at sea in an attempt to inflate the official figures on the number of Haitians trying to flee.
United States officials here deny the assertion strongly.
"That's ridiculous," said Stanley Schrager, an American Embassy spokesman. "This de facto government is obviously embarrassed by the number of people leaving."
 
Highest One-Day Total
 On Monday 3,247 Haitians were interdicted by Coast Guard cutters patrolling the Windward Passage. It was the largest number of refugees picked up in a single day since Haitians began to take to the seas in large numbers after the coup that overthrew Father Aristide.
The United States Embassy has expanded a radio campaign in which it broadcasts messages intended to discourage Haitians from fleeing. The minute-long Creole-language broadcasts, which began June 13, tell Haitians that economic refugees will not receive asylum, that the United States is not "a land where the streets are paved with gold" and that Haitians can apply for asylum at one of the three processing centers in Haiti.
The latest exodus of Haitians began after President Clinton announced on May 8 that he was reversing his policy of summarily returning Haitians without first granting them an interview to judge whether they should be granted refugee status.
In a move intended to discourage the tide of boat people, the Administration announced today that it would no longer accept Haitian refugees to the United States. Instead, Haitians picked up at sea will be granted an interview and those deemed to be fleeing economic hardship will be returned to Haiti. Those determined to have a well-founded fear of persecution if they are returned will be sent to temporary camps in Panama until Father Aristide is returned to Haiti.
While the main destination of those who flee has been the United States, advocates of refugee rights say that the new policy will not significantly reduce the number of boat people, many of whom are escaping a wave of terror and increasing economic hardship.
"It's a terrible tragedy," said Anne Fuller, associate director of the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees. "There is no easy way to stop it. We have to make it so that people don't have a reason to leave."

HEADLINE: Clinton Focusing on the World Economy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5

 BODY:
President Clinton declared today that United States security and the success of his Presidency are tied to economic growth worldwide, and that the major industrial nations have a rare chance "to create jobs in a world of prosperity."
Just before leaving for Europe and the annual summit meeting of the seven major industrial democracies, Mr. Clinton used a gathering of business leaders and diplomats at the Commerce Department to make the case that his policies have revived the economy and asserted global leadership. 
 "Now we have to use this new-found strength to address how to give the citizens of our nation and all other nations the confidence they need to prosper in uncertain times," he said. "We have to move from coping with crises to planning for prosperity.
"In other words, we have to lay the foundation for the 21st-century economy, one in which change will be the order of the day, and the real question will be whether change is our friend or our enemy."
 
Begins Eight-Day Trip
 Mr. Clinton left Washington this evening for an eight-day trip, beginning with a speech in Riga, Latvia, and a stop in Warsaw before the four-day economic summit meeting begins Friday in Naples. Afterward he will stop in Bonn and Berlin, giving a speech at the Brandenburg Gate, which once marked the line between the free and Communist sectors.
Today Mr. Clinton sought to unite all the stops under a single theme: that the ability of the United States to promote economic expansion is the key to peace and political stability worldwide. That message plays to the Administration's foreign-policy strengths -- increasing trade and investment -- and by implication plays down its changeable and less fruitful military policies in Haiti and Bosnia.
Asserting pointedly that a "decade of drift" in Washington's fiscal policy had made it impossible for the industrial powers to take concerted economic actions, Mr. Clinton said his policies had rebuilt Washington's credibility and ended the summit meetings' recent status as high-powered photo opportunities.
"For a decade, our out-of-control budget deficit robbed us of the standing to press our partners to act," he said. "Well now, instead of having the biggest deficit in the G-7, we have among the smallest." G-7 is bureaucratic shorthand for the Group of Seven, as the members style themselves.
Mr. Clinton was referring to one common yardstick of government debt, the ratio between a nation's annual budget deficit and its gross domestic product. In absolute terms, the United States' $4.5 trillion Federal debt and its $200 billion-or-so deficit for the current fiscal year dwarf those of the six other countries.
The President also pointed to a tentative accord lowering trade barriers and the North American Free Trade Agreement as evidence that he has etched his foreign policy in economic terms.
Indeed he said "the purpose of my Presidency" is to harness sweeping changes in trade, technology and economic growth for the world's benefit.
Mr. Clinton estimated that if the industrial nations carry out the new world trade agreement, it will create 500,000 jobs in the United States and reduce tariffs by nearly $750 billion over the next decade.
"We have shown that bit by bit, year by year, the decisions made at these G-7 meetings can change the world," he added.
Mr. Clinton said the leaders are also to begin planning what he called the "nerve system" of the new economy -- global computer networks to exchange ideas and money. They also will discuss environmental concerns and will meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia to explore ways to integrate western economies with those of eastern Europe.

HEADLINE: Business Leaders Urge Gun Restrictions

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 5

 BODY:
Gun control is good for the economy, business leaders said today, adding their voices to those urging passage of new gun restrictions by the Legislature.
Gun control "is a public safety issue, but it is also an economic development issue of the first order," said Timothy J. Moynihan, president of the Greater Hartford Chamber of Commerce. 
 On the eve of a special legislative session, Mr. Moynihan and about a dozen other business and community leaders gathered at the state Capitol to urge passage of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s gun control package.
Violence in Hartford's neighborhoods has hurt business and life in the city's downtown and led some residents and businesses to leave the area, the business officials said.
Mr. Moynihan asked gun owners and sportsmen to join the efforts to win passage of Governor Weicker's proposal to tighten the flow of handguns and stiffen the penalties for gun-related crimes.
"The bill is directed at the criminal use of weapons . . . not at the sportsmen," said Mr. Moynihan.

HEADLINE: THE SIMPSON CASE: THE HOMETOWN;
Where Thoughts of Simpson Linger

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 2

 BODY:
At the Potrero Terrace Market, a short uphill walk from where O. J. Simpson grew up in a housing project, Jack Woo watched the first week of televised court proceedings against his former customer and offered his own snap analysis. "So far, so good," Mr. Woo said. "Not much evidence against O. J."
He remembers an 8-year-old boy who used to come in, the picture of politeness and youthful energy. "Give me a bubble gum, Mr. Woo; give me Bazooka bubble gum," the market owner, now 70, recalled his words. 
 Mr. Woo also remembers, many years later, a sleek black limousine slowing at the curb outside his store. Mr. Simpson, now a famous sports figure, rolled down his back-seat window to offer an outstretched hand.
The corner food market is one of the landmarks of Mr. Simpson's youth, and it is flooded with memories. Simpson family members still visit, sometimes to shop, sometimes to banter. Mr. Simpson's older brother, Truman, stopped by last week and was treated to free slices of salami.
 
'He's All Right'
 These places, far from the city's clanging streetcars and waterfront tourist attractions, are filled with echoes of Mr. Simpson's life. Mr. Woo keeps a signed photograph of him on a shelf, in front of the cheap champagne.
"I know O. J., and he's not the kind of guy who would do something like this," Mr. Woo said of the murder charges Mr. Simpson faces in the slaying of his former wife and a friend of hers. "Maybe somebody framed him. He's a good man. He's a gentleman. He's all right."
Down the hill is the Potrero Terrace housing project where Mr. Simpson came of age. In a dense morning fog, the dozens of low-rise buildings grip the hillsides with an almost Mediterranean charm. Their paint is creamy tan, and their roofs are tiles of red clay. Monterey pines and eucalyptuses tower in clumps over what, on closer inspection, are worn boxy buildings, some with boarded-up windows and graffiti-strewn walls.
On the steep rise of Connecticut Street, near the apartment where Mr. Simpson used to live, the view south is of Candlestick Park, where a young O. J. watched his idol, Willie Mays, play center field for the San Francisco Giants. When the boy was 13, Mr. Mays appeared at his front door, responding to an appeal from a youth counselor about a promising athlete straying into a young hardened tough.
 
Conflicting Views
 Herschel Brown, 49 and unemployed, lives on the same street as Mr. Simpson once did. He said he could outrun and outplay Mr. Simpson in their high school days. But he saw Mr. Simpson's star rise, not his. He has never left the projects.
Mr. Brown blames the liquor bottle and bouts of rheumatic fever for his own failures. Yet he said his former schoolmate's current troubles made him reflect on the perils of fame. The old neighborhood saw less of Mr. Simpson after he was awarded the Heisman Trophy, he said.
"Some of them get like that when they get up there," Mr. Brown said airily. "After he made it, he didn't care about the other brothers. He didn't come around. I guess the high life went to his head."
But just up the hill on Arkansas Street, a route a young O. J. scrambled up to get to the Potrero Hill Recreation Center, that sentiment is not shared. A mural of the hard-charging back, wearing No. 32 for the Buffalo Bills, is painted high above the entrance of the green bunkerlike building. Mr. Simpson played baseball and tag football on the center's athletic field and met friends there after school.
Mr. Simpson has quietly helped the center with equipment, awards and field trips for neighborhood children, said Jon Greenberg, the director. Another large picture of Mr. Simpson hangs above the gleaming basketball court where 12-year-old Marquez White was dribbling a basketball.
 
Questions About Heroes
 The seventh grader said he believed completely in the sports star's innocence. He could not explain why, saying only, "They're going to let him go, I bet." The boy said he had not thought much about Mr. Simpson before his arrest. For his part, Marquez said he wanted to become a professional baseball player.
It is unfortunate, said Otis McGee Jr., that so many young people look to sports figures as their only models.
As a teen-ager, Mr. McGee, who is now a civil lawyer here, got to know Mr. Simpson through a social group called the Superiors at the Booker T. Washington Community Service Center, a cross-town bus ride from where Mr. Simpson lived.
The group of about 15 teen-agers paid a quarter a week in club dues and organized dinners, fund-raising events and dances heated up with recorded music by the Temptations and the Four Tops. Mr. Simpson was known as a natural leader who could corral other members into regularly attending meetings. Their common bond was sports.
 
A Center of Support
 But Mr. McGee eventually turned to the law books, while his friend went on to the high-profile world of sports. Just as the accusations against Mr. Simpson have dismayed the lawyer, so has all the talk about the fall of another role model. If there is one cautionary message in the scandal, Mr. McGee said, it is that the ball field is not the only place that young people can find heroes.
"They need to be looking to leaders throughout the community," he said. "They need to be looking at more than just athletes as people to emulate."
In Mr. Simpson's life, there are some places that have served not only as landmarks, but also as bedrocks. The Evergreen Missionary Baptist Church is one such place. Mr. Simpson's mother, Eunice, is the Sunday school pianist there, but she has been out sick since her son's arrest.
Last Sunday, Mae Wooten bowed her head and prayed hard for the Simpson family. The 70-year-old church member, dressed in a pink dress and matching hat, remembers Mr. Simpson as a young boy who obediently attended Sunday school. As an adult, he visited the church two or three times a year and supplied fruit for the Christmas program.
Mrs. Wooten said she would remain tight-lipped about Mr. Simpson now. But it has not stopped her tears.
"We are hurt, very hurt, and we are concerned," she said. "We are a church that is one for all and all for one. When one person is in trouble and having a hard time, we all feel it."

HEADLINE: Goal! Goal! How Italian Scored Big With Voters

BYLINE: By WILBORN HAMPTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FLORENCE

 BODY:
Time was, especially in a World Cup year, when a stranger could walk into any bar in Italy, order a beer or an espresso, and find instant camaraderie simply by offering the toast, "Forza Italia!" It was about as safe as shouting "How 'bout them Cowboys!" at a Super Bowl party in Dallas.
Nowadays, depending on the bar and its clientele, the stranger could just as easily be picking a fight. Ever since Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi co-opted Italy's national cheer as the name of his new party, "Forza Italia" has become a muted cry. 
For one thing, it is hard to tell whether the proverbial stranger is uttering a sporting exhortation or making a political speech.
The association, of course, is intended. Mr. Berlusconi, owner of the AC Milan soccer team as well as television stations, newspapers and magazines, is nothing if not a marketing genius. Part of his political power base is built on political clubs named Forza Italia that he established throughout Italy, a country in which soccer is the national passion and politics the pastime.
In fact, the early betting on the duration of Mr. Berlusconi's political honeymoon was linked by some to the success of Italy's national soccer team in the World Cup. The new Prime Minister invited the comparisons, warning the team, hopefully in jest, before they left for the United States that if they came back too soon he would lift their passports.
[So far, so good. On Tuesday, Italy won a place in the quarterfinals by narrowly defeating Nigeria, 2-1, with a penalty kick in overtime. SportsWednesday, page B9.]
 
Unkind Words for Mitterrand
 Oddly enough, Mr. Berlusconi received a big political boost from the most unlikely of sources. Criticism of his inclusion of neo-Fascists in his Government by Belgium, Greece and, most of all, President Francois Mitterrand of France has rallied even the Prime Minister's most ardent enemies to his side. Italians have never taken kindly to outsiders who try to tell them how to run their country, especially the French.
"I haven't voted in 15 years," an Italian businessman in Orvieto explained to a visiting American. "But Italian voters elected Berlusconi democratically. When Clinton came here he didn't make an issue about who was in the Government. Mitterrand has no right to say anything about a government freely elected."
It was a sentiment expressed even more forcefully in Monteriggioni, a ancient fortress town near Siena. Encircled by 13 stone towers that Dante compared to giants in "The Inferno," and that still look like a medieval crown set upon a Tuscan hill, Monteriggioni is in the heart of what was once called the Red Zone for its solid Communist vote.
"I'll tell you who is Fascist," a waiter at a local restaurant assured a visitor, conceding that he himself had still voted for "the left," as the Communists are now known. "Le Pen is a Fascist. Mitterrand should worry about his own Fascists in France and keep quiet about Italy."
But Mr. Berlusconi seems bent on reminding the public of the neo-Fascist tint to his Cabinet as well its connection to the soccer team. The governing bloc in Parliament now refers to itself as the Azzurri, or "the Blues," the nickname of the Italian team, and the Prime Minister himself is sometimes known as "Il Azzurro," or "Big Blue." If Azzurri does not carry quite the same menace as "the brown shirts" or Il Azzurro fails to convey the same bombast as Il Duce, the names still keep eyebrows raised.
 
Italy Jumps Into Cyberspace
 For many in Italy, however, the dangers Mr. Berlusconi represent are more in his vision of the new Italy he promised voters and his vague plans for "development." After decades of dog paddling in the backwater of modern technology, Italy has moved into cyberspace at full throttle.
Every country inn on the back roads of Tuscany and Umbria now has a fax, and cellular phones constantly beep all along the cobbled streets of hill towns that once only heard bells from ancient campaniles.
At lunch the other day at an old farmhouse-turned-restaurant between San Sepolcro and Monterchi, two sleepy towns known more for their Piero frescoes than as hectic commercial centers, local business executives chattered away on their cellular phones with more urgency that movie moguls doing lunch at Spago.
"When Berlusconi talks of development," a Florentine documentary film maker warned, "what he means is that he wants to turn Italy into a nation of malls and industrial parks."
In the end, the new Government will succeed or fail on whether the Prime Minister can find solutions to the country's very real fiscal problems. Italy is suffering from a galloping trade deficit and creeping inflation, and the lira, never the sturdiest of currencies, would not buy Baltic Avenue at current exchange rates.
Still, this is a World Cup year, making it hard to separate the fortunes of the new Government in Rome with those of the Italian soccer team in the United States. Discussing Italy's mediocre showing in the first round, the owner of a popular coffee bar in Piazza Commune in Assisi said: "We have to face the facts. Italy has become marginal."
It could just as easily have been a political observation.

HEADLINE: Turmoil in Haiti Dims Future of Its Students

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, July 5

 BODY:
Like most other children of eighth-grade age here, Yves St. Hilaire has never known regular schooling.
This year Haiti's schools were open for a total of about five months as classes were delayed, interrupted and then abruptly ended because of the economic sanctions and ensuing turmoil. It has been like this since February 1986, when a popular uprising forced Haiti's President, Jean-Claude Duvalier, to flee the country. 
 "It's discouraging," Yves said the other day. "Most of what I know comes by watching television."
As the nation struggles with its economic and political problems and as thousands of Haitians flee, the long-term question that concerns some Haitians left behind is whether their nation can become a true democracy when a generation of children -- about two million school-age youngsters from rich families and poor -- is growing up without adequate educations.
 
Deteriorating Public Schools
 Most of the children in the country's poor majority attend schools that are deteriorating -- when they are open. Parents still pay an entry fee of $10 a year, but that barely covers operating expenses, let alone books and teachers' salaries.
With Haiti's bureaucracy turning over with each change in leadership -- there have been nine such changes since 1986 -- statistics are hard to come by. But it is a given that in recent years the Haitian Government has done little to support public education, spending only about 8 percent of its budget on education. Teachers seldom receive paychecks, so the best emigrate to the United States, Canada and Europe.
Even the once-vaunted system of private schools is crumbling: many are closed. The few private schools that remain open are seeing student enrollment dwindle, since many parents can no longer afford the $30-a-month average tuition that is the schools' sole source of revenue.
The College St. Pierre, a private school in Port-au-Prince that Yves attended, is typical. Classrooms are Spartan: there are no wall charts, no letters of the alphabet, no maps, no libraries, no laboratories, sometimes no lights. There is a blackboard and chalk, and students sit on long wooden benches.
 
'Consequences Are Grave'
 "If this continues, a Haitian student will be worthless," said Roger Petit-Frere, a history professor at the University of Haiti. "It's a phenomenon that parents are beginning to feel. And the consequences are grave because the schools do not serve the people."
The failings of today contrast sharply with the achievements of three decades ago. Haiti's public and private schools were then the envy of the Caribbean. Haitian graduates, well versed in French, were a catch for foreign governments and educational institutions. Haitian-educated administrators and intellectuals were heavily recruited to run schools and government offices in the emerging Francophone countries throughout Africa.
That all started changing in the 1960's. The quality of Haiti's public schools eroded as the Duvalier Government withdrew its support. Eventually, the nation became divided into educational haves and have nots.
At the same time, neither the public nor the private schools here have modernized their curriculums.
Like most institutions in Haiti, the schools are based on a rigid 19th-century French aristocratic system. The schools, which extend two grades beyond American high schools, emphasize Latin, Greek, mathematics and the sciences. Students learn largely through memorization. Lecturing is the norm, and the teacher's authority is seldom questioned.
 
Classics, but No Computers
 And while France long ago modernized its educational system, Haiti has lagged behind. Classes are still taught in French instead of Creole, which every Haitian now speaks. Computer literacy has yet to join the classics in the curriculum.
"We have to radically rethink our way of teaching," Mr. Petit-Frere said. "We are falling behind."
Michel Soukar, director of the College of Port-au-Prince and a radio commentator who has advocated changes in the school system, agreed. "The system is broken," he said. "It all goes hand-in-hand with the country's economic system. You cannot rebuild the educational system without knowing what economic course you are taking."
The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was elected President in December 1990, promised to fix the system and to provide a decent education for every Haitian child. But his administration, which ended in September 1991 when the military arrested and expelled Father Aristide from the country, was too short-lived to make good on his promises.
For students, the turmoil, violence and deterioration has been devastating.
"There's no future for us," said Sherley Louis, an 11th grader, at the public High School for Girls in Port-au-Prince, who said she would like to study medicine when she graduates. "Haiti does not allow us to live our dreams."
Martine Mabial, a 12th grader at College George Marc, a private school here, agreed. "I am going to school, but I really don't know why," she said. "Sometimes I ask God where this is going to lead."

HEADLINE: Shortage In Builders Cited

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5

 BODY:
Builders in the United States report a shortage of skilled construction workers as they meet demand for new housing, especially in the Midwest and Southwest, a trade group said today.
The Associated Builders and Contractors said a survey of its 80 chapters determined that the 18-month-old recovery in housing was "taking its toll on the available pool of skilled labor." 
 Shortages of skilled workers are the most severe in Kansas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Nebraska, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan, the trade group said. Shortages are also reported in Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Georgia and Florida.
But labor surpluses were reported in Alabama, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, New York, and Corpus Christi, Tex., and vicinity.
Builders "are scrambling to find enough craftsmen to get their projects built and are in some cases turning away work -- an unthinkable prospect a couple years ago," Leo Anhalt, president of the trade group, said.
Builders' labor costs could increase significantly if the demand for housing remains strong. "If they're busy and need people, they'll bid for them," Paul Kasriel, an economist for Northern Trust in Chicago, said.
Last week, the Commerce Department reported that sales of new single-family houses rose 4.2 percent in May even as mortgage rates climbed to a two-year high.

HEADLINE: Old Enemies Now Allied Against Crime

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 5

 BODY:
The director of the F.B.I., Louis J. Freeh, signed an agreement today to cooperate with Russian authorities in the fight against Russian-based organized crime.
Mr. Freeh and the Russian Interior Minister, Viktor Yerin, said that both countries were at risk from well-funded criminal gangs, parts of which have increasingly broad international connections. The prevalence of organized crime in Russia and the evident corruption of many underpaid officials and policemen are widely considered to be undermining the faith of ordinary Russians in market-oriented economic changes. 
 Opinion polls suggest that Russians regard criminals as the major beneficiaries of these changes, including the privatization of state property.
"Much remains to be done," Mr. Yerin said, "so that the professionalism, honesty, orderliness of every worker of the Interior Ministry organs will meet the standards of the society we are building together."
Mr. Freeh, who was quick to admit that the United States has a severe organized-crime problem of its own, praised draft anti-corruption legislation now before the Russian Parliament.
 
Exchange of Information
 The protocol signed today calls for the exchange of information among police forces, cooperation in investigations, the detention of alleged criminals in each other's countries and the training of Russian officers in the F.B.I.'s more modern techniques.
Both sides also welcomed the establishment of a legal attache office of the F.B.I. in the American Embassy here, which will house two F.B.I. agents. Although office space has not yet been set aside and the first agent to be assigned here will first undergo six months of language training, liaison with Russian authorities will continue, as in the past, through regular visits by European-based agents.
The Germans and Finns already have similar offices here, and the Italians are about to open one.
Mr. Freeh said he would welcome a similar Interior Ministry office in Washington at the Russian Embassy, though he said there had been no formal request for one so far.
Mr. Freeh left Moscow today after a two days of meetings with the chiefs of the Russian domestic security apparatus, including Mr. Yerin; the director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service (the domestic branch of the old K.G.B); the national security adviser; the deputy Justice Minister and the First Deputy Prime Minister, Oleg Soskovets.
 
No Meeting With Yeltsin
 He did not get to see President Boris N. Yeltsin, however, despite a request from the American Embassy.
American officials said that among the issues that brought Mr. Freeh here were concerns over narcotics trafficking from Colombia to Europe through Russia, the illegal transfer of money and the impact of Russian gangs among Russian emigres in the United States, especially in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn.
Mr. Freeh also stressed the risks of nuclear proliferation through the efforts of organized crime to steal or buy weapons-grade nuclear material, calling the possibility "the greatest long-term threat to the security of the United States."
Russian officials, including Mr. Yerin today, said there was no evidence of any such theft of weapons-grade nuclear materials or any nuclear materials from power plants, though much lower-grade fissionable material used in health care and "welding quality control" had been stolen. There were currently 50 such criminal cases under investigation, Mr. Yerin said.
 
The 'No. 1 Threat'
 American diplomats have said that responsibility for nuclear proliferation actually lies with the C.I.A. and Defense Intelligence Agency, not with the F.B.I. But Mr. Freeh said today that his agency intended to become more involved in anti-proliferation issues outside the United States, citing a law that gives the bureau, he said, "extraterritorial jurisdiction with respect to investigating and interdicting the illegal transfer of nuclear materials." He added: "I'm happy to report that we haven't used that jurisdiction much."
Mr. Yeltsin has called organized crime "the No. 1 threat to Russia's strategic interests and national security" and accused Russian criminals of "trying to take the country by the throat."
Russian Interior Ministry officials have said that some 5,600 gangs operate from Russia, averaging about 20 members each, and with little coordination and many rivalries over turf. Some of them are engaged only in vice or protection rackets. But an official said that some 160 gangs have international connections, large sums of money and operate in more than 30 countries.
The gangs deal in drugs, prostitution, oil, minerals, arms and money laundering, all across the former empire's still porous borders. Russian gangs have also threatened a number of Russian and Western businessmen, seeking protection money or partnerships.

HEADLINE: New Bosnia Peace Plan Has Serb Corridor

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Switzerland, July 5

 BODY:
The United States, Russia and the European Union unveiled a new plan today to end the war in Bosnia that they described as a "peaceful ultimatum" and a last chance to avoid a mounting conflict in the area.
"It would be a mistake of historic proportions for either party to believe they can serve their people well by rejecting this plan," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said after a sometimes strained meeting of foreign ministers here. 
 The plan is the latest of many international efforts to draw lines through the ethnic confusion of Bosnia, but it is the first in which the United States Government has actively participated. It will be formally handed to the warring parties on Wednesday and they will be given two weeks to respond.
The new map offers 51 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina to a Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia, linking the now marooned Muslim enclaves of Srebrenica, Zepa and Gorazde in eastern Bosnian, and connecting them in turn to the Sarajevo area, the United States special envoy to the Bosnian peace talks, Charles E. Redman, said.
The proposed map offers the remaining 49 percent to the Bosnian Serbs, including a crucial corridor near the northern town of Brcko that would link Serbian holdings in eastern and western Bosnia, Mr. Redman said.
 
Serb Corridor Is Crucial
 The Serbs, who control about 70 percent of Bosnia after 27 months of fighting in Europe's worst conflict since World War II, have rejected earlier peace proposals because they failed to provide this corridor.
"This plan preserves the state of Bosnia as a single state within its international boundaries," Mr. Christopher insisted in an attempt to clarify that the United States is not underwriting the carving up of Bosnia.
It was far from clear, however, how the Muslim-Croat federation and the Serbian entity would be constitutionally linked or what would prevent the Serbs from eventually opting for their long expressed desire -- union with neighboring Serbia.
It was also unclear what -- beyond extreme fatigue with the war -- had led the Clinton Administration to prefer this map to earlier ones.
The foreign ministers described the plan as a "turning point" and Andrei V. Kozyrev, the Russian Foreign Minister, said it constituted a "peaceful ultimatum." But the means by which the ultimatum would be enforced, including how an arms embargo on Bosnia might eventually be lifted, were left somewhat unclear amid clear signs of difficulties at today's meeting.
 
Many Issues Unresolved
 In the end, no communique was issued on the incentives and punishments to be presented to the parties, and the eventual lifting of the arms embargo was mentioned only as an alternative that would be adopted if all else failed.
Mr. Kozyrev said that if the Muslim-led Bosnian Government agreed to the plan, it would receive substantial aid for the reconstruction of Bosnia.
If the Serbs agreed to a withdrawal to the lines on the proposed map -- a surrender of close to a third of the territory they hold -- a progressive lifting of an international trade embargo that has crippled the Serbian economy would follow.
Alluding to what might happen if the Bosnian Government accepts the plan and the Serbs reject it, Mr. Kozyrev added that, "As an extreme measure, removing the arms embargo may be inevitable." Mr. Christopher said that "at the end of the day," lifting the arms embargo could become "a very strong possibility."
In effect it was clear that any lifting of the embargo would only come as a last resort, after several months and elaborate preparations.
 
Little Mention of Embargo
 The embargo has enraged the Government of President Alija Izetbegovic because it locked in a huge Serbian advantage in weaponry and has often appeared to lead to the widespread slaughter of Muslim civilians by Serbs.
President Clinton has been under growing pressure from Congress to lift the embargo. But Russia, a traditional ally of the Serbs, is deeply reluctant to endorse such a move and West European governments are worried that their troops in Bosnia would be endangered.
Indeed Foreign Minister Alain Juppe of France and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain both made clear today that their contingents in the United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia would almost certainly be removed if the arms embargo were lifted.
"There is a contradiction between lifting the arms embargo and maintaining the peacekeeping mission," Mr. Juppe said. "We would draw our conclusions."
Mr. Kozyrev said that "nothing new" had been decided on using the threat of NATO air strikes to enforce the plan. But Mr. Christopher said a tougher enforcement of weapon-exclusion zones around towns such as Tuzla and Gorazde would be "a way to ensure that there are consequences if one side agrees and the other does not."
 
Muslims Studying the Plan
 Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Prime Minister, held a meeting today with Mr. Christopher and said his Government would study the new plan carefully.
President Alija Izetbegovic said "it would not be wise to reject the plan fully."
There was no immediate reaction from the Bosnian Serbs, whose leader Radovan Karadzic last week described the proposed map as "humiliating for the winning side."
There have been clear signs in recent weeks that the Bosnian and Croatian Governments are preparing for a coordinated offensive against the Serbs in the fall if the latest peace initiative fails.
Mr. Christopher reiterated that if a peace agreement were reached, the United States would probably be ready to commit troops to police and to enforce the accord.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds in Lull As Traders Watch Fed

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
As Federal Reserve policy makers began meeting in Washington yesterday, bond traders sat on their hands, watching and waiting for something that most of them did not expect to happen, at least this week: an official increase in short-term interest rates.
As a result, Treasury securities ended the day almost unchanged. The yield on the bellwether 30-year bond edged down, to 7.58 percent, from 7.60 percent. The bond's price, which moves in the opposite direction from its yield, rose 6/32 , to 8414/32 . 
 Bond prices had started to slip early in the day, but were buoyed by a decline in commodity futures, a leading indicator of inflation. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of commodity futures dropped more than 3 points, its first decline in almost two months.
 
Fears of Inflation
 Inflation fears always weigh heavily on the minds of participants in the bond market, because inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments.
But such fears tend to be particularly acute when the Fed's Open Market Committee is meeting, as it continues to do today, to set interest-rate policy for the next six weeks.
Yesterday, an Administration official said there did not seem to be any attempt to dissuade the Fed from a rate increase in case it might be so inclined. Laura d'Andrea Tyson, the President's chief economic adviser, has not raised the subject with Alan S. Blinder, her former colleague who was just sworn in as the Fed's vice chairman and is attending his first open-market meeting, the official said.
If the Fed decides that the economy is growing too fast and that inflation is heating up, it will likely raise short-term rates, as it has already done four times since February.
Short-term interest rates have indeed risen sharply. Three-month Treasury bills, which began the year at a rate of about 3 percent, were auctioned yesterday at a discount rate of 4.31 percent, up from last week's 4.20 percent. Six-month bills were sold at a discount rate of 4.74 percent, up from 4.60 percent a week ago and the highest rate since early May.
Long-term rates have also jumped since they hit bottom in October; at that point, the 30-year Treasury bond was yielding about 6 percent.
Though traders were not so confident in their opinions that they bid up the price of bonds, few market analyst expect the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, to announce another rate increase today or tomorrow. They note that employment data, scheduled to be released on Friday, may help clarify how fast the economy is growing, and thus whether inflation is really a threat. Recent economic forecasts have been all over the lot, depending on whether economists focus on production, which seems strong, or consumer demand, which seems weak.
 
Guessing About Greenspan
 "My personal guess is that at this point, Mr. Greenspan and company would like to hold off a little longer, to have the chance to weigh the effects of higher interest rates," said Laurence L. Kreicher, a senior vice president and economist at Alliance Capital Management.
One reason the Fed may be willing to wait for more evidence of inflation, he added, is that in August, Mr. Greenspan must appear before Congress to explain his policies -- and Congress has been increasingly critical of the Fed's actions. "I think he'd like to be able to say, 'We're not letting our guard down against inflation, and if necessary, we'll tighten again in the future,' " Mr. Kreicher said. "He doesn't want to say, 'I think there's a bogyman in the closet and that's why I tightened.' "
There has been some speculation that the Fed would raise interest rates in an effort to bolster the dollar, which is trading at postwar lows against the Japanese yen and has also been falling against the German mark. But yesterday, the betting was against a rate increase for that reason.
"We would say it's unlikely," said Scott F. Grannis, a director of the Western Asset Management Company in Pasadena, Calif. "The Fed's traditional focus is, if they take care of the economy, the dollar will take care of itself."
That might not be the case if the falling dollar were really likely to make inflation worse, Mr. Grannis said, but the United States economy is too big for that to be a problem. "The economy is the dog, the dollar is the tail, and it will not wag the dog."
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.911	97.604	Discounted Rate	4.31%	4.74%	Coupon Yield	4.42%	4.92%	High Price	98.916	97.619	Discounted Rate	4.29%	4.71%	Coupon Yield	4.40%	4.89%	Low Price	98.911	97.604	Discounted Rate	4.31%	4.74%	Coupon Yield	4.42%	4.92%	Accepted at low price	62%	54%	Total applied for	$47,003,413	$43,685,950	Accepted	$12,012,973	$12,053,473	Noncompetitive	$1,414,490	$1,245,316	
Both issues are dated July 7, 1994. The three-month bills mature on Oct. 6, 1994, and the six-month bills mature on Jan. 5, 1995.

HEADLINE: Stocks End Day Mixed, With the Dow Up 5.83

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed yesterday, following the lead of the dollar, bonds and commodity prices. After opening narrowly lower, blue-chip issues were able to quickly reverse course amid strength in the oil sector.
Aside from that, many market participants either did not make it back from the holiday weekend yet, or they simply preferred to await the outcome of the meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee, the Fed's policy-making arm, that began yesterday and concludes today. 
 The markets are wary of another rate increase by the Fed. Some analysts have expressed the belief that the Fed will raise interest rates to protect the dollar, while others say coming data about the economy will act as the trigger to the next credit tightening. That could come sooner rather than later, or not until the Fed sees a clear trend developing. But a growing number of investors in the market are starting to say it may come next month.
 
195.4 Million Shares Traded
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.83 points to finish at 3,652.48, in lighter than normal volume of 195.4 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Market sentiment was almost split down the middle as the number of advancing issues barely surpassed the number of decliners, 1,091 to 1,030.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.17 point, to 446.37. The Big Board composite also rose 0.17 point, to 246.51. In Nasdaq trading the composite index dropped 3.26 points, to 703.59, while the American Stock Exchange composite slipoped 1.02 points, to 423.70.
In the related markets, bond prices moved slightly higher as the 30-year Treasury yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price, moved lower to 7.58 percent. On Friday, the yield was 7.60 percent.
Commodity prices as measured by the Commodity Research Bureau index, a barometer of inflation, also helped to stablize bond prices, as the CRB fell 3.30 points, to 226.73.
"Except for the Dow industrial average, the markets showed little movement, reflecting a belief by traders that the Federal Reserve may wait until Friday's June unemployment report before taking any action in interest rates," Harry W. Laubscher, senior vice president and market analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc., said.
"We're getting close to a turning point, but we may have to test the April lows once more before starting the anticipated summer rally," Mr. Laubscher said. Those April lows on the Dow, he said, were around 3,520 and 3,550.
However, Mr. Laubscher said, "any move below 3,600 would signal traders to start buying some of the better looking groups, such as aluminum, oil well service stocks, major oils, drugs, hospital supplies and papers."
 
Texaco Restructuring Plan
 Texaco, up 3/4, to 60 7/8, led the oil group higher after announcing a restructuring plan to cut costs by $300 million. Analysts saw the plan as a response to pressure from the investment community. The analysts also pointed out that most major international oil stocks were higher despite softness in the price of crude. Other gainers included Royal Dutch, up 2 1/8, to 107 1/8 for its American depository receipts; Mobil, up 1 3/8, to 82 5/8; Shell Transport, up 1, to 64, and Chevron, up 1/2, to 42 7/8.
Along with Texaco, Caterpillar, up 1 1/8, to 101 3/4, and Boeing, up 3/4, to 47 1/8, accounted for most of the move in the Dow index yesterday, analysts at Birinyi Associates said.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Corn, Soybeans and Coffee Lead a Broad-Based Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Commodity prices fell broadly yesterday, prompted by steep losses in corn, soybeans and coffee.
Wetter Midwestern weather caused the selloff and the collapse in grain prices. Coffee futures were affected by profit taking after a gain of 55 percent last week that was linked to frost damage in Brazil. 
 The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities fell 3.30 points, to 226.73.
Corn and soybean futures prices dropped sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade as weather forecasts for the Midwest promised adequate moisture for corn pollination. Corn for July delivery fell 11 cents, to $2.37 a bushel, while July soybeans plunged 27 1/2 cents, to $6.15 1/2 a bushel.
Some contracts for deferred delivery of corn and soybeans fell their permitted daily limits of 12 cents and 30 cents a bushel, respectively.
Weekend rain and forecasts for more precipitation this week alleviated concerns about crop weather at the start of the three-week corn pollination phase, when adequate moisture is crucial.
"Certainly, we're going to need to see more rain in July, but there's good rain in the forecast and that's why we're going down," said Dan Cekander, grain analyst with Rodman & Renshaw Inc. in Chicago.
He said hot temperatures in the region were expected to abate later this week as showers moved through.
"Heat is not a problem as long as we get the moisture," said Victor Lespinasse, assistant vice president in the grain trading division of Dean Witter, Discover & Company in Chicago.
Corn and soybean crop conditions improved last week, the Agriculture Department said late yesterday in a weekly report released after trading ended.
Meanwhile, coffee prices fell as investment funds and other speculators took profits after a weekend with no further frost damage to the Brazilian crop. The freeze a week earlier is believed to have wiped out a quarter to a third of the 1994-95 crop in Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer.
Unroasted arabica coffee beans for July delivery fell 8.75 cents, to $1.847 a pound, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York. The July futures contract rose nearly 69 cents last week.
"The bottom line is that supplies are tight, and you're likely to see good roaster support under the market," said an analyst for Merrill Lynch, Judy Ganes.
The sinking commodity prices eroded inflation concerns, pushing precious metals lower. August gold fell $1.20, to $386.90 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York, while July silver fell 8.4 cents, to $5.321 an ounce.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Message From Insiders Is 'Buy'

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The dollar is down, and interest rates are up. There is talk of a new bear market. In that atmosphere, who would want to buy stocks?
Corporate insiders. 
 Buying by insiders -- officers and directors of companies -- is by some measures running at its most intense since early 1991, when the stock market was taking off in the bull market that began with the Persian Gulf war.
"Insiders started picking up when the market bottomed," said David Coleman, the editor of Vickers Weekly Insider Report, a Washington newsletter that tracks insider buying and selling. "In 1987 and 1990, they did the same thing."
 
Reading the Signs
 Last week, Vickers recorded more purchases than sales among insiders whose stocks are listed on the New York or American Stock Exchanges, by a margin of five buys for each three sells. For the last eight weeks, the average such figure is almost even: 1.07 sells for every buy.
That may not sound all that bullish, but it is. Insiders have lots of ways to get their hands on stock before they resort to buying it on the open market. Many have shares from before the company went public. Even more get options to buy stock. Such options are often exercised at the same time the stock is sold, leaving the insider with no market risk.
As a result, there are almost always more open-market sales of stock by insiders than there are similar purchases. And while insider selling is often a warning of bad news, insider buying is viewed as an even better indicator of a stock's being worth consideration. After all, as many a corporate officer has explained, there are lots of reasons for an insider to sell besides bearishness. The insider wants to diversify investments, or pay for a new house, or college tuition. But there is no obvious reason to buy, except hope that the price will rise.
There is, of course, no guarantee that an insider will be right. And it is a crime for an insider to buy if he or she has material nonpublic information.
Nonetheless, as Mr. Coleman noted, "they are the people that know companies best, and when they start buying, that is a good signal."
A level of buying as high as the current one has often served as an indicator for the entire market. Vickers regards as bullish a ratio under 1.32 sales for each open-market buy.
Insiders are required to report their transactions to the Securities and Exchange Commission by the 10th day of the following month. Thus all June trades are due at the S.E.C. by next Monday. Many such reports still come in late, but stiffer rules -- including a requirement that companies report to shareholders why officers and directors were late in filing -- have improved the promptness of filing.
As a result, the ratios now being reported include activity in May, as well as June, and thus are somewhat behind the time in terms of actual activity.
Vickers compares the number of sales by insiders with the number of open-market purchases, regardless of the size. And while Vickers reports weekly figures -- last week's ratio of 0.61 sell to each buy was the second lowest in the last three years -- it focuses on an eight-week moving average to smooth out the data.
"Since October 1974, when we began plotting this data, the market has not failed to improve significantly when our eight-week sell-buy ratio fell below 1.0," Mr. Coleman said. The ratio fell below that figure last month, although it edged back up at the end of the month.
Mr. Coleman said he also computed a ratio showing the rate of change for the eight-week moving average. Rapid falls, he said, can warn that even an otherwise bullish indication is suspect, while fast rises can indicate that insider opinion is turning. That indicator, which was negative as recently as early May, has grown to its most positive level since, once again, 1991.
Among individual stocks, Mr. Coleman said he had seen considerable interest in a number of gambling stocks. Casinos were darlings of Wall Street in 1993, and a lot of insiders chose to sell then. But the stocks have been driven down this year, and recently there has been interest shown by insiders in such companies as Boyd Gaming, Circus Circus, Casino Magic, Station Casinos, Grand Casinos and Sahara Gaming.
Several real estate investment trusts have also seen insider interest, including Storage Equities, Partners Preferred Yield and Crescent Real Estate Equities.
And I.B.M. has had substantial insider buying, at prices from $55 to $58 and a bit higher, Mr. Coleman noted.

HEADLINE: Paramount Takes Write-Off

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5

 BODY:
Paramount Communications Inc. has recorded a $20 million charge to reflect a decrease in the value of its derivatives, joining a growing list of companies harmed by these financial instruments.
Paramount, a New York-based entertainment and media company, was acquired by Viacom Inc. earlier this year in a deal that is to be formally completed soon. 
 Paramount listed the charge to reflect the current value of derivatives it holds in the form of interest rate swaps, according to a filing last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Procter & Gamble, Dell Computer and Gibson Greetings Inc. have all reported losses from derivatives, the financial instruments that many companies use to limit their exposure to changes in currency prices and interest rates.
"There was a significant change in the market value of the swaps," a Viacom spokesman said. Paramount "had to adjust the reserve," he added, attributing the decrease in value to "the change in the interest rate environment."
Paramount appears to have recorded the charge in February or March, when a drastic increase in interest rates was taking place. The company did not include the charge in its results for the nine months ended Jan. 31, but did include the figure as a component of interest expense for the 11 months that ended on March 31.
Paramount filed a report for the 11-month period rather than the standard 12 months because the company recently changed the end of its fiscal year to March 31 from April 30.
The company entered into interest rate swap agreements that enabled it to exchange fixed-rate payments for variable-rate payments, the filing stated. In general, this type of swap would require Paramount to make payments to another party if interest rates rose and receive payments if interest rates fell.

HEADLINE: More Hope for Spinal Injuries

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY 

 BODY:
THE longstanding assumption that severe spinal cord injuries cause permanent, incurable paralysis is being challenged by studies suggesting that some "dead" nerve cells can revive or regenerate.
The findings open the possibility that doctors may one day be able to reverse part or all of the crippling caused by accidents that crush or sever the spinal cord. Most of the studies, conducted in animals, involve the transplantation of nerve cells from fetal spinal cords. 
 Nerve growth stimulants are already being used experimentally in people who suffer spinal injuries. When given soon after the injury occurs, the treatments seem to promote growth of nerve fibers, only a small percentage of which are needed to produce significant functional gains. And steroids now being used routinely within hours of the accident can limit the extent of damage to the spinal cord and often enable patients to regain at least some of the functions lost at the moment of impact.
Even after initial recovery, surgery to reduce pressure on the spinal cord or to remove cysts, which often form as a result of the injury, sometimes results in life-enhancing improvements, like the ability to get in and out of a wheelchair unaided or even to walk with special aids.
After the football player Dennis Byrd of the New York Jets was injured in 1992, he was treated with Sygen, an experimental drug that helps repair damaged spinal cord nerves, and steroids. Although initially he could not move his legs or arms, he can now walk.
 
Vital Links to Brain
 The spinal cord, the brain's link to the rest of the body, is like a telephone trunk line with 31 pairs of individual lines extending from it to transmit messages from the brain to the rest of the body and to send sensory signals from organs and tissues along the lines back to the brain. When the cord is severely injured or severed, communication is cut off to and from all points beneath the injury site, resulting in paralysis and loss of feeling.
The extent of crippling effects depends upon where the disruption occurs, with injuries higher up on the spine the most severe. Injuries to the cervical spine, in the neck, like those that occur in diving accidents, cause the greatest devastation. For example, people who have injured the cord at cervical vertebrae numbers 2 through 4 have no ability to move their upper and lower extremities, although there is some remaining control of neck muscles. In addition, those with cervical 2 injuries require breathing assistance. But if the injury occurs one vertebra lower, at cervical 5, patients can use their biceps, enabling them to take care of simple grooming tasks and feed themselves with the help of special equipment. Patients injured at cervical 6 are able to bathe themselves, drive and prepare simple meals.
Although paralysis occurs immediately when the spinal cord is severely injured, much of the permanent damage to nerve tissue takes place during the first four to six hours after the injury. Circulation is impaired and hemorrhages at the site further disrupt the oxygen supply, causing surrounding nerve cells to die. Swelling and scar tissue complicate matters, spreading the damage up and down the cord. Timely treatment with steroids and other drugs can limit the severity of the injury and the extent of paralysis and loss of sensation.
But the most exciting developments are still highly experimental, involving the transplantation of fetal nerve tissue to fill in the gap in the spinal cord or bypass the injury site. Many rats and some cats given fetal tissue implants following spinal cord injuries showed significant return of function. However, researchers say it will be at least a decade before such measures are tried in patients.
Meanwhile, at spinal treatment centers around the country, doctors and rehabilitation therapists are helping people with spinal cord injuries make the most of the functions that are intact and cope better with those that are not.
 
2 Sets of Goals
 Dr. Barth Green, who directs the Miami Project, which he describes as the world's largest spinal cord research center, said, "Our long-term goal is to reconnect the spinal cord, but our short-term goal is to improve the quality of life of spinal injured people."
At his and other centers, patients get help with such common problems as pain control, pressure sores, spasms, bladder function, sexuality and reproduction. The techniques used include surgery, biofeedback and computerized neuromuscular electrical stimulation.
Perhaps most challenging of all are the psychological adjustments required after a spinal cord injury. In a recent review of the problem in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. John F. Ditunno Jr. and Dr. Christopher S. Formal of Philadelphia noted that "the majority of people with chronic spinal injuries are not depressed" and that "the majority still rate their quality of life as 'good' or 'excellent.' "
Still, they added, the divorce rate is high during the first years after the injury, half of the patients who were working before the accident never return to work, and suicide is more frequent, especially among those who remain unemployed and socially isolated after the injury. Psychosocial and occupational therapy can be as important as physical rehabilitation in improving the lives of people with spinal cord injuries.

HEADLINE: Eating Well

BYLINE: By Marian Burros 

 BODY:
BAGELS have become a staple of the healthful eater as well as the dieter, taking the place of Danish pastries, croissants and even muffins for those pursuing fewer calories and less fat.
But those virtuous eaters are in for sticker shock. Even without a slathering of butter or cream cheese, some bagels sold in New York contain more than 500 calories each. 
 Call it bagel inflation. When bagels made their debut in New York at the beginning of the century, they weighed just two or three ounces. The United States Department of Agriculture has the quaint idea that bagels are still about the same weight as they were back then and provide about 150 to 200 calories each. But there's nothing uniform about bagels today.
In the beginning, bagels were small. They became hard in six or seven hours and were affectionately known as cement doughnuts. They were served with salty lox and a very thick layer of cream cheese, known as a shmeer, which helped moderate the saltiness of the lox.
Since Americans like everything big, bagels ballooned when they started to become as popular as doughnuts. Even traditionalists like Bagel Oasis in Queens have begun making bagels bigger, because everyone else does.
"We used to make 2 1/2-ounce bagels that had a crust on all sides," said Mike Edelstein, a partner in the bakery. "They had a crust that was hard," he said, knocking a counter for emphasis. "But now we've come down to making a more neutral bagel, not as tough, and it weighs four ounces."
Bagel Oasis still makes bagels by hand and still boils them before baking. But the company is an exception. It's hard to find a handmade bagel or a bagel that isn't all puffed up from the addition of dough conditioners.
For the first half of the century in New York, only members of the Bagel Bakers' Local 338 could make bagels. Today, anyone with $100,000 to $200,000 can buy a bagel bakery package, which includes cooking equipment and just about anything else you might need to start up, except the desire to make bagels the traditional way. It's not much different from buying a complete package to go into the coffee bar business.
Bagels were once flour, water and malt. Today, they may contain sugar or honey or even, if the word on the street is to be believed, Crisco or saccharin. And plain bagels have given way to blueberry bagels and cheese bagels and raisin-nut bagels and pizza bagels. When the calorie and fat tally for cheese and nuts is added, the healthy halo of the bagel disappears.
To find out where the standard bagel stands in relation to the contemporary New York bagel, plain bagels were collected from 15 bagel shops and markets in New York City. Most of the bagel shops make their own, but some buy from suppliers.
The bagels were delivered to Certified Analytical Group Inc. in Corona, Queens, for a weigh in. Most of them weighed at least half again as much as the standard Agriculture Department bagel. Some are three times as much -- it's easy to find a bagel that weighs six or seven ounces.
In the test, two bagels were bought from each of 10 shops, weighed and analylized for calories. An average of the two was calculated. In addition, bagels were bought from five other shops and simply weighed.
For those who believe bigger is better, Bagel on the Square was the winner. The average weight of a bagel there was seven ounces, with 552 calories per bagel. Pick a Bagel was not far behind, with a bagel that weighed on average just under seven ounces and contained 518 calories. Ess-a-Bagel and Dean & Deluca also had 500-plus bagels and Nosh a Bagel came in at 472 calories. The others analyzed were in the 300-plus range. The lightest bagel, three ounces, was from Dunkin' Donuts.
In general, it is safe to conclude that all plain bagels of the same size will have approximately the same number of calories -- about 75 to 80 calories an ounce -- and between one and two grams of fat. Unless, of course, someone adds Crisco.
Should the bagel lover decide on a modest amount of cream cheese -- say, two tablespoons -- that means another 100 calories.
A slice of smoked salmon? Don't ask.
 
Weighing In (Shmeers Not Included)
TWENTY plain bagels were analyzed for weight and calorie content by Certified Analytical Group Inc., Corona, Queens. The weight listed below is an average of the two bagels tested from each place. Some of these shops have more than one location in New York.
BAGEL ON THE SQUARE 7 ounces, 552 calories.
PICK A BAGEL ON SECOND 6.7 ounces, 518 calories.
DEAN & DELUCA (made by A & S Bagels): 6.4 ounces, 507 calories.
ESS-A-BAGEL 6.4 ounces, 503 calories.
NOSH A BAGEL 6.2 ounces, 472 calories.
H & H 4.5 ounces, 347 calories.
ZARO'S 4.3 ounces, 355 calories.
ZABAR'S (made by Columbia): 4.3 ounces, 338 calories.
BAGEL OASIS 4.1 ounces, 323 calories.
E.A.T. 3.9 ounces, 307 calories.
The average plain bagel has around 75 to 80 calories an ounce. Bagels from five other stores were simply weighed. The lightest of all the bagels tested was from Dunkin' Donuts, at just 3 ounces. One from Hot Jumbo Bagels came in at 3.5 ounces. D'Agostino's bagel was 3.8 ounces, and Moishe's bagel weighed 4 ounces, as did Balducci's. To learn the approximate caloric content of any bagel, simply multiply the weight by those figures.

HEADLINE: In America;
Dyson the Disdainful

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The thing about John Dyson is that he doesn't even bother to keep up a front. Most politicians, as they engage in the long-term mugging of the electorate, try to finesse things a little. They tell you how wonderful you are and what great things they are going to do for you. They lie, but they do it engagingly, with pretty words and lots of embraces, the political equivalent of flowers and chocolate.
Ronald Reagan was peerless at this. Americans seldom felt better than during the period when Mr. Reagan and his henchmen were masterminding the wholesale transfer of capital from the middle class and the poor to the very, very rich. 
 Mr. Reagan had an instinctive understanding of the principle known to even the lowliest three-card monte dealer on 42d Street: the fleeced must be kept amused during the fleecing, or things can get ugly.
This is a point lost on John Dyson, New York City's arrogant and obnoxious Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. The only amusement Mr. Dyson is interested in is his own. Like so many politicians, he disdains the vulgar masses he is sworn to serve. Only he doesn't hide it. He revels in it.
So it's not as odd as it might seem that Mr. Dyson would insult the city's African-American population with a watermelon crack. "The Comptroller ought to know the difference between a bid and a watermelon," said Mr. Dyson, in a dispute over whether to retain a company owned by a black woman.
It's the kind of thing you can expect from John Dyson -- gross and ugly and demeaning.
Earlier this year, at a special cabinet meeting held on Staten Island, he made it clear that a similar meeting would be unlikely for Harlem. Harlem, he said, has gotten "the vast proportion of the attention over the last four years." It was a gratuitous, divisive and untrue comment. But probably amusing to Mr. Dyson.
In any event, he's left no doubt that the kind of people who live in Harlem are not the kind he is interested in helping. Mr. Dyson is interested in people like himself, the very rich. So while the Giuliani administration was furiously lopping off jobs and slashing city services in an effort to reduce budget costs, Mr. Dyson came up with the bright idea of restoring $50 million in capital funds to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority as a way of easing the financial burden of the wealthy developer Mortimer Zuckerman. The idea was to offer the budget restoration (to be paid for by taxpayers) as an inducement for the M.T.A. to settle its fight with Mr. Zuckerman over the sale of the Coliseum site in Columbus Circle.
The proposal was widely denounced, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, scorched by the criticism, finally had to say, "That is John Dyson's proposal, not mine."
Mr. Dyson got his appointment via political kingmakers and he loves wearing the Deputy Mayor's crown. But he doesn't know the city and he doesn't like it. He only lives here (sort of, in a pied-a-terre) because the law says he must. His normal digs are a 200-acre farm and vineyard in Dutchess County. His personal view of the great and rowdy city he is now helping to govern was summed up years ago when he told an upstate audience that he had "the normal disregard for New York City that you do."
Now that Mr. Dyson is a top municipal official, his expressions of contempt for ordinary New Yorkers are especially maddening. In the wake of a newspaper article that noted the absence of blacks in top jobs in the Giuliani administration, Mr. Dyson wrote a memo to the chief Deputy Mayor, Peter J. Powers, that said: "Do not worry. Two white guys have been running this city of immigrants for over 200 years."
The theme that runs through most of the controversies surrounding Mr. Dyson is the perverse idea that those who are less fortunate have too much, while those who are most fortunate do not have enough. One of his many nutty ideas was to provide additional financial support to the city's elite cultural institutions by shifting funding away from less-established organizations. Amid loud protests, that idea also was shelved.
New York, a city that can appreciate a genuine rogue, deserves better than John Dyson. He's an amateur and he's annoying. He can't go back to Dutchess County soon enough.

HEADLINE: Ground Shifts in California's Water Wars

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "As Drought Looms, Farmers in California Blame Politics" (front page, June 24): 
 Changing wasteful, destructive and costly habits is always a challenge, whether in the case of spending, deficits or water in California. Only a minor amount of the dislocation you document is attributable to recent legislation, such as the Central Valley Project Improvement Act of 1992, of which we are the authors. Seven years of drought in the last eight (including this year, the four driest on record), plummeting commodity prices and numerous other factors are affecting the Golden State's agricultural economy.
Although farm spokesmen warn of dire food shortages if their water supplies are reduced, it should be noted that among the most heavily irrigated crops are cotton, alfalfa and irrigated pasture. Hundreds of thousands of acres of land are reverting to desert not because of diminished water supply, but because of the same process of desertification that has dried up artificially irrigated lands since Mesopotamia.
Some of that irrigation is also generating millions of gallons of toxic waste, which endangers wildlife and, potentially, human health. And tens of thousands of acres ineligible to receive subsidized water have been irrigated by the exercise of political power. Taxpayers need not feel guilty about demanding that the system return to some semblance of reality.
Water is no longer the exclusive right of farmers because it can be used better in other places. You fail to note the enormous public subsidy these growers receive: Central Valley Project customers may pay as little as $10 an acre foot for water for which non-Central Valley Project growers pay $400. Taxpayers and power customers pay that subsidy, often to grow crops we are encouraging farmers elsewhere in the country not to grow. By contrast, that water provided to urban areas generates far more jobs and far greater revenues for California and the country.
It is absurd to predict that water reforms will drive agriculture out of California. But farmers must recognize the state has changed drastically, and agriculture is a relatively minor feature of the state's diverse economy. The future of California depends on the efficient use of limited water resources, rather than just handing 85 percent of it over to irrigation. Urban residents, recreational activities, commercial fishing, as well as fish and wildlife restoration are all legitimate competitors for water. Financially and scientifically, allocations must be made soundly and reasonably in the years to come, and that is the basis of our long-overdue legislation.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN HAITI: U.S. STRATEGY;
U.S. TROOPS STAGE MILITARY EXERCISE WITH EYE ON HAITI

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
Stepping up preparations for a possible invasion of Haiti to oust its military leaders, United States forces have secretly rehearsed a plan to seize airfields and ports there, Pentagon officials said today.
The exercise, which involved more than a thousand commandos who would most likely serve as a vanguard, took place two weeks ago in the southeastern United States and the Gulf of Mexico, the officials said. 
 A battalion of Army Rangers flew from Savannah, Ga., and "seized" an isolated airfield at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, which was intended to represent the airfield at Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. Navy SEAL commandos operating from ships in the Gulf of Mexico practiced capturing a port.
Army Rangers conducted the same kind of exercises at Eglin just before the United States invaded Panama in December 1989 to overthrow Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
The Administration says it is still pursuing economic sanctions in the hope of forcing the military leaders to step down. But officials have warned that they are keeping open the option of using force to restore to power the President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and stem a flood of Haitians that is overwhelming refugee centers in the Caribbean.
As long as the Administration continues to hold out the possibility of military intervention, the Pentagon must be prepared to execute it, but military officials say the White House has not yet decided on an invasion.
United States intelligence officers have long been skeptical that economic sanctions will induce Haiti's military leaders to leave. A classified National Intelligence Estimate prepared in January 1993 stated: "Neither tougher sanctions nor a blockade alone would lead the de facto regime to capitulate to demands for Aristide's return," but "the credible threat of force to restore him could persuade the military to reach an agreement."
American officials said there were indications of dissatisfaction in the lower ranks of the Haitian military. Visible military preparations could add to their unease and, the officals hope, encourage the ouster of the military leaders.
The exodus of Haitians has put added pressure on the Administration.
The State Department said today that since June 15, the Coast Guard had picked up 14,000 Haitians, including about 2,900 in 46 boats on Tuesday. Almost 1,200 were picked up by early evening today.
The Administration has tried to buy time for sanctions to work by announcing on Tuesday that it was sending refugees who flee Haiti in boats to temporary camps in Panama and other Caribbean countries. But officials concede that the new plan is at best a stop-gap. The agreement with Panama, which is to last for a year, limits the number of refugees there to 10,000.
 
Six Months, and Counting
 Reflecting the White House's sense of urgency, William H. Gray 3d, President Clinton's special envoy on Haiti, said today in a television interview that the military leaders must leave within six months.
"We don't expect the military regime to be there six months from now," Mr. Gray said on the NBC News program "Today." "We believe that the dictatorship will step down, will leave. If they don't, then there are options that are open. The President has made it very clear that the military option is just one of those options."
American officials said the invasion plan calls for about 20,000 troops, most from the Army. The first task would be to seize airfields and ports so an invasion force could be deployed. Army Rangers performed a similar mission in Panama, taking over an airfield near Panama City.
In addition, 2,000 marines now being dispatched to the coast off Haiti, officially to be prepared to evacuate Americans, include troops trained in special operations. Adm. J. Michael Boorda, the Chief of Naval Operations, sent a message on Tuesday to the marines and sailors en route to "be prepared for at least 30 days of operations."
 
The Forces Involved
 The 82d Airborne Division, which was used during the invasion of Panama, is trained to deploy quickly to trouble spots. Officials said it would be well suited to serve as the larger invasion force.
American officials said the rehearsal by the special forces included a Ranger battalion, which normally numbers about 900 men.
The C-130 planes that carried the Rangers flew for about the same amount of time they would fly if they went to Haiti. Then the Rangers parachuted at Eglin, in the Florida Panhandle, to "seize" the airfield.
Officials said the rehearsal also involved about eight Army Special Forces A-Teams, which are 10-man commando units. Two SEAL teams, each of which had about 120 men, were also involved, along with numerous support units.
In all, more than 2,000 troops were directly or indirectly involved.
 
'Contingency Plans'
 One military expert described the exercises as a "final rehearsal" and said the proficiency demonstrated would remain high for three to six weeks; after that, more training would probably be required.
The Pentagon declined to comment directly on the rehearsal.
"The President has not ruled out the military option," said a Pentagon spokesmen, Dennis Boxx. "We obviously have contingency plans should he direct military action. We will not discuss any specifics of what those plans might be. I would remind you that Mr. Gray said yesterday that a military invasion is not imminent."
But other Pentagon officials said that in recent weeks, military units and staff officers have focused on a possible invasion.
"In the last month or so we've had different types of training in that area," a ranking Army officer said. "There are three options for doing something like this: dropping troops in, air assault and amphibious landing. Training on all three probably makes sense."
 
Practice Sometimes in Vain
 Special forces have previously rehearsed operations that later proved to be unnecessary. After Iraq invaded Kuwait, for example, United States special forces practiced for a rescue of diplomats trapped in the Embassy in Kuwait. But Saddam Hussein's decision to release his hostages made that operation unnecessary.
And while preparations are continuing, the armed forces have not taken the final steps needed to launch an invasion, like establishing a joint command.
Still, senior officials describe the situation as a crisis.
"There is no military invasion imminent," Mr. Gray told reporters on Tuesday. "However the military option is on the table. 'Imminent' is defined as something that is going to happen in a few days."

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN HAITI: THE WHITE HOUSE;
Clinton's Haiti Problem: What Price Democracy?

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
As American commandos rehearse for war and Administration officials insist that the crisis in Haiti must end soon, the unanswerable question is whether President Clinton himself is really willing to risk American lives to restore democracy to Haiti.
His aides insist that despite intensified military planning for an invasion and increased war talk, Mr. Clinton has not yet decided what to do. 
 The decision on Tuesday to change policy on Haitian refugees once again was an ad hoc response to a particular problem and not part of an overall strategy to oust Haiti's military leaders. And officials stress that they are still considering other ways the United States can pile more pressure on Haiti's military leaders before sending in the marines.
The Administration's public actions and statements offer little help in deciphering Mr. Clinton's intentions. As happened with the shift on refugees, the White House seems to be lurching from one short-term solution to another, often creating new problems that in turn require new quick fixes.
The President's special envoy on Haiti, William H. Gray 3d, said today that Washington does not expect the Haitian military to be in power six months from now. But the Administration has delivered no such formal ultimatum to the military junta, ordering them to leave or risk an invasion by a date certain, despite the request by the American Ambassador to Haiti, William Swing, that he be given the authority to do so, officials say.
 
No Consensus on Sanctions
 The Administration has debated, but failed to agree on, authorizing a covert program by the Central Intelligence Agency to sow dissension among the military or finance the departure of the country's three top military leaders, the officials add.
Moreover, there is no consensus among Mr. Clinton's national security advisers on how much longer the United States should give the stringent economic sanctions to work before it moves to an invasion.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, for example, argued strongly in recent interagency meetings that American credibility was at stake and that there had to be a change in government by the end of the year at the latest, even if it took an invasion, officials said. The Pentagon remains strongly opposed to an invasion, and Pentagon officials have continued to point out the problems with an invasion.
Part of the problem in the Administration's decision-making on Haiti is that the tension between Mr. Clinton's desire to do what he calls the "moral" thing has clashed with political reality; another part of the problem is that the Administration has imposed punitive measures on the military only in stages. The result: a policy that seems to shift with every new development at home or in Haiti.
 
A Temporary Solution
 Mr. Clinton's decision on May 8 to end the practice of forcibly returning Haitians intercepted at sea came after he told aides that he could no longer continue a policy that was "making Haitians choose between being drowned at seas or having their faces cut off on land."
But the Administration estimated that only hundreds of Haitians a day would try to seek refuge in the United States; when thousands a day began to leave, Mr. Clinton found a way to deny them the opportunity to settle in the United States eventually by finding refuge for them in other, less attractive countries.
Senior Administration officials admit that Mr. Clinton's decision to divert refugees to third countries is at best a temporary solution that buys a few more weeks or months to test whether the strategy of painful economic sanctions will topple the military.
By contrast, the decision to send a landing force of 2,000 marines into the Caribbean and statements by Mr. Gray that American lives in Haiti must be protected at all costs, move the United States closer to war.
Mr. Clinton is hoping that what his senior aides call a "credible threat of force" to restore the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, will somehow persuade Haiti's military leaders to leave the country quietly. Instead, it may simply push Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras to call Mr. Clinton's bluff by threatening the lives of American citizens.
 
Clinton Called Ambivalent
 "The Administration has created a situation it may not be able to control," said Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, who has been highly critical of the Administration's policy to try to restore Father Aristide to power. "Armed intervention is becoming its only option."
Still, Mr. Clinton is said to be ambivalent about whether he should exercise his prerogative as commander and chief and order the use of force in Haiti. According to people familiar with his thinking, he has vowed not to let the Haitian crisis become a vehicle for overcoming lingering skepticism about his attitude to the use of force stemming from his opposition to the Vietnam War and his avoidance of the draft. On the other hand, he has told intimates that he is not willing to prove the skeptics wrong by risking people's lives.
Last May, for example, Mr. Clinton laid out six good reasons why an invasion was justified, among them: "It's in our backyard"; several thousands Americans live there, and there is a "continuous possibility" of a huge exodus of Haitians if democracy is not restored. But that same month, at a "town meeting" on the Cable News Network he undercut his own position when he said, "We are doing our best to avoid dealing with the military option."
If Mr. Clinton wants to invade Haiti, he may not have much of a battle with Congress. In a little-noticed action last Wednesday, the Senate rejected, by 65 votes to 34, an amendment to the 1995 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill binding President Clinton to get Congressional approval or justify the use of force before ordering an invasion of Haiti aimed at ousting its military rulers.
Not that Mr. Clinton is insensitive to the wishes of Capitol Hill. Even though he has not decided whether to invade, he knows that there are certain blackout dates for the use of military force. Aides say that he is keenly aware that the optimal time to invade is after Congress recesses in the first part of August and before Labor Day, because lawmakers do not want their campaigns complicated by an invasion.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
Growing Up in the Melting Pot Called Hope, Ark.

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WARSAW, July 6

 BODY:
Today was the first time Bill Clinton had ever laid eyes on Poland and the Baltics. But to listen to him tell it, a boyhood in Arkansas amounted to pretty good preparation.
Even before he spoke this afternoon of an "unbreakable" chain binding the United States and the Baltic countries, Mr. Clinton was making out that his hometown, Hope, was a pretty worldly spot. 
 "I grew up in a little town in Arkansas that had a substantial Lithuanian population," the President told a gathering of foreign reporters not long before he left Washington. "So I grew up knowing about the problems of the Baltic nations."
Mr. Clinton proclaimed himself "very excited" to be beginning his Baltics trip with his visit to Riga, Latvia, this morning. (His spokesman, Mark D. Gearan, announced there that the President was still "very excited.") He separately described himself "so excited" to be traveling on to Poland, where he arrived this evening, and he suggested that was in part because life in Hope had taught him something about the place.
"Interestingly enough, we had a lot of people from Central and Eastern Europe, a lot of people from the Czech Republic in my hometown in Arkansas who came down from Chicago," the President told his visitors. "Most of them came from Chicago and moved to my state because it was a little warmer but still it had four seasons. So I'm very excited about it."
 
Remember the Colonel ...
 It wasn't, by any means, that his education was complete. Among the bits of lore that neither his neighbors nor his advisers had taught him was the case of Col. Ryszard J. Kuklinski, the Polish officer who became one of the United States' most important spies.
In the 1970's and early 1980's, Colonel Kuklinski provided American handlers with more than 35,000 pages of secret Warsaw Pact documents and tipped off the Central Intelligence Agency to the pending crackdown on the Solidarity labor movement before finally fleeing to the United States. He was convicted of treason in 1984 and sentenced in absentia, but his case has since become a cause celebre among Poles who regard him as a hero, not a traitor.
Even President Lech Walesa of Poland wrote to Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former national secrity adviser, three years ago to tell him that the Kuklinski case "lies on my heart."
Mr. Clinton nevertheless could only profess ignorance last week when one of his visitors presented him with a request from Polish Clubs of Chicago that he join in the calls for amnesty for the 64-year-old colonel, who is living under a false identity in the United States.
"I knew nothing about this issue before I read this letter," the President confessed. But he latched quickly upon another memory from his Arkansas youth.
"When I was a boy I went to school with a man named Richard Kuklinski," he mused. "I wonder if he was related to this man."
 
... Don't Forget the Broker
 Playing his part as a beacon of capitalism, Mr. Clinton borrowed the Latvian stock exchange building this morning for a meeting with 80 of the country's leading politicians, intellectuals and businessmen.
But one person not invited was Evgeni Kopits, who supervises the country's only commodities market from a small upstairs room, watching over 500 brokers who trade everything from tennis rackets to oil tankers and who operate strictly in longhand.
Perhaps worse, to make room for Mr. Clinton's pilgrimage to the once-captive nation, its market had to shut down.
"We won't be able to take any orders," Mr. Kopits said, "but for the sake of Mr. Clinton we are happy to do it." He was less magnanimous toward the Latvian Government officials who left him off the list. "We have been here for three years and they act like we don't exist," he said huffily. "Those politicians don't realize how vital a stock market is for a real economy."
Mr. Kopits, whose title is general director of Latvia's universal market, described his country's leaders as former "Soviet functionaries." And in what sounded a little like a 100-year curse from a Latvian fairy tale, he gleefully predicted that the free market would not flourish in Latvia until after their death.
 
The Vacant Chairs
 Nothing about a Presidential visit is supposed to be unplanned.
When Air Force One landed in Riga this morning, for example, Mr. Clinton descended a stairway that had been trucked all the way from Germany for the occasion. Secret Service agents and military and civilian advance teams had filled the capital's best hotels and high-priced outdoor cafes for more than a week, and American frogmen had paddled in the muck of a downtown canal to be sure it was free of explosives.
Near Freedom Square, where the President delivered his speech this afternoon, residents had been warned to keep their heads behind their curtains lest Secret Service sharpshooters mistake them for a threat.
And with every step choreographed to the minute, an escort was awaiting even 14-year-old Chelsea Clinton, who was guided on a private tour through a Latvian art museum by 16-year-old Nicholas Silins, a gentlemanly youth in blue blazer and horn-rim glasses who just happened to be the son of the American Ambassador.
But politics is not a friend of plans, and this day-old journey has already brought evidence of that. For the first time in his Presidency, Mr. Clinton flew abroad from Washington unaccompanied by a chief of staff: both Leon E. Panetta, the incoming chief, and Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the old one, decided to stay behind, at least for a few days, to wrap up the settling out from last week's shake-up. Lloyd N. Cutler, the White House counsel, who joined Mr. Clinton on his European jaunt, has stayed behind this time to prepare for Congressional hearings on the Whitewater case.
That still leaves Mr. Clinton surrounded here by many of his top experts on foreign policy, politics and communications, including George Stephanopoulos and David R. Gergen, who are supposed to help him mesh all three. Mr. Gergen was given that job formally last week, and said he expected to spend much of his time at the State Department, but he arrived in Riga this morning not with the Secretary of State but in his old spot aboard Air Force One.
None of the surprises has quite compared with last week's power shift in Tokyo, but even that has left American planners who penciled in a joint news conference featuring Mr. Clinton and Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata of Japan at the weekend Group of Seven summit meeting with something of a red face.
To the discomfort of the Japanese press, that same false anticipation remains emblazoned in bold color across a T-shirt that was being peddled on a chartered flight here by a freelancing Government employee. Its silkscreened image, intended as a memento of the coming gathering, depicts Mr. Clinton side-by-side with Mr. Hata, the suddenly former Prime Minister, and not with Tomiichi Murayama, the lifelong Socialist who will now attend the meeting as his successor.

HEADLINE: Department of Energy Pushes Competitive Bids

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
The Department of Energy said today that it would put up for competitive bid contracts valued at tens of billions of dollars, shaking up the companies that manage some of the Government's biggest laboratories and nuclear sites.
The announcement would more than triple the potential value of the contracts already under competition at main nuclear sites, and could present the Westinghouse Electric Corporation with especially intense competition as a prominent manager of big parts of the Government's nuclear complex. 
 Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary and other top agency officials characterized their plan as a wholesale revolution in the way the department does business with its primary contractors.
 
 
'Belong to the Public'
 They said their aim was to wrest control of the nation's nuclear complex from the contractors, who the officials said had become complacent in their decades-old roles. The officials vowed that the result would be to accomplish more and to spend less.
"These are our sites -- they in fact belong to the public," Mrs. O'Leary said. "They are not the contractors' sites."
At a lunch meeting with reporters, Mrs. O'Leary and her senior aides repeatedly described the existing arrangements with contractors as a hidebound and wasteful "entitlement" program, a kind of high-technology dole for corporations.
A single contractor would no longer control a Federal plant employing thousands of people, with its costs routinely covered by the Government and its fees calculated as a percentage of costs, the officials said.
Under that system, Deputy Energy Secretary Bill White said, "the more costs you incur, the greater the likelihood you will get a bigger fee."
Under the old system, officials said, big contractors handled even mundane tasks, like running laundries where special work garments were washed, under contracts awarded without competition.
In the future, a contractor would compete for a basic contract to integrate the services of several smaller contractors, each performing specialized work. And much of the work would be done on a fixed-price basis, with the contractors rewarded for holding down costs and performing well-defined tasks on time.
By making competition the rule rather than the exception, the department's officials hope to save at least 15 percent of the costs of managing its vast programs.
The Energy Department's programs focus on designing, building and dismantling nuclear materials and warheads, but in recent years it has also been overwhelmed by the costs of cleaning up pollution from five decades of bomb production.
Among the plants where the incumbent managers will face competition are the Hanford Reservation near Richland, Wash.; the Savannah River nuclear operation near Aiken, S.C., and the Nevada atomic testing site near Las Vegas. The current contracts to manage those sites are valued at an estimated $19 billion.
Westinghouse is the company most affected by the new plan. It is the principal contractor at Savannah River and Hanford, where it holds five-year contracts valued at more than $16 billion.
 
 
Reducing Costs
 Officials said Westinghouse and other contractors had already begun to reduce their costs in the face of potential competition, and that they expected the latest announcements to spur even greater economies.
"We were the first contractor to fully embrace the Department of Energy's contract reform, and look forward to the opportunity for the Department of Energy to compare our outstanding performance record against other competitors for the Hanford and Savannah River Site contracts," Westinghouse said in a statement today.
Counting previously disclosed competitions for contracts to manage the Rocky Flats plant near Denver, the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Springs and other contracts that will be renegotiated without necessarily seeking new bidders, the Energy Department said 21 contracts valued at $41 billion over several years would be rearranged.
By contrast, in the last 25 years there have only been seven instances of contracts, with a total value of about $14.5 billion, in which the Energy Department required an incumbent contractor to face competition.

HEADLINE: In Aftermath of Oil Spill, Alaska Waters Languish

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CORDOVA, Alaska

 BODY:
Before the Exxon Valdez ran aground in 1989 and spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil in Prince William Sound, spring was a season of joyous preparation for the fishermen in Cordova.
The sound teemed with herring and salmon and the promise of bulging summer catches, worth as much as $40 million a year to this port village of 2,100 people, 800 of whom are fishermen. 
But since the spill, the sound's overall ecological condition appears to have suffered, state and Federal scientists say.
Sea otters are reproducing, but their young are dying in unusual numbers, several scientists say. Other scientists have found that some species of water birds, particularly Harlequin ducks, are failing to reproduce in areas of the sound that were covered in oil. State studies show that although there were record catches of salmon in 1990 and 1991, and of herring in 1991 and 1992, the numbers of both species have now plummeted.
 
Trials to Decide Blame
 Whether any or all of these changes are due to the Valdez spill is now an issue in separate state and Federal trials in Anchorage. The Exxon Corporation, the owner of the oil tanker, has spent tens of millions of dollars hiring marine experts and preparing studies that essentially contend that Prince William Sound, an arm of the Gulf of Alaska, has recovered from the spill and that the continuing problems with the fishing industry stem from cyclical changes in ocean temperatures that reduce food supplies for herring and salmon. They also note that fishing is on the decline around the world.
The plaintiffs in both cases -- thousands of fishermen, native villagers, and property owners -- will cite data largely prepared by the state and Federal governments that conclude that oil from the spill continues to produce subtle toxic effects on fish and wildlife, affecting their growth, behavior and immune systems.
The plaintiffs in both courts are seeking a total of about $2 billion in compensatory damages. In June, Exxon lost the first phase of the Federal trial when a jury decided that the company had been reckless in allowing a captain with a history of alcohol abuse to command the Exxon Valdez. The decision makes Exxon vulnerable to a $15 billion punitive damage award that the plaintiffs will seek later this summer in the third phase of the trial.
 
Two Factors Cited
 Exxon long ago acknowledged that its own negligence contributed to the accident on March 24, 1989. But in the second phase of the Federal trial, which began on June 20, Exxon is seeking to reduce the compensatory damages by arguing that the collapse of the salmon and herring fisheries in Prince William Sound was a result of two factors.
First, natural fluctuations in ocean temperatures reduced the amount of food for the fish, weakening them and making them vulnerable to diseases.
Second, Cordova fishermen themselves may have hurt the catches by establishing a network of private salmon hatcheries that overloaded the sound's ecosystem with hundreds of millions of young fish, many of which starved.
"The commercial fishing industry in Alaska, like much of the rest of the world, has been experiencing hardships," said Douglas O. Walt, a spokesman for Exxon. "As shown by worldwide conditions, there is much more to the problems in Alaska than the oil spill, which occurred five years ago. To simply say that everything seen in the sound is because of the oil spill is an overly simplistic approach."
In Cordova, such statements are met with sputtering anger. The supply of fish is the lowest it has been in decades. This spring, Alaska closed the sound's herring fishery because there were too few fish. The number of herring caught in other Alaskan coastal areas has not had a similar collapse, said Evelyn Brown, a herring specialist here with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.
The dwindling supply of fish and the plummeting prices, which the fishermen laid to the taint of oil and a ruined market, have led to both economic and emotional depression in Cordova. Fishing is now so bad, many boats will not leave the docks this summer.
In the 1970's and 80's, Cordova was a magnet for young men and women from the lower 48 states who took jobs as crew members and quickly earned enough money to pay for their own $200,000 boats and the state herring and salmon permits, which cost more than $100,000 each.
Fishermen like 37-year-old Tom Masolini, who came here from Northern California in 1976, were clearing $150,000 a year and more after paying their crews and other expenses. Winters were spent in Hawaii.
Now Mr. Masolini spends six months a year away from home to support his wife, Linda, and their three children by fishing for swordfish off California, 3,500 miles to the south. He has sold everything he can to make ends meet. The value of his boat and his fishing permits have been cut by more than half. He is dogged by creditors.
"I'm so angry at Exxon I can't even express how I feel," Mrs. Masolini, 41, said in an interview at their home, which is surrounded by the steep slopes of the Heney Range. "Our life is totally changed. Tom was away so long this winter, it just started to wear on me. People were going places and being with their families. It was just like he wasn't here any longer. I thought I just cannot take any more. But you couldn't express it with people who were doing worse than you were because at least my husband was earning money."
Mr. Masolini, who will not be fishing for salmon in Prince William Sound this summer for the second year in a row, added: "It gets you to talking about all kinds of weird stuff. We talked about opening an espresso bar or owning an ice cream cart in Hawaii. But I don't know if I'm cut out for that."
 
Biologist Blames Oil Spill
 From his office near the entrance to Cordova's snug harbor, Rick Steiner, a 41-year-old marine biologist with the University of Alaska, has been studying the volumes of scientific reports published about the sound since 1989. He says most of the evidence points to a single source of the problems: the Valdez disaster. Mr. Steiner argues that the spill tore the membrane of ecological and economic life in Prince William Sound to a point where it will take decades to recover.
"It was a massive toxic shock of oil," Mr. Steiner said. "Essentially, the spill sterilized the waters of Prince William Sound. Initially it had a stunning lethal effect. And now there are sub-lethal effects on the development of fish larvae, mussels, birds, otters."
The great paradox for Cordova's residents is that not a drop of oil from the nation's worst tanker spill came anywhere close to the village, which is at the entrance to Prince William Sound on its eastern shore.
The vast oil slick was pushed by the currents down the western part of the sound, eventually fouling 1,500 miles of shoreline and covering more than 10,000 square miles, an area roughly the size of Vermont. The spill occurred as the sound was coming out of winter dormancy and preparing for the spring migration of sea birds, the return of whales, the births of sea lions and otter pups, and the reappearance of swarms of herring and pink salmon to spawn.
 
Extensive Toll on Wildlife
 According to the damage assessment studies compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other state and Federal agencies, the toll on wildlife was extensive. Some 3,500 to 5,000 otters died, or a third of Prince William Sound otters. One pod of killer whales lost 13 of its 36 members. Some 200 to 300 bald eagles died; 175,000 to 300,000 common murres perished. The fry of pink salmon were found to be genetically abnormal. Millions of herring larvae that hatched in oiled areas developed extraordinary structural defects, like kinked spines, that led to their deaths, said Ms. Brown, the state herring specialist.
Exxon says it spent $2.1 billion in 1989 and much of 1990 amassing a fleet of boats and an army of workers to scrub the oil off the sound's beaches. Exxon's executives and scientists contend that the cleanup, as well as the winter storms that pound the beaches, have not only scoured the region but also eliminated the toxic effects of the oil.
Indeed, viewed from an airplane, the sound's beaches were free of any visible oil. Bald eagles soared above the trackless wilderness. Sea lions and otters were plentiful along the rocks. Families of humpback whales surfaced in the dark blue waters, and one slapped the water with its great fluke.
But state and Federal scientists say the real story of the sound's condition lies below the surface of the grand Alaskan landscape, beneath the rocks on the beaches and in the tidal areas, where the worst oil damage occurred and where many of the animals live and feed.
During a trip to Sleepy Bay, an area of the sound heavily hit by oil, Mr. Steiner found innumerable places on beaches where oil was oozing between the rocks.
 
Beneath the Surface
 Mr. Steiner said it cannot be proved yet that oil is still causing ecological trouble, but there are plenty of suggestions that it is. For instance, he said, one reason the otter population appears to be having trouble recovering is that oil is in the tidal areas that support mussels. Since mussels are the favorite food for young otters, that may explain why juvenile otters are not surviving to adulthood in the western part of the sound.
But Exxon, citing surveys by the Coast Guard and other government agencies, contends that the number of beaches where oil still lies below the surface is small. The company also says there is no evidence that oil seeping into the sound from the beaches or the tidal areas is harming otters or having an effect on other creatures, including herring and salmon. The conflicting assessments have put science on trial in Anchorage along with Exxon.
In Cordova, though, most fishermen share Mr. Masolini's wishes. "I just want the fish to come back," he said, sighing.

Labatt to Buy Part of Mexican Brewer

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TORONTO, July 6

 BODY:
John Labatt Ltd., the Canadian brewing giant, said today that it would spend $510 million to acquire a stake in one of the two largest beer companies in Mexico in a transaction signaling the dramatic growth of Canadian business interest in Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Labatt, one of the most profitable beer companies in North America, has chosen as its Mexican partner Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A., known as Femsa, which controls 48 percent of the Mexican beer market with brands like Tecate, Carta Blanca, Superior and Dos Equis. 
 Mexico's other leading brewer, Grupo Modelo, which makes Corona, Mexico's best-selling beer, is 17 percent owned by the Anheuser-Busch Companies of St. Louis.
Femsa also operates 624 Oxxo convenience stories throughout Mexico and a packaging business. It also holds the largest Coca-Cola franchise in the world.
Labatt said it would buy a 22 percent stake in the beer enterprise, which accounts for about half of Femsa's total business, with an option to buy another 8 percent within three years.
 
Stock Offering Planned

 
Femsa Cerveza, as Femsa's beer division is known, would then be spun off as a separate enterprise. An initial public offering of 19 percent of Femsa Cerveza's shares is planned soon after Labatt closes its deal with Femsa, expected before Sept. 30. If the offering is completed as planned, Femsa would retain 51 percent of the beer unit.
"We think Labatt is the perfect fit for what our needs are," the chief executive of Femsa, Othon Ruiz Montemayor, said in a telephone interview from New York, where he and Labatt's executives met with securities analysts. He noted that today's announcement was the culmination of a three-year effort to find an appropriate partner for Femsa's beer business."
The chief executive of Labatt, George S. Taylor, said the alliance "clearly positions us for growth." He said Mexico, with its rising net disposable income and youthful population, was "one of the fastest-growing beer markets in the world."
In Mexico, all of Labatt's brands will be available to Femsa for distribution. In Canada, Labatt will distribute Femsa Cerveza's brands. In the United States, the two companies will unite their operations, focusing on specialty beers.
The position of Labatt in the Canadian market is similar to that of Femsa in Mexico. In each country, two companies control the bulk of the market.
Labatt's chief rival here is Molson Breweries of Canada Ltd. Labatt also has extensive sports and entertainment holdings. It owns 90 percent of the Toronto Blue Jays baseball club, the World Series champions for the last two years, and 100 percent of the Toronto Argonauts football team of the Canadian Football League.
 
Trade Pact Made Deal Possible

 
Violy McCausland, partner of James D. Wolfensohn Inc., an investment house in New York, who helped put the deal with Femsa together, said the North American Free Trade Agreement, which came into effect earlier this year, "created the right environment for it to happen."
Labatt, founded in 1847, reported sales of $2.3 billion (Canadian) in its latest fiscal year, and earnings before interest and taxes of $284 million (Canadian).
Femsa started in 1890. Its consolidated sales in 1993 were $2.437 billion (United States), and earnings before interest and taxes were $250 million. Its Femsa Cerveza unit had sales of $1.358 billion in 1993, and earnings before interest and taxes of $132 million.
Some Canadian analysts said the move should be positive for Labatt. "Labatt has an impressive track record," said Glynn Williams, a director of the Gordon Capital Corporation, an investment house in Toronto. "This acquisition is easily affordable and provides an excellent opportunity for them." Shares of Labatt rose 37.5 cents (Canadian), to $20.625 (Canadian), on the Toronto Stock Exchange today.
The Miller Brewing Company of Milwaukee also has a stake in Femsa. Miller's parent, the Philip Morris Companies, acquired a 7.9 percent interest in the overall Femsa enterprise from Citicorp in 1992. Miller, which owns 20 percent of Molson, Labatt's leading rival, had bid unsuccessfully for the Femsa Cerveza holdings and is now trying to revamp its Mexican strategy.
Mr. Ruiz of Femsa declined to say what went wrong with the Miller deal. "I prefer to put it in positive terms," he said, "that this is going to work great with Labatt."
 
Philip Morris Also In the Game

 
Darienne Dennis, a spokeswoman for for Philip Morris in New York, said Philip Morris "will continue exploring expanding Miller brands in Mexico."
Labatt is only one of a number of Canadian companies that are increasing their presence in Mexico to take advantage of the free trade accord, which took effect in January.
BCE Inc., the conglomerate in Montreal that controls Bell Canada, has expressed an interest in acquiring a stake in a telephone company in Mexico, and has held talks to form a partnership there with the American long-distance carrier, the MCI Communications Corporation.
Canadian mining companies and banks are also becoming more active in Mexico.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
The Rising Star From Dime Savings

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The ideal of an American meritocracy wouldn't appear to have too many better representatives than Richard D. Parsons.
Born in Bedford-Stuyvesant and raised in Queens, he finished first in his law school class, served on the governor's staff in Albany and on the White House staff in Washington. He then became a partner in a blue-chip New York law firm and the chairman of a bank. 
 Now, with the merger of the Dime and Anchor Savings Banks, Mr. Parsons, who will be chairman and chief executive of what will be one of the largest thrift institutions in the country, may also become one of the country's most visible African-American business executives.
As the former chairman of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's transition team and a ranking member of his kitchen cabinet, Mr. Parsons, 46, is a rising political power broker, and perhaps, one day, even a candidate himself.
 
Staying at the Dime
 During an interview yesterday at his corner office overlooking Fifth Avenue and 48th Street, Mr. Parsons gave assurances that he had no intention of leaving the Dime anytime soon. Both he and James M. Large Jr., the 62-year-old chairman and chief executive of Anchor, who will serve as president of the combined holding company, have just signed new, three-year employment contracts, he said.
But Mr. Parsons bridled slightly when asked if he thought of himself as a banker (he prefers to describe himself as a "businessman") and made clear that he did not see himself remaining in the same job indefinitely. "I'm not the kind of guy who will want to do the same thing forever," he said.
 
The Place of Public Service
 Recalling his days as legal counsel to Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and as associate director of President Gerald R. Ford's domestic policy council, he referred to public service as the "highest calling, large and important work."
"It's a venue to which I could see myself returning at some point in time; whether in elective office or appointive office is an entirely different question." he said.
According to admirers of Mr. Parson -- and they are numerous -- there are not many limits to how far he could go.
"In my view, Dick Parsons is one of the great black leaders in the country," said Harry W. Albright Jr., the former chairman of the Dime, who recruited him to run the bank six years ago. "I think he will be a hugely successful leader of this new $20 billion corporation. I also believe that he could be hugely successful in any position in the country, whether it be senator, governor or President."
 
Earning Loyalties
 "He's a leader," added Peter J. Powers, New York City's First Deputy Mayor, who worked with Mr. Parsons on the Giuliani transition and has known him for more than a decade. "He really knows how to bring people together and find common ground."
A gregarious and thoughtful man, Mr. Parsons has risen by winning the affection and loyalty of influential mentors. After graduating as valedictorian of his law school class at Albany Law School in 1971 and earning the top score that year in the New York State Bar exam, he was recruited by a member of Governor Rockefeller's staff.
"The old-boy network lives," Mr. Parsons remarked. "I didn't grow up with any of the old boys. I didn't go to school with any of the old boys. But by becoming a part of that Rockefeller entourage, that created for me a group of people who've looked out for me ever since."
Mr. Parsons followed Mr. Rockefeller to Washington after he became Vice President in 1974, and later moved on to the White House staff under President Ford.
"Rockefeller took a great liking to him," Mr. Albright recalled. "He kept him with him as his private counsel until the time of his death."
In 1977, Mr. Parsons joined the law firm of Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler, where he worked as a litigator and grew close to Harold R. Tyler Jr., a former Federal judge and head of the firm. In 1988, he accepted the offer to head the Dime.
"Judge Tyler wanted him as his successor and he was mad as hell at me because I wanted him to take my place, so we competed for him," Mr. Albright said.
 
Through Difficult Times
 Since joining the bank, Mr. Parsons has seen it through a difficult time. After real estate prices crashed in the late 1980's, the bank was stuck with a large number of nonperforming loans and suffered huge losses. Under his leadership, the bank has been slowly nursed back to health, culminating in a $300 million recapitalization completed last year.
Around the same time, Mr. Giuliani, the newly elected Mayor, asked Mr. Parsons to be his Deputy Mayor for Economic Development.
"I was not in a position to accept it," he said. "You cannot go out and raise $300 million on the assumption that you are going to be there, and then turn around three months later and say, 'Well, I changed my mind.' "
But he has agreed to serve as chairman of the city's Economic Development Corporation, and he often advises the Mayor and his staff.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Parsons' political beliefs are in the mold of his mentor, Mr. Rockefeller. He sums up that philosophy as "fiscal conservatism and social activism."
"You have to structure programs that are designed to modify or ameliorate social ills," he said, "but that requires investment on the part of the people who are being helped. "Otherwise, they won't value what they've got."
Mr. Parsons said race had never been a "defining character" in his life, and he does not consider it a burden that he might be a role model for other blacks.
"I don't do anything differently than I would otherwise because I have that responsiblity to my family," said Mr. Parsons, who is married and has three children. "Whether I was an African-American, an Arab-American, a Jewish-American, or some other American, there are a lot of people who I cannot let down, so you have to live your life a certain way to be a role model to the peoole who are important to you."

HEADLINE: Striking Oil but Straining Families

DATELINE: HOUMA, La.

 BODY:
When Jimmy Josey left for work recently, he hugged his two young sons and kissed his wife goodbye.
 But instead of heading to nearby Bilco Tools in his pickup truck, he drove about 40 miles northeast to New Orleans International Airport. Then, starting his 28-hour journey to the oilfields of Kazakhstan, he moved into the routine that is now part of his life in the domestic oil industry: He heads overseas, for a month at a stretch, to teach Kazakh, Hungarian and Russian workers to operate drill pipe-handling equipment made by his company. 
 Stocky and deep-voiced, Mr. Josey, who is 38, has worked on rigs across the Gulf of Mexico and thought he always would. "If you worked hard and hustled," he said, "there was always a place for you because there was so much activity."
 Now that activity is shifting, to Russia and other former Soviet republics, Brazil, China, Angola and, soon, to Vietnam. And oil workers like Mr. Josey are learning to adapt in mid-career -- a time when many Americans expect to be settled into a work and home routine -- to spending up to half their time working abroad, living in dormitories and struggling to learn other languages, diets and ways of life.
 Though energy companies have always gone overseas in search of oil and natural gas, that activity has picked up in the last four years and is likely to accelerate as more deals are completed. Encouraged by firming oil prices and promises of big profits from abroad, big oil companies now spend almost 65 percent of their exploration budgets overseas, up from 51 percent in 1990, according to the American Petroleum Institute.
 The industry does not tally how many of its employees work abroad, but executives and blue-collar workers say there is no question that companies are increasingly relying on overseas projects for future earnings. Being in the domestic energy industry, they say, now means being willing to go overseas.
 "I didn't anticipate I'd be working in a foreign country, but that's what it takes these days," said Jim Henley, regional manager for the<cobi>Chevron<coei>Corporation's offshore operations in Cabinda, Angola. He is gone from his wife, Frances, and their home in Mandeville, across Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans, for a month at a time.
 Mr. Josey once believed that the oil in the warm, rich gulf would always put a paycheck in his pocket. But now he and other lone men, lugging duffel bags and trunks, are seen more frequently among the travelers at the New Orleans airport. Mr. Josey's neighbor, Kirby Falcon, routinely heads to Norway and the North Sea for Hydraulic Well Control, a drilling support company also based in Houma. Another man from Houma, John Triagle, oversees oil-rig crews for the Halliburton Company in the Far East. And Jeff Cetodal teaches Brazilians about Bilco technology that helps bring oil wells into production.
All had expected to finish their careers in the gulf. All now work overseas several months or more each year.
Mr. Josey is gone for up to four times a year, 28 days at a stretch. When he is overseas, he quadruples his usual weekly paycheck in Houma. But the work takes a toll on him and his family.
 
Starting Support Groups
 Overseas, many men work in such remote areas that they can call home no more than once a week, and their employers try to limit them to 15 minutes a call on scarce phone lines. So many men from Houma and the small nearby cities of Thibodaux and Morgan City work overseas that their wives have formed small support groups to ease their lives as single mothers.
Mr. Josey's wife, Dana, belongs to a group that she and four local friends call the Oilfield Wives.
"Sometimes you just feel that the whole burden is on you," said Mrs. Josey, 35, lighting a cigarette. The mother of two sons, ages 4 and 8, said the boys tested her when their father was not around. "You have to be real tough like daddy," she said, looking at the two. "Then you have to be tender like mama."
Jamie Falcon, who is 23, says that when her 2-year-old son hears a plane overhead, he sometimes asks: "Is Daddy coming home?" Recently, her husband was home for two days before his schedule changed and he had to board a flight back to Norway. This time, he'll be gone for several months.
The changes have hit blue-collar workers and managers alike. Mr. Henley, Chevron's manager in Angola, is 50 years old and had worked his way up the corporate ladder to become manager of environment and safety in an area that includes the gulf. But seven years ago, when Chevron decided to step up its exploration and production in Africa, it sent him to Angola. He recently left Houma for a 28-day stint there.
"After a few years, you get used to it," said his wife, Frances, who teaches piano and plays the organ at the First Baptist Church in Mandeville.
 
Dorms and 12-Hour Shifts
 The men adjust, too, but differently. In Angola, Mr. Henley works 12-hour shifts, six days a week, overseeing drilling and production platforms. He lives in a self-contained complex with dormitories that house 580 workers.
Mr. Josey has learned to work on rigs in temperatures that sink 40 degrees below zero. In the Tengiz oilfield of Kazakhstan, he works 12-hour shifts, communicating with the workers through translators. He has widened his palate by eating local foods like pig lung soup, cooked by his Kazakh colleagues, but he stays close to the Americans.
"We sit at the same table," he said of his American co-workers from Mississippi, Texas and Oklahoma. "You have somebody to talk to."
In their efforts to cope, the Joseys have found some rewards. Mrs. Josey, for instance, has developed more of her own interests. She has set up a small workshop in her home where she makes colorful ceramic bowls and lamps. But her boys get restless during the weeks of their father's absence, and when he returns she gives him three days to recover before handing them over to him. The rebonding is intense.
"It just means so much to see the boys," Mr. Josey said. And Dustin, who is 8, likes to pull the pay stub out of his father's shirt pocket and marvel that the amount on it can be as high as $1,200 a week.
 
A Domestic Industry's Shrinkage
 The need to send workers overseas is unlikely to change anytime soon, even though a small recovery in drilling in the gulf is expected later this year. The domestic energy industry has shrunk to 443,800 workers, from 920,000 in 1982, the American Petroleum Institute said. Oil prices dropped sharply in the 1980's, many domestic fields matured and hundreds of smaller companies went out of business or were sold. Domestic exploration spending, which reached $29.9 billion in its heyday in 1982, fell to $7.4 billion by 1992, according to an institute study of 18 big oil companies.
[The most recent example of how the domestic oil industry is shrinking came Tuesday as the Texaco Corporation said it would put half of its 600 domestic fields on the auction block as part of a wider effort to cut costs. It plans to cut a total of 2,500 jobs in domestic and international operations.]
Louisiana has been whipsawed by the industry's volatility. Energy-related jobs in the state had dwindled to 42,000 last year from 102,000 in 1981. One of the hardest-hit areas includes Houma and Thibodaux, which is heavily tied to oil and gas exploration.
Mr. Josey's employer, Bilco Tools, is one of the local survivors, and its president, Bill Coyle, can rattle off the names of small neighboring companies that went under or were sold at fire-sale prices during the 1980's. "People bought companies for 15 cents on the dollar," Mr. Coyle recalled.
 
'Where the Action Is'
 He decided that if Bilco was to survive, it needed new business from overseas, and he scoured the world for orders. The first came from Abu Dhabi and India. Now they range from the North Sea to the Far East.
"We had the choice of going out of business or going where the action is," he said. Today, about 20 percent of his company's revenue comes from overseas and about one-quarter of his 80 employees work abroad for some stretches of the year.
As oil companies increasingly shift investments overseas, the area around the gulf is "fighting to hold on to what it can," said Loren C. Scott, a professor of economics at Louisiana State University. "Workers have had to readjust their lives."
Mr. Josey, for one, is more than willing to do so and grateful for the work. Without it, he would be one of the tens of thousands of oil industry workers who have had to move to other states and take lower-paying jobs, flipping hamburgers or pumping gas.
"If it weren't for Bilco," he said, "I don't know where we'd be."

They Think, Therefore They Are Very French

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 4

 BODY:
Does knowledge inhibit the imagination? Is a coherent thought necessarily true? Can a work of art be considered immoral?
Or how about this one? Is passion compatible with wisdom? O.K. Now, over the next four hours, write a five-page dissertation on one of these topics. 
 Year in, year out, the rite of passage from France's senior high schools is unchanged, and last month no fewer than 570,000 French students around the age of 18 set about trying to show that, while perhaps not yet budding philosophers, they already knew how to discuss an abstract subject.
France is still the only country in the world that requires the study of philosophy in high school. But, more than instilling a smattering of knowledge about Hobbes or Voltaire or Locke or Marx, this policy aims to teach young French men and women how to think -- to think in the French way.
"At this stage, it's a rhetorical exercise, a question of being able to present an argument," said Luc Ferry, a philosophy teacher, "and, since Victor Cousin in the mid-19th century, this has been done through the method of presenting a thesis, an antithesis and a synthesis."
In high schools and, above all, in the "baccalaureat" examination, the topics are chosen to force young minds into new areas through analysis of, say, truth or conscience or freedom. "All my students want to discuss is love," one high school teacher said with a laugh.
In the exam room they have to be ready for more. Last year's questions included, Is reality always realistic? Among questions presented for dissection two years ago were: Can self- knowledge be sincere? And, more mischievously, How do you know that a problem is philosophical?
Yet, in the land of Descartes, it is the method that has had most lasting effect. As soon discovered by anyone who has sat in a smoke-filled Left Bank cafe or around an elegant Paris dinner table, good conversation involves taking a subject, examining it from all sides and conceptualizing it to the point that a conclusion becomes irrelevant.
Indeed, such is the fascination with philosophizing -- more than philosophy -- that each year newspapers publish the questions asked of students in their "bac-philo" exam and invite philosophers to write their own model answers. And even years later, it seems, everyone remembers the question they answered and the mark they were awarded in philosophy.
This cerebral and even ethereal approach to life's dilemmas in turn affects the way French society as a whole works, including politics and diplomacy. And perhaps here lies the secret to why the French and "Anglo-Saxons," as they call Americans and Britons, have so much trouble understanding each other.
"The French always go from the general to the particular," said Jack Lang, a former Culture and Education Minister. He promptly recalled that his "bac-philo" essay was on "Happiness" and that he got 18 out of 20 points. "The Anglo-Saxons start with a concrete fact and reason from that. They call a cat a cat. We like to blah-blah-blah."
For Mr. Ferry, the Anglo-Saxon tradition of analytical philosophy can be summarized by the phrase: we have a problem and must find a solution. "In contrast, in France, through Voltaire and Diderot and Rousseau, ours is more of a political or social philosophy," he said. "Only the Germans have created great metaphysical systems."
Mr. Ferry went even further. "We don't have any true philosophers in France today," he said. "We have intellectuals galore. We even invented the word 'intellectual.' But what we have are intellectuals who call themselves philosophers and a host of professors who are more historians of philosophy."
Dominique Bourdin, who teaches philosophy in an underprivileged Paris suburb, said she nonetheless enjoyed the recognition her expertise brought her. "My teaching colleagues are often intimidated by us," she said. "They'll come and ask us to discuss philosophical aspects of their disciplines."
The same enthusiasm is not always apparent among students, above all those studying mathematics, sciences and technical subjects. "The course was a waste of time," said Laurent Delahaye, 18, who plans to study economics in college. "Still, perhaps it developed my critical faculties, who knows."
Mrs. Bourdin, whose students are unlikely to join the French elite, said she felt that even a couple of hours of philosophy lessons a week made a difference. "Even if they don't retain much, they have asked some questions and they know there are more questions to be asked," she said.
For the "bac-philo" exam, France is divided into four regions and, within each region, there are three sets of questions, depending on whether the student specializes in humanities, social sciences and pure sciences. Each student can pick between two questions and a commentary on a philosophical text.
Humanities students, who take eight hours of philosophy a week, are expected to do best. This year, those in the Paris area had to chose between the questions, "Is a philosopher necessarily a man of his times?" and, "Is reason a guarantee against deception?" Or they could discuss a text by St. Augustine on war and peace.
Diego Bunuel, 18, a humanities student who plans to major in political science at Northwestern University, said his philosophy studies had taught him to question.
"In philosophy, you can talk about everything," he said. "The subjects I prefer are passion, religion, the state, law, violence, justice and death."
Karen Micmacher, 20, who will study law at college, said her only regret was that she had not begun philosophy sooner. "It has changed my whole way of thinking," she said. "I feel like it has been a voyage into history." Then, as if to stress she is now truly French, she added, "I have learned how to reason."

HEADLINE: Fed Fails To Move On Rates

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve ended a two-day strategy session on monetary policy today without announcing an increase in short-term interest rates or explaining its apparent inaction.
Analysts took this to mean that the central bank, which had raised rates four times since early February, was satisfied with early signs that the economy is slowing enough to minimize the risk of resurgent inflation. 
 It had been widely agreed that the Fed's assessment of the domestic economy would outweigh its interest in supporting the dollar in world currency markets, even though higher rates, by making the dollar more appealing, would tend to enhance foreign investment and minimize inflation from imports.
 
 
Markets' Response
 The financial markets responded fairly positively, though with no great enthusiasm, to the apparent outcome of the Fed meeting. The dollar rebounded from its morning declines, blue-chip stocks rallied and bond prices showed relatively little change.
But while today's result came as no surprise, some analysts had speculated that the Fed might continue its practice since early February -- when it began its current series of rate increases -- of providing a brief rationale for its moves, or at least to make a clear declaration that it had decided to leave its stance unchanged.
Today's development did not absolutely mean that the Fed had decided to keep rates where they were. Until February, the committee's moves had to be deduced from watching the financial markets -- usually the day after it met -- since the committee did not announce its immediate intentions.
 
 
Fed Statement
 The Fed did, in fact, issue a statement today, but the statement said only: "The meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee ended at 12:35 P.M. and there will be no further announcement." The session, attended by 18 members and more than two dozen staff, ran for seven hours, starting Tuesday afternoon, and reconvening at 9 A.M. today.
Joseph R. Coyne, a spokesman, denied that any precedent had been set in announcing immediately the four earlier increases in the Federal funds rate. Nor would he comment on the possibility that the Fed today made a "contingent" decision to take action based on some future development.
"We don't have any permanent policy yet" with respect to the immediate announcement of deliberative results, Mr. Coyne said. "This is still provisional."
There was disappointment, however, at the House Banking Committee where Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who serves as chairman, has long pressed for greater and quicker disclosure of Fed actions. A committee aide said today, "They're clearly going back to their old ways."
Most analysts continued to regard further rate increases as likely, probably before Labor Day and possibly as soon as mid-July, after the Fed has digested labor market and retail sales figures for June. The job report is due Friday, the sales report next Thursday.
 
 
Consumer Spending
 A slackening in consumer spending, along with a less robust housing market, has been the chief evidence so far that the economy's growth has slowed from the torrid 7 percent growth rate of the final three months of 1993 followed by a 3.4 percent pace -- regarded by some as still unsustainable -- in the first quarter of 1994.
Lyle E. Gramley, a former Fed governor and research chief who is now with the Mortgage Bankers Association, said today that the Fed would be particularly interested in the upcoming sales report and predicted that the next move to raise rates would come at the Federal Open Market Committee's next meeting on Aug. 16.
He said the job figures could prompt a telephone conference of the committee but doubted this set of data would produce an increase by itself.
Robert V. DiClemente, a veteran Fed watcher at Salomon Brothers, also said more rate increases could be expected. He said it did not much matter whether a rise was deferred for days or even weeks, so long as the economic need for it was clearly established. On the other hand, Mr. DiClemente added, "it could be critical if they make a misstep in acting too soon."
He and other analysts also suggested it was wise for the Fed to avoid stating today it had taken no action since this could have emboldened speculators to attack the dollar with relatively impunity.
 
 
Three Votes
 Mr. Coyne said three votes were taken at today's meeting but he would not hint at the results. The committee members, 11 of them currently with votes, expressed themselves on monetary targets for the balance of 1994 and on preliminary monetary targets for 1995, in addition to policy over the next six weeks.
The voting committee is currently composed of six sitting governors of the Federal Reserve Board plus the presidents of 5 of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, who vote on a rotating basis; the president of the New York Fed, who also serves as vice-chairman of the committee, is a permanent voting member. This was the first meeting for the newest governor, Alan Blinder, the first Clinton appointee to the Fed.
The Fed's targets will be publicly disclosed when Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, makes his statutory semiannual appearance before Congress later this month to discuss the economic outlook and the central bank's anticipated response.
A spokesman for the Senate Banking Committee said this afternoon that the date for this hearing had not yet been determined.

HEADLINE: Japanese Made Gains In June Vehicle Sales

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 6

 BODY:
The leading Japanese auto makers posted strong sales and gains in market share in June, driving up total car and light-truck sales for the month despite a weaker performance by the Big Three.
Over all, sales sustained the moderate growth they have managed since easing off in May, sticking to a pace that analysts say bodes well for continued slow growth in the economy. Sales of cars and light trucks rose 6.8 percent compared with a strong period a year earlier. 
 Partly because of product shortages, the Big Three auto makers appeared to be sacrificing sales to the Japanese, who are offering customer incentives to exploit the opportunity.
 
Unfazed by High Yen
 "What all this means is you can't underestimate the Japanese," said Christopher W. Cedergren, senior vice president with the AutoPacific Group, an automotive consulting and marketing firm in Santa Ana, Calif. "Even at 98 yen to the dollar, they can still increase their share."
Indeed, taken together, the Japanese increased their share of the American car and light-truck market in June by 2.3 percentage points, to 23.8 percent. Combined, the Big Three lost 2.8 points, to 72.2 percent.
"They had cars," said David Healy, auto industry analyst for S. G. Warburg in New York City. "If you wanted a Mustang or a Blazer or a Neon they had waiting lists," he added, referring to Big Three products. "And you went to a transplant dealer and they had cars."
The Big Three's problem is not simply too much demand for factories strained to capacity, however. All three auto makers have closed plants for months to prepare for production of 1995 models.
 
Factory Woes at G.M.
 At the General Motors Corporation, for example, a key Canadian plant that manufactures the Lumina midsize car was shut in November to prepare for the 1995 version. The factory stayed closed for three months, and is still not expected to reach its full assembly line speed until August. By contrast, Honda's assembly plant in Marysville, Ohio, was able to switch from the 1993 Accord to the 1994 model in one weekend, and was up to full speed in a matter of weeks.
With too few of its crucial midsize cars, Chevrolet's car sales fell 4.4 percent in June, and G.M.'s total car sales fell 4.6 percent. G.M., which is now in its annual two-week production shutdown, said its figures were preliminary. The company said it would have final numbers on July 18.
Sales in June of all cars, whether built in North America or imported, climbed 4.4 percent, to 876,136. Sales of pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles climbed 10.7 percent, to 576,358. (Light-truck sales are slightly overstated, because G.M. did not separate out the number of medium-duty trucks it sold; in May, G.M. sold 3,033 medium-duty trucks.)
Light-truck sales continued to provide a bright spot for the Big Three. While the Chrysler Corporation sold more light trucks than it had in any previous June, the Ford Motor Company sold more light trucks than it had in any previous month.
 
Annual Rate Unchanged
 The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for cars in June was 7 million, the same as in May.
The total sales figures disguised markedly different performances by the auto makers. Combined sales by the Big Three rose only 2.8 percent, while sales by the Japanese jumped 18.2 percent.
"The Japanese are throwing a hell of a lot of money behind their products," Mr. Cedergren said. He said the Japanese were also emphasizing leasing, which plays to their strength because lease rates are based on projections of the resale values of cars when they are eventually returned. Since Japanese cars tend to have high resale values, the manufacturers can set rates low, even though the sales price of the cars would be high.
The Toyota Motor Corporation, after an anemic May, saw its sales of cars and light trucks rise 23 percent in June, to 111,566, the company's best month since August 1990.
The Honda Motor Company also had a strong month, as sales of cars and light trucks jumped 18.1 percent, to 73,365. But there were indications that Honda made a special effort to beef up its June sales. A Honda dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the company had offered dealers special incentives to hit their sales targets for the month.
"There were probably a lot of deliveries reported in June that normally would have been sitting around the office," the dealer said.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 22.02 as Most Other Indexes Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed yesterday for the second consecutive session, with the main blue-chip indicator up and the broader market indexes down, but off the lows for the day.
Mindful of the bond market and weakness of the dollar, many investors were still unsure about the possibility of another increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, and moved to the sidelines to await the release tomorrow of employment data for June. 
 At the conclusion of its two-day meeting yesterday, the Fed's policymaking arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, left its monetary policy unchanged. The lack of a rise in interest rates was particularly good news for cyclical stocks and was a factor affecting the divergence of the Dow Jones industrial average from the broader market indexes.
Monthly auto sales data released yesterday were about in line with expectations, and as a result the blue chips continued to bounce back.
 
Nadaq Index Slips 2.59 Points

 
 The volume on the New York Stock Exchange was moderate, with 233.6 million shares traded, compared with 194.5 million shares on Tuesday. The number of issues declining yesterday narrowly outpaced advancers, 1,082 to 1,024.
The Dow rose 22.02 points, to 3,674.50, while the Big Board composite index gained 0.03 point, to 246.54. But the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, which fell 0.24 point, to 446.13, the Nasdaq composite index, which fell 2.59 points, to 701.00, and the American Stock Exchange, which fell 0.15 point, to 423.55.
After the open market committee's meeting ended yesterday without an announcement on rates, many analysts said they believed the Fed was waiting for the employment data tomorrow to decide whether another tightening of credit was needed.
"If the market learned anything today, it's that the Fed continues to place the dollar at a lower priority than inflation and economic growth," Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities, said.
Other analysts said the Fed might avoid an early tightening of rates only because such a move could be seen as validating what some have called a currency crisis, or an overemphasis on the dollar's role in monetary policy.
If the economic data support the view that the economy is strong and getting stronger, it could lift stocks because a strong economy translates into higher corporate earnings. But an economy that is too strong would produce inflation and higher interest rates, which is counterproductive to corporate profits.
Lawrence R. Rice, chief market strategist for Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said he continued to be underwhelmed by the quality of the current market rallies. "Today is a perfect indication of how rallies are one-sided," he said.
Mr. Rice said there was also a continued divergence of the blue-chip issues from the bond market. "Historically, bonds should rally before stocks," Mr. Rice said. "What has been happening is that the spread between stock and bond yields has widened significantly within the last few months to the point where stocks have become very unattractive compared to bonds."
Texaco was up 1 5/8, to 62 1/2, after the stock was raised to a "buy" rating, from "accumulate," by Dean Witter. Texaco announced a restructuring program on Tuesday that would save it $300 million, and would involve the sale of its marginal oil fields in the United States.
Microsoft fell 13/16 , to 485/16 in Nasdaq trading. The company said it would continue its stock repurchase program through the next fiscal year.
The earnings outlook for Viewlogic Systems caused an analyst for Smith Barney to trim his earnings estimates for the computer software maker to $1.10 a share, from $1.15, in 1994, and to $1.35 a share, from $1.45, in 1995. The stock was down as much as 3 1/4, before closing down 1/2, at 14 1/2, in Nasdaq trading.

Dollar Recovers as Traders Await Rate Action by Fed

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar recovered yesterday from an early selloff that had sent it to a 14-month low against the German mark, as traders waited to see whether the Federal Reserve would make any move to push up interest rates.
The Fed's Federal Open Market Committee ended a two-day meeting without announcing any action on its monetary policy, providing an indication that it had apparently decided to make no immediate move to raise interest rates to support the dollar. 
 Many economists have said the Fed's assessment of the American economy would outweigh its interest in supporting the dollar.
But traders said the Fed did not seem to be ruling out raising interest rates at some future date. Several said the Fed might be waiting for the Government's report on June employment before it acts.
 "People still think there might be an interest rate hike in the cards," said David Durst, a trader at Bear, Stearns & Company. "Just because the Fed didn't act today doesn't mean they can't announce a rate increase later this week."
Higher rates could buoy the dollar by making dollar-denominated deposits more attractive.
The dollar fell to 1.5658 marks in early New York trading yesterday, its lowest level since April 1993. It was quoted at 1.5785 marks late in the day, down from 1.5810 marks on Tuesday.
The dollar also fell to 97.84 Japanese yen before recovering to close unchanged at 99 yen.
Many traders sold dollars early in the day after Germany's Economics Minister, Gunter Rexrodt, said efforts to support the sagging currency were sure to fail. "Germany's position, that intervention against a market trend can't succeed, has been proven," Mr. Rexrodt told a German newspaper.
His comments fueled speculation that leaders from the Group of Seven industrialized nations would not take steps to shore up the dollar when they meet in Naples this weekend.
 The dollar rebounded from its lows against the mark and the yen after a spokesman for Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of France said that country would call upon the United States to "take all necessary measures" to support the dollar at the Group of Seven meeting.
Those comments lifted the dollar because "a lot of people are still looking for something substantial out of the Naples meeting," said Jim Raphael, a trader at NatWest USA Bancorp. "If there's no strongly worded communique, we'll see a much lower dollar next Monday."
Mr. Raphael does not expect the Fed or the Group of Seven to come to the dollar's rescue unless American stock and bond markets appear to be in trouble. Those markets were relatively stable yesterday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Crude Oil Prices Weaken And Precious Metals Drop

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Crude oil futures prices weakened yesterday after an oil company resumed operations in Yemen.
Precious metal futures also fell, which helped drive down the Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities 1.42 points, to 225.31. 
 On other commodity markets, coffee futures rebounded on frost fears, grains and soybeans were mixed and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
Oil prices fell after Canadian Occidental Petroleum announced that it had resumed production of 150,000 barrels a day in Yemen after halting operations on Tuesday because of heavy fighting in the civil war there.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the crude oil contract for August delivery fell 38 cents, to $19.24 a barrel. August heating oil tumbled 1.23 cents, to 49.09 cents a gallon. August unleaded gasoline fell 0.88 cent, to 52.97 cents a gallon, and August natural gas fell 0.9 cent, to $2.122 for 1,000 cubic feet.
The market's failure to reach $20 a barrel in recent sessions also prompted selling, said Thomas Blakeslee, vice president of Cameron Hanover Inc., an investment research firm in Bronxville, N.Y. "Once it started to slide, you saw more and more liquidation," he said.
Crude prices have been jittery since the July contract hit a high of $20.95 on June 21. The relatively high prices in the United States have attracted shipments of oil from other countries, which has been absorbed so far by surprisingly strong demand for refined products, Mr. Blakeslee said. "At these prices, demand is starting to look a little more sluggish," he said.
United States stocks of crude oil declined by 607,000 barrels last week, the American Petroleum Institute reported after the close.
Silver led precious metal futures lower amid waning inflation fears and expectations for higher interest rates in the United States, said Peter Cardillo, research director for Westfalia Investments Inc. in New York.
On the Commodity Exchange of New York, gold for August delivery fell $2.30, to $384.60 a troy ounce; July silver fell 8.9 cents, to $5.232 a troy ounce.
Coffee beans for September delivery soared 8.15 cents on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York to $1.945 a pound.
The gain erased most of Tuesday's 8.80-cent loss as traders focused on forecasts for possible frost this weekend in Brazil, the world's top producer. A cold snap late last month hurt the Brazilian crop.

Treasuries Slip as Fed Fails to Act

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities slipped yesterday after the Federal Reserve took no action on interest rates, raising concern among some traders and investors that the Fed was not being aggressive enough in fighting inflation.
The Fed's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, said in a statement that its two-day meeting ended at 12:35 P.M. "and there will be no further announcement." 
 Bond prices fell on the news after rebounding to be almost unchanged from earlier losses. A stronger dollar and falling commodity prices helped bonds recover a bit late in the day be to almost unchanged. The dollar recovered to 99 Japanese yen, unchanged from yesterday. The dollar also recovered late in the day from a 14-month low against the German mark. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities, meantime, which is considered a leading indicator of inflation, dropped 1.42 points, to 225.31.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 3/32 , to 8411/32 yesterday. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 7.59 percent, from 7.58 percent on Tuesday.
The Fed's announcement "tells the market the Fed gave up a great opportunity to make a move that would be judged as pre-emptive," said Anthony Chan, a senior economist at Banc One Investment Advisers, a Columbus, Ohio, firm with $8 billion in bonds.
Expectations that the Fed will take its time raising rates explains why bills and notes are doing better than bonds, said Dennis Bushe, head of $12 billion in bonds at Prudential Investment Advisers in Newark.
"Everybody's been hiding in the front end of the yield curve," he said.
The yield curve is the difference in yields between short-term and long-term securities.
Some traders and analysts said the Fed might wait until the release of the employment report for June tomorrow before raising rates. A surge in job growth beyond expectations would fuel concern that an expanding economy could fuel inflation.
But Mr. Chan said the Fed would run a risk in waiting for the employment report. If it raises rates after a report that the economy created more jobs than expected, "they can't fly the pre-emptive flag," he said.
The Fed may also have its eye on this weekend's meeting of leaders from the Group of Seven industrial nations, Mr. Bushe of Prudential said. The news "makes me wonder if they're going to wait for the G-7 meeting," he said. "One thing you could read into this is that they might try for a coordinated move," with other central banks cutting rates as the Fed raises U.S. rates.
"It probably makes sense for them to hold off for the jobs report and to see what comes out of the G-7," Mr. Bushe said. "It's a rational thing for them to do. What concerns the market now is employment growth, and it's wise for the Fed to watch and wait to see what employment does."
Some investors are willing to purchase bonds at these levels because they expect higher rates to depress home sales and slow the economy, said Leslie Finnemore, who helps manage about $4 billion in government securities at Colonial Mutual Funds in Boston.
While 30-year bond yields are not likely to sink below 7 percent this year, Ms. Finnemore said, she is "cautiously optimistic" that the worst is over for bonds.
Jan Terbrueggen, who helps manage $5 billion in fixed-income assets at Flagship Financial in Cincinnati, said that because the Fed did not act yesterday, it might not move before the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in August. That is especially likely if the dollar recovers, he said. "Personally, I think on Greenspan's list of favorite indicators, the dollar is at the bottom of the list," he said.
Relief that the Fed has not raised rates will allow notes to keep doing better than bonds, said Matthew Alexy, a market strategist at CS First Boston.
Many analysts do not expect the Fed to raise rates to bolster the dollar, even though a weak dollar can add to inflation by raising the cost of imports. A fall in the value of the dollar also makes dollar-denominated securities such as Treasury bonds less attractive to investors because the value of the bonds depreciates with the currency.
"You don't try to defend your currency by sinking your economy," said Tom Carpenter, chief economist at ASB Capital Management in Washington, D.C.

HEADLINE: OLYMPIC FESTIVAL;
For Volleyball Player, a Rich Athletic Tradition

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, July 6

 BODY:
The man wearing a white T-shirt and an intense gaze leaned forward, surveying the court as the South played the East in the second day of volleyball competition at the United States Olympic Festival today.
The object of his focus was Jennifer Johnson, a tough 5-foot-10-inch outside hitter for the South squad and one of the best young players competing here. Before the match, the man had given a critical evaluation of Johnson. 
 "Her numbers aren't always gigantic but she does so many other things," he said. "She can get the ball off the floor, she's quick, she can block, she's one of the best defensive players I've seen play."
Rafer Johnson might be a bit biased: Jennifer is his daughter. Still, given his deep background in world- class competition -- and given his daughter's talent -- he knows of what he speaks.
"She's a really great all-around player," Johnson said. "She might not be individually outstanding in one area, but I haven't seen many people match her with her all-around play."
It's fitting that the defining quality of Jennifer Johnson is her overall skills. Her father was one of the greatest decathletes in Olympic history. Johnson won an Olympic gold medal at the 1960 Rome Games, breaking a world record.
More than three decades later, Johnson's 21-year-old daughter is beginning the process of reaching world-class status. Best of all, Johnson said, is that neither he nor his wife, Betsy, pushed Jennifer or her brother, Josh, toward athletics.
"My wife and I tried to involve our kids in everything," he said. "Josh played volleyball and soccer, he played Little League. Jennifer played softball and ran track. Our idea was not to find anything in particular but to give them a chance to play all the different sports. They found their own way."
Jennifer certainly has. Through the various experiments with sport, the constant was volleyball. She began playing when she was 7. By the end of her senior year in high school, Johnson was acknowledged as the California player of the year.
On Tuesday, she had 17 kills as the South overcame a 2-games-to-1 deficit and won by 3-2.
Tonight, she had 14 kills, 12 digs and 4 blocks in a losing effort: East 3, South 1.
It has been a great year for the Johnson family.
Josh is on the U.C.L.A. track team as a javelin thrower. "Personally I never thought they'd run track," said his father.
In January, Jimmy Johnson, Rafer's younger brother and a former defensive back with the San Francisco 49ers, was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Rafer Johnson will be his brother's presenter at the induction in Canton, Ohio, on July 30.
Jennifer had a successful freshman season at U.C.L.A. and capped the summer off by making the Olympic Festival team.
"This is a big stepping stone for me," she said. "A big step toward making the national team."
Asked about the role her father played in her development, Jennifer said he was the exemplary role model.
"What he did was instill a great work ethic," she said. "He showed me the importance of working harder, hitting the weights, believing in ourselves, never giving up."
She said her dad isn't really a tough critic. "He can give me general counseling about conditioning and the mental aspects of being an athlete," she said. "But when it comes to volleyball, I'm the boss."
Johnson said the work ethic he passed on came, in large part, from his own upbringing in economically deprived circumstances and a sense that sports would somehow be a means to better his circumstances. His excellence in athletics earned him a scholarship to U.C.L.A.
He said the forces that drove him to compete are much different from those that are driving not only his children but many who compete.
"When I was competing there was no professional career," Johnson said. "I never even thought of making money as an athlete. I did it because I liked it, because I wanted to make the Olympic team.
"I wanted to be like Jesse Owens, Jackie Robinson."
Jennifer Johnson is not driven by the same forces. She just wants to win.
"The biggest thing is that we're just lucky to have two kids who love to compete," said her father.

Where Textiles Tell Stories

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE 

 BODY:
IN ancient Assyria and Egypt, when women wove cloth, they were not just making skirts for the body or sheets for the bed; they were accumulating power. So concludes Elizabeth Wayland Barber, a professor of archaeology and linguistics at Occidental College in Los Angeles and the author of "Women's Work: The First 20,000 Years" ( W. W. Norton, 1994), which traces the cultural and economic importance of textiles.
In ancient times, "the ups and downs of women's rights had to do with how important to the culture and the economy their textiles were," Dr. Barber said. Four thousand years ago, women in Mesopotamia, for example, sold textiles for gold and silver. The women pictured above are shown gathering saffron to use as a yellow dye. In Egypt during the Middle Kingdom (2000 to 1786 B.C.), linen sheets were a chief means of barter. 
 Dr. Barber's fascination with weaving began in childhood, when she fell in love with folk dancing, and later, folk costumes. She saw patterns in the cloth that were very ancient. Although textiles may be ephemeral, she said, their role in history is not.

Is Sports On Trial With O. J.?

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW 

 BODY:
WHILE the O. J. Simpson murder case and continuing pretrial hearing have made an immediate impact in regard to proposed legislation in some states to curb domestic violence, and while this has encouraged more women to ring hot lines to battered women's shelters, the case has, in a fashion, also put sports in America on trial.
Is this what we make of our celebrated athletes: Men who believe they have the right of entitlement, which includes the physical abuse of their spouses, or to stalk and intimidate their former wives or girlfriends? 
 Mariah Burton Nelson is among those who believe this is essentially the case. In a recent op-ed column in The Times she wrote that our sports world trains athletes "to hate women." She has since appeared on several television shows repeating this theory and relating it to the Simpson case.
In her new book, "The Stronger Women Get, The More Men Love Football: Sexism and the American Culture of Sports" (Harcourt Brace and Company) Nelson wrote: "Sports is a women's issue because on playing fields, male athletes learn to talk about and think about women and women's bodies with contempt."
This is a generalization to be sure, and, like all generalizations, a sweeping one. But like many generalizations, there is some truth to it, and she has marshaled some facts and statistics.
She cites, among others, for alleged spouse abuse the boxer Sugar Ray Leonard, the golfer John Daly, the baseball player Darryl Strawberry, the basketball player Moses Malone.
She cites statistics in which it is shown that, on college campuses, basketball and football players -- the most celebrated of the "manly sports," as Nelson terms it -- have been involved in more rape incidents than any other group, roughly equal to those by members of fraternities.
And she cites another, harrowing statistic: more than two million women are beaten each year by husbands or boyfriends. "About 1,400 women a year die at the hands of these 'lovers,' " she writes.
How many of those two million were athletes or former athletes? We know of that publicized handful. How many are involved in those 1,400 murders? Only one accusation comes to mind, that involving O. J. Simpson.
This doesn't minimize the seriousness of both the situation of women generally and the possibilities of Nelson's position regarding men and sports, but she overstates her case.
Lynn Hecht Schafran, senior staff attorney and director of the National Judicial Education Program, said that "domestic violence is a phenomenon that crosses the lines of race, ethnicity, religion, age, economic status and sexual orientation." In a paper that she distributes called "Facts on Domestic Violence," it states that in Massachusetts in recent years, to take one example, "batterers have included a business- school student, a police officer, a computer engineer, a building contractor and a college professor."
According to a Federal Bureau of Investigation estimate, 30 to 50 percent of all women in this country are abused by their husbands or boyfriends at some time in their relationships.
How many of these men could have been pampered, standout athletes? Not all of them, it seems reasonable to assume, were motivated by the so-called manly sports.
The problem is deeper than that. "Up to 80 percent of men who abuse their wives were victims of violence or witnessed the abuse of mothers," wrote Laura Crites in an article for the NOW Legal Defense Fund, "A Judicial Guide to Understanding Wife Abuse."
"Abused children grow up to abuse their children," she wrote. "And violent homes breed violent crimes."
Who truly knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? What went through the hearts of those Serbians who viciously raped innocent women? What goes on in the hearts of the gangs that rape the girls in their neighborhoods, or the rappers who condone and promulgate such violence? Or the religious zealots who cruelly suppress women?
It is more than sports, though sports in some moments mirror the larger aspects of historical and national violence. And there will always be foolish male coaches like Bobby Knight who will put sanitary napkins in a player's locker to send an ignorant message to be a tough guy.
The ideals of sports are to play by the rules, to be creative, to strive to get better. It doesn't always work that way, especially in the corrupt, win-at-all-costs high-profile sports. Bobby Dodd, the late football coach at Georgia Tech, put it best in response to a mother who wanted discipline for her son. "You give me a good boy," he said, "and I'll give you a good boy back."

HEADLINE: Debate Rages On Ball Park In Mt. Vernon

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON, N.Y., July 5

 BODY:
With its towering red brick columns and columned grandstand, Memorial Field resembles the sentimental new ball parks that have charmed fans and critics in Baltimore, Arlington, Tex. and Cleveland.
But unlike Baltimore's Camden Yards and its architectural cousins, the 6,000-seat stadium on this city's south side doesn't just look old. It is and it is showing its age badly. 
 Built in 1930, the stadium is a picture of decay. Weeds and dust choke the playing field. Paint flakes from the green railings in the concrete stands on the home team's side. The bleachers on the visitors side have been condemned.
The Westchester County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke, has proposed buying Memorial Field from the City of Mount Vernon and investing $6.1 million to spruce up the park, converting its seating alignment for baseball, and attracting a minor league baseball team.
 
Mayor Likes the Plan
 Mayor Ronald A. Blackwood has embraced the county plan, arguing that Mount Vernon cannot afford the rehabilitation.
Taxpayers absorbed a 23 percent property tax increase last year, he pointed out, and would be loath to pay for the work. Still, the proposal has drawn opposition from Mount Vernon residents, many of whom use Memorial Field's running track, handball courts and tennis courts.
More than 300 residents turned out for a public meeting at the field and each of the nearly two dozen speakers denounced the sale. Taking a break from his evening walk on Memorial Field's gravel track, Steve Mitchell explained why. "Memorial Field belongs to the people of Mount Vernon," said the 57-year-old native of the city. "It's one of the few places where people can come together other than the school system. It's the lifeblood."
Mr. Mitchell said he ran track at the stadium during high school and he remembers summer evenings when the city would stretch a movie screen across the playing field and show movies. "It would be like Penn State selling Beaver Stadium to make a little more money."
 
Opponents Fears Exclusion
 Opponents of the sale fear a county-run Memorial Field would exclude them and threaten such popular events as Caribbean soccer and cricket league matches and the twice-annual African Family Day festivals held there.
While Westchester officials stress that Mount Vernon community events would have priority in scheduling, they acknowledge that there would be less every-day access to the field. The handball courts would vanish to make room for right field and more sporting events would mean more days and evenings when a redrawn track could not be used by the community.
"We feel the best use of Memorial Field is as it was built, as a stadium," said Philippe M. Gille, a senior aide to the County Executive. "Right now, it is used as a community park, not as a stadium."
Mr. Gille said the county envisions a renovated Memorial Field as the outdoor counterpart to the Westchester County Center, an indoor arena in White Plains that hosts events ranging from baseball card shows to minor league basketball games.
While Memorial Field is the site of soccer matches, Mount Vernon High School football games, and the traditional Thanksgiving Day football game between the Iona Preparatory School and New Rochelle High School, Mr. Gille said a refurbished stadium -- featuring artificial turf -- would attract a wider slate of games.
 
Looking for an Anchor
 A minor league baseball team would "provide an anchor" for the ball park, he said. The stadium would be purchased with county-backed bonds, and the purchase agreement is likely to include a clause allowing the city to buy back the field when the bonds mature in 20 or 30 years. No price has been agreed upon.
Mayor Blackwood agrees with Westchester planners who believe a revitalized Memorial Field would be an economic boon to Mount Vernon's south side. "Our best bet is with the county," he said. "We can't afford to put any more burdens on the taxpayer. People will come to the stadium, spend money in the area, increase the sales tax revenue and generally liven things up in that area."
For now, the ball is in the hands of the five-member City Council, which must approve the sale. If the city approves the plan, Mr. O'Rourke will include it in next year's capital budget, which requires action by the County Board of Legislators.

HEADLINE: GARDEN NOTEBOOK;
The History of Central Park Through a Handful of Benches

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER 

 BODY:
YOU may not think that seven benches could tell the nearly century-and-a-half story of Central Park. But if you know what you're sitting on, they can.
Across from the park, at the Cooper-Hewitt National Museum of Design, at Fifth Avenue and East 91st Street, is a handful of benches deceptive in their profound simplicity. A few evocative old photograghs, accompanied by some well-chosen words, capture the essence of each bench's moment in time. But essentially these seats just sit -- in the museum's elegant garden, which was first designed to set off Andrew Carnegie's 64-room mansion when the steel magnate and his family moved uptown in 1902. 
 It was a prescient act. Wealthy New Yorkers like the Vanderbilts and the Tiffanys had moved to the East 70's and 80's around the turn of the century, but Fifth Avenue was still a dirt road. Hardly 50 years before, Central Park had been carved out of 800 acres of swamp, woodland, rocky cow pastures and some settlements of the city's immigrant and black population.
The benches in the former Carnegie garden range from the rustic Adirondack style of the park's beginnings to an ornate hoop-armed cast-iron model made for the 1939 World's Fair to the 1994 look-alike that echoes the first Central Park settee from the 1870's. The Central Park Conservancy hopes to install copies of the new settee in the park this fall.
The star of the show, "Angles of Repose: A Garden Exhibition of Central Park Benches," is a 12-foot-long reproduction of one of the rustic log benches first designed by Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted to overlook the panoramic vistas of the artificial wilderness, which the two park makers constructed by moving many tons of earth and rock.
"They were supposed to transport you into a state of nature," said Michael Owen Gotkin, a landscape architect at the conservancy. "By sitting on them and viewing the natural landscape beyond, you would be propelled into the wilds of the Adirondacks."
Sit on this new old bench for a while. Let its rustic logs tickle your legs. Then, take a walk in the Ramble, looking for the few forbears that remain. The Ramble, which starts north of the Lake, at about 74th Street, is a wooded area that is best traveled with a friend during the day. Though it's important to be cautious in secluded areas of the park, it would be a shame to miss out on the sense of mystery and surprise that Vaux and Olmsted built into the Ramble.
"To ramble means to wander, to ramble about," Mr. Gotkin said. "The paths are circuitous. They come in on each other, and it's easy to get turned around. That was part of the picturesque idea -- to enter the forest with a little trepidation. To feel something ominous about a waterfall, or to be slightly fearful of rocks. And then to be amazed by some spectacular view."
At the end of September, when the exhibition closes, the rustic bench will be moved to a knoll amid the pine trees just east of Bethesda Terrace.
Mr. Gotkin didn't know much about park benches until about a year ago, when he was asked by the conservancy to come up with a new design for one. His research led him to the archives at Cooper-Hewitt, to photograph and art collections in other parts of the city, to the cellars of park-maintenance buildings and to the locked gates of Gramercy Park (where he found a couple of escaped Central Park settees).
The treasure hunt eventually led to the exhibition, which Mr. Gotkin organized with Lucy Fellowes, a history and design buff at Cooper-Hewitt.
The lineup is a kind of time line of the shifting tastes, technological breakthroughs, economic highs and lows and roller-coaster politics that have shaped the city and its most famous park.
After the rustic bench came a cast-iron settee that was mass-produced to seat the crowds that flocked to the park in the 1870's. By then, furnaces could be fired up high enough to melt iron, which was poured into a sand cast. "So everything was cast iron," Mr. Gotkin said. "From sewing machines to Franklin stoves."
Though cheap and sturdy, these benches had Greek Revival souls.
"See how they're almost transparent, how they let the light through?" said Ms. Fellowes, pointing to a circa 1870 photograph of settees bordering the Lake near Bow Bridge. "They define the edge of the landscape without drawing attention to themselves."
This was in the spirit of the Olmsted-Vaux Greensward plan of 1858, which said that "artificial structures should be subservient to the main idea" and that "the park itself should always be uppermost in the mind of the beholder."
But that was before the City Beautiful movement at the turn of the century. Manhattan had grown up. Its streets were on a grid, its buildings were taller, the car was replacing the horse. Richard Morris Hunt went to the Beaux-Arts school in Paris and returned to design the grand facade of the Metropolitan Museum. The Pulitzer Fountain and the statue of General Sherman went up on Grand Army Plaza, and Columbus at what was to become Columbus Circle.
"There were those who wanted parks to be expressions of civic grandeur rather than pastoral retreats," Ms. Fellowes said. One architect suggested selling off most of the park to build a 10-mile-long version of the Champs Elysees to bisect Manhattan.
The rocks and woods held steady. Even if they didn't look exactly like the Adirondacks, Vaux argued, they were as close as many people would ever get to the wilderness. But the benches bowed to the City Beautiful style. The two kinds of settees made between 1890 and 1910 were of wrought iron -- because cast iron had become so common -- and the arms and legs formed an elegant geometry of circles.
"Park benches were props on an open-air stage," the exhibition notes read, "where promenaders could see and be seen."
Then came the hard days of the Great Depression, and the park fell into neglect. Homeless people slept on the benches and in the rustic structures (as they do today), and taxpayers called the Mayor's office.
"Jimmy Walker, who was famous in New York as a drinker and party guy, saw an opportunity," Mr. Gotkin said. "He hired a new Parks Commissioner to design a bench that appeared larger and more substantial."
Made of concrete and wood, the new bench was probably no more durable than cast iron and wood, but it looked it. And Walker put jobless people to work building them.
When Robert Moses became the Parks Commissioner in 1934, he, too, wanted to put his stamp on the park and called for a new bench. This one was made of cast iron, with an Art Deco flair, but its basic shape harked back to the hoop arms of the turn of the century. About 8,000 were made for the 1939 New York World's Fair -- and many are still in the park today.
The 1994 bench, on the other hand, looks like the great-grandchild of the 1870's settee. The prototype has a straighter back, and it's made of ductile iron, which is stronger than cast iron. So go to the Cooper-Hewitt and try it out. See how it feels without a bustle. And let it transport you into the park beyond the garden gate.
The museum, at 2 East 91st Street, is open Tuesday, 10 A.M. to 9 P.M.; Wednesday through Saturday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., and Sunday, noon to 5 P.M. Admission: $3; people 65 and older and students over 12, $1.50; younger children, free. Admission on Tuesday, from 5 to 9 P.M., is free.

 CORRECTION:
The Garden Notebook column in The Home Section last Thursday, about a show of Central Park benches at the Cooper-Hewitt National Museum of Design, described one bench incorrectly. The 12-foot-long rustic log bench echoes the style of the Adirondack benches first designed for the park by Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted but is not a reproduction. It is an original design by Kim Hoyt, an architect for the Central Park Conservancy. In addition, a picture of a bench, on the front page of the section, and a picture inside the section of a bench in the Ramble in Central Park were credited incorrectly. Both photographs are from the collection of Herbert Mitchell, not the New York City Parks Photo Archive.

HEADLINE: Which Haiti Policy?

 BODY:
Give them this. This White House team knows how to upstage a Presidential trip. When Mr. Clinton was in Europe for D-Day observances, all eyes were on North Korea. Now, as he visits Poland, comes news that commando units of the United States Army and Navy have been practicing a takeover of Haiti's ports and airfields.
It is hard to believe that the Pentagon's willingness to discuss these "secret" maneuvers is not part of a plan to flush Gen. Raoul Cedras and his henchmen out of Haiti. That is a worthy goal, but the timing is amateurish and the underlying message is troubling. Washington and the United Nations have only recently gotten serious about enforcing meaningful economic sanctions. These need to be given a chance to produce political results. And a new refugee initiative unveiled Tuesday at least temporarily relieves the political pressure from that direction. 
 After months of vacillating from one policy to another, America faces the troubling prospect that Mr. Clinton is drifting into using troops in Haiti because he wants to compensate for other policy embarrassments and does not have a better idea. Armed force is a notoriously poor tool for solving political problems. Even if U.S. forces, as expected, were to make quick work of General Cedras and his crew, does Washington really want responsibility for enforcing law and order in a volatile, revenge-minded land?
Meanwhile, for Haitian refugees it is now America if by land, Panama if by sea. Under the Clinton Administration's newest refugee policy, the next 10,000 boat people qualifying for asylum will be sent to Panama. Only those who qualify in Haiti will be eligible for resettlement in the U.S.
The new policy promises larger numbers of people safe haven from terror and persecution; but it continues to discriminate against Haitians, denying qualified refugees the right to resettlement in the U.S. enjoyed by politically more popular groups.
The amended policy comes less than two months after the Administration ditched the despicable practice it inherited from the Bush Administration of escorting would-be refugees back to Haiti with no chance to explain the dangers that spurred their flight. Instead, new processing centers were opened in the Caribbean to evaluate refugee claims, about a third of which were found to have merit.
Predictably, that big policy shift encouraged many more Haitians to take to the seas, hoping to qualify for resettlement in the U.S. More boats brought more drownings. The increase also threatened to overwhelm the Caribbean facilities and re-ignited fears in Florida of a large influx of Haitians.
As it amends that policy now to bar qualified boat people from the U.S., the Administration still offers sanctuary from danger, meeting its minimal moral and legal obligations. Yet if people continue to flee at present rates, the 10,000 slots in Panama could be filled within two weeks.
Meanwhile, the new policy has one big defect. It subjects Haitians to discriminatory treatment because of their race and their lack of the powerful friends who have facilitated resettlement for comparably large groups of other nationalities. Some half a million Cuban refugees, for example, have been resettled in the U.S. since Fidel Castro came to power. More than 100,000 people have been admitted from the former Soviet Union since 1980 alone. Haitians, in contrast, have long been treated as an unwanted burden, even though many who do get in have achieved economic success. It is only very recently, after the Congressional black caucus and Randall Robinson took up their cause, that Washington's policies have begun to bend.
The Clinton Administration deserves credit for ending summary returns in May. Its new policy maintains that substantial achievement. But the Administration has done the right thing in a way that still reeks of discrimination. It thus invites criticism from all sides rather than the credit it could have gained for upholding the American principle of sanctuary for all in desperate need. And now it adds the confusion of a lurch toward military adventure without enough thought about what might come after the victory parades.

HEADLINE: At Summit, Little to Fix

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NAPLES, July 7

 BODY:
As far as summit talks go, the meeting here of the leaders of seven major industrial democracies is a rather strange gathering for one simple reason: It has very little potential to do good, in large part because all seven countries already have economies growing faster than at any time in years. They really are not that broke and don't need much fixing.
But this meeting has significant potential to do bad, given the nervous state of world financial markets. The dollar's recent plunge against the yen and the German mark has roiled the currency markets, and uncertainty about the future of exchange and interest rates has global bond and stock markets on edge. 
 Any major disagreement among the leaders -- on interest rates, exchange rates or trade -- could further churn the markets, where many investors have already lost billions in the first half of this year.
The seven leaders, who began arriving in Naples today, will open their three-day conclave on Friday with an opening dinner, then focus on economics on Saturday and turn to political issues on Sunday, when they are to be joined by President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.
On economic matters, though, they are going to have to be careful about what they say. Looking at their own economies, they have reason to dance. But considering the state of global financial markets, they are dancing on a glass floor.
"I see very little prospect of drama on the upside at this summit," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. "But I see great danger on the down side, if there is friction over exchange rates, interest rates or trade policy. The markets are not expecting any major breakthroughs on the upside, but they will be watching very, very carefully for any hint of divisions among the participants."
For the first time in years, all the nations in the Group of Seven -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- are experiencing positive economic growth. All have relatively low interest rates and inflation is hovering in the 3 percent range. Their major common problem remains creating enough new, good jobs.
But this reality has not guaranteed an amicable session. The backbiting among members over the currency issue began even before the leaders arrived in Naples.
 
German Snipes at U.S.
 Gunter Rexrodt, the German Economics Minister and a member of the small Free Democratic Party, took a swing at the United States on Wednesday when he blamed the recent weakness of the dollar on inconsistent American trade and economic policies, which, he said, were not conducted "particularly cleverly."
Mr. Rexrodt, in an interview with the Munich daily Suddeutsche Zeitung, made clear that his Government had no interest in taking part in concerted market interventions to prop up the dollar, adding that Germany had resisted joining in the recent dollar-buying spree by 17 central banks to bolster the American currency.
He said the main cause of the dollar's decline was the sharp outflow of Japanese capital from the United States as Japanese banks have pulled money home to deal with their own recession.
The United States, Mr. Rexrodt said, is highly dependent on Japanese capital to finance its huge deficit because Americans have a very low domestic savings rate, which is a "deep-seated structural problem."
American officials raised their eyebrows but stifled their voices in reaction to Mr. Rexrodt's remarks to avoid a confrontation.
Indeed, fearing such dissension at the talks, President Clinton has carefully lowered expectations so that the impact on markets of any discord here will be kept at a minimum, and the more positive aspects might stand out. Even before leaving for Naples, President Clinton said in an interview with foreign journalists that the dollar would not be a subject for discussion -- so the markets should not get their hopes up or down.
Mr. Clinton also stated that he did not expect any breakthrough in trade negotiations with Japan, given the fact that Japan's new Government has been in office less than two weeks. Just to make sure that the United States-Japan negotiations did not overshadow this summit meeting, the two sides temporarily suspended their talks on Wednesday.
 
Following Up Trade Accord
 So what will come out of the meeting? The newest idea, and maybe the most controversial, will be a call by Washington to begin thinking about what the group wants to do as an encore to the global trade agreement, which was completed in December after seven years of negotiations.
The concept goes like this: The accord, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, was primarily about lowering tariff barriers to promote free trade; 160 countries signed it.
But the biggest problem faced by the industrial democracies is no longer tariffs. It is how to protect their intellectual property -- books, software, movies, patents and videos -- from pirates in developing countries; how to get more access for their service industries like insurance, banking, brokerage and consulting; and how to lower barriers and provide more guarantees for the billions of dollars in investment capital flowing from the industrial world to the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America.
American officials say there is no way they can get 160 GATT signatories to discuss such issues now, particularly when the developing world does not share these priorities. Indeed, when the group tried to raise many of these issues during the GATT talks, they were rebuffed by the third world in particular.
But now, some American officials hope that the Group of Seven, which represent two-thirds of the world's gross domestic product but only 11 percent of its population, can develop proposals and incentives to persuade the third world nations to sign on.
"If you wait for 160 countries, it will never happen, but the G-7 countries have the power to start themselves," said a senior Clinton official.
"This will not be exclusive. We will include others as appropriate, but the old big multilateral approach won't work anymore. Our idea is that the big industrial democracies, who are the ones who started the GATT round seven years ago, should begin looking at the trade barriers that really affect them now, and they are not tariffs anymore."
Only France is resisting this proposal, arguing that until the GATT agreement has been ratified by all the signatories -- the United States in particular -- they should not be overloading the systems by starting new projects. If the French can be brought around, the summit leaders will assign their finance and commerce ministers to come up with a concrete proposal by next year's meeting, scheduled for Halifax, Nova Scotia.
 
Shadow of Chernobyl
 A second item on the agenda will aid for Russia and Ukraine to help them repair or shut down dangerous nuclear reactors.
The United States is planning to offer $25 million in seed money that it hopes will attract $125 million from the other six members and the European Union, to be used by Ukraine to make much-needed repairs on its two decrepit Chernobyl reactors and to begin laying the basis for other power sources.
Everyone in Europe wants Chernobyl to be shut down for safety reasons, but the Ukrainians will not do that without an alternative. The West, though, won't give Ukraine loans for a new non-nuclear power source until it reforms its economy and starts charging its citizens the real cost of energy instead of heavily subsidized rates.
As for economic aid to Russia, a central issue at past summit talks, there will be no new money offered this time. But the leaders will propose raising the amount Russia can borrow from the International Monetary Fund as a standby loan to $7 billion, from $4 billion.
Although President Yeltsin will join the members for a political discussion, there is no thought now of making the organization the "Group of Eight."
American officials say that until Russia's economy is fully transformed to a capitalist system and until it begins to become a serious economic power with a global outlook, it really cannot become a full-fledged member of the world's most exclusive economic club.

HEADLINE: PANAMA REFUSES TO TAKE HAITIANS; A REBUFF FOR U.S.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
Two days after the Administration announced that Panama would serve as a "safe haven" for 10,000 Haitian refugees, Panama withdrew from the plan, leaving Washington struggling to cope with a new flood of boat people.
The decision, announced by the Panamanian President, Guillermo Endara, led to a round of finger-pointing between Panama and Washington and overshadowed President Clinton's arrival in Italy for an economic summit meeting. 
 Surprised by the decision, Administration officials tried to put the best face on the setback. William H. Gray 3d, the special envoy on Haiti, said Washington would not pursue talks with Panama, but he insisted the United States would find other sites.
"We will continue forward with our policy," Mr. Gray told reporters. "Panama was an important part of it, but we are in the process of building a network to provide a response to the surge of refugees caused by the deterioration of human rights in Haiti."
Mr. Gray also announced that Grenada, like Antigua and Dominica, had agreed "in principle" to provide safe havens. Other officials said Washington was considering trying to establish camps in Guyana, Suriname and maybe even West Africa.
"Obviously we're disappointed," the White House press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, said in Naples, where President Clinton arrived today for a summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial democracies.
American officials said Panama rejected the plan after President Endara realized he had misjudged the domestic opposition. But the collapse of the plan is likely to fuel criticism that President Clinton's foreign policy is confused. And it puts additional pressure on the White House to consider military force to oust Haiti's military leadership.
Even before the Panamanian announcement, the Administration was struggling to cope with the Haitians who have continued to put to sea. The Coast Guard announced that it had picked up 892 Haitians today by noon, and 1,731 on Wednesday. That brought the total since mid-June to more than 16,000.
To help stem the flood, the Administration announced on Tuesday that Haitians picked up at sea would no longer be resettled in the United States. And today, the Pentagon announced that it would expand its processing center at Guantanamo to handle 20,000 Haitians at a time.
"We are very aware of what the math is on this," said Dennis Boxx, the Pentagon spokesman. "We have people in Guantanamo Bay working 24 hours a day doing everything humanly possible to expand the capability of that camp."
Expanding the capacity at Guantanamo to 20,000, from 12,500 currently, will severely tax the military's ability to provide shelter, water, electricity and sanitation, military officials said. More than 10,000 Haitians are there already; more than 400 have decided to return to Haiti, an Administration source said today.
"It would be monumental," George H. Walls Jr., a retired Marine brigadier general who commanded a refugee operation at Guantanamo from November 1991 to March 1992, said in a telephone interview. During that operation, the number of refugees topped 11,000.
 
Tents on the Golf Course
 To make room for 20,000 refugees, the military will have to pitch tents on the base's golf course and football field, military engineers concluded in a study two years ago.
The base's desalting plant can produce three million gallons of drinking water a day, but the military would have to truck it to the Haitians or lay thousands of feet of pipe. The military could also bring in machines to convert sea water or brackish water into drinking water, General Walls added.
The sudden collapse of the Administration's negotiations with Panama prompted a round of recriminations.
The outlines of the plan were worked out last weekend by United States officials who went to Panama. To try to complete the understanding, Rand Beers, from the National Security Council, went to Panama early this week.
On Wednesday night, Administration officials confidently described the remaining issues as largely technical. But this morning it became clear that the differences reflected broad unhappiness in Panama.
President Endara was sworn in on an American military base in Panama during the 1989 United States invasion of Panama. And the perception that he was doing Washington's bidding appeared to be especially sensitive for the President, who leaves office on Sept. 1. Ernesto Perez Balladares, Mr. Endara's political opponent, won the presidency in early May in the first elections in Panama in more than 25 years.
 
Debating Who Blinked
 In his remarks to reporters in Panama City, Mr. Endara complained that the Administration had continually changed the terms of the arrangement and had taken Panama's cooperation for granted.
At first, Washington proposed that the refugees would be kept on an offshore island. Then, bowing to the wishes of the Panamanian political opposition, the United States said they would be kept on American bases.
Mr. Endara also said the plan to put the Haitians on bases in Panama violated the Panama Canal Treaty.
But one Administration official said it was President Endara who reneged after he realized he had miscalculated the degree of opposition.
Other changes in the refugee plan were announced today.
Mr. Gray acknowledged that Washington had relaxed its standard for determining which Haitians would be eligible for placement in a safe haven. On Tuesday Mr. Gray told reporters that only those with "a real and credible fear with regard to political persecution" would be sent to the camps. The others would be sent back to Haiti.
But officials said today that there would not be rigorous screening of Haitians picked up sea, and they would not be asked to prove they would face persecution if they returned.
Criminal and human rights violators would not be eligible to go to a safe haven.
 
Looking Closely at Force
 Though Administration officials insisted they can cope, the flood of refugees adds to the pressure on Washington to consider military action to topple the military leaders who ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991. Human rights abuses by the military, combined with economic sanctions imposed on Haiti, have driven tens of thousands to flee the country.
Stepping up preparations for a possible invasion, more than a thousand commandos recently rehearsed a plan to seize airfields and ports in Haiti, Pentagon officials said on Wednesday.
Asked about the possibility of military action, Mr. Gray said today: "I think the prospect of intervention grows as the coup leadership refuses to recognize that the world community has clearly called upon them to step down and allow democracy to be restored, and for the people of Haiti to move from under the boot of repression. However the world community, along with the United States, is committed to attempting every effort to resolve this crisis through diplomacy and financial restrictions."

HEADLINE: Poll on Doubt Of Holocaust Is Corrected

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. KAGAY 

 BODY:
Only a small segment of Americans deny that the Holocaust happened, according to a new Roper poll for the American Jewish Committee.
The new poll was conducted to correct a flawed question in an earlier survey that had suggested higher levels of Holocaust denial and, both the researchers and sponsors say, to set the polling record straight. 
 "Committed or consistent deniers of the Holocaust make up only a small segment of the population, about 2 percent or less," said Dr. Tom W. Smith, of the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center, who analyzed both the new Roper poll and all other available United States surveys on the Holocaust for the American Jewish Committee.
Dr. Smith added, "There is an additional group of a few percent -- under 10 percent -- who express some doubts or uncertainty, but do so mainly from lack of information."
In the new poll, taken by Roper Starch Worldwide Inc. , 991 adults were interviewed across the country during March. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
 
Question Is Revised
 It is a follow-up to an earlier Roper poll, taken in late 1992 for the American Jewish Committee, that seemed to indicate that 1 in 5 Americans doubted that the Holocaust had happened. Although that poll's finding about the Holocaust was widely publicized, Roper officials and other pollsters said it could not be considered accurate because the poll had used a confusing question.
In the new poll, the question was revised to read: "Does it seem possible to you that the Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened, or do you feel certain that it happened?"
Only 1 percent of those surveyed said it was possible that the Holocaust had never happened, and another 8 percent said they did not know; 91 percent said they were certain it had happened.
In the earlier poll, the flawed question used a double negative: "Does it seem possible or does it seem impossible to you that the Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened?"
In response to that wording, 22 percent of those surveyed said it was possible the Holocaust had never happened and an additional 12 percent said they did not know if it was possible; 65 percent said it was impossible that it had never happened.
"The double-negative question thoroughly confused people," said Burns W. Roper, the recently retired former chairman of the Roper polling organization. "Many may have given an answer just opposite of what they meant."
 
Correcting the Record
 Mr. Roper expressed satisfaction that the earlier inflated figure had finally been set straight. "It provided aid and comfort to the skinhead kind of anti-Semites and needlessly scared the Jewish community," he said.
The new study also found that:
*Detailed knowledge of the Holocaust had shown a modest overall gain, compared with the 1992 Roper poll. Dr. Smith attributed this to Holocaust museums and the film "Schindler's List." That knowledge was still limited, though Dr. Smith said it was comparable to Americans' knowledge of other World War II events.
*Americans were less knowledgeable about the Holocaust than the British, French or Germans surveyed in comparable polls.
*Education was a major factor accounting for Holocaust knowledge. Fifty-five percent of those with less than a high school education knew what the Holocaust was, compared with 87 percent of college graduates.
Dr. Smith's report, "Holocaust Denial: What the Survey Data Reveal," was originally scheduled to be made public by the American Jewish Committee on July 19. But Professor Everett C. Ladd of the University of Connecticut disclosed some of its findings in the July 1 edition of The Christian Science Monitor. In response, the American Jewish Committee disclosed Dr. Smith's full report yesterday.
Professor Ladd called the incident "an incredible chapter in American survey experience." He added, "People were really distressed, yet we went 14 months before we got a full acknowledgement."
David A. Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee, said, "Given the anxiety levels produced by the earlier poll, we felt it was worth the extra weeks needed to set the record straight with the kind of conclusive and comprehensive document Tom Smith has produced on the whole issue of Holocaust denial."

HEADLINE: In Tiny Haitian Port, Even Grief Is a Political Act

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ST.-MARC, Haiti, July 7

 BODY:
Gladys Paul lay on a bed in her two-room home groaning softly, grieving for her two children, who died on Monday when the rickety boat they were aboard capsized, killing at least 150 people.
"Oh! It hurts," she said to no one in particular, surrounded by a handful of friends and relatives. "My babies are gone." 
 Under normal circumstances Miss Paul, who lost two sons, Roygens Oscar, 7, and Ernst Oscar, 6, would expect a steady flow of visitors to pay their respects. And given the scope of the tragedy in a small city where every one is somehow related, the whole town would be mourning.
But these are not normal times: mourning the dead, particularly those who died trying to flee the island, can be seen as a political act.
 
Bodies Still at Sea
 Neither Miss Paul nor the relatives of the other victims have seen the bodies. Officials have not sent workers to retrieve the bodies, and many still float next to the capsized boat just offshore.
About six people have been arrested for organizing the journey, and many survivors are hiding in fear that they, too, will be detained by military officials.
But some remain defiant, openly acknowledging that they will return to sea at the first opportunity.
"I am not going into hiding," said Jean-Charles Oscar, who was on the boat when his sons, Roygens and Ernst, died. "I just lost two sons. If they want, they can come and kill me."
Political repression has worsened in recent months as military leaders who ousted the President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, have begin to suffer from the pressure aimed at forcing them out of power.
 
Specter of Invasion
 A force of 2,000 seaborne United States marines is to arrive off Haiti this weekend. One high-level Haitian military officer said that although the marines are only supposed to evacuate Americans in case of an emergency, army officers see the move as a prelude to an invasion.
Accidents like that near St.-Marc are all too familiar.
According to a dozen survivors interviewed today, at about 3 A.M. on Monday scores of people begin lining up to board tiny fishing boats to take them to a 30-foot vessel that was to sail toward the Windward Passage, where it was certain to be intercepted by United States Coast Guard cutters.
By 5:30 A.M., when the vessel set sail, about 300 people had crammed aboard the boat, which was built to hold 100 at most. After sailing less than 200 yards, the boat was rocked by a strong wind, and an instant panic sent people overboard.
"People started screaming," said Claudy Sylvain, 17. "I don't know how I got out. The last thing I remember I was on the shore trying to catch my breath."
Nowhere is the pain greater than in the Oscar family, which lost three small children. To Miss Paul her sons were as precious as "her two eyes." Neighbors described them as sweet, quiet and polite children. "They were nice kids," said Francoise Metellus, a friend of the family. "What has this country come to?"
The boys were nephews of Verdieu Oscar, who also lost his son. But three days after the accident, Mr. Oscar said that while he feels like a broken man, he will try again to flee by boat.
"I was looking for a better life for them, so I have resigned myself that this accident was their destiny," Verdieu Oscar said. He says he is fleeing economic turmoil and near starvation: "This morning I woke up and I didn't have a dollar to feed my child. My war has just began."
 
An Aspiring Lawyer Is Dead
 When told he might not reach the United States, he replied: "It's this country that I hate. I don't care where they send me. I will be all right, eventually."
Another victim was Rony Odige. At 25, he was the hope of his family. He finished high school two years ago and was studying sociology. In the fall, he was to begin law studies. Mr. Odige was a perfectionist who finished at the top of his classes. His passion was soccer, and after every World Cup match, he and friends would analyze the match passionately.
But as the political crisis steadily worsened, Mr. Odige began to lose faith that he would ever become a lawyer. In the last days before he died, he talked incessantly of joining his father, who emigrated to Irvington, N.J., in 1980.
"I can't explain it," said Byron Odige, Rony's brother. "I feel that a part of me has left me."
As the boat was swamped, Rony Odige, who did not know how to swim, cried out for help, and he took out a gold ring and tossed it to a nearby fisherman on a small boat as payment to rescue him.
The ring fell into the water.

HEADLINE: Parting Snapshots for the Supreme Court Yearbook

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
The Supreme Court's 1994 term, which ended last week, was one of impressions rather than grand themes. The caseload was light but the going was tough. The Justices emerged somewhat the worse for wear and departed on a much-needed summer break, leaving behind the following array of snapshots.
HOTTEST NEW TOPIC: Garbage and what to do with it, the subject of three decisions, reflecting its growing role in the interstate economy. 
 LOWER COURT THAT FARED THE WORST: The Supreme Court of Oregon. The justices overturned all three of its decisions that they reviewed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, didn't do too well either: the Court reversed it in 11 out of 14 cases.
LOWER COURT THAT FARED THE BEST: The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond. The Justices reviewed three of its decisions and affirmed them all.
MOST PREDICTABLE RESULT: The Court's unanimous ruling in Dalton v. Specter that the choice of which military bases to close is not subject to challenge in Federal court.
LEAST REWARDING TRIP TO THE COURT: That of Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican, who had brought the original lawsuit on military base closings in an attempt to block the shutting of the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. The case had his name on it. He chose to argue it himself. He lost.
MOST AUSPICIOUS DEBUT: Silvia S. Ibanez, a sole practitioner and certified public accountant from Winter Haven, Fla., who had never argued an appellate case before she argued her own, a free-speech challenge to a state restriction on advertising by accountants who also practice law. She won Ibanez v. Florida, 7 to 2.
CASE THAT BROUGHT THE JUSTICES CLOSEST TO THE CUTTING EDGE OF POP CULTURE: Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, in which the Court reviewed 2 Live Crew's raw rap music parody of Roy Orbison's "Oh Pretty Woman" and decided unanimously that a commercial parody is not necessarily copyright infringement. There was something endearing about Justice David H. Souter, for whom 18th-century music verges on the suspiciously modern, offering a footnoted definition of rap music complete with references to hip-hop. But he could not match the enthusiasm of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who in another copyright case a week earlier, Fogerty v. Fantasy Inc., referred to Creedence Clearwater Revival as "one of the greatest American rock and roll groups of all time."
MOST SURPRISING VOTE: That of Chief Justice Rehnquist, who left abortion rights groups cheering with his majority opinion in a final-day decision, Madsen v. Women's Health Center. The decision upheld most of an injunction that a Florida court had issued to protect an abortion clinic against disruptive protests.
MOST PREDICTABLE OPINION: That of Justice Clarence Thomas, who, in a concurring opinion in Farmer v. Brennan, reiterated his view that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment applies to sentencing, not to conditions in a prison. Justice Souter's majority opinion held that the Eighth Amendment obliges prison officials to protect inmates from foreseeable violence by other inmates.
MOST PUZZLING VOTE: That of Justice Clarence Thomas, for concurring in Farmer v. Brennan rather than dissenting, as he logically should have done after announcing that he rejected the decision's premise and after calling on his colleagues to reconsider all the relevant precedents.
TERM'S SWEETEST VICTORY: To Chief Justice Rehnquist, whose 5-to-4 majority opinion in Dolan v. City of Tigard, a property rights case from Oregon, was a milestone in a years-long effort to give more constitutional protection to property owners fighting government land-use regulation. The decision put new limits on the ability of local governments to make public access a condition of approving a building permit.
MOST DRAMATIC MOMENT: Justice Harry A. Blackmun's denunciation of the death penalty in an emotional statement issued just weeks before his announcement in April that he would retire at the end of the term. "From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death," the 85-year-old Justice said.
MOST POINTED EXCHANGE: Justice Antonin Scalia, a stylish polemicist, and Justice Souter. Justice Scalia for years has had no peer in the rhetorical riposte department, but he may have met his match in Justice Souter. They clashed notably in Board of Education of Kiryas Joel v. Grumet, in which Justice Souter's majority opinion held unconstitutional a public school district that New York State created for a village of Hasidic Jews. Justice Scalia, in blistering dissent, called the decision "astounding" and "unprecedented," saying that "it continues, and takes to new extremes, a recent tendency in the opinions of this Court to turn the Establishment Clause into a repealer of our nation's tradition of religious toleration."
To which Justice Souter replied: "Justice Cardozo once cast the dissenter as 'the gladiator making a last stand against the lions.' Justice Scalia's dissent is certainly the work of a gladiator, but he thrusts at lions of his own imagining."
MOST IMPORTANT STRAW IN THE WIND: In the Kiryas Joel case, when five Justices took the occasion to suggest that the Court reconsider two precedents in the church-state arena. The two 1985 cases prohibited public school systems from sending teachers onto parochial school premises to teach federally financed special education classes.
TERM'S HAPPIEST CAMPER: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who in her first term took the bench every morning with a smile and, by all accounts, enjoyed herself immensely.
TERM'S UNHAPPIEST CAMPER: Justice Thomas, who spoke hardly at all from the bench and who, during many arguments, looked as if he wished he were somewhere else.
WHEN IT STARTS AGAIN: The first Monday in October -- Oct. 3, 1994.

HEADLINE: Blue Chips Continue to Rise; Dow Up 13.92

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Stocks were higher yesterday, with gains posted by many big industrial companies, which are particularly sensitive to strengthening economic growth. Market analysts said the second-quarter profits of many industrial companies that have been cutting costs might be larger than expected.
Stocks of several retailers gained after strong store sales were reported for June. Dayton Hudson, which rose 1, to 81 7/8, said sales in its stores that were open more than a year jumped 12.7 percent, while Wal-Mart Stores, which rose 7/8, to 24 3/4, said its same-store sales rose 9.3 percent last month. Caldor rose 7/8, to 29 3/4, and Sears, Roebuck was ahead, 3/8, to 47 7/8. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.92 points, to 3,688.42. Gains posted by General Motors, Bethlehem Steel and Boeing accounted for 73 percent of the index's advance.
The volume on the New York Stock Exchange was moderate, at 259.7 million shares traded, when compared with the volume of the last few months, but was was higher than the volume of 233.6 million on Wednesday. The number of issues that advanced outpaced those that declined by 1,263 to 858.
 
Nasdaq Index Rises 5.53 Points

 
 Other indexes also moved higher. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 2.25 points, to 448.38; the New York Stock Exchange composite rose 1.03 points, to 247.57; the American Stock Exchange rose 1.10 points, to 424.65, and the Nasdaq composite rose 5.53 points, to 706.53.
Early in yesterday's session stocks drew much of their strength from modest gains in the dollar, Treasury bonds and overseas markets.
Many traders said they believed that while the stock market may have dodged a bullet in Wednesday's session, after the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee failed to move on interest rates, there was still one bullet left for the Fed to fire today.
The monthly employment data to be released today by the Labor Department have held traders at bay all week, keeping them from getting too excited about the market's near-term prospects. But buyers yesterday seemed to bet that the data about job growth would not be sharply above expectations, thus reducing the chances of an increase in interest rates. Too swift a growth in employment could help to raise inflation, the main economic threat the Fed would fight by raising rates.
Patrick J. Moriarty, chief investment officer for Bank Julius Bear in New York, said trading grew wary as the day wore on, with investors looking ahead to the employment data.
 
Job Gains Predicted

 
 Mr. Moriarty said economists were estimating a gain of 267,000 jobs in today's data, up from the gain of 191,000 posted in May.
Depending on today's report, Mr. Moriarty said, the Fed will probably not find cause to raise interest rates immediately. "We feel the current levels of inflation and economic growth are an aberration," he said, "and only a cyclical upturn within a long-term cyclical decline." But, he added, it will be a hard call to make if the new-jobs number is much higher than 350,000.
Beside retailers, another strong group was the automotive stocks. Chrysler climbed 3, to 49 1/8; General Motors rose 2 1/4, to 51 3/4, and Ford Motor rose 1, to 29 7/8.
Mr. Moriarty said the group was up after Wednesday's auto industry data that showed lower sales. The buying yesterday was sparked by the underlying reason for the lower sales report, he said, a lack of inventory, not a lack of demand.
"Also," he said, "all the car makers have announced price increases for 1995 and those increases are more likely to stick. And since used-car life spans are now above eight years, it means that demand will not dissipate."
Airborne Freight slumped for the second straight day after a Robinson Humphrey analyst cut estimates for its earnings because of declining package shipments and slower economic growth. The stock dropped 2 1/8, to 29 1/4, for a cumulative fall of nearly 17 percent in two sessions.

HEADLINE: Charles S. Benson Is Dead at 72; Expert on Education Economics

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Dr. Charles Scott Benson, an expert on the economics of education, died on Saturday in Carlsbad, Calif., while on a weekend visit with relatives. He was 72 and lived in Kensington, Calif., outside Berkeley.
The apparent cause was a heart attack, said the University of California, where Dr. Benson was a professor emeritus and, from 1964 until his retirement three years ago, taught educational administration and policy analysis. 
 Dr. Benson was also the director and chief investigator of the National Center for Research in Vocational Education. The center, based on the Berkeley campus, is a consortium of seven institutions financed by the United States Education Department to study the relationship between classroom studies and the workplace.
 
Models of Change
 Through his three decades at Berkeley, Dr. Benson's writings and advice contributed to public policy in America and abroad. He once said he regarded the center he headed as an instrument of changing a system that, he said, could doom a person who had no college degree to "wander from one minimum-wage job to another for about 10 years before finding a place to begin a career."
Most recently he focused on models for a vocational education that would integrate academic and vocational studies in high school as an alternative to the traditional college-preparatory curriculum.
He combined his research with public service in matters like school finance reform, social policies affecting pupils and their families, and the relationship between education and employment. He often served as a consultant to the World Bank, the Ford Foundation and American foreign aid officials, among others, on educational development planning overseas.
He played a role in the search for school finance reforms in the 1960's and 70's, and his text "The Economics of Public Education" (Houghton Mifflin) helped to define the subject. Dr. Benson, a native of Atlanta, received his bachelor's degree in economics from Princeton University and his master's and Ph.D. from Columbia University. Before joining the Berkeley faculty, he taught at Bowdoin College from 1950 to 1955 and at Harvard University from 1955 until 1963.
He is survived by his wife, Dorothy Merrick Benson; two daughters, Michele S., of Berkeley, and Sally M., of Richmond; a son, Charles S. Jr., of Pocatello, Idaho; a brother, Lawrence W., of Monroe, Ga., and seven grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Sharp Rise Seen in Smokers' Health Care Costs

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
Health care for smoking-related illnesses cost at least $50 billion in 1993, twice as much as has been estimated for previous years, according to a new Federal survey.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Atlanta-based agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, released the data today, saying that the estimate was based on a survey of 35,000 people, the most extensive to date. It is the only survey that has counted only actual medical bills, making it the most reliable estimate ever done, said Dr. Thomas E. Novotny, a leader of the study. 
 The study made these findings:
*Smoking accounts for at least 7 percent of all health care costs in the United states.
*The Federal Government and state governments pay for more than 43 percent of all smoking-attributed medical expenditures, and more than 60 percent for those over the age of 65.
*Most of the costs from smoking are for hospitalization, 54 percent; doctors' bills, 31 percent, and nursing home expenses, 10 percent.
 
Based on Multiple Interviews
 The study was conducted by the disease control agency and researchers from the University of California at Berkeley and the University of California at San Francisco, using information gathered by the Federal Government's National Medical Expenditures Survey from interviews with 35,000 people in 1987 and 1988. The figures were then adjusted for inflation to reflect the value of the dollar in 1993.
In the survey, each person was interviewed four times and each described his health problems and expenditures. The expenditures were then checked against medical records.
To estimate how much of the expenditures could be attributed directly to smoking, the researchers put those who were interviewed into four categories: those who never smoked, those who smoked for less then 15 years, those who smoked for more than 15 years, and those currently smoking. Then they added up the chief medical expenses of those with the most smoke exposure who had one of five diseases: heart disease, emphysema, lung cancer, arteriosclerosis and stroke.
The share of their medical expenses attributed to smoking was determined by first subtracting for other risk factors. For example, if a person was a smoker and also obese, the percentage of the spending attributed to smoking was less than it would be if the smoker was not obese.
 
Lower Than Actual Costs
 Dr. Novotny said the figures that resulted were "very minimum estimates" and likely to be lower than the actual costs.
He said that some medical problems attributed to smoking were not counted, like burns from fires caused by cigarettes and low birth weight or other infant health problems caused by a pregnant woman's smoking.
Dr. Novotny said the total economic burden of smoking is at least twice their $50 billion estimate. Other costs that should be included to reach a total estimate, he said, would be $6 billion more in costs associated with sick days and $40 billion in costs associated with premature death because of smoking.
The agency's figures are likely to be important to those states that have passed laws permitting them to sue the tobacco companies to recover money the states have spent for health costs linked to smoking. Dr. Novotny said that state-by-state estimates of the costs of smoking would be available within a few weeks.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Mark Time Awaiting Jobs Report

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were little changed yesterday for a third straight session as the bond market remained calm ahead of today's Government report on June employment.
Since Tuesday, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond ended each day within three basis points of the prior day's close. That is the smallest swing in the long bond's yield since the week of May 2, when it ended the day between 7.33 percent and 7.35 percent for four straight days. 
 Yesterday, the 30-year bond's yield ended at 7.60 percent, up one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point, from Wednesday.
"There's no interest in trading right now," said Michael Marzano, head of bond futures trading at Yamaichi International (America). "People are waiting for tomorrow and next week."
 
Repeat of Turmoil?
 But some investors are worried that the bond market might have set itself up to repeat the turmoil in early May, when the Government shocked traders by reporting that more jobs than expected were created in April. The bond's yield jumped 20 basis points that day.
An unusually strong increase in new jobs in June could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the fifth time this year to keep the economy from growing too rapidly, leading to increased inflation.
A survey of economists shows that they expect the Labor Department to report that the economy added 267,000 jobs in June, up from 191,000 in May.
"I'm looking for it to be surprisingly strong, a lot stronger than people realize," said Roger Marshall, president of Riggs Investment Management of Washington, referring to the expected increase in new jobs in June.
The June employment increase could be larger than expected because the scheduling of the report gave the Labor Department one more week than it normally does to collect statistics, some economists said.
Mr. Marshall warned that Treasury bond yields could soar, possibly reaching 8 percent before the summer is over, if job growth remains robust.
Still, bond prices did not react to a report that first-time jobless claims fell an unexpected 21,000 in the latest week to 332,000, the lowest in almost four months.
 
Concern About Dollar
 Some analysts noted that the Fed was also concerned about the weakening dollar. Higher American interest rates would bolster the dollar by making dollar-denominated deposits more attractive to investors.
"The Fed is looking for a reason to come in here and make a move so they have something else to point to besides the dollar," said James Casselberry, who manages about $900 million in bonds for the Chicago-based MacArthur Foundation.
But many economists have said that the Fed's concerns about the condition of the American economy are likely to outweigh its interest in supporting the dollar.
The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making panel, ended a two-day meeting on Wednesday without announcing any moves to push up interest rates.
This weekend, the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries are meeting in Naples. But there were few signs yesterday that they would take any major action to support the dollar.
Some analysts say the Fed may have decided to raise interest rates again to head off inflation and is just waiting for an appropriate time to announce it.
"If you get a strong economic number, it makes it easier politically to raise rates," said William Stevens, who manages $250 million in bonds at Montgomery Asset Management, based in Walnut Creek, Calif.
In early trading yesterday, Treasury bonds gained as much as 12/32 of a point on speculation that the Fed bought Treasury securities for other central banks.
"There's been talk of the Fed buying two-year and five-year notes, but I have no confirmation of that," Mr. Marzano of Yamaichi said. A spokesman at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York declined to comment.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops Amid Signs The Group of 7 Won't Act

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell moderately against the German mark and the Japanese yen yesterday amid signs that leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized nations would do little at their summit meeting this weekend to support the American currency.
Many traders sold dollars late in the day after an American official said the Group of Seven would not try to stabilize the dollar. 
 "We don't expect any kind of yen-dollar coordination at this summit, be it major or minor," said the official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified.
 
 
Three-Day Meeting
 The comments are the latest in a series by Group of Seven leaders and senior Government officials indicating that they are not concerned about the dollar's fall and are unwilling to try to support it. The group starts a three-day meeting in Naples today.
So far this year, the dollar has fallen 9.5 percent against the mark and 11.5 percent against the yen.
"The G-7 is sending signals that we shouldn't expect any action from them in the currency market," said David De Rosa, director of foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation. "Of course, they could be trying to fake us out."
Success in propping up a slumping currency often depends on catching foreign-exchange traders off guard. Group of Seven leaders may be feigning relative indifference to the dollar's fate so they can catch traders wrong-footed later, Mr. De Rosa said.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5732 marks, down from 1.5782 marks on Wednesday. It also fell to 98.60 yen from 99 yen.
 
 
'Behind Us'
 The dollar fell earlier in the day after Italy's Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, said the world's monetary authorities had little power to support the dollar because the foreign exchange market had become too large. "That sort of ability to intervene is behind us," he said, adding that he was not worried about the weakness of the dollar.
"Everyone is waiting for the weekend," Peter Wadkins, senior vice president at MTB Bank, said. "If nothing happens, they'll sell the dollar again next week."
The dollar showed little change against the mark earlier yesterday after the Bundesbank left German interest rates unchanged after its biweekly meeting. Some analysts had expected the German central bank to cut rates as part of an international effort to bolster the dollar.
Speculation that the Federal Reserve might raise American interest rates after the June employment report comes out today kept the dollar from falling further, traders said. Some expect the Fed to act if the report shows the economy is growing fast enough to raise the risk of an acceleration of inflation.

HEADLINE: First-Time Jobless Claims Decline

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new unemployment claims showed a surprising drop today on the eve of a Government report that is expected to show strong employment growth in June.
New jobless claims declined 21,000 last week, to 332,000, the Labor Department said today. It was the largest drop since April and the lowest level since March. During the previous week claims rose by 1,000, to 353,000. 
 The report sets the stage for Friday's June employment survey, which could counter other recent Government statistics suggesting the economy may be losing momentum. "I don't think the economy has slowed down," said William Stevens, who manages $250 million in bonds at Montgomery Asset Management.
 
 
Survey of Economists
 Economists surveyed by Bloomberg Business News estimated that the economy added 267,000 more jobs in the month after adding 191,000 in May.
Robust job growth could encourage the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates again to keep inflation in check. On Wednesday, Fed policy makers wrapped up a two-day meeting on monetary policy without taking any immediate action on interest rates.
While many analysts expect the June employment report to show a big gain in service employment, along with more modest increases in manufacturing and construction hiring, the total number could be skewed by a seasonal quirk. "Due to the bad winter, many schools had to extend the school year, so teachers and other educational employees may have been on payrolls longer than usual," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch in New York.
At the same time, big companies announced only 35,032 work force reductions in June, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., a Chicago employment firm. That is down from the monthly average of 50,843 job cuts for the last year and a half.
 
 
Moving Average
 Today's Labor Department report showed the four-week moving average for jobless claims, a more consistent gauge of employment conditions, fell to 346,500 last week from 353,250 in the prior week, also the lowest level since mid-April.
Part of last week's decline might be tied to the fact that auto makers delayed the customary summer shutdown of some factories, said Kathleen Camilli, chief economist with Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc.
Separately, the Commerce Department reported today that inventories of unsold goods at wholesalers rose 1.6 percent in May, the biggest gain in almost two years. Wholesale sales for the month rose three-tenths of 1 percent.
Wholesale inventories increased to $223.2 billion during the month following a revised 1 percent gain in April, rather than four-tenths of 1 percent as originally reported.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Long-Term Coffee Surges As Figures Hint of Shortage

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The prices of long-term coffee futures surged yesterday on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange as new supply figures suggested a shortage was possible. The surge came even though prices for near-term coffee contracts fell.
A mixed showing in other commodity futures led to only a modest increase in the Commodity Research Bureau price index, a key indicator of inflation activity. The index of 21 agricultural and industrial commodities rose 0.61, to 225.92. 
 On other commodity markets, energy futures prices slumped; grains and soybeans were mixed; livestock and meat futures finished higher, and precious metals ended mixed.
Green arabica coffee beans for September delivery fell 1.15 cents, to $1.933 a pound, but most other contracts surged 9 cents, with the December contract closing at $1.95 a pound.
Coffee prices seesawed throughout the session amid a flurry of news reports and rumors. The prices fell early in the session on rumors that Brazil planned to offer five million bags of coffee for auction during a 10-month period, which would flood the market.
They rebounded later amid reports that frost damage in Brazil would lead to the harvesting of 17 million bags, down from estimates of 22 million bags, said Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst with Smith Barney in New York.
Later in the day, Brazil's Government said it would auction five million bags from its stocks. The Government also reduced its 1994-95 crop estimates to 17.5 million bags, a loss of 28.6 percent of the crop.
Crude oil futures prices led other petroleum products lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with the August contract falling 12 cents, to $19.12 a barrel.
August home heating oil fell 0.91 cent, to 48.18 cents a gallon; August unleaded gasoline fell 0.84 cent, to 52.13 cents a gallon; August natural gas fell 0.5 cent, to $2.072 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Soybean and wheat futures prices finished mostly higher on the Chicago Board of Trade amid improved export demand for the crops. But exports remain well below last year's levels, which could put pressure on prices in the coming weeks as weather helps those crops grow.
Corn futures prices were mostly lower as better weather led to visions of a bumper crop. The National Weather Service's 6-to-10-day forecast called for rain and normal to slightly above-normal temperatures, which would help crops during a crucial growing period.
Wheat for delivery in July rose 1 1/2 cents, to $3.06 3/4 a bushel; July corn rose 1 3/4 cents, to $2.40 a bushel; July oats rose 2 3/4 cents, to $1.15 a bushel; July soybeans rose 4 1/4 cents, to $6.24 1/4 a bushel.

HEADLINE: U.S. Business and the Russian Mob

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 7

 BODY:
After many years in which the hydra-headed Russian mafia has openly penetrated virtually every level of local business, American companies operating here -- big and small, famous and unknown -- have begun to feel increasing pressure from criminal organizations that never before seemed to bother with them.
The situation for American business is still nothing like it is for Russians, for whom threats, intimidation, extortion and violence have become routine. 
 But thugs from Moscow gangs and more polished criminals from the mafia, as Russians call their criminal organizations, have increasingly turned their attention to American business in the last few months, visiting large financial institutions, small retail outlets and even unknown consulting firms, according to Russian police inspectors, American law-enforcement officials and the nervous business executives themselves.
 
Thinly Veiled Offers
 United States Embassy officials report a sharp rise, to more than a dozen this year from two all last year, in the number of companies acknowledging visits from gangs who seek to "protect" them in return for a weekly fee or a percentage of their profit. And with more than 100 American joint ventures and partnerships under way in Russia, the number may be higher.
In perhaps the most alarming recent incident, gangsters paid a call on the Moscow office of the American Chamber of Commerce, demanding the list of all companies that are members, with their addresses and phone numbers.
Frenzied chamber officials refused to provide them, and so far that has been the end of the incident, said three chamber members who, like almost everyone interviewed for this article, insisted on not being identified. Other companies have reported similar recent visits.
"If there was ever a sense that we were to be left alone, it is clearly gone now," said Richard A. Conn Jr., a lawyer with Latham & Watkins, a firm here that represents several major international corporations doing business in Russia. "I still consider it safe for Westerners to work here, and I encourage them to do so all the time. But the growth of the mob has been dramatic, and there just isn't a pass for American businesses from the mafia anymore."
Mr. Conn and most other foreign executives interviewed say that official corruption, an irrational system of levying and collecting taxes, and a lasting mistrust of profit still hurt American businesses here far more than crime does. And the executives note that no representative of any American company is known to have been killed by the mob, although such killings occur almost weekly among Russian businessmen, especially bankers.
But the days are over when American companies could afford to neglect what the Interior Ministry says are more than 5,000 gangs operating here, or when the Americans could permit their Russian partners to silently and secretly handle issues like crime and payoffs. Metal doors, electric fences and armed guards posted outside the office have become necessities, and that is just the beginning for some companies. The F.B.I. opened its first field office in Russia this week, but this is considered largely a symbolic presence.
"We hired the bad guys in white hats to protect us from the bad guys in black hats," said Bruce Macdonald, director general of BBDO Marketing in Moscow, explaining the presence at his advertising agency of two enormous Russians in camouflage outfits armed with pump shotguns.
Mr. Macdonald declined to discuss in any detail why they recently appeared on his payroll, but he acknowledged that it was not by chance.
"Foreign business is now being targeted in a very specific way, even businesses like this that hold no cash receipts," he said, "and I want my people to feel they are protected."
 
Knowledge Can Be Lethal
 Most foreign businesses in Russia are joint ventures. That has meant that for every American executive here there is almost always a Russian partner. And that meant it has been impossible to gauge the level of crime carried out against foreign companies, because the Russian partners invariably do the dealing with other Russians.
"In general, people don't want to know what they don't have to know," said Jeffrey M. Zeiger, whose Tren-Mos Bistro was the first American restaurant to open in Moscow. Mr. Zeiger's Russian partner was gunned down in his garage last year and even today, Mr. Zeiger swears he never heard a word about payoffs or a hint of a problem before his partner died.
"If it happened, I never knew about it," he said. "I never suspected it. And when they come for me, I'll give them the keys to the restaurant and leave this country the same day."
Hotels and restaurants -- the most visible businesses with the most obviously accessible cash -- are usually the first targets. But increasingly, smaller, non-cash businesses like advertising, consulting and manufacturing operations have been approached. Although they denied it, several of America's most famous corporations have also been approached since the beginning of the year, according to American law-enforcement officials and others in Moscow business circles.
"We have had a continual stream of reports this year from businesses reporting pressure," said an American who insisted on being identified only as a United States Embassy official. "Some of the contact has been very scary. The ones who come to us are almost always small-business men. Does that mean that McDonald's isn't bothered or that Coke has no problems? Not necessarily. But if they do, we don't know about it."
 
Big Enough to Bypass
 McDonald's says it has no problems with gangsters, and police officials say that Russian mobsters are rarely stupid enough to pick on the most visible American companies.
"It would take a fairly aggressive and sophisticated group to bother McDonald's," said Sergei Bogdonov, a spokesman for the organized-crime division of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, previously the K.G.B. "Those people know they can get more money and easier money in other ways."
The origin of many criminal gangs helps explain why they are ubiquitous. Many started in the old Soviet labor camps, to which some prisoners were sent for committing the sin of seeking profit.
When the world changed in Russia and suddenly Communism was bad and profits were good, criminals were often the only Russians who knew what to do. That and the absence of a reliable legal system permitted gangs to seize an enormous percentage of every emerging market.
Stories circulate in Moscow of men -- even Americans -- taken from the street and told to pay or die, but most of the tales seem to be false. One American businessman said two gangsters approached him to say that they had been paid $10,000 to kill him but would gladly let him live for another $10,000. He stalled for time, left Russia that same day and is now living in Eastern Europe -- although it seems that he was more likely the victim of a scam than of a potential contract killing.
 
Standard Method of Approach
 Yet the mob's approaches to foreign businesses, particularly in Moscow, where a third of all foreign investment is found, are taking on an eerily regular pattern, as one American consulting firm found out a few weeks ago.
"We got a phone call," said an executive at the firm, which is not well known, has no storefront, sells nothing for cash and pays all its American employees in electronic money transfers to avoid keeping currency in the office. "It wasn't subtle. They said they knew who we were and they knew we weren't 'working' with anybody."
The executive continued, "They volunteered to 'work with us' and demanded an immediate meeting," which occurred within 48 hours. "They were very open about what they wanted and we were very open, too. We just said no." That same day, the company changed all its locks, bought steel doors and expensive surveillance equipment and hired guards to protect its staff.
Many companies that contend they have had no problem with crime should look more closely at their rent, Russian police officials say, because payoffs to mobsters may be hidden in the $8,000 to $10,000 a month that it often costs to rent a decent office. Many foreign executives counter by saying that is the cost of doing business in a politically unstable locale, and that many such countries are worse than Russia.
"To me, acting surprised that people in this type of environment are seeking to take your money illegally is like showing surprise that the sun came up this morning," said John K. Bailey, managing director of Johnson & Johnson in Russia. "You do not have to break American law or pay criminals to acknowledge that this is a difficult working environment. It seems stupid to have to keep repeating it, but the greatest rewards are usually not far from the greatest risks."
 
A Market Hard to Ignore
 If there are great risks in Russia -- crime, a legal system that is unstable at best and nonexistent at worst -- there are also enormous opportunities for energetic entrepreneurs.
Russia has 150 million people. The market for the most basic consumer items, from deodorant to tampons, popsicles to eye liner, is just developing. Although the economy is floundering, many Western investors, led by the International Monetary Fund, have bet that in the long term Russia will emerge from its difficult transition to the marketplace with a vigorous economy.
If it does, then few companies eager to expand in the coming decades can afford not to be here.
"You know, the question here isn't are conditions perfect or even are they safe," Mr. Macdonald of BBDO said. "The question is where do I have to be in the next 30 years for this company to grow. And this is the world's next great market. And that is a fact that is worth thinking about when you think about all the other facts of business life in Russia. If you can't handle the pressure, you can't handle the business."

HEADLINE: Labatt Rating May Be Cut

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: TORONTO, July 7

 BODY:
John Labatt Ltd.'s debt ratings may be cut because of the company's plan to pay $510 million for a stake in a Mexican brewery, the Dominion Bond Rating Service said today.
The purchase price will more than double Labatt's current long-term debt of $610 million (Canadian), or $439.2 million (United States), which is a key concern of the rating company. Labatt said on Wednesday that it would buy a 22 percent stake in the Femsa Cerveza division of Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A. 
 "The additional debt will result in a weakening of Labatt's balance sheet and coverage ratios," Dominion Bond said.
Labatt, based in Toronto, is one of the most profitable beer companies in North America. Robert Vaux, the chief financial officer, said the company would finance the acquisition from $210 million (Canadian) in cash on hand and new debt totaling about $500 million (Canadian).
While Dominion Bond is concerned about the financial impact of the acquisition, the rating company said the purchase "has many positive aspects in that it gives Labatt an entry in the growing Mexican beer market."

HEADLINE: ART REVIEWS;
In New Jersey, a Permanent Japonisme Display

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
New Jersey art museums within easy striking distance of Manhattan offer a number of low-key rewards this summer. The Newark Museum is host to a cluster of offbeat mini-shows, from contemporary American to South Asian art. Jersey City Museum's airy space on the top floor of the city's public library is filled with the vital work of six young sculptors. And the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University in New Brunswick has recently inaugurated the first-ever permanent display devoted to the international esthetic movement known as Japonisme.
 
New Brunswick
 The Kusakabe-Griffis Japonisme Gallery documents a formative though still little-explored chapter in modern art history, the period from the mid-19th to early-20th century when Japan and the West were first engaged in fertile cultural exchange. 
 Much of that exchange was socio-economic in origin: Japan, after opening its doors to trade in 1853, was getting its first crack at Western-style industrial progress, while the West was gaining access to an exotic foreign market. Nowhere did this venture have greater immediate impact than on art. On the Japanese side, woodblock prints by artists like Hiroshige quickly began incorporating details of Western culture, from stovepipe hats to locomotives, while advanced European painters, Manet and Van Gogh among them, seized upon the formal properties of Japanese art as a way to break the grip of Western academic tradition.
It should be said right away that none of the work in the Rutgers Japonisme collection is of "masterpiece" caliber. Among its paintings and drawings, prints and posters, books and photographs can be found works by a few high-profile figures (Mary Cassatt and Toulouse-Lautrec are represented by some graphic work; Frank Lloyd Wright by a stained-glass window), but most of the Western artists are notable primarily as textbook exemplars of Japonisme itself.
Yet from this nonstellar, often ephemeral material, the Zimmerli's director, Phillip Dennis Cate, has shaped a telling study in cultural history. One of the installation's very first images gives a taste of the fascinating crossbreeding to come. It is an 1885 Japanese woodblock portrait of Kukuchi Genichiro, editor of the country's first newspaper. The print's technical execution is traditional, as is the pretty landscape of mountains and lakes it depicts. But Genichiro himself is like nothing Japanese art has seen before: he is a rakish figure dressed in a natty checked tweed suit, knee-high boots and a beretlike floppy black hat.
This portrait was intended as a positive emblem of Westernization (the title of the woodblock series from which it comes is "Self-Made Men Worthy of Emulation"), though Japanese depictions of Westerners themselves are sometimes unmistakably derisive. This is certainly true of Utagawa Yoshitoro's print "English Couple" (1861), with its simian-looking bearded merchant dominated by a towering, umbrella-wielding wife in pantaloons.
Western artists display a similar mix of admiration, disdain and incomprehension in their adaptations of Japanese culture. In a famous poster of a black-dressed Jane Avril, Toulouse-Lautrec forges a daring emblem of modernity from the flat planes and solid colors of Japanese prints. By contrast, Philippe Burty, who coined the term "Japonisme" in 1872, turns images of Noh masks into cartoons, and Helen Hyde, one of several American artists who studied in Japan, makes sentimentalized kitsch from what were presumably first-hand observations. Her work is a reminder that while some innovative Westerners used Japanese art to radicalize their vision, others sought the romantic images of pre-industrial serenity that this long-sequestered island nation was imagined to embody.
The Kusakabe-Griffis Japonisme Gallery (named for America's first Japanese college student, who enrolled at Rutgers in 1867, and for his English tutor) provides substantial evidence for all these points of view. It puts the good, the bad and the ugly side by side in a richly textured, stimulating exhibition that anyone interested in the shaping of 19th-century European modernism and in East Asian art will want to see.
 
Newark
 Work of the 19th century also plays a significant part in "Gods and Goddesses in Indian Art" at the Newark Museum, a small gathering of South Asian sculptures and paintings from the museum's holdings.
Among the remarkable pieces is a late-19th-century hollow metal head of the god Shiva from southern India. With its large, intense eyes and fantastically decorated, winglike ears, it was created to be carried in religious processions. From the same century, from Rajasthan, comes a large painting on unstretched cotton of women worshipping Krishna. Every element in the composition is symmetrical, yet the brilliantly colored palm groves and peacocks set under a star-filled autumn sky are vibrant with spiritual animation.
Splendid older pieces are also on view: the ninth-century goddess Parvati swaying to the rhythm of unheard dance music is one; a striking four-headed Brahma carved in wood another. But it is the the 19th-century works that prove of particular interest. They represent a period only beginning to get serious scholarly attention and they give clear evidence of ancient traditions perpetuated and transformed in the present.
The California artist John Baldessari has done his share of transforming traditions, too. His photograph-and-text-based conceptual work has had considerable influence on contemporary art since the early 1970's, and "John Baldessari: Four Directional Pieces" at Newark offers a small sampling of his output from the last three decades.
The earliest work, "A Movie" (1972-73), is pretty much clever absurdist fun. It consists of 28 old film stills arranged on the wall as a large spiral, dictated by the direction of the glances of the main characters -- Hollywood femmes fatales, gangsters and cowboys -- in each of the film stills.
"Flying Saucers" (1992), with its fragmented shots of ruined buildings and Santa Monica bicyclists, offers a bit more food for thought, and the enlarged magazine photos of snakes in "Baudelaire Meets Poe" (1980) are genuinely creepy. The low visual wattage of this artist's work, however, remains a problem. Even at their most dynamic, his images tend to fade quickly from memory (it has often been said that he is more interesting for the work he has inspired in others than for the work he has done himself). But the Newark's carefully chosen exhibition shows him at his most varied and engaging.
 
Jersey City
 The Jersey City Museum also offers contemporary work. Of two shows on view this summer, Felice Nudelman's solo exhibition of photography has some memorable moments. The opening image, titled "Allegory," of a woman's distorted face in profile is mysterious and disturbing, but the numerous murky-looking desert vistas that follow fail to convey a similar charge. Only "Cathedral Lake," whose great glowing oval of light could be either a cloud in the sky or a body of water, shows how good a landscape photographer Ms. Nudelman can be.
The group show of sculpture also has its distinct ups and downs. The attraction of John Parris's visual puns (oxygen tanks made of Styrofoam, suspended in midair) pretty much begins and ends with their snappy colors, and Nancy Cohen's podlike sculptures, despite evidence of the artist's nice way with materials, never get beyond suggesting 3-D refugees from old Terry Winters paintings.
Less technically resolved but more gripping are Lorenzo Pace's homages to the writer James Baldwin. The strongest, titled "Go Tell It on the Mountain" after Baldwin's book, brings together a battered church pew, a fan from an Alabama funeral home, a pair of beat-up high heels and an African-style sculpture to suggest the personal conflicts and cultural layering found in Mr. Baldwin's fiction.
Conflict of a certain theatrical kind is the entire substance of China Marks's grotesque plaster figures. Her tormented, often demonic creatures bring Hans Bellmer to mind, but the Rococo eroticism evident here is little more than audacious fluff. Better is Stephen Schofield's unassuming abstract work, also Surrealist in flavor. His fat little floor sculptures, combining silk, chiffon and cement and looking like cushions stuffed to the point of bursting, keep the eye coming back and invite hands-on investigation. Like Mr. Pace, Mr. Schofield is a talent worth following, and the Jersey City Museum does well to bring him to our attention.

HEADLINE: At the Summit: New Leaders and Old, With New Agendas and Old

 BODY:

BRITAIN
Prime Minister John Major arrives in Naples in a curious position: Britain's economy is growing at a healthy clip, unemployment is falling and inflation remains subdued, yet his standing in the polls is the worst of any British leader since World War II. Furthermore, his Conservative Party is deeply split after 15 years in power. 
 His standing in Europe is not much better: France and Germany are furious with him for vetoing their choice of the Belgian Prime Minister, Jean-Luc Dehaene, as the next leader of the European Union.
Mr. Major does not have an ambitious agenda, but he will press his case that the best way to create jobs is to make it easier for companies to employ and dismiss workers, and to deregulate and privatize industry as fast as possible.
He will also press Washington to underline its commitment to free trade by ratifying the world trade agreement. And, as the leader of a nation with an export-oriented economy, he is likely to push for a coordinated effort to bring stability to the gyrating currency markets.
 
CANADA
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, preparing for his first economic summit meeting, is expected to push for freer trade and less volatility in the currency markets. With exports accounting for a third of its output, Canada has an unusually big stake in a stable global economy.
Mr. Chretien came to office nine months ago promising more jobs and faster economic growth. But recent turmoil in the currency markets has accelerated a fall in the Canadian dollar and brought higher interest rates, which threaten the country's fragile economic recovery.
Some of the currency's weakness stems from fears that Quebec will break away from the federation after provincial elections this year in which the separatist Parti Quebecois is likely to take power. Mr. Chretien, a Quebecer but also an ardent federalist, insists these fears are overblown.
But he is not likely to make a big splash in Naples. Not only is Canada one of the less substantial players, but Mr. Chretien has chosen a low-key approach to governing, and is far less visible than his Tory predecessors, Kim Campbell and Brian Mulroney.
 
FRANCE
President Francois Mitterrand, who will be attending his last summit talks, is the world's longest-serving democratic leader: he will retire next year after two seven-year terms. In March 1993 his Socialist Party was voted out of office and replaced by a conservative coalition that is favored to win the Presidency.
With France slowly pulling out of a painful recession, Mr. Mitterrand is expected to call for efforts to combat chronically high unemployment. And he is likely to warn of an "unfair" competitive edge enjoyed by low-wage exporting nations, mainly in Asia, where workers do not enjoy the same labor, social and welfare rights as in Western Europe.
As President, Mr. Mitterrand has the final word on French foreign policy, and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who is among the possible candidates to succeed him, has decided not to travel to Naples.
On key foreign and economic issues, the two men agree. Both, for example, favor a negotiated settlement in Bosnia and a takeover by United Nations forces of the French intervention in Rwanda. France also wants to bolster President Yeltsin and use international financing to help close down the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine.
 
GERMANY
A rebounding economy and his party's strong showing in recent European and German state elections will give Chancellor Helmut Kohl a stronger political and economic position in Naples than at any such talks in recent years.
Given his strong hand, Mr. Kohl is expected to push employment-related issues like greater labor-market flexibility, fewer obstacles to investment and better vocational training. Such moves would also support his accelerating campaign to win re-election in October.
Germany is also pressing for financial aid to Ukraine to shut the Chernobyl nuclear plant. Additional German aid for Russia is unlikely, however; Mr. Kohl argues that his nation has already provided more than its share.
Bonn will support endorsement of the European Union's peace plan for Bosnia, but will continue to oppose ending the weapons embargo on the Bosnian Government, saying this would just prolong the war.
The Chancellor's agenda could be derailed if the dollar continues to weaken. But senior German officials have played down expectations in the financial markets that steps to support the dollar will be agreed upon in Naples.
 
ITALY
Silvio Berlusconi, the new Prime Minister, has been on a roll since President Clinton visited in June. Playing host for the summit talks will crown his rise from businessman in January, to electoral victor in March, to statesman in July.
Italian officials depict the talks as an upbeat gathering with an optimistic tone of recovery for the world's economies. Italy is particularly keen to endorse the view that changes in labor legislation -- making it easier to hire and fire, for example -- can reverse the huge loss of jobs that has left 20 million Europeans, more than 10 percent of the labor force, out of work. The Government also says changes in labor and tax laws and job training offer a better solution to unemployment than economic recovery.
Politically, Italian officials welcome President Boris N. Yeltsin's presence both as a display of continued support for reform in Russia and as a token of added political weight in the deliberations, particularly on Bosnia.
 
JAPAN
Japan, never the most outspoken of nations, is likely to be particularly reticent at the summit. Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, who took office only last week, has no foreign policy experience and is virtually unknown to other world leaders.
Mr. Murayama is expected to try to reassure the others of Japan's continuity in foreign policy, despite his being the first Socialist Prime Minister in nearly half a century.
Actually, being a newcomer might help shield Mr. Murayama from the perennial complaints about Japan's towering trade surplus ($130 billion last year) and its low unemployment rate (2.8 percent). The combination has led to charges that Japan is shifting unemployment to other nations by keeping its markets closed.
The political turmoil in Japan over the past year has prevented the Government from fulfilling its promise to cut taxes and increase public-works spending to stimulate its economy. Mr. Murayama is expected to pledge that Japan will indeed take such steps.
Japan also hopes for cooperation to stabilize the value of the yen, whose recent rise threatens to derail the nation's nascent economic recovery. But other nations are likely to tell Japan that the strong yen is the result of its trade surpluses.
 
UNITED STATES
On his third visit to Europe since taking office, President Clinton hopes to use the summit meetings to further integrate Russia and eastern Europe into the global economy and promote economic growth in the developing world. The talks will include a meeting between Mr. Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin.
But the main purpose, Mr. Clinton said before leaving Washington, "is simple: to create jobs in a world of prosperity," and he arrives in Naples with the best economic performance of the participants. Employment and trade are growing more robustly in the United States than in the other six nations and the budget deficit is shrinking as a percentage of the total economy.
Mr. Clinton thus says the meeting marks the United States' return to global pre-eminence after "a decade of drift" in which budget deficits in Washington hamstrung attempts to coordinate economic policies. Still, he is expected to face criticism that his approach on trade has been too confrontational and that his policies are letting the dollar slide as a means to reduce the United States trade deficit.
At home, economic revival has largely failed to bolster Mr. Clinton's popularity. Polls show that only about half approve of his performance. White House officials say he could especially use an overseas triumph to offset a widely held view that the Administration's foreign policy is vacillating.
 
 
Russia: A Guest Who Must Be Heard
 President Yeltsin is expected to be like a distant and vaguely disreputable cousin, big, powerful, just a bit unstable, so everyone will be polite to him and continue to give him gifts of oratory and aid in the hope that his vows of friendship are sincere.
As usual, aid to Russia (and other states, like Ukraine) will be on the table, along with the thorny issues of Bosnia and North Korea. There will be no big new aid package for Russia (last year's pledge of $40 billion is still being disbursed), except for $10 billion in International Monetary Fund loans for which Moscow has not yet qualified, and $2 billion in other aid.
Mr. Yeltsin will continue to seek Western markets for Russian goods, while Westerners will continue to plead for more stability in Russia's business and economic environment.
In the year since the last meeting of the Group of 7, Mr. Yeltsin came within a few hours of being deposed in a coup. Afterwards, he forced through a Constitution based on a strong presidency, but he has been reluctant to use its powers. Instead, he has been making his deals with the old power structure: the bureaucrats, the regional governments, the state-company types symbolized by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin.
Economically, Mr. Chernomyrdin has embraced the fight against inflation, which is now below 10 percent a month. Still, that figure is too high for economic stability or big investments. And most economists say that the current budget is woefully optimistic on the revenue side, and that big bankruptcies are still to come.

HEADLINE: This Clean Air Looks Dirty

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency has effectively ordered refiners to add corn-based ethanol to make gasoline environmentally friendly. But the added ethanol will not clean the air beyond what the 1990 Clean Air Act would already require; nor will it, as advocates claim, raise farm income very much or significantly cut oil imports.
What the E.P.A.'s rule will do is take money from consumers and taxpayers and hand it over to Archer Daniels Midland, which produces about 60 percent of the nation's supply of ethanol. It is certainly no coincidence that A.D.M.'s chief executive, Dwayne Andreas, is a major political contributor; he donated $100,000 to a recent Democratic fund-raising dinner. 
 The Clean Air Act requires high-smog areas to phase in use of "reformulated" gasoline whose weight is at least 2 percent oxygen; the goal was to reduce pollution by replacing gasoline with oxygenates. The E.P.A. order would now add another requirement: 30 percent of the oxygenates would have to come from "renewable" resources -- which in reality means corn-based ethanol.
Because the oxygen content of reformulated gasoline remains unchanged, the order will not reduce smog-creating emissions. But by forcing refiners to use ethanol rather than less expensive oxygenates like methanol, the rule will drive up the cost of gasoline. Indeed, ethanol remains a high-cost additive even though it benefits from substantial tax breaks. And some experts argue that ethanol may be environmentally damaging because coal used in producing it contributes to carbon dioxide emissions, adding to global warming.
David Montgomery, an energy economist for Charles River Associates, estimates that only 30 percent of the cost of ethanol will wind up in the pockets of farmers while about 70 percent will go to processors like A.D.M. So the rule is a ridiculously expensive way to subsidize farmers. And the addition of ethanol will cut imports by only 9,000 barrels out of about eight million barrels a day.
Carol Browner, head of the E.P.A., asserts that the policy will spur development of renewable energy sources. But the impact looms small when stacked against the obvious defects. President Clinton is twisting high-minded environmental promises into low-minded favors for special interests.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Reversal -- Of Fortune?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS; A. M. Rosenthal is on vacation.

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
For a onetime observer of British politics to examine the scene today is an eye-rubbing experience. Many of the old truisms have been turned upside down.
The Labor Party used to be the home of Little Englanders opposed to British membership in the European Community and generally suspicious of foreigners. Today a powerful group of Conservatives are Euroskeptics and sound the trumpet of xenophobia. Labor is committed to Europe. 
 Labor was a Socialist party in the old sense: nationalization, fealty to trade unions, class conflict. Today Labor extols market economics.
"We are not a tax-and-spend party," Tony Blair, the heir-apparent to the Labor leadership, said in an interview. "Those days are over."
Mr. Blair, the heavy favorite in a leadership contest now going on, is a perfect symbol of the new-model Labor Party. He is young, 41, and looks younger. He went to private school and Oxford and speaks with the accent of the upper middle class. His wife, Cherie, is a lawyer, as he used to be.
He made his name as the shadow Home Secretary by moving Labor to a tough position on crime -- while also pledging to be tough on the social decay that breeds crime. When charged with straying from Labor's base in the working class, he said: "These are the very people who care about crime."
Education similarly: Mr. Blair has lately begun moving Labor to what could be called more small-c conservative positions on state schools. He emphasizes the need for discipline, high teaching standards and parent involvement. But he has also called for the state to provide nursery schools for all.
Those positions may sound familiar to Americans. In fact, they are reminiscent of what so-called New Democrats are trying to do by way of shedding the albatross political baggage of the 1960's. President Clinton, too, is for tough measures against crime and restraints on Government spending.
The two most important features of Conservative rule over the last 15 years, Mr. Blair said in the interview, have been that taxes have risen as a proportion of national income and so has Government spending -- and that from a supposedly low-tax party. "We are a high-tax economy," he said, "because we are a low-success economy."
You can hear Mr. Blair campaigning in the next election when he says such things. (It must be held by June 1997.) But exactly what would Labor's tax policy be? On that and similar specifics Mr. Blair is deliberately silent.
"I'm certainly not going to write our tax plans or spending plans now," he said. The lesson of the election two years ago is too plain. John Smith, the Labor leader whose sudden death in May led to the present contest, unveiled a detailed tax proposal in 1992. The Conservatives ran against it and narrowly won.
One of the most striking changes in Labor Party policy, as Mr. Blair represents it, is his belief in a bill of rights for Britain: rights enforceable by judges, as in the United States. He would make the European Convention on Human Rights part of British domestic law, which the Conservative Government has declined to do.
Labor traditionally opposed any bill of rights on the ground that it would give too much power to unelected judges. "That is a risk," Mr. Blair said, "but you have to balance the risk. One of the features of a civilized society is the protection of minorities against the abuse of power by majorities."
If Mr. Blair becomes leader, that fact alone will do much to kill the old and losing image of the Labor Party as a tired relic of the past. Instead it will be a party that calls for renewal but is only the tiniest bit left of center.
Most British politicians are now trying to crowd into the center. The only notable exceptions are the right-wing, anti-European conservatives.
"The parties may not have starkly different ideologies to offer," Joe Rogaly, a Financial Times columnist, wrote the other day, "but Mr. Blair's has the advantage of freshness, something new, different where it counts, and safe." Safe, certainly. The question is whether safety, youth and broad visions will be enough to keep Mr. Blair and his party ahead in the polls, as they are now, through an election.

HEADLINE: Clinton Offers Poland Hope, but Little Aid

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WARSAW, July 7

 BODY:
President Clinton offered a message of reassurance to this capital in the heart of Central Europe today, with words, gestures and a token gift of aid intended to display his hope that all of Europe might soon be knit with economic and security ties.
But Mr. Clinton's overture, made in private meetings and an eloquent address to the Polish Assembly, appeared to have gone only a small way toward soothing the uneasiness so prevalent among Poles, who fear that their effort to strengthen their links to the West could fall victim to Western fickleness. 
 In a country whose history has been tortured by betrayal from both West and East, Mr. Clinton insisted that he had no intention of leaving Poland and its neighbors isolated and alone. He said the United States felt a responsibility to include them in a wider Europe "democratic and free, integrated and united."
And in what he honed to a signal pledge to the once-captive nations of Central and Eastern Europe, he proclaimed: "We will not let the Iron Curtain be replaced with a veil of indifference."
 
Disappointment on Alliance
 But his promise of more than $200 million in new grants and loans was acknowledged by Administration officials to represent no more than a small gesture toward nudging Poland further along a path of economic reform. And Polish leaders across the political spectrum expressed disappointment that Mr. Clinton once again stopped short of saying exactly when the United States and its partners would open their arms to their country as a full member of the North Atlantic alliance.
"Our expectations were not completely fulfilled," Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski said. "I would have liked our dialogue on NATO to have gone much further than it did. Today, I feel we have come an inch or maybe half an inch closer toward entry."
Bronislaw Geremek, a member of the centrist Freedom Union and chairman of the parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, described Mr. Clinton's speech as "beautiful," but said it "did little to satisfy our security expectations."
"To us this represents a lack of momentum," Mr. Geremak said.
 
Expansion of Alliance
 Even Mr. Clinton, while proclaiming this as Poland's best opportunity in 350 years to win peace and security, reflected some of the apprehension heard from President Lech Walesa and others in warning that "history and geography caution us not to take this moment for granted."
The President pointed to the joint military exercises here two months away by NATO and Polish forces as a sign that the new Partnership for Peace, a group intended to increase NATO's military cooperation with Eastern European countries without extending the alliance's mutual-defense umbrella, is truly intended as a means toward expanding the alliance. He also promised more directly than ever before that he would not permit Russia to prevent Poland's becoming a member.
But while his speeches here were spattered with references depicting the peaceful reunification of Europe as a crusade, they were more an exhortation than a plan of action.
"We must find the will to unite around these opportunities of peace as previous generations have united against war's life-or-death threats and oppression's fatal grip," the President said. "To the courage that enables men and women to drop behind enemy lines, face down rumbling tanks or advance freedom's cause underground, we must add a new civil courage -- the energy and optimism and patience to move forward through peaceful but hard and rapidly changing times."
 
Praise for Poland
 In a dinner toast on Wednesday night, President Walesa had said pointedly that he feared that the world had "stopped halfway" in carrying out the transformation of the bloc once bound by Communism and the Warsaw Pact. He complained that the West "does not seem to have an unequivocal vision of what our common present and future should be."
In seeking to offer that vision today, Mr. Clinton praised Poland as having served as a model for its neighbors with its rapid adoption of democratic and market reforms. He also spoke in common cause with Mr. Walesa and others who have sounded alarm at the rise in Russia of Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky and other extremists, saying that "we dare not underestimate the danger we pose."
The President also paid tribute to the heroism of Poles in World War II, laying wreaths at a memorial to those lost in battle and to the dead in the Warsaw ghetto resistance of 1943 and the Warsaw uprising the following year.
Some of Mr. Clinton's Polish hosts sought to focus on history's lessons on the need for faithful protectors. In urging the President to move swiftly to make tangible his promises to Poland, Mr. Walesa observed that the "Polish people know very well from their past and present experience what paper guarantees are worth." And after Mr. Clinton's address today, the head of the Democratic Left Alliance, the largest party in the country's governing coalition, said he was "very disappointed that there was no timetable set" to spell out how soon Poland might enter NATO.
Aides to Mr. Clinton had billed his speech today as the major address of his weeklong European tour, and it cut a vast swath in spelling out the President's commitment to forging what he described as "a continent where democracy and free markets know no bounds, but where nations can rest easy knowing that their borders will always be secure."
But his warning against a "veil of indifference" simply picked up a theme he adopted last January in Brussels, while his declaration that no nation should have the right to veto Poland's entry into NATO or any other Western institution made only slightly more specific his past insistence that his caution about opening their doors was not based on Russian objections.
The $210 million package that Mr. Clinton promised to Poland today included a combination of direct assistance from the United States and other aid from the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
The largest portion of American dollars is to be allotted to a $65 million capital investment fund to be set up by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation that would provide insurance for American companies that invest in Poland.

HEADLINE: KIM IL SUNG DEAD AT AGE 82; LED NORTH KOREA 5 DECADES; WAS NEAR TALKS WITH SOUTH

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Saturday, July 9

 BODY:
Kim Il Sung, the North Korean leader since 1945 and the man who led the invasion of the South and beganthe Korean War, died at 2 a.m. on Friday at the age of 82, Pyongyang Radio said today.
At shortly after noon, the Korean Central News Agency, the country's official news organization, issued a seven-page announcement of Mr. Kim's death, which said that he would be remembered as a man capable of "creating something from nothing." 
 "He turned our country, where age-old backwardness and poverty had prevailed, into a powerful Socialist country, independent, self-supporting and self-reliant," the statement said. It called him the "sun of the nation."
Mr. Kim, who is revered throughout the country as the "Great Leader," is reported to have collapsed with a heart attack sometime on Thursday. It said his son and heir apparent, Kim Jong Il, would direct the funeral of his father.
Mr. Kim's death just hours before the negotiations with the United States began, seems certain to raise questions over whether he actually died of natural causes.
Mr. Kim was also scheduled to conduct a first summit meeting with South Korea's President, Kim Young Sam, in Pyongyang, the North's capital, on July 25. It would have been the first such summit since the division of the Korean Peninsula.
For months there have been reports of factional infighting within the Government over whether to open up the country in return for financial aid, or to continue defying the international community and press ahead with the nuclear program.
An odd announcement about Mr. Kim's recent medical treatment, issued in mid-afternoon, included some mysterious wording that will likely fuel the speculation. It said that "on July 7 he suffered from a serious myocardial infarction) owing to heavy mental strains, which was followed by a heart shock." It said he had been disagnoed as suffering from arteriosclerosis, and that a "diagnosis of the disease was fully confimred in the pathological anatomic examination" conducted today.
A "State Funeral Committee" in Pyongyang issued another announcement, saying that the leader's coffin was lying in state at the Kumsusan Assembly Hall in central Pyongyang beginning and that a period of mourning would last until July 17 when the funeral is scheduled. "Foreign mourning delegations will not be received," the announcement said.
It added that artillery salutes would be fired in the capital and every province. "All songs and dances, games and amusement will be banned," during the mourning period.
Mr. Kim was last seen, apparently healthy, during a remarkable two-day meeting with President Jimmy Carter at which he agreed to freeze North Korea's nuclear program in return for restarting high-level talks with the United States over an end to the country's five-decade-long isolation.
Mr. Carter said on Wednesday that Mr. Kim told him at the time that he planned to "remain active for the next 10 years."
The renewed talks with the North, after a year of brinkmanship that seemed for a while to be veering toward a new confrontation between North Korea and the West, began in Geneva on Friday. The meeting was reported by both sides to have gone well, and negotiators gave no indication of Mr. Kim's death, if they knew. The meetings were supended today, and the chief United States delegate, Robert Gallucci, as saying "further talks are meaningless."
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who was told of the reports at 5 A.M. here, telephoned his South Korean counterpart, Han Sung Chu, and was told that the Government of South Korea regarded the reports as very credible, said Michael McCurry, a State Department spokesman.
Japanese Government officials said today that they could not confirm the announcement, which was delayed by Pyongyang for 34 hours.
For years South Korea and the United States have had extensive contingency plans for Mr. Kim's death, including higher states of military alert. The South Korean Defense Ministry said the army was on special alert today and that the same was true of the North Korean army. But the Defense Ministry said there were no special troop movements on the North Korean side. The north's military movements are tracked almost minute by minute.
The President of South Korea called an emergency cabinet meeting, the Korean Broadcasting Service in Seoul reported.
For half a century, North Korea has been essentially a family business headed by Mr. Kim, whose image is captured in monuments in every town and who is credited, in the national mythology and in song, with the country's creation and development. His cult of personality is everywhere, celebrated in "mass games" run on his birthday that involve hundreds of thousands, and in the everyday invocation of his philosophy of "juche" or national self-reliance.
Years ago, in an attempt to create something of a Stalinist dynasty, Mr. Kim designated his son, known as the Dear Leader, as his successor. But there have been persistent doubts over whether the younger Mr. Kim, a reclusive and deeply mysterious man who, according to Western intelligence reports may not be mentally stable, would win the confidence of the North Korean military.
Many have speculated that the death of the elder Mr. Kim would touch off a power struggle and perhaps a crumbling of the country's Communist Government.
But such a process could take years. There there is little understanding of the country's leadership elite beyond the elder Mr. Kim, who has been widely regarded as the only man able to make national decisions for the country.
With the nation's economy shrinking several percent a year and its factories grinding to a halt, Mr. Kim's "Paradise on Earth," as his propaganda machine calls it, seems headed toward collapse. Its nuclear program, which may or may not have already succeeded in producing one or two weapons, has in the past two years become the biggest security crisis in Asia.
Mr. Kim was installed by Stalin shortly after the end of World War II. Born on the outskirts of Pyongyang, in a thatch house that is visited daily by thousands of North Koreans, he spent nearly 20 years of his youth in Manchuria, the North Korean border areas and the Soviet Union as a guerrilla fighter against the Japanese.
Shortly after the official creation of the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea in 1948 he consolidated his power. He launched the Korean war in 1950, in a blitzkrieg attack that took Washington and Seoul by total surprise. His goal, he said, was to reunite the Korean Peninsula, and it took three years to fight to an armistice. Ever since the Demilitarized Zone, dividing North and South, has been the most heavily-armed outpost of the Cold War, and 36,000 American troops are still stationed near it.
 
The Weaker Korea
 For years it appeared that his country would be the stronger of the two Koreas: It had all the raw materials and, until the early 1960's, a healthier economy.
But that reversed as the capitalist South, with aid from the United States and Japan, and a population of 40 million surged ahead as a producer of steel, cars and semiconductors. The North, diplomatically isolated, went into slow decline, increasingly dependent on China and the Soviet Union for oil and critical industrial goods. Its own industrial base was left over from the Japanese occupation, save for some major project that Mr. Kim was credited with directing with "on the spot guidance."
With the end of the cold war, however, Mr. Kim was quickly abandoned by his allies. Russia embraced the South, eager for its aid and its technological help. China also began relations with Seoul, and Mr. Kim, on his periodic trips to Beijing, was greeted with airport signs for Samsung, the huge South Korean conglomerate. Recently South Korea's leaders began visiting Moscow and Beijing regularly.
To save his regime, Mr. Kim turned to the nuclear option. He developed a small reactor at Yongbyon, a heavily-guarded military installation north of the capital, into a sprawling nuclear complex. While he signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1985, he refused to allow inspectors into his country until two years ago. And since that time, he has conducted an increasingly tense cat-and mouse game with the United Nations and specifically the United States, keeping inspectors at bay. In March, his nuclear scientists began unloading spent fuel from a reactor at Yongbyon. The fuel, if processed, could yield enough plutonium for five or so bombs. That prompted a move for sanctions against the North in the United Nations, and those sanctions seemed likely until Mr. Carter's trip last month, which raised hopes about relaxing tensions on the Korean peninsula.
Mr. Carter was heavily criticized in the United States as he left Pyongyang for appearing to accept Mr. Kim's assurances at face value. The former President said that during his trip a "miracle" had occurred, and that Mr. Kim -- who had never before met such a high-ranking American -- was simply looking for respect.
Mr. Carter declared that, by derailing the sanctions, he and the North Korean leader had avoided a war. Sanctions, Mr. Carter declared, were a terrible idea, one that would brand Mr. Kim "a criminal and a liar," and probably prompt his 22 million indoctrinated followers to renew hostilities simply to protect the image of their President.
After all, Carter said a bit enviously later in Tokyo, "you have to remember that at home, President Kim Il Sung is treated as a combination of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Abe Lincoln."
In fact, in recent years there were two Kim Il Sungs who seemed to occupy the world stage: The one who ran the Korean gulags, who had enemies purged or executed, who presumably masterminded the attempt to assassinate the South Korean Cabinet while on a trip to Burma in the early 1980's -- and the kindly old man who met Mr. Carter.
Former Representative Stephen J. Solarz of Brooklyn, who met Mr. Kim twice, once in 1980 and then again in 1991, said of him: "He has this avuncular persona that stands in stark contrast to the reality of the regime, which is without question the most ruthless and tyrannical anywhere in the world. It is like meeting Hitler at Berchtesgaden and commenting on how he got along with the dogs and the children. He has the blood of millions on his hands; he has a society based on Orwell's '1984.' So you expect someone who will act like Saddam Hussein, a forbidding, threatening presence. And he is just the opposite, always smiling, always speaking softly."
But in North Korea Mr. Kim seemed, at least in every public utterance, to be nothing short of a god. Every gift a North Korean received from the government -- clothes, rice, a new apartment -- was said to come directly from "the Great Leader" or "the Dear Leader."
He held every important post in the country, including General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, its one party, and president of the country. His son was given increasing control over the military, but has rarely been seen in public in recent times.
There is so much state-sponsored mythology about Kim Il Sung's youth that it is nearly impossible to separate truth and fiction. But in all of the stories about his early days, including those he has written himself, there is always a clear subtext: Mr. Kim's struggles against greater powers around him, particularly the Americans and the Japanese.
They control the world, and it is the Kim family's destiny to battle them. In his memoirs, published in Pyongyang two years ago, Mr. Kim maintained that his great-grandfather set fire to the General Sherman, a "U.S. imperialist aggressors' ship" because its crew went about "stealing the people's possession and raping the women" while sailing up the Taedong River to Pyongyang in 1866. (Mr. Kim's biographer at the University of Hawaii, Suh Dae Sook, calls these stories "politically motivated fabrications," but most of them seem impossible to verify.)
Whether the stories are true or not, the myths have become the man. In the outskirts of Pyongyang, thousands of the faithful line up every day to glimpse the small mud hut where he is said to have lived with his parents, both of whom, he says, fought the Japanese occupation of Korea.
But the hut serves as more than just proof of his of-the-people roots; Mr. Kim often contrasted his own early life with that of the Americans (mostly missionaries) and the Japanese in Pyongyang. "In the 'Westerners village' at the time inhabited by Americans and the Japanese settlers, brick houses, shops and churches increased in number," he recalled vividly many decades later, but across town "the slum quarters were getting bigger."
It was around this time that he committed his first act of rebellion against Japan's brutal occupation, using a pocket knife to scratch out the title "Mother Tongue Reader" from the textbook issued by the Japanese colonial government that required all children to speak nothing but Japanese. He scratched in "Japanese Reader" on the cover, and from that moment, "whenever I saw children trying to learn Japanese, I told them Koreans must speak Korean."
Neither his own memoirs or official biographies dwell on the fact that he spent the vast majority of his youth in Manchuria, where he learned Chinese. That later turned out to be a crucial skill, as he joined up with China's communist guerrillas. And it is from China that Kim combined Communist philosophy with the nationalist mission that his father bequeathed him -- along with two pistols -- on his deathbed: To free the Korean Peninsula from Japanese domination.
Mr. Kim served as an anti-Japanese guerrilla in Manchuria, Siberia and the North Korean border areas starting in his early 20's, but it is impossible to verify the claims of his astounding feats, including the killing of a unit of Japanese special police who were tracking him in 1940. The next year, he was forced to retreat to the Soviet Union of for the remainder of the war. He makes no mention of that time, perhaps because it would be too obvious that his son, the "Dear Leader" Kim Jong Il, was born there in February 1942, instead of on Korea's own soil.
At the time, Mr. Kim was married to Kim Chong Suk, who died in 1949. His current wife was scarcely seen until Jimmy Carter's visit last month, where she played a surprisingly important role.
Mr. Carter had proposed that, as a gesture of good will, Mr. Kim allow the United States to bring home the bodies of soldiers buried in the North's territory, and search for other remains. Kim wavered, saying he would have to check with his advisers and take the issue up through diplomatic channels. "His wife spoke up and said, 'We should do it now,' " Carter recalled a few weeks ago. "And he said O.K. And it was done."
In North Korea's official histories, Kim took control of the country as soon as he singlehandedly kicked out the Japanese.
Of course, Kim's emergence was a far more complicated affair than the official accounts suggest. When he arrived back in Korea in 1945, he had been absent from the country for 20 years. His Communist party was tiny, outnumbered by other nationalist groups. But he rose to power by denouncing the "lackeys" of the Japanese and the Americans in his midst, and wiped out many of his enemies.
Most importantly, he won the confidence of the Soviets, who entered the Pacific war in the last days and took administrative control of the North. They reached for Kim, who quickly moved to consolidate power in the Korean Worker's Party. But the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was not created officially until September 1948, after the United States organized the first government in the South, the Republic of Korea.
When Kim Il Sung led an invading army into the South in June, 1950 -- an unbelievable scene of carnage that today seems like another world from modern Seoul -- the Truman Administration saw the takeover as the first step in a far broader Communist plot, directed from Moscow and Beijing, to seize much of Asia.
But a remarkable new study published earlier this year by Stanford University Press -- one that is fairly chilling given the current nuclear standoff -- shows it was Kim Il Sung who did all the plotting. Documents recently made available in Russia, along with others that have slipped out of China, show that Kim was convinced he could take the South in three days.
Stalin, who had put Kim in office five years before, was skeptical during a meeting in April 1950, but said that he might go along if the Chinese did. Mao was worried as well, fearful that the United States might step in. But Kim, showing a talent that he still clearly still possesses, played the two men off against each other brilliantly, inflating Stalin's interest when talking to Mao, and Mao's when talking to Stalin. It was the first of many incidents in which he manipulated his far bigger partners not only against the West, but against each other.
After a brilliant beginning, Kim's war plans went astray. The American intervention was a surprise. The war made a desperate economic situation in the North worse. But Kim emerged in position to wipe out his remaining rivals. And he never forgot the threats issued by Gen. Douglas MacArthur, and indirectly backed up by Harry Truman, that the Americans might end the war with a mushroom cloud. That, to many minds, was the start of the North's nuclear program.
But there were dozens of small clashes over the years along the DMZ, sometimes resulting in the deaths of South Koreans and Americans. Both sides built up enormous forces: Mr. Kim's army was 1.1 million strong, though in recent years it has spent much of its time building apartments and dams rather than training.
In 1968, as the Vietnam War raged, North Korea and Mr. Kim surged into the headlines again. The North seized an American intelligence ship, the Pueblo, and its crew stayed in prison for 11 years. In 1972 there were the first gestures of peace to the South, called the Red Cross Talks, in which both sides talked of allowing families divided by the war to meet. But those talks broke off and were not resumed for 18 years.
When they did come back together the two Koreas reached an historic accord: A December, 1991 agreement on peace and denuclearization. It was not a peace treaty. But it did provide for communications between the two Koreas: Roads, radio broadcasts, exchange of mail, mutual inspection of each other's military sites. None of that has happened, and relations worsened as the nuclear crisis deepened.
Starting last year, suddenly North Korea was back on Washington's agenda. The C.I.A. predicted the country could be a year to 18 months from building a bomb. Its ambitions -- to build a weapon that could threaten Seoul and Tokyo, and to assemble an arsenal of missiles to go with it -- has been the focus of America's security problems in Asia for two years now, as officials have tried to determine if the weapons project was a bargaining chip for economic aid or an effort to remain independent.
Mr. Kim devoted a huge amount of the country's scarce resources to building a nuclear complex centered on a 25 megawatt reactor based on old technology used by the British in the 1950's. The design uses ordinary uranium as fuel and graphite to control the nuclear reaction: The North has its own, ample supplies of both, meaning it does not have to worry about being cut off by foreign powers.
Conveniently, such old designs create waste that is high in plutonium content. The plutonium can be extracted and converted into bomb fuel with the right reprocessing technology. And the cat-and-mouse game over the past few years has been all about the North's steady progress in building that technology, while denying it all the way. For years the North denied it was building a reprocessing plant, even though a football-field sized one sticks out on satellite photographs. The Great Leader and the Dear Leader don't need a satellite: They have a guest cottage was built amid the complex. In the Spring, inspectors who got back into the non-existent reprocessing plant reported that a second manufacturing line was under construction -- to allow greater throughput.
In Washington, successive administrations sleepwalked through the evidence of the buildup. There was always another nuclear renegade to worry about: Qaddafi, Saddam, the Pakistanis. And time and time again, Washington convinced itself that this crisis was abating. When Mr. Kim signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty, leading everyone to sigh in relief, even if he then violated the treaty by barring inspectors for seven years. In 1991, the North and South signed an accord denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and banning reprocessing on either side. Again there were cheers, and again the North ignored the ban, and kept building.
Every time there was talk of finally taking action, the Asian allies fretted that Kim should not be provoked. But the warning lights became impossible to miss in March, 1993, when the North announced it would pull out of the Nonproliferation Treaty rather than face continued pressure.

Cangelosi Leaves the Mets With Questions and Anger

BYLINE: By JENNIFER FREY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 8

 BODY:
John Cangelosi knew for three days that this moment was coming, but when he left the Mets' hotel early this afternoon, he was still searching for a rational explanation. Despite conversations with management and a careful scrutiny of the team roster, Cangelosi still could not understand why the Mets were letting him go.
In a move that seemed difficult to justify, particularly to Cangelosi, the Mets assigned their reserve outfielder to their Class AAA franchise in Norfolk, Va., and activated starting outfielder Kevin McReynolds immediately after Cangelosi cleared waivers at 2 P.M. The Mets made the move well aware that Cangelosi would exercise his right to refuse the assignment and they would be forced to release him. 
 "With my limited role, I thought I did everything in my power to keep this job and I can't figure out their decision," Cangelosi said, shortly before catching a flight back to New York. "I can't figure out their decision."
 
Utility Role
 At 31, Cangelosi is neither an integral fixture in the Mets' system or a young player expected to blossom. But he is a better-than-average utility outfielder who has done what the Mets have asked this season, particularly in situations when the outfield has been stretched thin.
Cangelosi hit .252, stole a team-high five bases and played flawless defense; save for McReynolds, Cangelosi is the only member of the Mets to play more than a smattering of innings without incurring an error. He appeared in more games (62) and made more plate appearances (111) than any other reserve on the team.
In the end, though, this decision comes down to economics: the Mets will eat the remainder of Cangelosi's contract that pays just $175,000. By contrast, they are keeping one infielder who rarely plays (Luis Rivera) because he's making $450,000 and a relief pitcher who has been a disaster (Mike Maddux) because he's making more than $1 million this season.
Although Green did acknowledge that money was the reason Maddux continues to hold a spot on the roster, he argued today that Cangelosi could not provide the things the Mets need at this point -- namely power and runs batted in (Cangelosi had four).
"Offensively, we've sputtered so much that I've got to find ways to get the offense going and in my estimation, Cangelosi is not one that can do that for me," Green said.
 
Infield Reserves
 The Mets have chosen to keep three reserve infielders -- Rivera, Fernando Vina and Tim Bogar -- who also have shown little pop. But Green argued he needed late-inning defensive replacements in the infield and not the outfield. Cangelosi is not buying that argument, calling the demotion "personal."
With the move, the Mets are reduced to carrying four true outfielders -- Ryan Thompson, Joe Orsulak, Jim Lindeman and McReynolds, who has not shown he is able to remain healthy for any stretch of time. They've even made first baseman David Segui a sometime outfielder, much to his displeasure.
"It doesn't make sense," Cangelosi said. "It just doesn't make sense."

HEADLINE: Political Power of Police Union Could Slow Fight Against Graft

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
State Senate bill 8014A gained final legislative approval on the evening of July 1, one of the last days of business in Albany. The bill, to create an independent disciplinary hearing process for New York City employees, would strip the city's Police Commissioner of the power to dismiss officers for misconduct on the job.
The legislation had a handful of sponsors. And it had one major lobbyist: the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the main police union. 
 "The legislation would seriously reduce my ability to keep police in line," said William J. Bratton, the Police Commissioner. "It is perverse, done in the middle of the night. For the Legislature and the union, it is payback time."
The bill has not been signed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who vetoed a version of it a year ago and is considered likely to veto it again. But coming amid the emotional and political furor over police corruption, the fact that the P.B.A. would promote -- and the Legislature approve -- a bill that the Commissioner argues would compromise the ability of the Police Department to clean itself up illustrates both the influence of the police union and why its power has become a target of criticism, most recently in the Mollen Commission's report on police corruption.
The union, armed with millions of dollars in annual dues collections as well as multimillion-dollar contributions from the city, is an extremely powerful force. It is an active lobbyist in Albany, capable of initiating or killing legislation. It endorses candidates and contributes to their campaigns. The P.B.A. also wields wide influence within the Police Department, whose senior members are either respectful of or intimidated by the union's political clout, current and former top officials of the department say.
In short, the P.B.A.'s allegiance is to its membership, and its leaders do not apologize for the union's influence. In that, it is hardly alone, for the teachers union and others in the city exert similar political heft. But there is no shortage of critics who say the P.B.A.'s consuming loyalty to its membership is often at odds with efforts at changing the department. The Mollen Commission, after all, concluded that the union had often acted as "a shelter for the corrupt cop." And P.B.A. officials, for their part, refused to meet with or testify before the commission, which was appointed by former Mayor David N. Dinkins.
The Police Commissioner said the P.B.A. would not be an impediment to his efforts to eliminate corruption.
"I can rid this department of corruption with the union or without them," Mr. Bratton said.
Clearly, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has much invested in Mr. Bratton's ability to deliver on that promise. The Mayor badly wants effective law enforcement and a clean police force to be cornerstones of his administration. And while Mr. Giuliani himself profited from the P.B.A.'s support during his run for office, he has already clashed with the union over contract negotiations.
Now, the P.B.A.'s legislative campaign to deprive the Police Commissioner of final authority in disciplining officers raises questions about both the union's role in the corruption problem and its willingness to support efforts to find a solution.
 
'A Tough Project'
 "You won't meaningfully change anything about corruption unless you recognize the P.B.A. and the size of its strength and influence," said Raymond W. Kelly, Mr. Bratton's predecessor. "It's a tough project. I wouldn't write it off as a hopeless task. It depends on how it is approached."
There are critics of the P.B.A., though, who regard even Mr. Kelly's guarded optimism as overstated. United States Representative Major Owens, whose Congressional district in Brooklyn has endured major corruption scandals in three of its police precincts over the last decade, said he is considering subpoenaing leaders of the P.B.A. to testify before his subcommittee's hearings on discrimination in law enforcement.
"The P.B.A. is a monster that makes real reform impossible," Mr. Owens said. "It spends money in all sorts of ways that it is not accountable for. Its leadership doesn't even make an effort to be representative of the entire force. It has people in Albany."
The P.B.A. paints quite a different picture of itself. Its leaders depict the union as the loyal protector of honest police officers. They believe the union's political and economic strength is the rightful result of a long, principled fight for respect and years of hard bargaining.
"We do not condone corruption, and we do not protect bad cops," said Phil Caruso, the president of the P.B.A. "I've been through seven police commissioners, and not one of them could say with a straight face that we haven't been against corruption and acted to uncover it."
 
Repeated Lawsuits
 A new dialogue between the union and the department -- communication has never been great and has often been disfigured by angry oratory and repeated lawsuits -- has already begun.
Mr. Caruso has signaled a willingness to embrace proposals for change, like an increased minimum age for officers and changes in drug testing procedures. He has also been a participant in Mr. Bratton's "departmental re-engineering" project, which is looking into changes in integrity testing and command structure. Union delegates have also participated in the department's corruption focus groups.
"The lack of trust both ways has accrued over many years, and so there is a lot to overcome," said Walter Mack, the Deputy Commissioner for Internal Affairs, the departmental unit that investigates police corruption. "But I see progress."
Investigators say, however, that the union has often been a barrier to anti-corruption efforts.
"We spoke with hundreds and hundreds of officers, and time and time again we were told by the officers that they understood the attitude of their union to be not to cooperate with corruption investigations," said Leslie Cornfeld, deputy chief counsel with the Mollen Commission.
"Many told us this out of frustration," Ms. Cornfeld said. "I think many, many cops don't agree with the tactics and values of the union."
The P.B.A., formed in 1894 to aid widows and orphans of slain police officers, has more than 20,000 members. Its executive board is exclusively white and male, with black, Hispanic and women members making up a tiny fraction of its 360 elected delegates.
"It's a secret society at the top," said Bob Kliesmet, president of the International Union of Police Associations.
The union's 1993 annual report lists annual dues revenue of nearly $8 million, and notes that it paid out more than $6 million in administrative expenses and professional fees to lawyers and accountants. The union, which receives nearly $20 million annually from the city for its health and welfare funds, also oversees other multimillion-dollar annuity and pension funds. Because it is a union of municipal employees, it is not subject to the regulations of the National Labor Relations Act that govern private-sector unions.
 
No Stranger to Scandal
 "The income is mind-boggling," said Patrick V. Murphy, the former Police Commissioner who led the department's reform efforts in the wake of the Knapp Commission corruption hearings two decades ago. "The power is enormous."
In addition, the P.B.A. has been no stranger to scandal. Richard Hartman, the chief attorney for the union, left in 1988 after his use of union funds came under scrutiny. And in 1992, the P.B.A. came in for sharp criticism after their rally outside City Hall to protest Mayor Dinkins's plans for the Civilian Complaint Review Board degenerated into a near riot by officers, many of them inebriated.
Mr. Caruso fiercely defends the union.
"We are an above-board operation," he said, "and no one is more acutely in touch with the streets and the street cop than the P.B.A."
 
Work Slowdown
 When it comes to corruption, there has been no shortage of confrontations between the union and the department or outside investigators. In 1985, the P.B.A. sued to prevent the department from using unsubstantiated civilian complaints of corruption and brutality in evaluating job performance. In 1987, the P.B.A. staged a work slowdown to protest a department plan to rotate officers among precincts in the aftermath of a corruption scandal in the 77th Precinct, ultimately forcing the department to modify its demands.
And according to current and former prosecutors, the P.B.A., concerned about the impact on police officers under criminal investigation, has consistently and effectively fought legislation to alter grand jury immunity regulations. The city's district attorneys have argued that the proposed changes would be an overall bonus for law enforcement.
"The union leadership's perception of its role is to serve the interest of their constituency, sometimes to the exclusion of truth, justice or the welfare of the community," said Aaron H. Rosenthal, a former Assistant Chief of the department who is now an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
"And because of the power of the P.B.A., there have been and no doubt will continue to be very high-ranking members of the department who find it career-threatening to take a stance in opposition to the union on issues that might be to the benefit of the department and the public."
Mr. Bratton is not persuaded.
"Unions exist to represent their members, not the public," he said. "Unions will have their opinions. But I've dealt with unions before. I'll deal with this one."

HEADLINE: A SURGE IN HIRING ADDS TO CONCERNS ON U.S. INFLATION

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
A Labor Department report showing a sharp and unexpected surge in the number of jobs created in June gave financial markets jitters about inflation today. Traders' concerns were only magnified as the Clinton Administration tried later to allay their fears about the economy and the dollar.
While the unemployment rate held steady at 6 percent, the increase in business payrolls of 379,000 jobs was considerably stronger than analysts had anticipated. Coming on top of sizable upward revisions in the number of jobs created in April and May, the report seemed likely to push the Federal Reserve closer to another increase in short-term interest rates to prevent a surge in inflation -- a move it opted not to take at a policy-setting meeting this week. 
 Since inflation would lower the value of long-term bonds, the news caused prices of fixed-income securities to slump, driving rates up. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond jumped to 7.69, the highest level since Nov. 9, 1992, shortly after the last Presidential election. [Page 35.]
Stocks initially declined but recovered and finished higher.
Within hours after the report was released, the dollar plummeted against other currencies after President Clinton, meeting in Naples with the leaders of other industrial countries, seemed to rule out support for it from either the Administration or the largely independent Federal Reserve. [Page 4.]
 When asked why the dollar was performing so poorly while he was describing the economy as on its "soundest footing in decades," Mr. Clinton suggested that there was little governments could do in the short term to bolster the currency. He said he expected the dollar would rebound on its own when the fundamentals of the American economy were fully recognized.
"It is important not to overreact," Mr. Clinton said, adding, "It would be a mistake for us to change the fundamental objectives that we all ought to have, which is to pursue global growth."
Later, when asked about the job figures, Mr. Clinton said that these did not imply resurgent inflation and suggested another interest rate increase was unnecessary. "We don't want to adopt a short-run strategy that could choke off growth in the other G-7 countries and in other parts of the world," he said.
After his remarks sent the dollar below 98 yen, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was dispatched to reassure the markets that the United States did not welcome a weak dollar and had not ruled out action to support it.
By itself, the jobs report signaled continued strength in the economy and was hailed by officials here as evidence that expansion remained brisk. Although the job gains were concentrated in retail trade and other services, factory jobs grew by 34,000 to bring the total since October to about 100,000.
"It's a lot harder today to find people than it was a year ago," Frank N. Liguori, chief executive of the Olsten Corporation, a leading supplier of temporary business and health-care workers. He said his company had posted 20 percent year-over-year increases in billable hours since the first of the year, a trend implying continued robust growth for the economy at large.
Robust as the June job gains were, however, some special factors swelled the payroll total. Combined with contrary results in the less reliable survey of households, these factors appeared to blunt market fears that the economy might be on the verge of overheating. Most economists have been expecting the Fed to raise interest rates to curb excessive growth, and today's report, while perhaps hastening that day, was not so strong as to make a rate increase a certainty.
"The evidence, if you read it, is encouraging on the inflation front," Mr. Clinton said. "I don't think we should do anything to undermine the recovery when we have still Americans who need jobs, we have still Americans who are working part time who wish to work full time. We have parts of America that have not felt the recovery, and we have no evidence of inflation."
Indeed, wage pressures seem well in check. Average hourly earnings actually edged lower by a tenth of 1 percent last month and are up just 2.5 percent from the level of June 1993, the department's report also showed.
"Wage inflation remains very low in the face of these striking gains in employment," Norman Robertson, an economic consultant in Pittsburgh, said. He attributed this in part to exceptional growth in low-paying jobs, many of them in the service sector, and to intense competition among workers in most regions.
The Clinton Administration hailed today's report, with Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich calling it "excellent news for American workers." He noted that payrolls expanded by a million jobs in the second quarter -- 50 percent more than in each of the two preceding quarters -- and that the rise in factory jobs last month was the biggest such gain in four years.
One special factor helping to overstate the gains was that five weeks, rather than the more usual four weeks, elapsed between the department's May and June job surveys, allowing an estimated 100,000 extra payroll jobs to be counted.
When this phenomenon of a late survey week occurs while schools are letting out for the summer, officials said, the effects can be magnified. This year was particularly hard to fathom because many schools remained open longer than usual to make up for closings during an exceptionally severe winter. The effect would be mainly on students and their summer jobs, since teachers are generally under contract and considered employed year-round.
 
 
 
The World Cup Effect
 Private economists also said they thought the World Cup soccer tournament had generated additional jobs, noting that restaurants and bars alone added 69,000 jobs last month, nearly 20 percent of the total payroll gain.
Construction added 16,000 jobs last month, about half of the monthly average so far this year, as interest rates appear to have cut into home building, economists said. Temporary help, an area that has long been booming but that had only a tiny gain of 2,000 jobs in May, rebounded with a jump of 46,000 jobs in June.
The report also showed the average workweek easing a bit -- by 12 minutes, to 34.6 hours -- from near-record levels, a sign that employers had pushed their existing work forces to the maximum.
"They got to the point they decided they needed to hire more people," said Patrick Flaherty, assistant economist at the Shawmut National Corporation in Boston.
 But in sharp contrast to the results of the department's mail survey of more than 390,000 employers, which analysts consider by far the better gauge of economic performance, was its newly overhauled survey of 60,000 households.
This showed employment dropping by 442,000 in June, a development accompanied by a drop of 526,000 people in the labor force. That allowed the unemployment rate to hold at the 6 percent level to which it had fallen in May, by four-tenths of a point.
 
 
 
'Unusual' Divergence
 "Although the month-to-month movements of employment as measured by the two surveys commonly differ in size and occasionally in direction, large movements in opposite directions such as those that took place this month are unusual," a somewhat baffled Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress today.
Officials suggested that a partial explanation might be found in new methods used for the survey this year that relies on old factors for seasonal adjustment, the process of allowing for recurring variations related mainly to the calendar.
But for some reason, the labor force is smaller now than it was at the beginning of the year, a development in sharp contrast with what usually happens in a business expansion, when job growth inspires more and more of those who have retreated to the sidelines to go look for work, swelling the labor force.
A total of 532,000 people were listed as discouraged about job prospects last month, up from 436,000 in May, figures not adjusted for seasonality. Those with two or more jobs fell to 7,110,000 from 7,316,000 on the same basis, the report showed.
 Geographically, there was relatively little movement last month, with unemployment rates edging up a tenth of a point in the Northeast and West, to 6.4 percent and 7.4 percent respectively, and easing two-tenths of a point, to 4.5 percent, in the Midwest. The South's jobless rate was unchanged at 5.9 percent.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN NAPLES: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton Speaks, and It's a Tricky Day for the Dollar

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NAPLES, July 8

 BODY:
President Clinton set out today to convince the leaders of the other big industrial nations that the United States economy is back in the groove, growing steadily, and that they had best heed his advice.
But in the process, the luckless President stumbled in an embarrassingly public way. 
 Mr. Clinton said he saw no short-term way to prop up the dollar, which has fallen sharply in recent weeks, especially against the Japanese yen. In earnest tones, he warned against quick fixes.
Almost instantly, as financial reporters here monitored their computer screens, the markets read the remarks as an augury of continuing weakness for the dollar.
Traders quickly sent the value of the dollar below 98 yen, near its post-World War II low. The dollar also fell to a 19-month low against the German mark. [Business Day, page 43.]
While the markets were still open, senior officials rushed pell-mell back to the briefing room to tell reporters that the President had not ruled out further action to bolster the dollar.
Speaking a few hours before the leaders of the world's seven main industrial powers began their annual meeting at a calculatedly informal dinner, Mr. Clinton said he wanted to "send a signal to the markets that we are working on the economic fundamentals."
He said he did not want them to adopt a short-term strategy that could "choke off growth" around the world through higher interest rates. Pressure to prop up the dollar or head off inflation could lead to an increase in interest rates.
In fact, few if any members of the so-called Group of Seven have shown much inclination to prop up the dollar. German officials, for example, said the dollar was now near its 10-year average against the mark, which suited them fine. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said Italy would benefit by paying for imported oil with cheaper dollars.
After meeting with Mr. Clinton for 90 minutes this morning, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama of Japan said he and the President had agreed that government intervention in currency markets would be unwise. The rapid rise of the yen has shaken Japanese industry, whose products will be more costly abroad, and that has complicated things for Mr. Murayama, who took office just 10 days ago.
 
Spruced-Up City
 Like Eliza Doolittle scrubbed and dressed in silks, Naples looked its spectacular best for the international extravaganza, which has given the city a chance to shake its reputation for crime, poverty and filth. Gone were the piles of garbage along the waterfront, gone were the demonic traffic jams.
But despite the fresh paint and newly planted flowers, the melodramatic heart of this sentimental, theatrical old port continued to beat. A few blocks behind the police cordons, horns honked and Neapolitans argued and gestured with their usual brio.
Life is as hard as ever, with 27 per cent unemployment. A guard at the San Martino monastery overlooking the city begged an American to ask Mr. Clinton to get his brother a job.
The President spent the day in a series of meetings -- first with Mr. Berlusconi, whom he met in Rome last month, then with Mr. Murayama, Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada and Prime Minister John Major of Britain.
The other leaders in Naples are Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and President Francois Mitterrand of France. President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia is to arrive on Saturday and sit in on political sessions Saturday night and Sunday as a full participant, an important departure.
 
Politics, in Passing
 There was some discussion on Bosnia, some on other political topics, but for once the focus was squarely on economics as this, the 20th annual economic summit meeting, opened on the 50th anniversary of the Bretton Woods conference in New Hampshire that set up the postwar international monetary system.
At a news conference late this afternoon, Mr. Clinton was asked repeatedly whether the withdrawal of Panama from arrangements for handling Haitian refugees made military action in the Caribbean more likely. He said he had ruled out nothing.
He carefully listed American interests in Haiti, from the million Haitian-Americans, to the American citizens working in Haiti, to the promotion of democracy in one of the two countries in the area with military governments. (The other is Cuba.)
Such litanies have been recited by other Presidents before military action, but when pressed on prospects for an invasion, Mr. Clinton insisted, "My position has not changed since I first commented on that."
 
A Bit of Braggadocio
 The news conference took place in a classic Neapolitan setting, the terrace of Zi' Teresa, one of the small restaurants that cluster around Santa Lucia harbor, celebrated in the most famous of all Neapolitan ballads.
Mr. Clinton opened with a long statement in which he bragged just a little about his country's economic performance, which has been much the best in the last year of any of the seven nations.
"America has 40 percent of the G-7's gross domestic product but provided 75 per cent of the growth and about 100 percent of the new jobs over the last year," he said. "Growing our economy and shrinking our budget deficit from the biggest among these nations to one of the smallest gives us the authority to speak and the credibility to be heard on the matters of discussion here."
But the unpleasant reality of the sagging dollar intruded upon Mr. Clinton's optimism.
Asked to explain the situation, he blamed it mainly on the persistent trade deficit with Japan. Because Japan has had so many recent changes of government, he acknowledged, "there has not been the political capacity to reach any agreements which would permit the trade deficit to narrow."
 
New Minister in Town
 In the talks between Mr. Murayama and Mr. Clinton, the new Prime Minister reportedly reaffirmed all the general promises about opening Japanese markets to more American exports, but with no guarantee that this would happen soon -- if at all.
The one new thing Mr. Murayama said publicly was that his Government planned another income-tax cut next year to stimulate consumer spending, without a compensating sales-tax increase.
In the past, the Finance Ministry has been willing to accept a tax cut only if it was matched by a rise in consumption taxes. United States officials were mildly pleased to hear that Tokyo was ready to cut taxes again next year; but without a promise not to raise other taxes later, they said, it does not mean much.
At a separate briefing, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was asked whether figures issued today showing rising employment in the United States meant that the economy was overheating. "At this point I don't think so," he answered.
Mr. Bentsen was also asked whether he thought the Federal Reserve should raise interest rates to make sure the economy does not surge so fast that it produces inflation. He said bluntly, "Not at this point."

HEADLINE: Next Question: If Employers Don't Pay Health Bill, Who Will?

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
President Clinton's goal of health insurance for all Americans is often described as a moral imperative or a political objective, but it is also a pocketbook issue.
In one sense, there is no mystery about how to reduce the number of uninsured: it just takes money. The question is who should pay. 
 In trying to achieve universal health insurance coverage, Mr. Clinton and Congress will confront an unpleasant choice in the next few weeks. If employers do not pay most of the cost, as Mr. Clinton has proposed, then the Government and consumers must pay more.
Many people describe Mr. Clinton's proposal for an "employer mandate" as an alternative to taxes. Still, the public would ultimately pay. Economists say that employers would pass on the costs to their workers by reducing the amount of money available for wages or future pay raises.
 
Guarantees, but Not for All
 Members of Congress are skittish about requiring everyone to obtain insurance, and many flatly oppose Mr. Clinton's proposal to make employers pay most of the cost. Many lawmakers now suggest that the Government should initially try to guarantee coverage for some fraction of the population, perhaps 95 percent, as the Senate Finance Committee has proposed.
What difference does it make whether 95 percent or 100 percent of the people have insurance? And who is most likely to remain uninsured? Those questions are at the heart of the current debate over how to redesign the nation's health care system.
Currently, the Government estimates that 39 million Americans, accounting for 15 percent of the population, have no health insurance. But such numbers imply far more precision than is possible with any measuring tools now available. People's insurance status is continually changing as they change jobs, marry and divorce, move from one state to another and go on and off the rolls of programs like Medicaid and Medicare.
 
Unintended Adverse Effects
 Virtually all the major health care proposals now in Congress would make health insurance more available, prohibit insurers from denying coverage to people with a history of illness or disability and prevent insurers from charging extremely high premiums to people with high medical risks.
But such changes, by themselves, would not solve the problem, and experts warn that half measures could have unintended adverse effects. Alice F. Rosenblatt, an actuary at Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm, said that "a small proportion of the uninsured, probably less than 5 percent, have been denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions like cancer and cardiovascular problems."
Moreover, unless there is some mechanism for enrolling all people in health plans, millions of Americans are likely to remain uninsured because they do not want to be bothered, see no need for coverage or cannot afford their share of the cost.
"Many people may rationally choose not to purchase health insurance coverage, either because they have low income or because they believe they have a low risk of needing health care services," said William S. Custer, research director of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan organization whose members include businesses and labor unions.
 
The Young May Go Without
 If there is no requirement for people to have insurance, many who are young and healthy will probably go without it because they see no immediate need, given the cost. If significant numbers of healthy people go without insurance, the average risk of the policyholders rises, and their premiums increase as a result.
At least 11.6 million people 18 to 29 years old have no health insurance. They account for 30 percent of the uninsured. It is desirable to have these people in the insurance pool because their medical costs are generally lower than those of older people, actuaries say.
Under most of the proposals in Congress, poor people would pay little or nothing for health insurance. The Government would pay the premiums for people with incomes below the official poverty level, now $14,764 for a family of four. Lawmakers assume that affluent people can buy private health insurance, costing $4,000 to $6,000 a year for a family, if they do not receive coverage through employers.
So, health policy experts say, if employers are not required to provide insurance to their employees, the people most likely to be uninsured are people in the middle-income range, particularly those who work for small companies.
"All the major proposals would give full coverage to people below the poverty line," said Mr. Custer of the Employee Benefit Research Institute. "That's the first group that would pick up coverage. Uninsured people at the poor end of the middle class are least likely to pick up coverage as a result of these reforms."
Eleven million people without insurance, or 28 percent of the uninsured, have incomes below the poverty level. They could get coverage at little or no charge under most of the proposals pending in Congress.
If the Government provided coverage similar to what the average employer now offers, it would cost $2,000 a year for each uninsured person. For every million people who received fully subsidized coverage, the Government would have to pay at least $2 billion a year.
Nearly one-third of the uninsured -- 12.5 million of the 39 million people without coverage -- have incomes between the official poverty level and twice that amount. Under the major proposals, these people would get some financial assistance from the Government to help them buy insurance.
 
A Cautionary Note
 Whether such subsidies would be adequate depends on many questions: the amount of the assistance, the cost of the insurance and the portion, if any, paid by employers.
Mr. Custer sounds a cautionary note. "It is extremely unlikely that simply lowering the costs of insurance will achieve universal coverage," he said.
Clinton Administration officials say that universal coverage is not only good health policy but also good politics. Health care is a pocketbook issue, they say, because people can be impoverished by medical bills.
"People who work should not be left behind when we reform the health care system," said Gregory E. Lawler, a lawyer coordinating the health care campaign at the White House. "They should have guaranteed private insurance."
More than half of the uninsured are working adults. Eighty-four percent of the uninsured live in families headed by workers. But in recent years, there has been a decline in coverage provided by companies with fewer than 25 employees. Such companies say they are often unable to obtain affordable health insurance for their workers because insurers charge them higher premiums, reflecting the risks and the administrative costs associated with small groups.
 
Concern for Children
 Congress has for years shown special concern for the medical needs of children, and that impulse is clear in many proposals to overhaul the health care system. The Finance Committee, for example, accepted a proposal by Senator Donald W.

Nearly 10 million children under 18 years old have no health insurance coverage, and most of them could obtain it under the bills now pending in Congress.

WELFARE FINGERPRINTING GAINS APPROVAL
The Cuomo administration gave the green light to New York City and two suburban counties to take electronic fingerprints of some welfare recipients in an effort to fight fraud, as long as local governments pay a share of the cost and follow state regulations. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has made the process known as finger imaging a centerpiece of his welfare policy, said he would proceed with plans to set up a system in all five boroughs by May. Page 1.

POLICE COMMISSIONER'S POWER ATTACKED
State Senate bill 8014A gained final legislative approval on the evening of July 1, one of the last days of business in Albany. The bill, to create an independent disciplinary hearing process for city employees, would strip New York City's police commissioner of the power to dismiss officers for misconduct on the job. The legislation had one major lobbyist: the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the main police union. Page 1. 

NEW YORK CITY
 
GIULIANI INTERVIEWING G.O.P. CANDIDATES
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani began formally interviewing New York's Republican candidates for governor , holding out his support as the coveted prize of an unusual, politically delicate dance. The Mayor's interview with Richard M. Rosenbaum was the first of what Mr. Giuliani said would be a series of meetings with the two Republican candidates -- George E. Pataki is the other -- to determine, as the Mayor said, who would deliver more for the city. Page 22.

UNLICENSED DRIVER BACKS OVER CHILD
A 21-month-old girl, who moved from Puerto Rico only weeks ago, was killed Thursday evening when an unlicensed driver backed into her outside a supermarket in the Soundview section of the Bronx, the police said. Page 22.

STORMS BRING RELIEF FROM THE HEAT
Morning sunshine dissolved into thunderstorms, forcing sunbathers to flee shade for shelter, people in shorts to throw up umbrellas and forecasters to change their predictions of record heat. Within three hours, the temperature at Central Park dropped 21 degrees. A funnel cloud was seen over northeastern Orange County, N.Y., and in Secaucus, N.J., three inches of rain fell in 45 minutes. The World Trade Center was struck by lightning 10 times in seconds. Page 22.

PORT AUTHORITY OFFICER HURT IN SCUFFLE
A Port Authority police officer was shoved in front of a moving car and injured at Kennedy International Airport during a scuffle with supporters of Louis Farrakhan, the head of the Nation of Islam, a spokesman for the authority said. Page 23.

NEW JERSEY VOTE TO BE REVIEWED
The civil war among Essex County Democrats took on a new dimension when the New Jersey Attorney General announced an investigation into possible vote fraud in the June 7 Democratic primary for county executive. Page 24.

REGIONAL JOBS DATA MAY HIDE GAINS
The Government's latest unemployment statistics showed that the jobless rates for New York City, New York State and New Jersey remained higher than the national rate. But Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor, said, "Fundamentally, the region is coming around after a long time in the wilderness."

HEADLINE: Panama's People Don't Want Haitians, or 'Gringos'

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PANAMA, July 8

 BODY:
In the neighborhood known as El Chorrillo, destroyed but only partly rebuilt after the American invasion of Panama in 1989, Orlando Gil and his neighbors were in a celebratory mood today, delighted that their Government had decided not to allow the United States to bring Haitian refugees here. "It's about time somebody in this country said no to the gringos," the unemployed laborer said.
To Washington's great dismay, the Western Hemisphere country most recently invaded by the United States proved unwilling this week to ease the pressure of a crisis that may well result in America's next military adventure. And to a large extent, Panamanians agree, it was the legacy of that invasion and 90 years of American involvement here that forced President Guillermo Endara to rescind Panama's offers of a temporary safe haven for up to 10,000 Haitian boat people. 
 "After the invasion, people thought the money would flow like manna from heaven," said Cecilia Smith Ayarza, owner of a small restaurant in El Chorrillo. "But things are as bad as they ever were, maybe even worse. The Americans want us to help them with their problem, but they still haven't cleaned up the mess they made here."
 
Complaints About Invasion
 Since the invasion in December 1989, the United States has authorized more than $1 billion in aid and credits to the Government of Mr. Endara, who defeated the candidate backed by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in a vote in May 1989 and took office after the invasion. But families whose homes were ruined or whose relatives were killed, as well as owners of businesses destroyed during the invasion, complained that they have not been properly compensated, and wonder where all the money went.
Indeed, unemployment here remains nearly as high as during the Noriega era. There is also a shortage of housing, a rising crime rate and serious health and drug problems, all of which, many Panamanians say, would only have been worsened if Mr. Endara had acceded to the Clinton Administration's request for help with the Haitian refugee crisis.
"I believe in charity, but charity begins at home," said Maria Morales, who was among a group of protesters picketing the Panamanian Foreign Ministry when Mr. Endara announced Thursday that he would not allow the refugees to come to Panama. "There's not enough jobs to go around, and everything you buy is getting more expensive. We have enough problems of our own."
 
Warring Political Parties
 In large part because of such dissatisfaction, the Presidential election held here in May resulted in victory for the Revolutionary Democratic Party, a strongly nationalistic group organized to support the military dictatorship that lasted until 1989. The party's candidate, Ernesto Perez Balladares, who is scheduled to take office on Sept. 1, criticized Mr. Endara's handling of the situation after the agreement collapsed on Thursday.
By first agreeing to accept the refugees, and then just as suddenly changing his mind, Mr. Endara exposed Panama to "international ridicule," Mr. Perez Balladares asserted. "If such a situation presents itself during my administration, I will consult a great number of Panamanians, rather than arriving at a decision I will have to regret three days later," he said.
Revolutionary Democratic Party officials said Mr. Perez Balladares, who was scheduled to meet with President Clinton in Washington on July 20, did not want to antagonize the United States before being sworn in, and therefore did not oppose the refugee agreement openly. But a strong streak of anti-Americanism has always run through his party, and Mr. Perez Balladares had no desire to support a deal that was clearly unpopular with ordinary Panamanians.
 
Endara Felt Mistreated
 Mr. Endara complained about the treatment he received from American officials over the Haitian refugee issue.
"I felt mocked and intimidated," Mr. Endara said in a telephone interview with Telemundo television news. "I negotiated with them till midnight and they mistreated me. They treated me as if this were a banana republic."
American officials, on the other hand, said they had been "exceedingly deferential" to Mr. Endara because they realized the delicacy and the sensitive nature of the agreement the two sides were seeking.
For many Panamanians, Washington's eagerness to unload Haitian refugees on them recalled a similar situation in 1979, when the deposed Shah of Iran came here at the height of the hostage crisis. Carter Administration officials, several of whom are now back in power with the Clinton Administration, later boasted that they had solved the problem of a safe haven for the Shah with "a single phone call" to Gen. Omar Torrijos, the country's ruler at the time.
Since the overthrow of General Noriega, however, Panama has been a vibrant, if somewhat tumultuous, democracy, with the National Assembly challenging the executive branch at every turn. Mr. Endara announced the offer of a safe haven for the Haitians after a phone conversation on July 2 with Mr. Clinton and discussions with American diplomats, but without consulting legislative leaders here, who were deeply offended at being left out.
 
Anti-Immigrant Sentiments
 Mr. Endara's willingness to offer a safe haven to 10,000 Creole-speaking refugees also wakened even older and equally disturbing memories here. Despite pledges by the Endara Government that any Haitian refugees would remain here no longer than one year, many Panamanians were openly skeptical, recalling earlier episodes in which "temporary" influxes of foreigners proved permanent.
During the building of the Panama Canal, for instance, the United States brought thousands of English-speaking blacks from the West Indies to do much of the most dangerous and physically demanding work, promising they would be repatriated after the project was finished. Most of them stayed on, however, making surnames such as Kelly, Parker, Duncan or Cooper common here and giving Panama a mixed cultural identity that persists to this day.
In recent years, Chinese, Arab, Indian and Pakistani immigrants and refugees have also settled here in large numbers, some of them with false visas or passports they purchased from corrupt government officials.
"These are people who know how to build boats, so how can you keep them on a small island?" Herminia Espinosa, a housewife in the capital, said of the Haitians. "They're going to have children who will be Panamanian citizens, or they will escape from the encampments and take away jobs from Panamanians. Because they look like Panamanians, they're going to be able to melt right into the population."

Players' Salary-Cap Fears Confirmed by Management Explanations

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Negotiators for the Players Association spent the better part of a three-hour meeting yesterday asking questions of their management counterparts to make sure they understood the owners' salary cap proposal.
"Our views of how certain things would work were certainly confirmed," Donald Fehr, head of the players' union, said. "We were afraid our views were going to be confirmed." 
 In other words, yesterday's bargaining session did nothing to make the players' hearts grow any more fond of the salary cap the owners want to institute as a new economic system for baseball. The players haven't rejected the proposal, but they long have stated their opposition to a salary cap.
In this proposal, the owners have offered to give the players 50 percent of their annual revenue and guarantee $1 billion a year as long as revenue doesn't fall below the total revenue the clubs have this year. The clubs estimate that revenue at $1.8 billion.
During yesterday's meeting, the two sides also discussed the owners' proposal to reduce from six to four the number of years of major league service needed for free agency. The drawback, from the players' viewpoint, is that players with four or five years of service would be subject to right of first refusal, meaning their former club could retain them by matching an offer made by another club.
Richard Ravitch, the clubs' chief labor executive, called the meeting "useful," prompting Fehr to respond, "He obviously has taken a course in how to write press releases following diplomatic meetings."
Ravitch said the two sides also discussed a drug policy. Baseball hasn't had a joint policy since October 1985, but the clubs have expressed interest in formulating a new one and the union has said it, too, would like a joint program.
This was the last bargaining session before the players' executive board meets in Pittsburgh Monday, the day before the All-Star Game.
"We'll go through where we are on everything," Fehr said. "We'll talk the issues through and make sure everybody understands the proposals we want to make. I'm sure there will be discussion of setting a deadline, but I don't expect we will set one."
The players are expected to make their initial proposals at a negotiating meeting next Thursday.
Ravitch has indicated some impatience with the union's pace, but Fehr has pointed to the delay in the clubs' presentation of their salary cap proposal.
It was made five months after the clubs adopted their own revenue-sharing plan, which is contingent on the players' acceptance of a cap, and 18 months after the owners reopened the collective bargaining agreement.

HEADLINE: New Money No Novelty in Brazil

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BRASILIA

 BODY:
With six different currencies having passed through their hands in the last decade, Brazilian comics are comparing the July 1 introduction of Brazil's new money unit, the real, to Elizabeth Taylor's latest marriage.
The Unified Workers Federation, Brazil's most powerful trade union, has already coined its protest slogan: "It looks like a nightmare, but it's real." (The Portuguese word for "real" is the same as the English.) 
 Here in this city of technocrats, where officials are shepherding Latin America's largest economy into its latest anti-inflation program, thin smiles greet such gibes.
Brazilian financial officials see the world's largest currency switch -- 3,000 tons of new bills and coins, worth $7 billion -- as the last, best hope of driving down a 5,000 percent annual inflation rate.
Indeed, many economists agree that the process, loosely modeled on the successful anti-inflation program of Argentina, might finally bring price stability.
 
Parity With U.S. Dollar
 Brazilians have until July 15 to trade in the cruzeiro real -- a currency that lost half of its purchasing power in June -- for the real, a new currency that is to stay on a par with the dollar through the end of the year.
"Our commitment is to intervene by selling dollars so that the relation stays at one to one," Pedro Malan, the president of the central bank, warned speculators recently.
Mr. Malan controls Brazil's largest foreign currency reserves ever, $40 billion. This mountain of dollars is one of several factors that make Brazil's financial officials optimistic about engineering a price turnaround in an economy now larger than Russia's. For example, in a measure of the nation's industrial might, Brazilians this year bought a record 573,849 automobiles and 21 million Brazilian-made television sets, largely to watch World Cup soccer.
Also, the federal budget, at the heart of any inflation, is balanced this year, they say. But as is often the case with politics in Brazil -- where general elections are to be held on Oct. 3 -- budget balancing is a messy, temporary affair. One decree has curbed election-season spending by governors, mayors and congressmen. Another cut federal revenue-sharing -- but only through next spring.
"The deficit in services is going to explode in next year's budget," predicted Miro Teixeira, an opposition congressman who presides over the Economy Committee of the Chamber of Deputies. "Hospitals can't close. Roads can't continue with potholes."
But Brazil's Finance Minister, Rubens Ricupero, believes that the success of the plan will generate support for continued budget balancing.
"The success of stabilization makes it irreversible," Mr. Ricupero declared in a recent interview here. "No government that enters in January with low inflation can afford to throw it away." A survey of Brazil's largest retailers predicted that next year Brazil will have a monthly inflation rate of 7 percent -- the lowest level in nearly a decade.
In contrast to previous attempts at controlling inflation, the conversion to the real does not involve a price freeze. Still, reflexively fearing a freeze, merchants have pushed up prices. At one fruit market in Rio, the asking price for melons was $5 apiece; at another, a dozen cherries cost $9.80. On Ipanema beach, the price of coconut jumped from 83 cents to $1. At Sugar Loaf mountain, the aerial tramway went from $4.50 to $7.50. But with Brazil's minimum salary pegged at $65 a month, consumer resistance is forcing prices to more realistic levels.
 
Pressure From Imports
 Another difference from the past is that this conversion comes at a time when Brazil's economy is fully open to imports. Where cartels once colluded on prices, they now look warily over their shoulders at imports.
"The faster the imports come in, the better for me," Mr. Ricupero said. "Brazilians have lived with inflation for 30 years. Like addicts, some people will always want their daily fix."
A freighter recently docked at a Brazilian port with the nation's first shipment of Vietnamese rice, he noted. Suddenly, Brazilian rice growers stopped raising their prices.
After Mexico, Brazil is Latin America's largest importer of goods from the United States. American exports to Brazil were rising even before the conversion, largely because of low tariffs and because of Brazil's surging economic growth rate -- at 5.7 percent in the first quarter, one of Latin America's highest.
With inflation predicted to drop this month to 5 percent, from 50 percent in June, merchants predict a rise in consumption as credit cards and installment plans return to use.
 
Few Shortages Expected
 But economists do not forecast the kind of inflationary bottlenecks that derailed past currency switches. Brazil had a record grain harvest of 76 million tons this year, and Sao Paulo industries have the idle capacity and supplies of raw material to allow quick production increases. And to hold off an inflationary boom in consumer spending, the Government is keeping interest rates high -- 5 percent a month above inflation.
In the short term, the major threat to the new currency would be a surge of dollars from overseas to take advantage of Brazil's high interest rates. But each dollar that enters Brazil must be matched by a real. And the Government says it has no intention of breaking its target for the monetary base -- 8.5 billion reals by the end of this year.
To discourage deposits from overseas, the Government has driven down the price of the dollar here to 85 centavos. Although an estimated $2.5 billion surged into Brazil in June, flows have virtually dried up since the introduction of the real.
The long-term threat to Brazil's anti-inflation plan would be the election this fall of a presidential candidate without a commitment to balance the federal budget.
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who stepped down as Finance Minister in March to run for president, is staking his campaign largely on the plan's success. Overwhelmingly favored by business executives in surveys, Mr. Cardoso, who places second in overall opinion polls, saw a rise in his poll standing recently, to about 22 percent from the high teens.
But Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, the socialist career unionist who is leading Mr. Cardoso by 15 percentage points, dismisses the new Cardoso showing.
"People are believing in the money, not the man," he said in an interview on a campaign stop at Montes Claros, an agricultural center in Minas Gerais, the state with the nation's second most powerful economy. Indeed, some wonder if low inflation will be enough to help Mr. Cardoso win an electoral runoff.
"I would be surprised if stabilization, without salary increases, left people euphoric," said Mario Henrique Simonsen, a former Planning Minister who is a Cardoso supporter. "People who call the real plan an electoral trick are mistaken. It is the typical kind of plan done at the beginning of a mandate and harvested at the polls at the end of a government."

HEADLINE: Fiscal Board Chief Takes Harvard Post

 BODY:
Allen J. Proctor, the head of the state agency that oversees New York City's finances, announced his resignation yesterday after more than four years in the post.
Mr. Proctor, 42, is leaving the State Financial Control Board to teach at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. As executive director, Mr. Proctor was a frequent critic of New York City's budget plans, and he prodded state and local politicians to bring the city's long-term spending projections more into balance with its underlying economic and fiscal situation. 
 "In the last year or so, there's been a sea change in the way political leaders on all sides have approached the structural budget crisis," Mr. Proctor said. "I'm proud that we did our part to help bring that about."
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, in accepting Mr. Proctor's resignation, praised him for "strong and effective leadership at the control board" and said he "took an already proficient operation and, with dedication and hard work, made it better."
Mr. Proctor, who was a deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget under Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins, said he was resigning out of a desire to do something different in his career, not out of any policy disagreement with either Governor Cuomo or Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. "An interesting offer like this doesn't come along all that often," Mr. Proctor said.

HEADLINE: Newts and Metal Projects Ride Columbia Into Space

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., July 8

 BODY:
Rising on a golden tail of billowing flame, the space shuttle Columbia carried a crew of seven into space today for a two-week mission to study both the subtle and the grand effects of gravity on materials and living things.
The experiments involve work with exotic furnaces that can produce unusual alloys and with a rotating centrifuge that can simulate different levels of gravity. The equipment also includes aquariums teeming with thousands of animals, including goldfish, killifish, jellyfish, sea urchins and Japanese red-bellied newts. 
 Columbia, carrying a bus-sized module called the International Microgravity Laboratory in its cargo bay, took off on time at 12:43 P.M. after there were initial concerns about showers and thunderstorms building up near the Kennedy Space Center and at two emergency landing fields overseas.
Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said they had been able to handle a few minor problems with ground sensors, computers and power fluctuations. Although a puff of smoke or mist was seen near the shuttle about a minute into the flight, an official said it did not seem to indicate a problem.
 
Going Right to Work
 After the astronauts were safely in orbit, they immediately got down to a busy schedule of activating the laboratory for continuous operation. Working around the clock in two shifts, the astronauts will conduct 82 experiments involving more than 200 scientists from 13 countries. The experiments, in materials and life sciences, include 22 provided by the German Space Agency, 18 from the United States and 12 from the National Space Development Agency of Japan.
The mission focuses on studying the effects of the limited gravity of orbital flight on the processing of materials and on living things, particularly the growth of plants and aquatic animals. Officials of the space agency say the multinational research is a prelude to the kind of work that will be done after the turn of the century, if all goes as planned, on the international space station.
Experiments in processing metals without using containers will employ a special furnace that electromagnetically levitates the metal samples. That allows them to be melted and solidified without the walls of a vessel either contaminating them or affecting their crystalline structure, researchers said. Another physics experiment will examine the transitional states of a material as it changes from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas or vapor.
Dr. Harry Holloway, NASA's associate administrator for microgravity and life sciences, said the work with aquatic animals, looking at the effect of gravity on their balance, orientation and physical development, represented fundamental research that might also have implications for humans. Fish and amphibians swim in water in much the way astronauts float in space because of reduced gravity, he said, so studying the evolution of the animal cells that sense motion and orientation has obvious implications.
However, he said, studies done in the absence of gravity can also shed light on the effects of gravity on people on Earth. "All of us, in our mothers' wombs, developed as aquatic animals," Dr. Holloway said.
 
Japanese Woman on Board
 The international flavor of the mission is reflected in the crew, which includes six American men and Japan's first woman astronaut, Dr. Chiaki Naito-Mukai, a heart surgeon from Tokyo. Dr. Mukai, who also has a doctorate in physiology, is the second Japanese astronaut to fly on a shuttle. The first was Mamoru Mohri, who flew in 1992 on a mission dedicated to Japanese life science research.
Dr. Mukai, already a celebrity in Japan for her role in the space program, said earlier that she hoped her flight "encourages other Japanese to do things they might hesitate to do because they are women."
Other crew members aboard the mission, the 63d of the shuttle program and the 17th for Columbia, include Col. Robert D. Cabana of the Marines, the mission commander and a veteran of two previous flights, and Lieut. Col. James D. Halsell Jr. of the Air Force, the shuttle pilot, who is making his initial voyage. Richard J. Hieb, the payload commander, has flown two previous missions, and Lieut. Col. Carl E. Walz of the Air Force, a mission specialist, flew once before. The rookies aboard include Dr. Leroy Chiao and Dr. Donald A. Thomas, both science specialists.
The puff of smoke or mist was seen by some ground observers near the upper part of the exhaust plume of one of the two solid-fuel booster rockets, which are attached to the shuttle. Loren Shriver, a shuttle program manager, said the puff had apparently resulted from the interaction of normal shock waves caused by the shuttle moving through the air at supersonic speed, with a wave of condensed, moist air rolling down the vehicle.
Mr. Shriver said no one monitoring the shuttle or its engines reported anything unusual at the time of the puff, but he said he had made an informal request for engineers to recheck their data. "Personally, I don't think it's anything more than the shock wave going through condensation," he said after a news briefing.

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
"How many divisions has the Pope?" Stalin is supposed to have asked, but it is not hard to imagine Franklin D. Roosevelt or Henry A. Kissinger saying much the same thing. They too, at times, were exasperated by the idea that in world of politics, religious ideals could outweigh military might or material interests.
It is also not hard to imagine such dismissive sentiments issuing from the corridors of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington research institution with a reputation for harboring tough-minded scholars and diplomats. 
 But tough-mindedness isn't always what it seems. Scholars and diplomats affiliated with the center have just produced a study saying religion has been systematically neglected as a factor in international affairs.
They contend that policy makers, embassy aides, strategists -- and journalists, too -- have given minute attention to economic assets, military forces and social and political rivalries while scarcely noting the role of religion. When a Central Intelligence Agency analyst proposed an examination of the leading religious leaders in Iran under Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the idea was rejected as mere "sociology."
This kind of criticism may fall on receptive ears now that the cold war has been replaced by so many conflicts between groups divided by religious or ethnic loyalties.
But in "Religion: The Missing Dimension of Statecraft," a collection of studies that Oxford University Press plans to publish in August, the center's scholars go further. They fault not only the underestimation of religious differences as a source of conflict, but also the neglect of religious institutions and leaders as catalysts in ending warfare or bringing about peaceful democratic change.
Why, in the view of these scholars, has religion been slighted by America's foreign policy specialists?
One reason is the longstanding principle of the separation of church and state and the resulting tendency of American culture to relegate religion to the realm of the personal.
Douglas Johnston, the center's executive vice president and chief operating officer who is a former Defense Department official, says many Americans are desensitized to the fact that much of the world does not operate this way.
A second reason is the school of realism, which has loomed so large in the study of international relations. Realism emphasizes the primacy in international relations of "national interest" defined in terms of power and material advantages rather than cloudy ideals.
It is not surprising that the index of Mr. Kissinger's new book, "Diplomacy" (Simon & Schuster), a massive realist study of modern world politics, contains no entry for religion or Christianity, Judaism or Islam. Nor does it contain any entry for Mohandas K. Gandhi, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. or Pope John Paul II.
A third reason that religion remains "the missing dimension of statecraft" is what the military strategist Edward Luttwak bluntly calls the "Enlightenment prejudice."
"Even as the Enlightenment swept away clerical obscurantism," he writes, "it imposed its own restrictive prejudice on the scope and content of scholarship." The advanced thinkers of the 18th century rejected the Inquisition's methods of torture, Mr. Luttwak said, "but when it came to religion in all its aspects, they strangled free inquiry just as effectively by the commanding force of the fashion they imposed." Religious motivations in secular affairs, he said, "were disregarded or dismissed as mere pretense."
Mr. Luttwak and Barry Rubin, a professor of international studies at Johns Hopkins University, enumerate instances, particularly in the Middle East, when American policy may have been misled by the disregard of religious realities. The point of the book is not to indict American policy, however, but to provide a scholarly basis for considering the nearly unthinkable -- that religion could actually be a positive force for peacemaking.
The book provides seven case studies of efforts by religious groups or leaders to reconcile enemies or to achieve peaceful rather than violent political change.
One study describes the largely unreported success of the Moral Re-Armament Movement in bringing together thousands of French and German citizens, including influential politicians, trade unionists, industrialists, educators, clergy and journalists, for extended and intense meetings in Switzerland from 1946 to 1950. The gatherings laid the groundwork for the 1950 initiative of Robert Schuman and Konrad Adenauer to establish the European Coal and Steel Community, a major step toward the reconciliation of France and Germany and a united Europe.
Other case studies focus on Nicaragua, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, East Germany and the Philippines. One essay traces the role of South Africa's Dutch Reformed Church in first justifying apartheid, then turning against it.
The authors strive not to overstate their thesis, and one contributor warns against literal-minded efforts to translate these ideas into action. "The world is obviously not clamoring for Washington or other capitals to shanghai platoons of clerics into their service in order to support a global pacification mission," writes Stanton Burnett, a senior adviser at the center.
In fact, many believers will have mixed feelings about Mr. Luttwak's suggestion that "religious attache's" be assigned to countries where religion is particularly important "to monitor religious movements and maintain contact with religious leaders, just as labor attaches have long been assigned to deal with local trade unions."
But "Religion: The Missing Dimension of Statecraft" holds lessons not only for government officials but also for religious leaders willing to take initiatives for peace. It should encourage the growth of diplomatically engaged religion as well as religiously informed diplomacy.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Starts Interviewing Candidates for Governor

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani began formally interviewing the Republican candidates for Governor of New York yesterday, holding out his support as the coveted prize of an unusual, politically delicate dance.
For months the Mayor has annoyed state Republican leaders because of his reluctance to endorse the party's nominee, George E. Pataki -- a stance the leaders fear may play into the hands of the man they are trying to defeat this fall, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. 
 Yesterday morning, Mr. Giuliani met for 45 minutes with Richard M. Rosenbaum, the former judge who is mounting a petition drive to force a primary against Mr. Pataki, the state Senator from Peekskill.
The leaders say that Mr. Pataki, who is scheduled to have his own meeting with the Mayor next week, is the best hope for the party that elected Mr. Giuliani New York City's first Republican Mayor in a generation. He is also, perhaps not incidentally, the protege of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Mr. Giuliani's sometimes political rival.
 
Looking for Most for City
 The interview with Mr. Rosenbaum was the first of what Mr. Giuliani said would be a series of meetings with the two Republican candidates to determine, as the Mayor reiterated yesterday, who would deliver more for the city. And in a manner befitting someone who is being courted by dueling suitors, Mr. Giuliani made it clear yesterday that he was keeping his options open.
"This is not to favor one candidate or another," Mr. Giuliani said after his meeting with Mr. Rosenbaum yesterday morning. "It's to give both candidates an equal opportunity to explain to me, since they're running for Governor of New York State, what they would do with regard to the issues that are of importance to New York City."
(As for Mr. Cuomo, whom the Mayor has even hinted that he might ultimately endorse if he is the best candidate to help the city, Mr. Giuliani explained that he knew where the Governor stood on those issues and would call him if he needed a clarification.)
Though his aides say it speaks for itself, the Mayor's strategy also underscores the political realities that face Mr. Giuliani, a Republican who barely won the Mayor's race in an overwhelmingly Democratic city and who prefers to portray his administration as nonideological.
"He has to operate in a constituency that is 5 to 1 Democrats," Jay Severin, the Republican political strategist, said.
 
Eye to His Future
 "By choreographing the courting of him by candidates across the spectrum he is playing his cards well," he added. "He enhances his own political stature and that of New Yorkers."
Other strategists and leaders from both parties say that Mr. Giuliani also appears to have one eye on his future, which includes almost certainly a re-election campaign in 1997 and possibly a race for Governor.
Whatever the case, in these early days of the race for Governor, Mr. Giuliani has stayed out of the roiling fight among Republicans vying to take on Mr. Cuomo, who the party believes is as vulnerable as ever. The Mayor said yesterday that he did not expect to endorse any candidate in the Republican primary, though he is almost certain to endorse a candidate in the general election.
And Mr. Giuliani has had a prolonged flirtation with the Governor himself, appearing often with Mr. Cuomo at news conferences and ribbon cuttings and offering kind words.
"The only concern he's got is the people of New York City," Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers said yesterday. "There's not much more to say than that."
The strategy, particularly his appearances with Mr. Cuomo, has won little sympathy from the state's Republican leaders and others supporting Mr. Pataki, including Mr. D'Amato.
 
Clearly Angry Officials
 Many Republicans are still angered that though the Mayor remained aloof, Mr. Powers lobbied at the party's convention in May for another of Mr. Pataki's opponents for Governor, Herbert London, a New York University economics professor. One Republican official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the leaders perceived the Mayor's actions and inactions "as a sort of slap in the face."
The state chairman of the party, William D. Powers, declined through a spokeswoman yesterday to discuss the Mayor's meeting with Mr. Rosenbaum.
But officials were clearly angered by the meeting with Mr. Rosenbaum because of the prominence it gave his insurgent effort. Mr. Rosenbaum, who supported Mr. Giuliani's campaign last fall, has raised more than $1.6 million and collected about 37,000 signatures on petitions, more than three times the number needed to qualify for the Republican primary.
The Mayor's meeting with Mr. Rosenbaum covered a range of issues, both men said, and Mr. Giuliani said he gave Mr. Rosenbaum, and would also give Mr. Pataki, a scorecard of sorts of "the issues that I consider important to the city."
The list included aid for education, reform of welfare, a takeover of the city's Medicaid costs, anti-bias legislation that includes protection for gay men and lesbians and reform of the criminal-justice system.
Mr. Rosenbaum used the occasion to release his proposal to change welfare that, among other things, would require recipients to work or attend classes 40 hours a week and cut benefits for women who have additional children. Another provision said, "If father's identity is unknown, recipients should be required to provide the names of all possible fathers or face cutoffs of benefits for that child."
Asked about the candidate's proposals, Mr. Giuliani said: "Those are all things that are certainly worth proposing. You don't have to agree with all of them."
Party officials say that Mr. Giuliani would be foolhardy to support any candidate other than the Republican on the ballot in November and that in spite of whatever signals he might send, they expect him to be loyal to his party.
"I honestly believe he's going to support the Republican candidate," said Frances Werner, the party chairwoman for Queens. "It was the Republican Party that made him Mayor."
