HEADLINE: Third-Quarter Profit Fell 16% at DuPont

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., Oct. 21

 BODY:
The DuPont Company, the largest chemical company in the United States, said third-quarter profit fell 16 percent on weakening global demand and the strong dollar before charges resulted in a quarterly loss.
The company, based in Wilmington, which also owns the Conoco energy company, said profit from continuing operations fell to $610 million, or 53 cents a diluted share, from $725 million, or 63 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. 
 Including profit from Conoco, which DuPont plans to sell, the company had results of 67 cents a share, in line with the 66-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by the First Call Corporation.
The company, which derived almost half of its $45.1 billion in 1997 sales from overseas, said that global economic weakness and the strong dollar eroded prices for polyester and other products. In addition, falling oil prices, DuPont said, reduced profit at Conoco. Excluding acquisitions, shipments fell during the quarter and productivity gains did not match analysts' expectations.
Even so, sales rose 4.3 percent, to $6.04 billion from $5.79 billion, as recently acquired businesses added to revenue.
Shares of DuPont fell $2.1875, to $62, yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Kmart to Open 45 Stores

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TROY, Mich., Oct. 21

 BODY:
The Kmart Corporation said today that it would open 45 of its Big Kmart stores next month, ending a long period of store closings and depressed earnings. The retailer's chairman, Floyd Hall, said the opening of the remodeled stores, which are the same size as other Kmarts but include food sections, would help it compete against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Wal-Mart plans a big push into Michigan in the coming months. Mr. Hall said Kmart, based in Troy, had finally emerged from its troubles. While sales were down in September, he said third-quarter earnings would be up, though still short of potential.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Construction of new homes and apartments slipped in September for the second consecutive month as the brisk pace of building cooled along with the rest of the nation's economy.
Builders started work on new housing units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.58 million last month, down 2.5 percent from August, the Commerce Department said today. Starts had hit a rate of 1.70 million in July, an 11-year high. 
 In September, housing starts in the South dropped 8.6 percent, the largest decline since May 1997, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 709,000 -- a consequence, analysts said, of Hurricane Georges.
Starts also fell in the Northeast, down 3.6 percent, to a rate of 135,000. But they rose 5.6 percent in the West, to 414,000, and 3.2 percent in the Midwest, to 318,000.
Nationally, the decline was steeper for apartments, down 9.1 percent, to a rate of 330,000, than for single-family homes, down six-tenths of a percent, to 1.25 million.
Separately, according to a National Association of Home Builders survey, the number of shoppers viewing model homes fell sharply this month, though sales remained quite good.
Sales of both new and existing homes have soared this year, supported by a plunge in mortgage rates and by low unemployment and solid income growth. The big gains in the stock market through midsummer also allowed some buyers to make down-payments on larger homes.
But financial turmoil overseas has begun to slow United States economic growth, and the stock market is still well off its July peaks.
"Given the drop-off of prospective buyers visiting model homes and the recent erosion of consumer confidence, the indication is that the housing market will be slowing a bit in the months ahead," said Kent W. Colton, executive vice president of the home builders' group.

HEADLINE: U.S., Pushing Its Route For Pipeline, Aids Turkey

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey, Oct. 21

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration, increasing the pressure on oil companies to build a pipeline for Caspian Sea oil that suits American interests, said today that it would give Turkey $823,000 to help plan its part of the line.
As oil company executives appear close to making a recommendation on a pipeline route, the United States is making a major push for a plan that would send oil across Turkey to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. Administration officials say a pipeline along this route would help stabilize the region and serve long-term United States interests. 
 "Over all, Baku-Ceyhan offers the best option from environmental, economic and strategic standpoints," said Under Secretary of State Stuart E. Eizenstat. "No one should underestimate our determination to make Baku-Ceyhan a reality."
Oil companies favor the American-backed pipeline route but believe that its projected cost of $2.8 billion makes it too costly to build anytime soon. Indeed, some executives believe that the project could cost $4 billion or more. Mr. Eizenstat's announcements were apparently part of a last-minute campaign to make it more economical.
"The idea is to give Turkey financial help to lay the groundwork for this project," said an official in Ankara who was briefed on this week's meetings. "It's to help Turkey prepare a financial package, figure out how to line up financing and firm up details of the route."
Executives of oil companies active in the Caspian region said today that they still favor a shorter pipeline route running from Baku, the capital of oil-rich Azerbaijan, to the Georgian port of Supsa on the Black Sea.
Mr. Eizenstat concluded three days of meetings with Turkish officials today. He said that the Trade and Development Agency, which supports American business projects abroad, would provide the money to Turkey.
He is one of several top Administration officials who are traveling to push for the Baku-Ceyhan route. Jan Kalicki, a senior Commerce Department envoy, was in Azerbaijan last weekend. President Clinton's special envoy to the Caspian region, Richard Morningstar, and the head of the Trade and Development Agency are due in Istanbul next week.
The discovery of large amounts of oil and gas under and around the Caspian has attracted dozens of energy companies to what may be the century's last big bonanza. Because the new nations in the region are unstable and wedged into a strategic region between Russia and Iran, they have also become an arena for big-power competition. The decision on where to build an oil export pipeline could have profound geopolitical as well as economic effects.
Oil companies active in the Caspian, among them Exxon, Pennzoil and BP Amoco, are expected to announce soon which pipeline route they favor. Officially they are making only a recommendation to the Government of Azerbaijan. Since they will pay for the pipeline, however, their recommendation is likely to be decisive.
A spokeswoman for the oil consortium, Pamela Mounter, said executives hoped to recommend a pipeline route next week. "Our contract calls for us to make a draft recommendation to the Azerbaijani Government," Ms. Mounter said in a telephone interview from Baku. "The deadline is the end of this month, and we hope to meet that deadline."
Asked if the recommendation would be made public, she replied, "Yes, to the right people."
An executive close to the consortium, however, said intense international interest would probably force the companies to make their recommendation fully public.
"The recommendation is being made to Socar," the executive said, referring to Azerbaijan's state-owned oil company. "They've asked for a delay of a week or two because they're still working on next year's budget and some other matters that have to be discussed at the meeting. It's a legitimate delay, nothing horribly nefarious."
Published reports suggesting that the companies will not recommend immediate construction of a pipeline across Turkey have set off waves of protest and denial in several countries.
"Baku-Ceyhan will definitely be constructed," President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey assured anxious Turks. "It is the safest route and has the backing of the United States."
The date originally set for the companies' announcement, Oct. 29, is also the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. The Presidents of Azerbaijan and Georgia will be in Turkey for the celebrations, and they are expected to join President Demirel in a statement committing themselves to the Baku-Ceyhan route. Since their Governments will not be putting up the money for the pipeline, however, the statement will be largely symbolic.

HEADLINE: For Congress From New York

 BODY:
There are more members of Congress from New York City and its suburbs running uncontested this year than facing serious opposition. But an election still presents an opportunity to evaluate the incumbents. Here are our endorsements in some of the more interesting local races: 
 Fourth District (Nassau County): Carolyn McCarthy's transformation from nurse-housewife to gun control advocate to member of Congress was one of the most dramatic stories of the 1996 political year. Now Mrs. McCarthy, a Democrat, is running for re-election and she has the right to boast that she has become more than a one-issue lawmaker. Mrs. McCarthy has worked hard on constituent services and broadened her concerns in Congress to education and health issues, while compiling an impressive record of support for the environment. Her opponent, Gregory Becker, is a longtime State Assemblyman whose main rationale for running seems simply to be that the district ought to be under the control of the Republican Party. We are impressed by the degree to which Mrs. McCarthy has grown in office, and we give her our enthusiastic endorsement.
Sixth District (parts of Queens and the Bronx): Voters who feel that political power brokers are elbowing them out of the decision-making process have no farther to look than this district, where the veteran incumbent Thomas Manton engineered a transfer of power to his chosen successor in the middle of the night, at a time when it was too late for other Democrats to file for a primary or for Republicans to nominate a serious opponent. The beneficiary of Mr. Manton's scheme, Joseph Crowley, is a 36-year-old member of the State Assembly whose main exertion seems to have been promoting the racing industry. Mr. Crowley, a personable Democrat with deep roots in Queens politics, will almost certainly be elected to Congress, since the Republican Party is giving no support to its nominee, James Dillon, a maverick. Mr. Dillon should be commended for his effort to give voters more of an option than the local political machines seem to have intended. But his positions on tax policy are extreme and his platform on foreign policy seems to call for American isolationism, except in regard to countries whose ethnic groups are represented in the district. Despite our reservations about the illegitimate way in which he obtained the nomination, we reluctantly endorse Mr. Crowley and hope Queens voters will get more respectful treatment in the future.
Thirteenth District (part of Brooklyn and Staten Island): The freshman Republican Vito Fossella quickly established himself as a loyal foot soldier for Speaker Newt Gingrich. We have disagreed with Mr. Fossella on a number of fronts, including his extreme opposition to abortion rights and family planning. He also opposes requiring Federal employee health plans to cover contraceptives for women, just as they cover other prescriptive drugs. But Mr. Fossella's most unforgivable failure was his persistent attempts to sabotage bipartisan efforts to pass a campaign finance reform bill. Eugene Prisco, a Democrat and Staten Island schoolteacher, is a long shot at best in this race. But he has been a lifelong fighter for reform and has a sensible list of priorities including school construction aid and environmental protection. He gets our strong endorsement.
Twenty-Sixth District (Lower Hudson Valley to Ulster County, the Catskills and north to Ithaca): The incumbent Democrat Maurice Hinchey's district is larger than Connecticut, and includes both troubled industrial cities and tourist resorts. During his three terms in Congress, Mr. Hinchey has represented this diverse territory well with an agenda that combines economic development and a staunch support for the environment. Along with Sherwood Boehlert of Utica, a Republican, Mr. Hinchey has set the pace for environmentalism in the New York Congressional delegation. His Republican opponent, William Walker, an apple farmer who owns several upstate radio stations, has no real experience in government. Mr. Hinchey has served his district well and should be returned to Congress.

HEADLINE: Big Cash Infusion Aims to Rebuild Anemic C.I.A.

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Heeding warnings from the Director of Central Intelligence that the C.I.A. "will no longer be relevant" without an infusion of money and talent, Congress and the White House today approved the largest spending increase for intelligence in 15 years.
The Director, George J. Tenet, has been telling members of Congress that the machine of United States intelligence might rust and falter in the coming decade without an injection of billions of dollars. He received secret "emergency assistance" from Congress in April, and today, officials said, he received a supplemental appropriation of about $1.8 billion. In budget requests for coming years he will seek billions more. 
 "I will not allow the C.I.A. to become a second-rate organization," he told its employees recently.
In recent months, American intelligence has failed to foresee India's nuclear tests, to quickly and accurately assess a North Korean missile launch, to come up with a workable plan to undermine the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, and to provide sharp analysis of global financial crises. The C.I.A.'s evidence to justify a cruise missile attack on the Sudan in August has been questioned by Administration officials and within the agency itself.
These problems illustrate shortcomings in the intelligence agencies' abilities to analyze world events and to undertake secret operations, say supporters and critics alike.
But intelligence officials and Congressional overseers caution that some of those abilities will take years to build and cannot be created by money alone. They say -- and C.I.A. officials acknowledge -- that the agency must attract a new generation of talented people: not just spies, but computer wizards, scientists, engineers, economists, and experts in foreign languages, cultures and other subjects.
Mr. Tenet has warned his employees and members of Congress that the agency, which celebrated its 50th anniversary last year, would not see its 60th year without the money to become smarter, faster and sharper. This year he undertook a campaign to restore the agency to its cold-war strength.
In a May 5 speech at the agency, which has not previously been made public, he said the C.I.A. had to "rebuild our field strength" in order "to stay in the espionage business."
He pledged "to mount increasingly complex and expensive operations" to steal secrets. He vowed to build up the agency's clandestine service of spies, open more overseas stations, undertake more covert operations, hire more in-house experts, buy faster and better computers, and bring in a new generation of recruits.
"Obviously, moving ahead without more money would be difficult," he said in the speech, which became a basis for his requests for the billions he says are needed to create a skilled and agile intelligence service.
"How are we going to pay for it all?" he asked. "I will work with the Administration and Congress to obtain more funding."
In recent weeks, Mr. Tenet has done just that, buttonholing President Clinton, Speaker Newt Gingrich and key lawmakers. He convinced them that American intelligence was "seriously eroding" and needed rebuilding, said Representative Porter J. Goss, Republican of Florida, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
"Intelligence isn't just something for the cold war," Mr. Goss, a former C.I.A. operations officer, said in an interview. "When you think back to Pearl Harbor, you can understand why. Unpleasant surprises are out there, like embassies being blown up. We finally have a very clear manifestation of a commitment that we are going to invest in intelligence. This is going to be a long-term rebuild."
The retirement of several thousand employees since 1991 has cost the C.I.A. a great deal of talent and experience. Past and present agency officials say those people left because the cold war ended and lesser missions did not interest them, because they did not like the Clinton Administration, because morale sagged as five different Directors led the C.I.A. over six years, and because of a lack of spirit, which Mr. Tenet is trying to revive.
"Does the agency have enough people on board to deal with the challenges it's facing? Not enough," said Fred Hitz, who retired after a long C.I.A. career, including eight years as inspector general. "Our stocks have been severely depleted. Trying to replace these individuals, the knowledge they took out the door, the elan and the sense of mission that they had is a very difficult problem."
An intelligence official outside the agency said that "the brain drain can be remedied," but "it's going to take five, six, seven years of steady rebuilding."
Several intelligence officials said that money was not the sole solution, but that the C.I.A. and the other intelligence services were assured of more in coming years.
"You don't want to throw money at them," one said. "But this is not a binge. This is not a one-time huge shot of money. This is an upward glide" that Congress intends to continue for years.
The overall budget for intelligence, will rise by about 7 percent, to about $29 billion, close to the figure at which it peaked during the cold war, without accounting for inflation. The money finances the C.I.A. and a dozen other intelligence services; the C.I.A. spends about a tenth of the sum.
The spending figures have traditionally been kept secret. But the increase approved today appears to be the largest since 1984, the last of four years when President Reagan's Director of Central Intelligence, William J. Casey, presided over multibillion-dollar annual spending increases, undertook scores of covert operations and hired several thousand new C.I.A. officers, "stacking people like cordwood in the corridors," in the words of another former Director, Robert M. Gates.
When Mr. Tenet became Director last year, "the C.I.A. was a place on the verge of absolute disaster," said an intelligence official outside the agency. "There was not enough money to to keep things going. Many elements of C.I.A.'s operating budget were unfunded. They had to rob other activities to run the agency."
"A great deal of the money that is going into the C.I.A. is going into the hiring and placement of good new people," this official said. "About a year ago the door into the agency was almost shut. A whole new class of people was almost put off because there wasn't money to bring them in."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The timid Japanese banking bailout just might do the job.

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
THE law the Japanese Parliament recently passed to rescue broken-down banks commits several blunders. It does not require insolvent banks to close. It does not require banks to disclose losses. It does not require wobbly banks that accept taxpayer money to lend to credit-worthy borrowers -- the primary purpose of a bailout. The obvious prediction is that Japan will remain credit-starved, dragging down other economies in Asia and beyond.
But the obvious may be wrong. The law takes the important step of injecting public money into failing banks. Despite its flaws, the measure might pry open clogged credit lines and channel money to companies in need of a fresh start. As Adam Posen of the Institute for International Economics, author of a new book on the Japanese economy, says, "The bill will succeed despite itself." 
 Japan's banks are buried in bad loans and confront an economy that has slipped into recession. Thus they are loath to lend even to reliable customers. But if banks do not lend, companies cannot invest, and the economy cannot grow.
The crisis has been worsened by an accounting system that lets banks mask losses. Fanciful financial reports have scared away investors and creditors. Worse, the phantom bookkeeping pretends that borrowers can repay impossibly big loans.
Japan needs to have its banks wipe bad loans from their books so borrowers can start fresh. To that end, the law creates three pots of public money totaling about $500 billion, more than 10 percent of Japan's annual output. America's bailout of savings and loans in the 1980's cost about 2 or 3 percent of output.
The first pot, about $150 billion, will pay off depositors at banks that close. Their assets will be transferred to a Government agency for resale to private investors, much the way the Resolution Trust Corporation worked in the United States.
The second pot, also around $150 billion, will be used to nationalize insolvent banks the Government decides to keep open. The Government will run these banks until private owners take over, mirroring the way the Roosevelt Administration handled the 1930's banking crisis.
The third, most-controversial pot has no American parallel. It will pump about $200 billion into private banks the Government deems shaky but solvent. In return, the Government will get stock. The idea is that the taxpayer money will build up the banks' capital so they can resume lending.
Daniel K. Tarullo, formerly President Clinton's top adviser on international economic policy, is unconvinced the plan will work. "There is no clear mechanism for moving the $500 billion out the door of Government and into banks," he says. "Banks have to ask for assistance. But by asking for assistance, the bank managers identify themselves as incompetent, invoke intrusive Government monitoring and put their jobs in jeopardy. That is hardly an incentive to play along."
Critics ask why the Government should bail out supposedly solvent banks. Besides, nothing in the law forces banks that take public money to write down loans to feasible levels. Mr. Tarullo points out that the ruling party has a history of letting banks serving agriculture and construction -- its core supporters -- do as they want.
The legislation is vague, critics point out, relying on bureaucrats to fill in the blanks. That might have worked fine when the finance and other ministries were all powerful. But now they are largely discredited, and the ability of the bureaucrats to discipline private markets is dubious.
The threat is that insolvent banks, operating under the cover of a bogus accounting system and a compliant Government, will limp along, draining resources from productive parts of the economy. Mr. Tarullo paints a picture of continued drift.
Perhaps, Mr. Posen says, Japan's recent past is not prologue. Yes, Parliament should have forced banks that take public money to write down old loans and use the cash to issue new loans. But, he says, there are good reasons to believe all this will happen anyway.
He argues that the discipline of international capital markets, which have largely shut off Japan's banks, will force banks to take the Government bailout. Yesterday, three major Japanese banks were reported to be preparing applications.
Mr. Posen also predicts that these banks will be forced by public pressure and new political forces to pass along cash to worthy borrowers.
He points out that the law was not written according to Japanese custom by bureaucrats in the Finance Ministry but was drafted, at the request of Cabinet officials, by a younger generation of Parliament leaders.
American officials have been clamoring for the Japanese to clean up their bank mess -- no matter how. The bailout passed by the Parliament will waste lots of taxpayer money. It will not dispense justice. It will not by itself turn the Japanese economy around -- fiscal measures will also be needed. But by throwing serious money into blocked credit lines, the law takes an essential step toward ending Japan's immediate crisis.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL BRIEFING

BYLINE: By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 

 BODY:

Democrat Is Gaining In Massachusetts Race
Democrats don't always win in Massachusetts. But mostly they do. So with less than two weeks to go to Election Day, can the Democratic candidate for governor, Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, overtake his Republican opponent, Acting Gov. Argeo Paul Cellucci?
He is closing in. 
 A month ago, Mr. Harshbarger was down 10 points or so in the polls. But now, according to the latest Boston Herald poll, he has cut that deficit in half.
Mr. Harshbarger has been hammering Mr. Cellucci hard recently, asserting in campaign advertising that the Acting Governor has yet to adequately explain how he could be some $700,000 in personal debt. Independent voters in particular appear to have responded favorably to the advertisement.
But Mr. Harshbarger still has a steep hill to climb. His voter base is shaky, with many Democrats lukewarm about his candidacy because they remember that he once politically challenged a Kennedy, and on another occasion aggressively investigated possible wrongdoing by some party members.
Equally difficult for Mr. Harshbarger, he must overcome the built-in advantage that Mr. Cellucci has as an incumbent running in economic good times. That advantage is enhanced considerably by the fact that the Acting Governor is a liberal Republican, and thus not all that ideologically different from Mr. Harshbarger.
 
Money and Message In Washington State
Going into this year's Washington State race for a United States Senate seat, many state and national Republican leaders insisted that their candidate, Representative Linda Smith of Vancouver, had a real shot at unseating the Democratic incumbent, Patty Murray. But would they put their money where their mouth is?
Not wholeheartedly, it turns out.
Ms. Smith has good conservative credentials -- strong enough, political analysts say, to guarantee her a hefty Republican vote. She also has a strong populist streak, which analysts believe will stand her well with independent voters.
But Ms. Smith is having trouble getting her message out.
Her outspoken support for campaign finance reform has come back to haunt her. Because she refuses to take many types of campaign contributions, she is running low on money and is unable to match her opponent's big television advertising campaign. The latest polls have Ms. Smith trailing by nearly 15 points.
Appeals for money to the Republican Senate Campaign Committee, run by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, an outspoken opponent of campaign finance reform, have mostly been ignored. The committee could legally give Ms. Smith up to $540,000 but has sent only $17,500, without explaining why.
Frustrated Washington State party officials last week sent word to the national party, and to Mr. McConnell, that if they were not going to help the Smith campaign they should stop all money solicitations in the state.
On Monday, Ms. Smith announced that she had just been sent $100,000 by the Republican National Committee, a gift that she gladly accepted. The national committee can accept gifts from sources that Ms. Smith will not accept gifts from. How, then, could she accept such money?
Ms. Smith said it was not an issue for her because she did not know who gave the money to the committee, and thus there could be no quid pro quo on her part.
"The ultimate hypocrisy," Senator Murray shot back.
 
G.O.P. Candidate Is Adrift in Alaska
The Alaska governor's race has taken another topsy-turvy turn, one that very well might doom whatever slim chance the Republican nominee, John Lindauer, had.
A month ago, Republican leaders in the state questioned whether the party should continue to support Mr. Lindauer, given that there were so many confusing and unanswered questions about the source of his $2 million in campaign funds. He insisted that everything was above board, and the party leaders backed off.
But questions continued to arise, with a least one Alaskan filing suit in an effort to get a more detailed answer -- or, in the absence of one, to have Mr. Lindauer thrown off the ballot. Was there or wasn't there a secret financial source, something not permitted under Alaska law?
Mr. Lindauer, a retired newspaper publisher, insisted initially that he was spending his own money. Then he said it was his wealthy wife's money. Then he said he was broke. And so on.
On Tuesday, the Republican leaders announced that the party was withdrawing its support of Mr. Lindauer because of all the confusion and contradiction.
The party chairman, Tom McKay, said Mr. Lindauer would, of course, remain on the ballot, pending any court action on the citizen's suit. But he added that the party would "rally around in a big way" should a prominent Alaska Republican step forward to start a write-in campaign.
"This is not something we're having fun doing," Mr. McKay said. "But it's necessary to preserve the Republican Party as a viable institution in Alaska politics."
If past results in Alaskan elections for governor are any indication, there is not much viability to preserve. The last time a Republican won the office was 20 years ago, and political analysts say this year's Democratic incumbent, Tony Knowles, a moderate, has few re-election concerns, particularly in light of Tuesday's decision by Republican leaders.
Mr. Lindauer, a conservative, vowed to push on.
"I didn't lie about the source of my income," he said. "The party lied that I lied."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Global Distress Takes a Toll On the Results at Citigroup

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Citigroup Inc., the world's largest financial services company, reported a 65 percent drop in third-quarter earnings yesterday, reflecting the impact of trading losses in volatile global markets this summer that offset strength in its domestic consumer businesses.
The company, created by the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Inc. at the end of last month, reported profit of $729 million, or 30 cents a diluted share, for the three months ended Sept. 30. The results were close to analysts' expectations of 29 cents a share. Comparable combined earnings from the year earlier were $2.1 billion, or 96 cents a share, excluding a restructuring charge for job cuts at Citicorp. Including the charge, combined profits fell 51 percent. 
 On Oct. 8, Citigroup estimated that it would report earnings of $700 million for the quarter after it suffered hundreds of millions of dollars of trading losses from the slump in financial markets, particularly in Russia and developing counties.
"The real message here is the global consumer business seems to be doing quite well," even as the company "absorbs the body blows on the capital markets side of the business," said Judah Kraushaar, a banking analyst at Merrill Lynch.
John Keefe, president of Keefe Worldwide, a financial services consulting firm in New York, said, "It looks like putting all this Russia, emerging markets aside, the underlying businesses are either O.K. or have yet to deteriorate."
"Behind some of these dramatic losses -- these events of biblical proportions -- are some strong businesses," Mr. Keefe said.
The leaders of Citigroup tried to take the earnings slump in stride.
"Obviously, we're disappointed with the results," Sanford I. Weill, co-chairman and co-chief executive of Citigroup, said in an interview yesterday. But, Mr. Weill added, he and his colleagues are encouraged by the continuing strong performance in their consumer businesses and by the helpful steps taken by governments in recent weeks to stabilize international markets.
Mr. Weill cited Congress's agreement to provide further financing to the International Monetary Fund; the Federal Reserve's second interest rate cut, which he said showed clear understanding of the liquidity problems in markets, and Japan's plan to inject more than $500 billion to help revive its banking system.
He said, however, "I think we're still going to have lingering problems in the fourth quarter, but they won't be of the same kind of degree as the third quarter."
Not all of the turmoil has been bad for the company, Mr. Weill added, saying that it had caused some depositors to turn to larger institutions, like Citibank, the company's bank subsidiary.
Mr. Weill also said that the combined company was well positioned to take advantage of more difficult markets. The combined firm's equity strength, he said, would "prove very useful" as Citigroup came across opportunities to expand its own businesses or acquire other companies in those markets.
At a meeting with analysts yesterday, he and his co-chairman and co-chief executive, John S. Reed, set out how they were cutting costs to reposition Citigroup for the changes in financial markets, according to some who attended. In reply to analysts' questions, the two played up the potential for revenue growth and the benefits from cross-marketing of insurance, banking and brokerage products.
The two men also told analysts that results for 1999 should look good compared with those for 1997, according to Joan S. Solotar, a banking analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, who said that the leaders had projected a 15 percent average growth rate for the next five years.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE SOUTH;
3 G.O.P. Candidates for Governor Face Trouble

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: MOBILE, Ala., Oct. 21

 BODY:
Part of the political legend of Fob James Jr., the pugnacious Republican Governor of Alabama, is that he likes to play from behind.
"Fob is a strong finisher," said Roger McConnell, the state Republican chairman. 
"He's just a fourth-quarter player," said Tom Blackerby, chairman of Conservative Christians of Alabama.
So as the clock ticks down in Mr. James's campaign for re-election, his allies are trying to convince voters -- and themselves -- that his predicament simply reflects the natural order of things. But even as the James camp brushes off poll after poll showing him trailing Lieut. Gov. Don Siegelman, other Republicans are getting nervous, and some sound downright defeatist.
"I'd be real surprised if he can pull this one out," said a prominent Republican strategist in Alabama, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Less than two weeks before the Nov. 3 election, Mr. James is not alone. In one of the surprises of this fluid election year, Republican candidates for governor are in tight races in three conservative Southern states that have voted increasingly Republican in recent years.
In South Carolina, polls have shown that the incumbent Republican, Gov. David M. Beasley, holds the thinnest of leads over his Democratic challenger, Jim Hodges, the former minority leader of the state House. And in Georgia, where Republican leaders have asserted that this will be the year they break the Democrats' 126-year lock on the Governor's office, Guy W. Millner, a Republican businessman, is running just ahead of Roy E. Barnes, a longtime Democratic legislator.
To some extent, the races hinge on local issues and dynamics, including the quality of the candidates. And the Republicans could win in all three states. But several authorities on Southern politics said today that the closeness of the races demonstrated that Southern Democrats were learning the lessons taught by their two most successful mentors, Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia and Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina.
The message, said Wayne Flynt, a historian at Auburn University in Alabama, is that there may still be enough core Democrats and swing voters in the South, including blacks and working-class whites, to reward Democrats who focus on issues like education, jobs and the economy.
"If the issues are all about social concerns, like abortion and school prayer and vouchers, Republicans win," Mr. Flynt said. "But Democrats can still succeed if they can make the case that they are the party of the common people, and that the Republicans are the party of big business and the wealthy."
Nowhere is that theory being tested more than in the Alabama race. In the last two years, Mr. James has earned a national reputation for his fervent support of school prayer and state autonomy from Federal control. But even diehard Republicans acknowledge that he has allowed Mr. Siegelman, a Democrat, to control the discourse of this campaign with a proposal for a lottery to finance education.
Four public polls taken in the first two weeks of October showed Mr. James behind by 5 to 13 percentage points. He has raised significantly less money than Mr. Siegelman and started his advertising campaign more than a month later. And Governor James has barely nicked Mr. Siegelman on what Republicans have perceived to be his most glaring liabilities, that he is too liberal for Alabama and too beholden to trial lawyers. National Republican officials consider Mr. James the most vulnerable of the 18 Republican governors seeking re-election.
In Alabama, Republican strategists are grumbling that Mr. James seems to not want his job that much, and that his seeming dispassion could hurt fellow Republicans in important races for the legislature and state Supreme Court. "There's a feeling that he's a drag on the ticket," the strategist said.
There is enough of an impression of inertia in the James campaign that its chairman, Mayor Emory Folmar of Montgomery, felt the need to energize the troops with a tough speech at a rally on Sunday.
"I haven't seen the fight in this campaign I'd like to see," Mr. Folmar was quoted in news accounts. He urged James supporters to resort to "some scratching, biting and clawing" in depicting Mr. Siegelman as a liberal.
But Mr. James has a history of making late dashes to victory, often with help from Christian conservatives whose enthusiasm does not always register in polls. In 1994, Mr. James trailed Gov. Jim Folsom by 10 percentage points in the polls with less than a week to go and came back to win by 1 percentage point. In the Republican primary this summer, he was forced into a runoff and was thought to be in peril but won by a convincing 12 percentage points.
In his race against Mr. Siegelman, Mr. James's most significant problem is the Democrat's popular lottery proposal, which would provide an estimated $150 million a year for merit-based college scholarships, pre-kindergarten programs and computers. A disciplined, if scripted, campaigner with an experienced staff, Mr. Siegelman has promoted the lottery relentlessly on the trail, in his advertising and in debates like the one here on Tuesday.
"I have proposed an education plan that will change education in this state forever," he said in that debate. "I say yes to a lottery. Fob James says no."
With the lottery a big success in two of Alabama's neighboring states, the Siegelman plan has placed Mr. James on the defensive. The Governor has responded with a three-pronged rebuttal. He has proposed a far less ambitious plan for college scholarships that would be financed with existing state money. He has argued that Mr. Siegelman will need to raise taxes to pay for his proposals, even with the lottery. And he has warned that the lottery would lead to other forms of legalized gambling.
In the last two weeks, Mr. James has run television advertisements that question Mr. Siegelman's integrity by showing his nose growing like an animated Pinocchio. One depicts a cockfight as the narrator asks, "Why should we believe Siegelman when he says that later he won't let his gambling friends sneak other games of chance into Alabama behind his lottery?"
James aides said that the campaign's polling suggests that the advertisements have narrowed the gap significantly in recent days. But it may be too late to reach swing voters like Brenda J. Crain, of Mobile, who owns a used car lot with her husband. Although she voted for Mr. James four years ago, Ms. Crain, 49, said she would vote for Mr. Siegelman this year because she agreed that Alabama should have a lottery to pay for education and because she had been embarrassed by some of Mr. James's pronouncements, like his contention that the Bill of Rights does not apply to the states.
"I'm normally a Republican so this is a hard choice," she said while shopping at the Bel Air Mall on Tuesday. "I don't think Fob James is a bad person but he's just a little more of a backwards type, and Alabama could use a better image. And with the lottery, people are going to gamble whether it's here or in Florida or Mississippi. The tax money should stay here in Alabama."
Natalie M. Davis, a political scientist at Birmingham Southern College, said that the lottery had become a wedge issue for Democrats. "We often think of wedge issues as abortion, prayer, that kind of thing," said Ms. Davis, a Democrat. "But what has happened here is that Siegelman has used the lottery to pull apart a predictable Republican constituency."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Technology Shares Help Nasdaq Market Advance Sharply

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Technology shares led the Nasdaq stock market sharply higher yesterday, while blue-chip companies saw a far more mild rise.
Paced by Microsoft, which rose 6 3/16 a share, to 106 7/16, the Nasdaq composite index climbed 2.17 percent, or 35.56 points, to 1,674.75. The Nasdaq index has surged 18 percent in the last two weeks. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.38 points, to 8,519.23, posting its sixth consecutive advance. More of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow were down than up and the average, which spent much of the day in negative territory, would have ended lower without the contribution of I.B.M.
Big Blue rose 4 13/16 a share, to 142 11/16, after reporting a 10 percent increase in third-quarter profits late Tuesday.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.99 points, to 1,069.92.
Several mergers announced recently -- the latest being the Newell Company's $5.8 billion deal yesterday for Rubbermaid -- have helped improve the climate on Wall Street lately, as has the re-emergence of credit for some borrowers.
"We're beginning to see some thawing out," said Peter J. Canelo, a domestic investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "I think we've turned the corner on the panic."
Mr. Canelo added that the options volatility index has registered distress in 23 of the latest 34 sessions, but none in the last week.
Alan Ackerman, chief strategist at Fahnestock, said that "mood, momentum and money-flow seem to be coming together" in the markets, particularly for Nasdaq stocks. In many cases, he said, those still sell for "a pittance" relative to earnings.
Some analysts suggested that the traditional year-end selling of battered stocks to establish losses for tax purposes seems to be occurring early this year, with bargain hunters already moving in to scoop up shares at their lowest prices.
Stocks are also getting a lift from generally favorable third-quarter corporate earnings, which have slightly surpassed expectations.
"We're seeing some pretty good numbers coming in," said Mary Farrell, senior strategist at Paine Webber. "The important thing is that the market continues in positive territory -- it's holding."
Treasury bond prices, which have been volatile for months as investors sought a safe haven from equities, were little changed yesterday.
Conoco's stock, being spun off by DuPont, was priced at $23 a share to raise $4.4 billion, the biggest new American issue ever in terms of dollar value. Those shares are scheduled to begin trading today.
Technology stocks, which dominate the Nasdaq index, were once again the standout performers among equities. Dell Computer rose 3 5/8, to 56 15/16; Cisco Systems climbed 3 1/2, to 57 5/8, and Intel jumped 2 1/2, to 87 1/16. Peoplesoft, though, dropped 6, to 19 3/4, following the company's projection of slower sales next year.
Among blue chips, drug stocks were strong, with shares of Merck, Eli Lilly, Schering-Plough, Warner-Lambert, and American Home Products gaining more than 2 points each.
But airline shares, prominently those in United Airlines, were lower. UAL, the parent of United, fell 3 7/16, to 62 15/16.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 745.18 million shares, with advancing issues barely outpacing decliners, 1,595 to 1,498.

Slow Session for Bonds
By Bloomberg News
 Bond prices were little changed yesterday as investors found few incentives to buy Treasury securities, with yields near three-decade lows and world markets stabilizing.
With yields already so low, "it makes it hard to believe we'll have a significant rally here," said Steve Guterman, who helps oversee $68 billion at American General Investment Management L.P.
Since the Federal Reserve surprised investors with an interest-rate cut six days ago, stocks have gained and investors have begun scouting for bargains in corporate bonds.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged at 10619/32 . The yield held steady at 5.07 percent.
Since August, when Russia devalued its currency, many investors shunned all bonds except Government-backed securities. Sales of risky securities by loss-ridden hedge funds and speculation the economy might tip into recession next year added demand for Treasury debt.
"Investors are now saying that maybe the economy isn't in such bad shape," said David Horner, a senior fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company.

HEADLINE: Outlook for Political Dynamics: More of the Same

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
As the 105th Congress cast its final legislative vote today, it stood identified less with any signature bill than with the paralysis of American politics near century's end.
For it was a year in which much of the partisan energies went into blocking initiatives, not passing them. 
 The Republicans stymied the Democrats' drive for regulation of health maintenance organizations, overhaul of campaign finance laws, and anti-tobacco legislation. And President Clinton took such a strong stand against tax cuts in the first year of a new government surplus that even Senate Republicans refused to embrace the tax-cutting fervor of their more ideological brethren in the House.
In part this represents the trade-offs of a government divided between a Democratic President and a Republican-controlled Congress. But in many ways the stalemate runs far deeper.
With the cold war gone, and the surplus changing the deficit politics that had defined the two parties for decades, Republicans and Democrats alike have been left with grappling for an agenda for the new millennium. And it is a quest that fractures both parties.
"There are all these books and articles that have been written about the end of things," said Bill Curry, a former domestic policy adviser to President Clinton, "the end of history, the end of ideology, the end of the business cycle. We're not at the end of ideology but we are at the end of the ideology of these two parties."
From the other side of the spectrum, in remarkably similar tones, Representative David M. McIntosh of Indiana, one of the conservative Republican firebrands of the House, said, "The leaders who took us into the majority, you get the sense they're coming up with stale ideas and are not focused on bringing the next agenda forward."
Both parties have been thrown off course not just by the changing times but also by the nation's antipathy to sweeping change in a period of prosperity. Mr. Clinton tried, and failed, to carry out a major overhaul of the nation's system of health care coverage early in his first term, only to see the voters turn over control of Congress to the Republicans.
Then Speaker Newt Gingrich and his fervent conservatives took their turn and tried to use a Government shutdown in 1995 to make Mr. Clinton accede to the Republican call for sweeping tax cuts and a scaling back of the Great Society programs. But a year later, their standard bearer was unable to capture the Presidency and Mr. Gingrich's House majority fell to 11 seats, one of the most precarious for either party this century.
"It's a time at which big ideas failed," said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. "Given those failures and given the fact that this is a time of relative tranquillity, it's hard to get people going on big ideas."
The response of the two parties has been a fallback to look-alike agendas and a politics of small gestures that gives neither a broad mandate.
"The ideal political place to be at the end of this millennium is to have Republican policy and Democratic language," said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. "That is the perfect place for the American people."
So in 1996 Mr. Clinton embraced the Republican idea of a balanced budget and then added grace notes on education and health care and the environment.
Going into this election, the Republicans have put forward no new Contract With America but instead are mostly running on the welfare overhaul and a balanced budget pact with a tax cut, which were the achievements of 1996 and 1997. Learning from Mr. Clinton's strategy of co-opting Republican issues, they agreed in the final spending bill of this session to $1.1 billion for new teachers in hopes of neutralizing the traditional Democratic advantage on the education issue.
Beyond that, sending his majority home to campaign with a final balloon-festooned rally, Mr. Gingrich also took credit for stopping Federal financing of needle-exchange programs for drug addicts. And in almost nostalgic tones, he said Congress had included some money for Ronald Reagan's cold-war-era dream of a Star Wars missile defense system.
But the final hours of the session put in sharp relief the fractures in the Republican Party that had haunted Congress all year, causing the House and Senate to fail to pass a budget for the first time since 1974 and costing Republicans the large $700 billion tax cut that House leaders proposed in early summer.
Conservatives took turns denouncing the Republican leadership in the final hours of the session while Mr. Gingrich fired back at his critics on the right, calling them a "perfectionist caucus" who lacked maturity. And today, he said the Republican Congress had failed to pass a major election-year tax cut "because the Senate blinked."
Of the issues looming for the next Congress, chief among them is insuring the solvency of the Social Security system for the baby boom generation. Mr. Gingrich and other House Republicans are vowing to push earlier and harder for a large tax cut. Mr. Gingrich said today that "you can be much bolder" in the year after an election.
The Democrats want to try again to regulate health maintenance organizations and overhaul campaign finance laws. And the economic turmoil in Asia and Russia could yet cause serious tremors in the American economy.
But there is little sign that the political stalemate will change. Most strategists are predicting that the November election will only reinforce the status quo and produce no large shift in the balance of power.
"People are more or less both content with national conditions and disgusted with national politics," Mr. Kohut said. "So there ain't much going on."
The struggle over whether to impeach Mr. Clinton is likely to distract him and consume much of the energy in Congress. It will also tie the President closely to the liberal Democrats who have been his strongest defenders, keeping him from being free to side with the Republican majority.
Adding to the likely polarization, Republicans may have to find other ways to placate conservative activists if they do not ultimately have the votes to remove Mr. Clinton from office.
In both parties the true battle for a new agenda is likely to come in the next Presidential race.
"The big serious political agendas are Presidential agendas," said William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, a conservative journal. "Clinton's not going to have one in 1999 and the Republican Congress isn't either. The interesting action will be in both parties in 2000."

Profits Strong at 3 Airlines, But T.W.A. Reports a Loss
Three of the country's largest airlines reported record third-quarter earnings from strong passenger traffic, the low cost of fuel and a strike at Northwest Airlines.
Earnings at American Airlines and U S Airways surpassed the expectations of Wall Street analysts, while earnings at United Airlines were slightly weaker than expected. Trans World Airlines, however, posted a surprising loss. Page C3. 

Three Oil Companies Report Losses
Shares of Texaco, the third-largest oil company, fell $2.75, or 4.48 percent, to $58.625, after it announced that earnings dropped 58 percent. Exxon, the nation's biggest oil company, said its profits declined 23 percent, and Amoco, the fifth-largest, reported its fourth consecutive quarterly loss, a reflection of the slump in oil prices that began a year ago. C8.
 
Wall Street Continues its Rally
A strong earnings report from Microsoft fueled a rally on the Nasdaq stock market, which climbed 2.17 percent, or 35.56 points, to 1,674.75. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 13.38 points, to 8,519.23, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.98 points, to 1,069.92. C9.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: CONNECTICUT;
Kennelly Regrets Calling Party Support Weak

BYLINE: By JULIAN E. BARNES 

DATELINE: DANBURY, Conn., Oct. 21

 BODY:
Repesentative Barbara B. Kennelly, who told newspaper editors yesterday that she was disappointed with the support she had received from her party during her campaign for governor, backed away from those comments today, saying that she regretted her criticism but had no regrets about entering the race.
The state Democratic Party chairman said that Mrs. Kennelly's original remarks were driven by frustration with her own fund-raising efforts. As Mrs. Kennelly's position in the polls has tumbled, her campaign has had trouble raising money. And those poll numbers fell further today as Quinnipiac College released a poll showing Mrs. Kennelly trailing Governor John G. Rowland of Connecticut by 48 points. 
 In an interview on Tuesday with the editorial boards of The Advocate of Stamford and The Greenwich Time, Mrs. Kennelly said she had been "naive" and should have been more realistic about her chances to defeat Mr. Rowland. She also criticized the Democratic State Central Committee and its chairman, Edward L. Marcus, saying they had failed to raise money for herself and other Democratic candidates.
At a news conference here, Mrs. Kennelly said she regretted "criticizing anyone" during her meeting with the editorial boards. But in an interview earlier in the day her campaign manager, Jonathan W. Pelto, said the party needed to do more to help its nominees. "Whatever the outcome on Nov. 3, it's clear the Democratic Party needs to do more to rebuild its infrastructure and support its candidates," Mr. Pelto said.
According to the most recent financial disclosure statements, filed three weeks before the election, Mr. Rowland has $2.17 million on hand and Mrs. Kennelly has $348,000. Mr. Marcus said he had personally raised and donated $40,000 to Mrs. Kennelly's campaign.
But he added that the party's central committee, which organizes get-out-the-vote drives, could barely pay its bills, much less give money to candidates. Mr. Marcus said the party had not given money to an individual candidate since 1966. "It's a miracle we have been able to stay out of debt," Mr. Marcus said. Mrs. Kennelly's father, John M. Bailey, ran the state Democratic Party from 1946 to 1975, when the parties had a bigger role in getting their candidates elected.
The new poll, conducted from Oct. 13 to Oct. 19, showed Mr. Rowland leading Mrs. Kennelly 72 percent to 24 percent among likely voters. The survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.8 percent for likely voters, according to the poll's director, Douglas Schwartz.
Mr. Rowland, in an interview with the Connecticut Radio Network, said his strong showing in the polls reflected the strength of the economy, support for his administration's policies, and problems with Mrs. Kennelly's campaign.
"I think people are generally happy with the direction of the state, happy with their leadership and that is reflected in the polls," he said. The Quinnipiac College poll found that 83 percent of registered voters were satisfied with general conditions in Connecticut.
Mrs. Kennelly was in Danbury to criticize Mr. Rowland's proposal last year to cut rail service along the Danbury, Waterbury and Shoreline East lines. The candidate, who has said in the past that polls are important, said she was ignoring the new poll and concentrating on the election.
She said she did not regret entering the race. "I ran for the right reasons," she said, "to make sure Connecticut was first again in educating all its children, in having a good environment, and first in having a good transportation system."

To Aid Players, Agents Ponder Forming League

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
Fed up with unfruitful negotiations with owners and fearing a work stoppage that could last into 1999, agents for National Basketball Association players are looking into economic alternatives, including exhibition games and even creating their own league.
The discussion came during a meeting of the agents' advisory council in Las Vegas, Nev., yesterday, where more than 20 player agents and 11 N.B.A. players gathered for nearly four hours. Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, also announced that it planned to organize exhibition games until the lockout is settled. 
 Patrick Ewing, the union president, will lead a meeting today that will be open to all players at Caesars Palace. From superstars like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Karl Malone to the journeymen Marty Conlon and Muggsy Bogues, about 200 players were expected to attend as the union tries to show a united front during the lockout.
Several agents predicted yesterday that there would be a dispute among the players over whether the players should decertify the union and risk a prolonged court battle with the N.B.A. Although decertification came up in the meeting, neither the players nor the owners gave it much credence at this point.
"I thought we'd be fighting, but it was the most harmonious agents meeting I've ever been to," said Bill Duffy, one of the 19 members of the union's agents advisory committee. "The deal the league has offered us is so bad there wasn't even a need to discuss it."
The meeting came two days after the union lost a ruling on its guaranteed contracts before John D. Feerick, the arbitrator who determined that the owners need not pay any players during the lockout. The decision affects 226 players with guaranteed contracts, which together total nearly $800 million in value.
Because of the ruling, the agents discussed alternative sources of income for players who may struggle financially.
All players are due to receive $25,000 checks Nov. 15 as part of the league's group licensing agreement, and Ewing said many of the wealthiest players would pass on those checks for one year, with lower-salaried players getting an extra $25,000.
"We plan to announce to the players that we're going to be in a position to provide financial support to those ballplayers who need it," Hunter said. "We intend to, with the assistance of many of the agents, put on games. So as long as the lockout continues, we intend to put on some games to help raise funds."
Hunter said an exhibition game tomorrow in Houston had already sold out a 10,000-seat arena at the University of Houston. Another game with many high-profile players was being planned for Las Vegas, perhaps to be televised on pay-per-view, and a third game was being planned for Japan.
Lines of credit have been obtained from two banks, Hunter said, and other professional sports unions have pledged loans.
The league has approved players' earning a living outside the N.B.A. until the lockout is settled.
"Of course, they're doing so entirely at their own risk," said Jeff Mishkin, the league's chief legal counsel. "If they injured themselves and were not able to play basketball, they're at risk of having their contracts terminated."
The players and the agents are also looking at an even more ambitious idea, the formation of a new league. A four- or five-person committee has scheduled a meeting for this morning to discuss economic alternatives for the players, said Marc Fleisher, an agent.
"It's in the very early stages," he said, "but we're ready to start talking to potential owners, broadcasters, investors, anybody out there that might make sense."
The possibility of an alternative to the N.B.A. for this season is remote, but several player agents did not discount the potential for next season. The idea was contingent on the league canceling the entire season.
"For the first time, there was serious discussion about the possibility that the whole season could be lost," said Steve Kauffman, an agent. "I don't think many of us believed that before. But with the way the owners have been behaving, it's now something we have to discuss and prepare for."
According to two agents, David Falk, the agent for Jordan and several other superstars, said he would approach Jordan to see whether he would be interested in such a venture as a new league.
"Well, Michael's going to be here tomorrow, so let's ask him about it," Falk said in the meeting, according to the agents.
"If Michael is involved, I'd bet it would work," one agent said.
Meanwhile, owners and players are not scheduled to meet for their next bargaining session until next week. Because representatives from all 29 teams' owners will be in New York next Wednesday for the league's board of governors meeting, the next talks could come as early as Tuesday.
At yesterday's agents' meeting, the subject of the owners' resolve was brought up often. Several players' agents, on condition of anonymity, said that NBC's relationship with the league was discussed at length. Along with TNT, the network signed a $2.6 billion deal with the N.B.A. in the fall of 1997, an agreement that guaranteed the owners $500 million in rights fees for this season.

Nomura May Trim Up to 2,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By Bridge News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Japan's Nomura Securities Company plans a major job cut worldwide because of a substantial net loss for the six months ended Sept. 30, Kyodo news service quoted company sources as saying.
About 1,000 to 2,000 employees are expected to be dismissed, including workers at its United States and British units, which have suffered huge losses from the Russian financial crisis and real estate-linked securities. 
 Nomura, Japan's biggest brokerage house, is expected to make an official announcement of the job cuts along with its audited financial results for the second and third quarters on Thursday.
The United States and British subsidiaries are estimated to have suffered some $350 million in losses on their Russian Government portfolios. The American unit is also believed to have posted around $1 billion in losses related to loans to real estate companies.
Nomura Securities is expected to report a net loss of 200 billion yen ($1.5 billion) because of its overseas losses as well as 33.7 billion yen in evaluation losses on its Japanese securities holdings, which have been hurt by slumping Japanese share prices.
Nomura Securities is expected to lay off a large number of employees at the United States and British subsidiaries, which employ 3,000 workers. In Japan, where it employs 10,000 workers, Nomura will curb new recruitment and urge early retirement.

HEADLINE: Teachers in Miami Are to To Be Offered Edison Project Stock

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Stock options are usually reserved for high-paid executives or employees of high-tech start-up companies. But teachers in the for-profit Edison Project school in Miami will begin receiving them under a program believed to be the first of its kind.
The move was announced yesterday by the Miami Dade Public Schools, the teachers' union there and the Edison Project, the private company that runs one of Miami's public elementary schools and four dozen others around the country. 
 The move comes at a time of growing interest nationwide in finding new ways to reward teachers. Edison, a privately held start-up company that expects to go public in the next few years, provides a way for teachers and other school employees to benefit in the company's potential success. It gives them the right to buy stock at a relatively low price, no matter how high it might go.
"The basic idea is to give teachers a broader sense of ownership in the enterprise in which they are the key professionals," said Benno C. Schmidt Jr., Edison's chairman. "They are not giving up anything, but we want them to participate if Edison does well."
Pat Tornillo, executive vice president of the United Teachers of Dade, local 1974 of the American Federation of Teachers, applauded the new plan, calling it "the first time in the history of American education that teachers have become direct economic stakeholders in the public schools where they work."
"It's about time," Mr. Tornillo added.
Allan Odden, an expert in teacher compensation at the University of Wisconsin, said performance awards for teachers had begun to be offered in school districts around the country, including ones in Kentucky and North Carolina.
"This is a 90's phenomenon," Mr. Odden said.
But while he applauded such incentives, he said it was too early to say whether they would improve education.
Under Edison's Miami program, full-time staff members will have the right, though not the obligation, to buy Edison shares at a set "exercise" price during a 10-year period. Edison's board has said the stock price under the options would be no more than $6.15 a share.
If the stock price rises above that amount, the value of the options will rise, giving school employees a profit. If the stock price remains below the exercise price, the options will be worthless, but employees would not need to use them. Generally, companies set their stock option prices at levels that are expected to generate profits for those who hold them.

TENNECO CUTS 1,000 JOBS, TRIMMING WORK FORCE BY 2%

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Tenneco Inc. said yesterday that it would cut 1,000 jobs, or about 2 percent of its work force. Tenneco, based in Greenwich, Conn., and the third-largest United States packaging company, said it would step up cost-cutting measures, resulting in a fourth-quarter pretax charge of $95 million to $105 million. The maker of Monroe auto parts and Walker mufflers also said it recorded an 11 percent drop in third-quarter earnings because of weakening demand for its replacement auto parts. Third-quarter earnings, excluding a gain, fell to $93 million, or 56 cents a diluted share, from $105 million, or 62 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had expected Tenneco to earn 64 cents.

DEERE TO CUT 300 JOBSIN RESPONSE TO SLUGGISH DEMAND

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
Deere & Company, North America's largest farm equipment maker, said yesterday that it was laying off more than 300 employees, or about 4 percent of its 7,700 agricultural equipment production employees, in response to lower demand. The company, which last month warned that sluggish demand for farm equipment would hurt fourth-quarter profits, said the layoffs would affect workers at its Waterloo, Iowa, foundry and the East Moline, Ill., Harvester Works. Deere, based in Moline, said it was also offering $10,000 early retirement packages to 1,400 eligible employees. The company said its forecast had not changed and that the layoffs were a step to follow up on its earnings warning from last month, not a sign of new weakness.

Computer Associates Plans L.I. Expansion

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Computer Associates International, the fourth-largest software company in the United States, said yesterday it would add 1,000 jobs within the next year as it expands its headquarters in Islandia, N.Y.
Computer Associates now has 2,300 employees, or 20 percent of its worldwide work force, on Long Island. The company said it expected to have more than 8,000 employees there within the next 10 years. 
 Computer Associates said the expansion would result in more high-technology jobs at the company and might attract more technology firms to the area.
The company's expansion plans include new office space, areas for research and development, a training center, a food court, a fitness center and a larger child-care center.
"Thanks to New York's new economic policies, we are confident that Computer Associates will continue its expansive growth well into the next century right here on Long Island," Charles B. Wang, the company's chairman, said in a statement.
Computer Associates, which makes software that runs computer systems, had sales of $4.7 billion in the year ended in March.

More Connecticut Jobless

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Unemployment in Connecticut rose to 3.9 percent in September, an increase of four-tenths of a percentage point from August, and the state lost 10,600 jobs, the State Department of Labor reported.
Salvatore DiPillo, the state's labor statistics supervisor, said on Tuesday that two-thirds of the job loss was a temporary result of the strike by Southern New England Telephone workers. 
 The largest job losses were reported in transportation, communications and utilities (6,500), services (2,500) and manufacturing (1,800).
Nonfarm jobs totaled 1,639,300 in September, up 17,600 from a year ago. The employment rate was down one percentage point from September 1997.
In September, average hourly wages were up 28 cents from August's figure to $15, not seasonally adjusted, and up 38 cents over the year.

U.S. Splurging on Energy After Falling Off Its Diet

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

DATELINE: ARVADA, Colo.

 BODY:
Twenty-five years after an oil embargo proved that fuel supplies were neither reliable nor endlessly cheap, the United States has given up almost all the gains it made in conserving energy. On average, Americans have returned to consuming nearly as much energy as ever before.
From 1973, when Arab oil producers choked off their shipments to the United States, through 1983, the nation reduced its energy consumption even as the population and economy expanded. Prodded by higher costs and led on conservation crusades by Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter, Americans learned to do more with less. 
 That effort is still yielding great benefits. Owners of older buildings and homes installed thicker insulation and tighter windows. As technology improved, every new home, factory and car came with far more efficient appliances, machines and engines than in the 1970's. But energy demand has risen so much since the mid-1980's that, next year, the Energy Department predicts, consumption per person will come to within 2 percent of the peak in 1973, before any of these energy-saving advances had begun.
Declining energy prices -- now lower in real terms than before the first embargo -- have made the difference. In the dollar-a-gallon era, why spend much time or money saving a gallon or a watt?
Evidence of the more energy-intensive life style is everywhere. Since the early 1970's, as the average household has shrunk by a sixth, the average new home has grown by a third. Even moderately priced homes are now stuffed with energy-hungry features, from central air-conditioning to Jacuzzis and security systems.
Look at families like T. C. and Michael McCracken and their year-old daughter, Lydia. The McCrackens, avid hikers, are far more willing than most Americans to shop for energy-saving appliances or ride the bus to work. But here in Arvada, outside Denver, standard features of their nearly completed tract home include ceilings so high that overhead fans, finding a new season and purpose, are required in winter to blow rising heat back down. With 2,600 square feet to fill, Mr. McCracken plans to install a home office, a home theater and a home brewery fed by its own gas line. What Mrs. McCracken calls a "killer kitchen" has all the standard appliances and the electrical capacity for more than a dozen others, plus room to seat a family of 10.
Energy use is rising even faster on the roads. Next year, Americans are expected to burn more fuel per person than in 1973, before the Government set mileage standards. More families have two earners, and the suburbs continue to sprawl, so Americans are driving more than ever. As for fuel economy, the growing popularity of light trucks -- minivans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks -- has begun to reverse two decades of gains.
The daily hour to hour and a half that Mrs. McCracken, a personnel manager, has spent commuting and running errands in her Dodge Caravan minivan will stretch by another half-hour once she moves. And Mr. McCracken will put more miles on his sport utility vehicle, an Isuzu Rodeo.
Corporate habits are going the same way. Businesses saved more energy than individuals did through the mid-1980's but have used the most extra energy ever since. Chemical producers, among the heaviest energy users, say that in the 1990's they have all but quit making improvements solely to save energy. Electric utilities are cutting reimbursements for installing more efficient heating, cooling, lighting and other equipment at work and at home.
Cheap, abundant energy has in fact produced great benefits, fueling an era of rising standards of living and dormant inflation. Lower demand from Asia has pushed oil prices down even further lately, with shortages unlikely for years.
Growing energy demand is a natural result. But it conflicts with the nation's declared goals of reducing dependence on imported oil and lowering carbon dioxide emissions, thought to cause global warming. It also requires the nation and its oil companies to spend billions of dollars laying pipelines through unstable regions, building drilling platforms in deep seas and defending foreign supplies.
Clearly, the nation relies more than ever on overseas oil. Imports account for a record 50 percent of consumption, up from 35 percent in 1973. Though a rising share comes from secure neighbors like Mexico and Venezuela, the United States still gets about 10 percent of its oil from the Persian Gulf, twice the level in 1973.
The rising use of fossil fuels has also raised the atmosphere's level of carbon dioxide. The Clinton Administration pledged at a conference in Kyoto, Japan, last December to cut these emissions. That is not a simple task, said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. "Environmental concerns point one way and prices point the other way," he said.
President Clinton is now striving to put energy efficiency back on the nation's agenda. He asked Congress for $6.3 billion over five years, including $3.6 billion in tax incentives and $2.7 billion for research. Accelerating the introduction of electric cars and other technologies would make energy savings nearly painless, he argues. Administration officials note that improving technology has already allowed Americans to live better with far less energy than they would otherwise use. Since the mid-1980's, however, these advances have slowed.
Many corporate executives and members of Congress call global warming a distant peril with uncertain causes. They portray the Administration's plans as a costly threat to the nation's prosperity. They also discount the danger of rising imports, saying that free markets will relieve high prices or tight supplies by promoting increased output and efficiency. In a compromise, Congress allowed $202 million of the $473 million for research this year but nothing for tax incentives.
It was 25 years ago this month, and again in late 1978, that vengeful Middle Eastern oil exporters squeezed their supplies to the United States and raised prices worldwide. A nation that was virtually self-sufficient into the 1950's had become a petroleum captive. Gasoline prices soared, lines at the pump stretched beyond frustration and the economy fell into repeated recessions.
Americans turned down their thermostats and bought fuel-efficient Hondas, Datsuns and Toyotas. At work, they replaced millions of inefficient motors, lighting fixtures and generators. President Nixon called for a national effort on the scale of the making of the atomic bomb.
"Let us set as our national goal," he said, "with the determination of the Manhattan Project, that by the end of this decade we will have developed the potential to meet our own energy needs without depending on any foreign energy source."
President Carter, wearing a sweater in a televised speech to drive home his point, termed energy conservation the equivalent of fighting a war.
But traumatic memories of oil shocks have long been soothed by plentiful, low-cost supplies. At about $1 a gallon -- compared with $1.10, adjusting for inflation, in 1973 -- fuel is as cheap as ever. United States gasoline prices remain less than half those in Europe and Japan, where energy is heavily taxed. Americans consume more than twice as much energy per person as Europeans or the Japanese.
The Energy Information Administration predicts that, in the absence of efforts to curb growing energy use, carbon emissions from burning fuel will rise 33 percent from 1990 to 2010, while the President has pledged to lower them by 7 percent. The agency's experts scoff at the prospects of meeting that goal unless prices rise significantly.
"If you look at our actions rather than words, it's evident we don't care," said Dwight K. French, a specialist on consumption trends. "Only the next crisis will again make conservation a priority. End of discussion."
 
On the Home Front
More Square Feet And 'Vampires'
Here in Arvada, in the subdivisions carved into the sagebrush hills of Denver's suburbs, the McCrackens' new home will have far more efficient heating, air-conditioning and major appliances than the homes of 25 years ago. Modern weatherstripping and vinyl-sealed windows will help keep the Colorado cold out and the heat in. In energy consumption per square foot, the home of the late 1990's is the winner.
But not the overall champion. Since the early 1970's, the average size of a new home has risen to 2,100 square feet from 1,600, even as the average household has shrunk to 3 people from 3.6. "It's almost like the trend to sport utility vehicles," said Donn D. Eley, chief financial officer of Village Homes, the McCrackens' builder. "They can't build them big enough."
Home builders are also bringing to tract homes the expansive features once reserved for mansions. "Wow factors," they are called in the trade. In the $150,000-to-$300,000 range, the confined quarters of yesteryear just won't do.
Larger homes with fewer people but more things to plug in have pushed home energy consumption back to the levels of the 1970's. Residential energy consumption per person fell by a tenth from 1973 to 1983 but has since risen about as much.
Tighter Federal standards for homes and major appliances promise to save enough energy over the coming years to offset what goes to heat and cool larger homes. But then come the computers, videocassette recorders, dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers that have been using about 5 percent more energy a year since 1990. Early in the next decade, the Energy Department predicts, such appliances will consume even more energy than heating.
Many of these devices are always on, ready at the push of a button. Razors and electric toothbrushes have chargers, fax machines are poised to send and receive, televisions and videocassette recorders merely go dormant, not off.
Together, these items use more power than a refrigerator. "They're called vampires," said Arthur H. Rosenfeld, a senior adviser for efficiency at the Energy Department. "They suck electricity."
Central air-conditioning, in less than 40 percent of new homes in 1971, is now in more than 80 percent. Dishwashers have gone from luxuries, found in 19 percent of households in 1970, toward necessities, found in 57 percent as of 1996.
The standard ceiling height has risen to nine feet from eight, meaning more space to heat and cool. "Even though the efficiency of larger homes has improved," said Gopal Ahluwalia, research director for the National Association of Home Builders, "the total volume, the use of glass, the fireplaces and the appliances lead to higher energy consumption. They will not buy a home without these energy-inefficient features."
As Coloradans who believe weekends were made for hiking and cross-country skiing, the McCrackens, trim 31-year-olds, say they would like to live greener. To save water and energy, they plan to pay about $300 extra for a high-efficiency washer and dryer. Mr. McCracken has even joined the declining 5 percent of Americans who ride mass transit -- for him a bus -- to his job as a consultant and programmer for I.B.M.
But their new house, like many today, is another story. Join the McCrackens in the Wyndham Park subdivision as they open the door to a 2,600-square-foot model home like the one they are buying nearby for $270,000. A towering entryway and its clerestory windows tilt their gazes upward. The two-story, 21-foot spaces continue on into the living room and the family room.
"What I love about this is the high ceilings," Mrs. McCracken volunteered. "I know they are terribly inefficient. But it does make it seem so spacious."
Her husband was nodding as Jack Zelkin, a senior marketing executive with the builder, listed the features. Mr. McCracken was already making plans to take advantage of the upgraded phone, cable and data wiring, for internal video and computer networks, that became standard a year ago, even in homes costing less than $150,000.
Saving energy has become a dormant issue, said Mr. Zelkin, who was once an energy-efficiency expert for the local utility.
"I'm a tree-hugging, granola-eating, environmental zealot," he said. "But if you give these buyers a choice between a Jacuzzi tub or extra insulation, they'll take the Jacuzzi tub every time."
 
On the Road
Traveling Farther, And Less Efficiently
Americans are not only living in spacious new homes. They're also living in their cars.
From her home in Lakewood, another Denver suburb, Mrs. McCracken has driven her minivan about 20 minutes to Golden to drop off her daughter at day care. Then it is 10 minutes back to her office in Lakewood, at Harveys Wagon Wheel Hotel/Casino. Or, a couple of times a week, she drives 20 minutes to the casino itself in Central City.
After work, Mrs. McCracken reverses the pattern, often adding a stop at the King Soopers grocery store, the Blockbuster video store or the cleaner's.
From her new house, it will be 15 minutes more each way, meaning that she will spend up to two hours in the car every day.
Tens of millions of T. C. McCrackens who have entered the work force have become a prime factor pushing energy use for travel up 12 percent for each American since 1983, back to the previous peak in 1978. In 1975, only 47 percent of American women with children younger than 18 were working or looking for work. By 1997, it was 72 percent.
Many households have almost enough cars to create their own traffic jams. Nearly one in five households has three or more cars, up from about one in 25 in 1969.
Commuters of both sexes also live farther from work. The average commuting distance grew by more than a third from 1983 to 1995, to 11.6 miles, even as car-pooling and the use of mass transit declined.
While covering more miles, Americans are getting fewer miles per gallon now that they are buying nearly equal numbers of cars and light trucks. Back in 1975, light trucks accounted for only a fifth of sales.
Cars are meanwhile becoming more powerful. Auto makers that once concentrated on building leaner, more efficient models have instead been adding the muscle that customers crave. Average horsepower has risen to 156 in 1996 from 99 in 1982 -- and the time needed to zoom from zero to 60 has fallen to 10.7 seconds from 14.4. And as speed limits have increased, those cars are using still more energy.
As vice president for operations at A.A.A. Colorado, Vickie W. Stark's job is to encourage travel. But even she decided she was spending too much time behind the wheel.
Her husband, a computer network manager, had followed her in assignments from Washington to Florida to Cheyenne, Wyo., where they bought a home north of town. When Ms. Stark got a job in Denver in 1995, he refused to budge.
And so Ms. Stark began driving more than two hours each way, or 127 miles, not counting her monthly one-day round trips to each of six offices elsewhere around the state.
A few months after she began the long haul from Cheyenne, Ms. Stark made a habit of calling her husband and two children on her car phone just as she was passing the exit for Windsor, Colo., the halfway point. "If we lived here, I'd be home," she always said.
In September 1996, they moved again -- to Windsor. As a family, they did not save any driving, but they did redistribute it. Her husband now has a 52-mile trip north, and Ms. Stark a 63-mile trip south.
All Ms. Stark has sacrificed by moving are bragging rights to the longest trip to work. Her neighbors next door and just across the street also work in Denver.
 
In the Factory
Energy Conservation A Lower Priority
Three times a week, 100-car trains more than a mile long arrive brimming with coal at the Celanese Ltd. chemical plant near Pampa in the Texas Panhandle. The trains dump their contents into chutes that form a pile 10 stories high. Coal dust dances in the flatland winds.
The coal is burned to boil water, providing the heat for producing chemicals like acetic acid, which is used in clothing fibers and plastic parts. The plant also uses enough electricity to power a city of more than 50,000. In one of the most energy-hungry industries, Pampa makes chemicals that are twice as energy intensive per pound as the Celanese average.
The plant, which opened in 1952, initially treated energy as if it were as cheap and plentiful as the air. Steam and heat were simply vented.
The oil embargoes of the 1970's brought a new outlook. Steam used in one process was rerouted to other processes. As a result, Pampa and other Celanese plants raised their energy efficiency 2 percent to 3 percent a year through the 1980's.
But in the 1990's, with lower energy prices reducing the payoffs, they have improved at less than half those rates, if at all. "The emphasis is simply elsewhere these days," said Thomas Parker Jr., managing director for tax policy and energy at the Chemical Manufacturers Association.
Across all businesses, industrial and commercial energy use fell 18 percent from 1973 to 1983, then jumped 37 percent by 1997. The growing corporate appetite for energy comes despite the economy's shift from smokestack industries like steelmaking to software and entertainment.
Managers in many industries say they achieved the easiest savings long ago. "We picked the low-hanging fruit first, in the 70's and 80's," emphasized Edward E. Quick, the environmental manager for Celanese. "As we move into the 1990's, we're finding the available technology much more costly."
Amory B. Lovins, whose Rocky Mountain Institute promotes energy efficiency, will hear none of it. He rattles off a half-dozen technologies like computerized controls that he says the chemical plants have failed to adequately exploit. "When the Celanese guys say you're running out of low-hanging fruit, the only thing I can say, based on the experience of people in this industry, is that the fruit is bushing up around our ankles."
Riley R. Kothmann, who runs the Pampa plant, has some ready answers. His tour includes a room where walls of dials and meters have been succeeded by banks of computer screens and controls.
But at times, it seems, fruit from higher branches drops on plant supervisors' heads. Even without reaching for energy savings, they find, the savings often land on them.
Compelled by law to contain emissions, Pampa's technicians found that those emissions could go back through a turbine to raise the plant's electricity production by nearly 10 percent. Or there was the time three or four years ago when managers began wrapping insulation around the joints where pipes are bolted together. "Pampa just had a tradition of not doing it," Mr. Kothmann said. "It's so much easier to continue doing things the way you used to."
To meet the goals of the Kyoto treaty for reducing emissions, Celanese executives say they would have to improve their energy efficiency by 3 percent a year through 2010, or as rapidly as in the 70's and 80's. All the technology they know of cannot meet that goal unless they cut production, said R. David Damron, the company's director for Government affairs. If Washington insists, he said, "you're going to stifle growth."
Celanese is still hedging. In early June, a company energy committee was assigned to find ways of meeting the goals, whatever the costs. The next step will probably be to find ways of doing the suggested projects at manageable costs. Mr. Kothmann, a member of the committee, recalls that environmental controls expected to cost $800 million a few years ago were delivered for less than $300 million. "Our experience has shown that we can achieve much more for much less than we anticipated it costing us," he said.
Energy use is rising in corporate offices as well as plants. Like homes, they have far more efficient heating, lighting and cooling, but also far more electronics.
Electric utilities have cut their support for installing more efficient equipment to $1.9 billion in 1996 from $2.7 billion in 1994. They say they cannot afford these programs in the competitive new era of deregulation.
Consolidated Edison, which serves New York City and most of Westchester County, cut its efficiency program to $31 million last year from $125 million in 1993 and has now eliminated it. Customers had been rewarded for deeds like installing more efficient appliances and compact fluorescent light bulbs instead of standard incandescents.
In its place, Con Ed, with state backing, plans to spend $25 million to $30 million a year on programs including low-cost loans for companies to develop more efficient electrical products and incentives to help them sell these products more cheaply.
"For less of an incentive per light bulb, appliance or motor, you can get a lot more in energy savings," contended Stephen Pertusiello, the company's program manager for market transformation.
But Peter A. Bradford, the chairman of the New York State Public Service Commission from 1987 to 1995, said Con Ed's case was at best uncertain. "You are replacing a known and proven set of programs with speculation," he said.
 
In the Political Arena
Calls for Action Face Challenges
Presidents going back to Richard Nixon have tried to arrest the nation's growing energy use. In the face of the 1973 oil embargo, he urged the nation to turn down its thermostats, form car pools and more. He announced that December that the lights on the national Christmas tree would be kept off. The next month, he signed the Emergency Highway Conservation Act, setting a speed limit of 55 miles an hour.
The first fuel-efficiency standards for cars took effect in 1975, requiring the average to double, to 27.5 miles a gallon, over a decade. By 1977, Jimmy Carter was promoting the search for renewable sources of energy like sunlight, wind, wood and wastes. He called his conservation campaign "the moral equivalent of war."
Then, in 1978 and 1979, another round of production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, compounding shortages caused by American price controls and regional allocations, brought the gas lines back. More than half the nation's gas stations were closed during the first summer weekend in 1979.
As gasoline climbed by 1981 to $2.05 a gallon in today's dollars, the nation began its most successful peacetime conservation effort. Americans used 43 percent less energy for every dollar of gross domestic product in 1986 than at the peak in 1972. From 1987 through last year, energy use per dollar of output declined by only an additional 8 percent.
By the mid-1980's, OPEC was in disarray and energy prices had declined. President Ronald Reagan cut back conservation and renewable-energy programs. The rural speed limit was raised to 65 miles an hour.
This decade brought a reminder that foreign oilfields have their risks. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 provoked a stock market selloff and a run-up in energy costs that contributed to the decade's only recession, the third in a row that came after oil supplies were pinched.
President Clinton, taking office in 1993, asked Congress to raise taxes on all fuels, including coal, by the equivalent of a dime a gallon. He got 4.3 cents on motor fuels only. In 1995, Congress repealed the national speed limits, and most states set their own at 65, 70 or even 75.
Over the last year, President Clinton has sought to make energy efficiency a renewed national priority. But to keep down the costs of reducing emissions, the United States plans to achieve only about a quarter of the required reductions itself. The trading of emissions rights would allow America to pay other nations to achieve the rest.
At home, the White House wants to promote advances in electric cars, renewable energy and the like. "My gut is, we will see the introduction of these new technologies very quickly," said Ernest Moniz, the Under Secretary of Energy, whose responsibilities include the efficiency programs. With much of the technology already available, he said, "We're not waiting for some magic bullet."
Republicans in Congress have portrayed the Kyoto accord as a dangerous effort to shape energy policy by raising false environmental fears. It leaves out developing nations, they say, and by requiring drastic energy savings, it threatens the United States with job losses resulting from much higher costs than the Administration acknowledges. Chuck Hagel, the Nebraska Republican who led the Senate's delegation to Kyoto, says that for all the risks of growing dependence on imported oil, "The answer is not just to say we're going to lower everybody's standard of living."
In the face of such opposition, President Clinton has not yet sought Senate ratification, saying that he, too, wants to include developing nations. But Europe and Japan are clamoring for the United States to take action, and the Administration has promised to submit the treaty next year.
Conservation is now so unpopular that its advocates shun the label. "Use the term efficiency," said Mr. Lovins at his Rocky Mountain Institute headquarters in Old Snowmass, Colo. "Conservation to a third of Americans means doing less, worse or without. It means privation, discomfort and curtailment."
If the cause of energy conservation has a last, remote redoubt, it is his stone-and-glass compound 7,100 feet high on the western flanks of the Continental Divide. There, he shows off an indoor tropical forest, luxriant with pink and yellow bougainvillea and a banana tree that has yielded 26 crops. Despite temperatures as low as 47 degrees below zero, he has no heating bills and no furnace. Instead, he has triple weatherstripping and heat-trapping windows and walls.
Technological efficiencies, or what Mr. Lovins calls negawatts, can capture energy far more cheaply, in his view, than spending billions to build more power plants or produce more oil from remote or politically volatile regions.
With energy prices so low, however, some in Washington say that high demand is only a sign that free markets are working in everyone's best interests. "Those who have an energy fetish argue that saving energy is more important than saving money or time," said Fred L. Smith, president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute there. Low energy prices allow more people to afford air-conditioning and cars, he says. "If we raise the price of energy, we will push some people back onto the buses."
But just as open-heart surgery is far more traumatic than regular exercise and a low-fat diet, other experts say that an abrupt response to another oil shock or environmental crisis could make the earlier discipline of gradual energy savings seem mild.
For Joseph J. Romm, who until recently ran the Energy Department's efficiency programs, it is only a question of when the nation will return to conservation, not if. Contending that the world's oil supplies will eventually tighten and temperatures rise, he said, "Ten years or 15 years from now, people will be desperate to take action."

"Erasing the Gains"
An Arab oil embargo 25 years ago compelled the United States to make conservation a priority. Now, after several oil crises, energy is once again cheap. The average American uses about as much as before the first embargo.
 
1973 -- The Arab oil embargo, begun during the Yom Kippur War, demonstrates OPEC's power. A new era of scarcity, favoring oil producers, begins. Oil prices eventually quadruple.
 
1974-75 -- To conserve energy, Congress approves a speed limit of 55 miles an hour and enacts fuel-efficiency standards.
 
1979-80 -- Revolution in Iran and Iran's war with Iraq limits oil shipments, sending prices up.
 
1986 -- OPEC's production quotas fail in the face of weak demand. Oil exporters flood the market and prices collapse. The oil industry begins a sharp contraction. But lower prices encourage greater consumption.
 
1990-91 -- The Persian Gulf war begins with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, a threat to Saudi Arabia as well. Oil prices jump, contributing to a global recession.
 
1997-98 -- The world economic crisis reduces oil demand. Prices, adjusted for inflation, fall in the summer of 1998 to 25-year lows.

"Different Places, Different Paces"
Energy costs in the United States are much lower than in Europe or Japan, which helps explain why Americans consume far more energy per person than the Japanese or Europeans. Even though the United States has made greater gains in efficiency, improvement has slowed in the 1990's and its economy uses energy much more inefficiently than other industrial nations.

"Living Larger"
In the 1990's, environmentalism has been a favored cause. But Americans are using almost as much energy as ever before. Homes are larger, requiring more energy to heat, cool and run more appliances. On the road, fuel consumption is rising even faster. Industry is also using more energy, but thanks to big efficiency gains in the 1980's, it is still consuming less than two decades ago after adjusting for growth in output.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: NEW JERSEY;
Democrat in Lead as Interest in Scandal Cools

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
There were days, not long ago, when it looked as though United States Representative Steven R. Rothman's Congressional race in New Jersey's Ninth District might turn into a referendum on President Clinton's libido.
Mr. Rothman, a first-term Democrat, is a member of the House Judiciary Committee and was one of a handful of representatives selected as targets by the National Republican Congressional Committee, which hoped that the aftershocks of the Clinton scandal might topple vulnerable legislators. 
 After Kenneth W. Starr's report was released in August and President Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony was released on Sept. 17, Mr. Rothman found himself besieged with constituents' questions about Mr. Clinton's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky and about the impeachment hearings.
"People would come up and ask me about it on the street, when I went to the supermarket, at my children's soccer games," said Mr. Rothman, 46, a divorced father of two.
But as the frenzy of summer faded into the fall, interest in the scandal has cooled. Polls of voters across the country have shown that Mr. Clinton's troubles are not considered an important issue in local elections.
In fact, some Democrats around the country are having success defending the President. Former Representative Jay Inslee, a Democrat running for a Congressional seat in Washington State, has been gaining ground since he began running a television commercial that links his opponent to the Republican leadership.
"Rick White and Newt Gingrich shouldn't be dragging us through this," Mr. Inslee says in the 30-second commercial. "Enough is enough."
Polls show that New Jersey's voters agree with the rest of the nation on Mr. Clinton. Mr. Rothman's challenger, Steven Lonegan, had been one of the first Republicans to run campaign commercials calling for Mr. Clinton to resign, but now he has dropped those advertisements.
Instead, Mr. Lonegan has shifted the focus of his campaign to social issues. Mr. Lonegan has called for abolishing affirmative action programs and cutting back foreign aid, and has criticized Mr. Rothman as a "big-spending liberal" because he has not supported bigger tax cuts.
As the campaign heads into its final two weeks, Speaker Newt Gingrich is scheduled to make his second fund-raising appearance on behalf of Mr. Lonegan, which could evoke the Contract With America, the platform that helped an army of conservative Republicans seize control of the House in the 1994 election.
"It looks like an odd strategy to run a campaign on conservative, very right-wing ideas in what is a very moderate district," said Cliff Zukin, chairman of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University.
Voters' reactions to these themes are noteworthy because New Jersey, and the Ninth District in particular, is viewed by many political analysts as a barometer of working-class and suburban voters. The district, which stretches from Englewood Cliffs south through 37 towns in Bergen and Essex Counties, has a solid core of registered Democrats, and in 1996 its voters favored Mr. Clinton over Bob Dole by a 2-to-1 margin.
Mr. Lonegan, who was raised in Ridgefield, thinks that the district will respond to his platform of laissez-faire economic policies and a return to a more stable social order. He has promised to fight to restrict abortion, allow school prayer and "fight for the values that made this country great."
As the Mayor of Bogota (population 7,900), he cut the budget by combining several departments and angered the city's police union by rejecting a 5 percent pay raise he considered exorbitant.
Mr. Lonegan's beliefs about reining in government were shaped by his own experiences as a client of the New Jersey Commission for the Blind. A degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa rendered Mr. Lonegan legally blind in his early 20's. As he was learning to cope with the disability two decades ago, one counselor from the commission actually discouraged him from seeking a job, he said, and argued that it would be easier for him to remain on public assistance.
Mr. Lonegan shunned that advice, earned an M.B.A. in marketing, found a job at a cabinet manufacturing company, and eventually bought the company with a $3,000 loan from his mother. The business, Kitchens Plus of Maywood, now employs 35 workers.
"The government is full of a lot of liberals who think they are doing a lot of good, but what they're really doing is cutting your heart out, encouraging you to be dependent," said Mr. Lonegan, 43, who is married and a father of two. "The institutions of family, church and the small-business community will outproduce anything government can do."
Mr. Rothman portrays Mr. Lonegan as an ideologue, calling him a "right-wing radical who is out of step with the people of this district."
Mr. Rothman succeeded Democrat Robert G. Torricelli, who left the Ninth District seat in 1996 to run a successful campaign for the Senate. He has been has a steadfast defender of abortion rights and voted for bills that provided Federal financing for 100,000 additional police officers and 100,000 additional teachers.
Mr. Rothman has also aligned himself with many of Mr. Clinton's policies: voting for a White House plan to modernize schools with no-interest Federal loans, and supporting the President's promise to use the budget surplus to bolster the Social Security system rather than to use the money for large tax cuts.
Mr. Rothman said he is proudest of the work he did during the budget negotiations, and says he encouraged White House officials to include an education tax credit in the plan that produced the first Federal surplus in decades.
If re-elected, Mr. Rothman said, he would focus on pocketbook issues like H.M.O. reform and Federal aid to improve New Jersey's rail and transit lines.
But Mr. Rothman, a lawyer and former Bergen County Surrogate Court judge, still refuses to discuss how he might vote on Presidential impeachment. He said he disapproves of Mr. Clinton's conduct, but has not heard enough evidence to decide what punishment, if any, is appropriate.
Internal polls by both campaigns show that Mr. Rothman has a sizable lead in the race. But Mr. Lonegan, who has been campaigning door to door since August, and has visited more than 21,000 homes in the district, said the Clinton scandal may depress voter turnout among Democrats and allow him to prevail. "I think we can put together enough other voters to win this race," Mr. Lonegan said.

HEADLINE: Three Large Oil Companies in U.S. Report Weak Results

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The Exxon Corporation and Texaco Inc. reported double-digit drops in earnings for the third consecutive quarter yesterday, and the Amoco Corporation reported its fourth consecutive quarterly loss, a reflection of the slump in oil prices that began a year ago.
Earnings at Exxon, the biggest oil company in the United States, fell 23 percent. Earnings dropped 58 percent at Texaco, the third-largest company, and 54 percent at Amoco, the fifth largest. 
 "Everyone in the oil production game just got clobbered, and will continue to get clobbered until prices recover," said Rosario Ilacqua, a Rothschild Inc. analyst.
The Chevron Corporation and the Atlantic Richfield Company are expected to report today.
Crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange averaged $14.15 a barrel in the third quarter, 28 percent less than in the 1997 quarter, when the average was $19.79. It was the lowest quarterly average price since the third quarter of 1986.
The companies reporting yesterday had bigger declines in earnings in the third quarter than in the second because returns from sales of chemicals or fuels fell.
The Asian recession reduced chemical demand at the same time new plants began production, creating a glut that pushed down profit margins. Prices for ethylene and propylene, two of the most widely used petrochemicals, fell by 30 percent to 35 percent on the Gulf Coast during the quarter, according to ICIS-LOR, a pricing agency.
European and Asian refiners also sent more fuel to the United States when they could not sell it in Asia, raising supplies and lowering profit margins in North America, analysts said.
"There's plenty of gasoline around, and not much demand," said James Van Alen, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
Exxon, based in Irving, Tex., earned $1.4 billion, or 58 cents a diluted share, compared with $1.82 billion, or 73 cents, in the 1997 quarter. The company was expected to earn 56 cents, the average estimate of analysts polled by the First Call Corporation. Revenue fell 12 percent, to $28.78 billion from $32.75 billion.
Exxon's decline was much smaller than that of its rivals, including Texaco and Amoco. The company's success at cost-cutting lets it make as much as 25 percent higher returns on investors' capital than its competitors, analysts said.
Exxon shares fell $1, to $75.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Texaco, based in White Plains, said earnings before gains and a charge dropped to $208 million, or 37 cents a share, from earnings of $490 million, or 90 cents, a year earlier. The company had been expected to earn 41 cents a share. Revenue fell 31 percent, to $7.71 billion from $11.09 billion.
Texaco shares fell $2.75, to $58.625.
Amoco, based in Chicago, said earnings fell to $295 million, or 31 cents a share, from $635 million, or 64 cents a year earlier. Amoco was expected to earn 32 cents a share.
Revenue fell 17 percent, to $7.49 billion from $8.98 billion. Amoco, which gets a bigger percentage of its income from chemical sales than most of its rivals, also said chemical sales fell.
Amoco shares fell 56.25 cents, to $52.1875.

HEADLINE: Bell Atlantic Narrows Loss; U S West Earnings Are Flat

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Bell Atlantic Corporation, the regional phone company serving the East Coast, posted a sharply narrower third-quarter loss of $8.1 million yesterday, surpassing Wall Street forecasts amid growth in high-speed data and mobile-phone services. And another regional Bell, U S West Inc., which is based in Denver, reported flat earnings despite a strike.
Bell Atlantic, based in New York, lost the equivalent of 1 cent a diluted share after $1.1 billion in one-time charges to cover an employee buyout program, expenses from its merger last year with the Nynex Corporation and the reduced value of investments in the slumping Asia region. The company disclosed the charges last week. 
 In the quarter a year earlier, the company recorded a larger deficit of $80.1 million, or 5 cents a diluted share, also because of one-time charges.
Without the charges this year, Bell Atlantic said, third-quarter profit would have been $1.09 billion, or 69 cents a diluted share.
The results slightly beat the expectations of analysts surveyed by the First Call Corporation of 68 cents a diluted share in the quarter. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Bell Atlantic shares rose 68.75 cents, to $50.0625.
Revenue grew to $7.91 billion from $7.37 billion, buoyed by a 31 percent increase in sales of high-speed data services to businesses, a 28 percent rise in sales of mobile-phone services and a 16 percent increase in sales of optional phone services, like caller ID. Bell Atlantic also reported 4.5 percent growth in the number of new telephone access lines bought by customers.
Bell Atlantic said last week that it would write down the value of its stakes in an Indonesian wireless company and a Thai telecommunications venture. Both are in countries that have been hard hit by Asia's economic turmoil. The charges also reflect the cost of enticing 5,200 workers to retire early as a result of the company's merger with Nynex.
Earnings at U S West were nearly unchanged in the third quarter despite a crippling strike.
The company earned $379 million, or 75 cents a share, compared with $380 million, also 75 cents a share, for the similar quarter a year ago.
The earnings report was based on a comparison of comparable data in the third quarter a year earlier, to account for the spinoff of the Media One Group on June 12.
Solomon D. Trujillo, president and chief executive of U S West, acknowledged that the work stoppage, which lasted 15 days, hurt the company's ability to provide new service to customers, but he said the company had caught up with most of the backlog.
More than 34,000 workers in 13 Western states went on strike in August over a new bonus plan that set work standards and over complaints of excessive overtime.
Shares of U S West's rose 56.25 cents yesterday, to $56.625, in New York Stock Exchange trading.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Thursday about the Bell Atlantic Corporation's third-quarter earnings referred incorrectly to its early retirement program. The program began in 1994 as part of a labor settlement, and the costs associated with it had no connection with the merger of Bell Atlantic and the Nynex Corporation last year.

HEADLINE: 3 Major Airlines Report Record Profit for the Quarter

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN

 BODY:
Cashing in on strong passenger traffic, low fuel prices and a strike at Northwest Airlines, three of the country's largest airlines reported record third-quarter earnings yesterday, while a fourth -- Trans World Airlines -- posted a surprising loss.
The mostly strong results seemed to ignore recent investor worries that a weakening economy would result in a decline in air travel. But executives at several of the carriers also expressed concerns about the future and said they were considering scaling back their planned growth next year, when the number of new airline seats is expected to rise faster than economic growth for the first time since the early 90's. 
 "Nobody is singing the blues at the domestic carriers," said Kevin C. Murphy, who follows the airline industry at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York, "but everybody is cautious."
Earnings at American Airlines and US Airways, the second- and sixth-largest carriers in the country, easily surpassed the expectations of Wall Street, while earnings at United Airlines, the nation's largest, were slightly weaker than expected because of its large exposure in Asia. The three carriers' figures were in line with strong results reported in the last week by Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines.
Indeed, of the country's major airlines, the only disappointments have been at Northwest, which suffered a worse-than-expected loss from the pilots' strike last month, and T.W.A., which has been struggling to regain its equilibrium.
Most airline stocks declined yesterday. United's parent company, UAL, was down $3.4375 to $62.9375; AMR, parent of American, closed at $57.875, down 6.25 cents; US Airways fell $1 to $54.8125, and T.W.A. was down 87.5 cents, closing at $4.5625.
AMR said its net income grew 34 percent in the quarter to $433 million, or $2.49 a diluted share, compared with $323 million, or $1.78 a share, in the similar period last year. Wall Street had expected $2.32 a share.
The company's revenue grew 7.2 percent, to $5 billion, compared with $4.7 billion in 1997.
Gerard J. Arpey, AMR's chief financial officer, said the quarter was the best in the company's history, and the sixth consecutive record. He added that the Northwest strike and another at Air Canada increased AMR revenue by $50 million in the quarter, $16 million of which was offset by the cancellation of about 1,000 American flights as a result of Hurricane Georges.
From July to September, AMR bought back $500 million worth of its stock, and the company's board recently authorized another $500 million buyback.
US Airways reported net income for the quarter of $142 million, or $1.51 a diluted share, compared with $187 million, or $1.82 a share last year. But on an operating basis, its earnings grew 20 percent to $140 million, or $1.49 a share, from $117 million, or $1.14 a share. Analysts polled by First Call had estimated $1.43 a share.
Revenue rose 4.4 percent, to $2.2 billion from $2.12 billion last year, as the carrier said its planes were filled to record levels in each of the quarter's three months.
UAL said earnings rose 3.4 percent to $516 million, or $3.71 a diluted share, compared with $499 million, or $3.75 a share in the period last year. Revenue rose 3 percent, to $4.78 billion, from $4.64 billion. Analysts had expected $4.07 a share.
United said it gained $75 million in revenue from the strike at Northwest, more than any other airline. But the gains were largely offset by weak sales in the Asia-Pacific region, which provides nearly 20 percent of its total revenue. The carrier was particularly hard hit by a rise in the value of the Japanese yen during the quarter.
"We are no longer certain of profitability for the Pacific for the full year," James Goodwin, UAL's president and chief operating officer, told reporters. But he hastened to add that barring any major changes in the industry or the economy, United was on track to surpass last year's record earnings.
Despite reports that companies are cutting travel budgets, American, United and US Airways said that advance bookings were strong.
After many years of growing more slowly than the industry as a whole, American is planning to take delivery of 49 new Boeing jets next year, increasing its total number of seats by 6 percent. But Mr. Arpey said the company was studying whether to reduce that growth rate by one-third by retiring some of its older DC-10 and 727 jets earlier than planned.
Executives at United and US Airways also said they were considering lowering their growth next year.
T.W.A. has more serious problems. The airline, the country's eighth largest, had an operating loss in the quarter of $923,000, or 11 cents a share, compared with a profit of $13.3 million, or 17 cents, last year. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call was for 33 cents a share.
Revenue fell 5 percent, to $863.2 million, from $908.4 million as T.W.A.'s efforts to attract lucrative business passengers failed to make up for an overall passenger decline.
The airline announced a fare sale on Tuesday to win back budget-minded leisure passengers, and yesterday it announced the purchase of five Boeing jets. But the poor quarter was a bad omen.
"If T.W.A. can't make profit in a quarter when traffic is strong, fuel is cheap and they got 14 cents a share from the strike at Northwest," said Brian D. Harris, the airline analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, "we wonder when they can make a profit."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 24, 1998, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Thursday about third-quarter financial results at major airlines misstated earnings at Trans World Airlines. The company reported operating income of $23.7 million and a net loss of $923,000 before extraordinary items -- not an operating loss of $923,000.

HEADLINE: Iowa's Quiet Voters

BYLINE: By Frank Conroy; Frank Conroy, director of the Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa, is the author, most recently, of "Body and Soul."

DATELINE: IOWA CITY

 BODY:
Iowans have remained remarkably calm through the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. Nobody seems to want to talk about it publicly, although a soccer mom might be overheard at the supermarket complaining about five 11-year-olds discussing oral sex, semen stains and cigars on the way to the game.
People are not in denial about what happened; they just aren't particularly eager to go on and on about it. I believe their reticence springs from shame. If any mood can be said to prevail in Iowa as we approach the elections, it is a sense of shame. 
 President Clinton is shameless, his remorse a sham. Kenneth Starr is shameless, digging in the dirt and shoving it in our faces. The House of Representatives is shameless, having instantly politicized the situation while talking of the need for bipartisanship. No, it is the people who are ashamed, and understandably so.
Our Governor, Terry E. Branstad, a moderate Republican and the nation's longest-serving governor, is retiring after four terms. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat and former State Senator, is running against Jim Lightfoot, a Republican and former member of the United States House of Representatives. Mr. Vilsack has not asked for Mr. Clinton's help on his campaign, and Mr. Lightfoot has kept entirely mum about the scandal, which suggests the two men, perhaps unconsciously, have agreed to keep the whole mess at arm's length.
In fact, the issue has not been raised in any of the races in Iowa. The people are sick of the Clinton-Lewinsky story, and the politicians know it.
The Iowa elections will not be a referendum on the President's behavior or Congress's response. For every Democrat voting Republican out of disgust with Slick Willie, there will probably be a Republican voting Democratic out of disgust with Mr. Starr's brutal brand of moral dandyism. Or in response to the threat from Republicans in Congress to keep the miserable spectacle running forever.
Iowans will vote on the issues: agriculture, education, drugs (a surprising methamphetamine problem has emerged around the state -- not big, but pesky) and the economics of health care. Some observers anticipate a lower voter turnout across the board, but that's all. Iowans will vote as if the scandal never occurred.
But, of course, it did occur.
Iowans are crazy about sports, and thus many bars and restaurants have banks of television sets that are left on all the time. When the image of Bill Clinton is on the screen -- speaking from the Rose Garden, or standing on a podium somewhere -- people tend to look away.
It's subtle. They don't groan or make faces; they rearrange the silverware, fold the napkins or generally fiddle. Supporters and critics alike, they don't look back at the television until his image is gone.

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD;
Foot in the North, Heart in the South

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky.

 BODY:
The city began with the river.
As the broad and occasionally unruly Ohio flows southwest from Pittsburgh toward its rendezvous with the Mississippi, it is interrupted here by rapids. In 1778, that barrier prompted George Rogers Clark, a young frontiersman from Virginia, to pause on his trip west and establish a settlement that eventually grew into this, the first metropolis west of the Alleghenies. 
 Clark himself, a brother of Meriwether Lewis's partner, William Clark, pushed on into the wilderness with a meager little force of 175 men. Marching through primeval forest and across flooded prairies in a campaign of audacious brilliance, he fought and defeated the better equipped, more numerous British at isolated villages in the Northwest Territory -- Vincennes, Cahokia and Kaskaskia -- securing that vast domain for the fledgling United States.
In 1809, long retired, Clark returned to Louisville to live out his final years at his sister's house, Locust Grove. Built in 1790, meticulously restored in 1962, it stands today as a monument to Clark's exploits, which are detailed in a nearby visitors center. But with its Flemish bond brickwork, shellacked ash floors and original walnut paneling, its gardens and dependencies, Locust Grove also bears witness to the highly refined tastes of some of Kentucky's pioneer settlers.
Louisville has preserved other handsome mementos of its early years. Farmington, an exceptional little Federal plantation house with delicate fan lights and a pair of octagonal rooms, was built to plans by Thomas Jefferson in 1810. Depressed because he feared that his courtship of Mary Todd had failed, Kentucky-born Abraham Lincoln took refuge there for six weeks with his friend Joshua Speed, scion of the family that owned the plantation.
Downtown, the Jefferson County Courthouse, whose pediment is supported by monumental fluted Doric columns, was built just a little later, from 1835 to 1860. With a grand cast-iron stairway and balustrade inside a 68-foot rotunda, it is by Gideon Shryock, a student of the Philadelphia architect William Strickland, who designed the Second Bank of the United States. Shryock introduced the Greek Revival style to the states beyond the Alleghenies.
The county was named, of course, for Thomas Jefferson, whose statue stands in front of the courthouse.
The city, whose inhabitants call it LOO-uh-vul, all but swallowing the final two syllables, was named for Louis XVI, the French King who aided the colonies in their war for independence. (The Almanac of American Politics, Michael Barone's invaluable compendium, points out that only one other American city, St. Paul, Minn., was named for a man who was executed.) Other place names in Kentucky, including Bourbon County and the towns of Paris and Versailles, also reflect the new nation's gratitude to France in the postwar years.
 
Whisky, Women and Horses
But ask a native about Louisville and you are likely to hear about things other than history and architecture. The Kentucky writers who put together the city's entry in the Depression-era W.P.A. Guide said it was "noted for fine whisky, beautiful women and the Kentucky Derby," and it still is.
"Louisville is too busy making and selling things to have the languor of a town in the Deep South, but it does have its special graces," the guide adds. "Its people are friendly and hospitable. Bourbon and water or a cocktail after work is popular; amusement and relaxation are as important as work."
Almost 60 years, three wars and several economic upheavals later, that description rings as true as ever, down to the last semicolon.
The city proper has a population of only about 275,000, but its suburbs spread into three Kentucky counties and four across the river in Indiana. The metropolitan area has more than a million people and a big-city feel, with Interstates and freeways circling and bisecting it. Yet drivers gallantly yield to people in crosswalks and cars waiting to turn left.
Officially, this is a border city in a border state. Kentucky stayed in the Union during the Civil War, with Kentuckians fighting on both sides. But Louisville long ago lost its heart to the South. Before the war, explained James Holmberg, a curator at the Filson Club, a Louisville historical society, "we were a Western city, but Confederate veterans took over the city and state after the war. Kentucky was the only state to secede after Appomattox."
 
Charm and Tolerance
Daniel D. Maye, a Georgian who came to Louisville by way of Chicago, says it "combines Southern rural charm with Northern urban tolerance." It produced not only Louis D. Brandeis, the first Jewish Supreme Court justice, but also Muhammad Ali, in whose honor the city plans a 50,000-square-foot museum, and it was one of the first cities anywhere to comply with the 1954 desegregation ruling.
Come here during Derby Week, the seven days leading up to the annual Run for the Roses on the first Saturday in May, or the week before that, and the traffic might make you think you're in Manhattan or Los Angeles, even if the nonstop Southern belles and the lawn parties, with lethal mint juleps served in silver stirrup cups, might remind you rather more of Biloxi or New Orleans.
The city plays host to the world with costume balls, the Pegasus Parade down Broadway, the Great Balloon Race out at the Fairgrounds and the Great Steamboat Race on the Ohio, punctuated by calliope toots, between the local stern-wheeler, the Belle of Louisville, and the larger Delta Queen from New Orleans. Race day itself might come as an anticlimax if it were not so stirring: the sentimental strains of Stephen Foster's "My Old Kentucky Home," the clang of the starting bell and the hell-for-leather charge down the stretch, jockeys' silks flashing, crowd cheering, steeds straining.
It is indeed "the most exciting two minutes in sports" (except in 1973, when the great Secretariat won in one minute 59 and two-fifths seconds). It is a parimutuel money-spinner, with $8.3 million bet at the track on the 1998 Derby. It is the only horse race most Americans pay the slightest attention to.
It is also a hell of a party. A Kentucky judge once said of the julep that "he who has not tasted one has lived in vain." Not many of the 130,000 or so people at the Derby in a typical year are in danger of that.
Churchill Downs, where the race has been run since 1875, is open almost every day of the year. Tucked beneath the twin octagonal Edwardian spires, the track's trademark, is a museum celebrating the race, the owners, the trainers, the jockeys and the horses themselves, from Man O' War, Whirlaway and Citation to the present. An exciting audiovisual presentation of the most recent race is projected onto an oval overhead screen. Or maybe you'd like to gawk at doll houses depicting C. V. Whitney's estate near Lexington, Maple Hill, or collect trivia like this tidbit: women used to bet candy or gloves on the race.
Louisville has another sporting claim to fame: it is the home of the Hillerich & Bradsby Company, the maker of Louisville Slugger baseball bats. Lately the company has opened a museum, identified by a bat 120 feet tall leaning against the building. Here, too, there is a film, featuring Johnny Bench and Tony Gwynn talking about hitting in such a lively, understandable way that my wife, Betsey, a non-fan, was entranced. You can watch bats being made from ash blanks taken from 50-year-old trees in Pennsylvania and New York, and view Sluggers used by Babe Ruth and Roger Maris (but not Mark McGwire, who swings a Rawlings bat).
Down Third Street at the far end of the neighborhood known as Old Louisville stands the J. B. Speed Art Museum, one of the premier cultural institutions in a city that has a lot of them for its size.
Recently remodeled, the Speed has a tureen by Paul Storr, a beautiful second century A.D. Roman altar supported by two lions, a fine early Rembrandt portrait of a woman (the mate of a male portrait in the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, Calif.), a set of folding screens painted in 1911 by Everett Shinn for the interior designer Elsie de Wolfe, and the wooden paneling of an entire reception room, complete with spectacular carving, from a manor house in Broadhembury, Devon, England. Dating from 1619, it was removed when the house was pulled down, sold to William Randolph Hearst at the peak of his collecting mania, then resold to a Louisville patron who gave it to the museum.
Odd, the way places catch up to you: the manor house, called the Grange, belonged to a family named Drewe. For years, Betsey and I have been stopping for lunch at a pub in that same speck of a village, on our way from London to visit friends in Devon. The pub is called the Drewe Arms. Snap.
 
Calder and Dubuffet
Some of the city's best sculpture, including pieces by Calder, Dubuffet, Tony Smith, Louise Nevelson and John Chamberlain, is gathered in and around the Kentucky Center for the Arts, a big, glistening glass box. Its three stages provide homes for Louisville's resident opera, ballet and symphony orchestra, plus touring Broadway musicals and concerts from bop to bluegrass.
The Louisville Orchestra, which celebrated its 60th anniversary last year, has a reputation extending well beyond the region. Beginning in 1953, under its founding conductor, Robert Whitney, it has recorded several hundred previously unavailable works by more than 250 composers, including Ginastera, Ives, Villa-Lobos, Piston and Britten. Battered like many similar groups by drastic reductions in funds in the 1980's, the orchestra finally returned to the black in 1996 and named a new principal conductor, the Israeli Uriel Siegel, for this season. It opened in mid-September with Pinchas Zuckerman as violin soloist.
A Tony Award-winning regional theater company, the Actors Theater, occupies a Greek Revival bank building on Main Street, built in 1837 (and erroneously thought for a long time to have been designed by Gideon Shryock). Each winter the Actors Theater stages a highly regarded Festival of New American Plays.
The city's civic and artistic life has been blessed by a succession of innovative and capable mayors, including Wilson W. Wyatt, a founder of Americans for Democratic Action; Harvey Sloane, and the present incumbent, Jerry Abramson.
Much of Louisville's cultural life was underwritten for years by the Bingham family, as was the Falls Fountain, built in 1988. Best seen from the Riverfront Belvedere or the Riverwalk, it spews water to a height of 375 feet from the midst of the Ohio River. In theory, it forms a fleur-de-lis, the city's official symbol, but to be honest, you'd have to have a Rorshachian imagination to see much of anything except a lot of splashing water.
Robert Worth Bingham bought The Louisville Courier-Journal in 1917 from Henry Watterson, one of the greatest of 19th-century American editors. In 1933, he went to London to serve as United States Ambassador, and his son, Barry, took over the paper. Barry Bingham and his wife, Mary, rapidly became a dominant force in Louisville political, cultural and philanthropic circles; he and Wilson Wyatt, boyhood chums, worked in close partnership.
But the Bingham children squabbled over their inheritance, and the paper was sold in 1986. It has lost much of its zest under its less open-handed new owner, the Gannett chain, and many Louisville charities have felt the loss of the Binghams' leadership.
 
Contrasting Architecture
Happily for the city, however, others have stepped in, notably the family of David A. Jones, founder of Humana Inc., the health-care company. Humana's headquarters, a salmon-pink skyscraper, is one of Louisville's most distinctive buildings; its entrance is flanked by Busby Berkeley waterfalls refashioned in Michael Graves's post-modern idiom. Almost next door stands the American office of the Aegon Insurance Group, a good-looking 1992 tower by John Burgee and Philip Johnson whose openwork cap has led irreverent locals to christen it "the Ban roll-on building." The two contrast sharply with other contemporary structures downtown, a thoroughly mediocre group. Worst are the Waterfront Plaza Towers, with gaudy scarlet-and-white "lighthouses" on their roofs.
The waterfront itself has been redeveloped to great effect, making it possible to walk for miles along the Ohio. You can also follow the river upstream along River Road to some of Louisville's prettiest suburbs.
Humana and other companies in its field are among Louisville's biggest employers; there are no fewer than 15 hospitals in the city. The city is also the global hub for United Parcel Service, which provides 14,500 local jobs, more than any other single company. General Electric makes appliances here, Philip Morris and Brown & Williamson make tobacco products and Brown Forman and United Distillers make bourbon. Tricon Global, the new corporate tent for Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut, has its headquarters here, too.
 
Fried Chicken and Bourbon
But if you want to experience the definitive Kentucky fried chicken, and explore the bourbon belt, the best thing is to head south to Bardstown, one of the state's oldest communities. It was founded in 1775, the year of Paul Revere's ride in far-off Massachusetts, and its streets are lined with 18th- and early 19th-century houses. More to the point, it has Kurtz's, where Marilyn (Toogie) Dick serves her glorious fried chicken to hordes of hungry people each weekend, some of whom come all the way from Cincinnati.
Suitably fortified, you can use Bardstown as a base to learn more about bourbon, the corn-based whisky that made Kentucky famous (along with Daniel Boone and racehorses). This is the state, it has been said, "where the corn is full of kernels and the colonels are full of corn." So visit the Oscar Getz Museum of Whiskey History in Bardstown to soak up distilling lore.
Then move on to Maker's Mark in Loretto, a charming old distillery. Its whisky is much loved by Kentuckians, for its red wax seal and its distinctively mellow flavor. That results in part from using winter wheat, instead of rye, along with corn and malted barley. Near Versailles is Labrot & Graham, perhaps the most picturesque of the distilleries; Woodford Reserve, the company's small-batch bourbon, has the savor of a French Armagnac, with a typical "hot" finish.
If you have more time, spend a morning in the more abstemious atmosphere of the restored Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill, near Harrodsburg. The triumph of the place is not the 33 brick, frame and stone buildings, or the clever, handsome furniture or even the wonderful twin spiral staircases at the Trustees' House. The triumph is the sense of serenity -- or is it spirituality? -- that visitors feel, far from the roar of the interstate and the clamor of the city, surrounded by ponds and meadows where sheep may safely graze.
 
Here is information about visiting Louisville, Ky.:
 
Where to Stay
 
THE CAMBERLEY BROWN, 335 West Broadway, (502) 583-1234. Echoes of Derby frolics past resound through the magnificent marble halls of the 75-year-old Brown, Louisville's old-money hotel. Ornate chandeliers, collections of equine paintings and sculptures and a registration desk concealed behind gilded screens enrich the lobby. Guest rooms, some a trifle small, are nicely appointed. Double room: $189; special rates may be available.
 
SEELBACH HILTON, 500 Fourth Street, (502) 585-3200. Opened in 1905, the Seelbach served as a model for a scene in "The Great Gatsby." It was restored in the early 1980's, but some rooms and bathrooms have grown shabby since; another face lift is needed and planned soon, to the tune of $3.2 million. The lobby, with murals illustrating Kentucky history, begs for better lighting. Double rooms: $159 to $209; based on availability, special rates of $99 on weekends and $129 on weekdays, including Continental breakfast.
 
HYATT REGENCY, 320 West Jefferson Street, (502) 587-3434, offers the usual amenities of the chain hotels, but it, too, is starting to look a little tired. Nonetheless, the Hyatt's downtown location is convenient, and the tennis court, indoor pool and 18-story atrium are strong selling points. A revolving rooftop restaurant overlooks the river, if you like that sort of thing. Double rooms: $99 to $120 on weekends; $169 to $210 on weekdays.
 
OLD LOUISVILLE INN, 1359 South Third Street, (502) 635-1574. Third Street is lined with Gilded Age houses of every description from Richardsonian Romanesque to Eastlake Victorian, many of them carefully restored. One such is the Old Louisville Inn, a well-run, 10-room bed-and-breakfast with 12-foot ceilings that was built in 1901 as the baronial residence of a telephone tycoon. Double rooms: $95 to $135.
 
Where to Eat
 
CLUB GROTTO, 2116 Bardstown Road, (502) 459-5275. Big Jim McKinney says he knows 90 percent of the customers who visit his animated red-walled, low-ceilinged bistro. The menu reflects an aversion to shortcuts: mozzarella is made in the house, and barbecued shrimp are served in a sauce based on lobster stock. Try cornmeal-breaded fried walleye or the 11-vegetable "orgy."
 
J. GRAHAM'S CAFE, in the Camberley Brown (see above), is a glorified coffee shop that serves an authentic Hot Brown sandwich, an old Louisville favorite invented at the hotel. Toast triangles in an ovenproof dish are covered with shaved turkey breast, Mornay sauce, smoky Kentucky bacon, Parmesan and tomato wedges and finished under the broiler. Result: a cheese dream with a Ph.D. Open for breakfast and lunch only: Mondays through Saturdays, 6:30 A.M. to 3 P.M.; Sundays, 7 A.M. to 3 P.M.
 
KURTZ'S, 418 East Stephen Foster Avenue, Bardstown, (502) 348-8964. Don't look for furbelows in this old stone house. Kurtz's has been there since 1937, serving chewy, salty Kentucky ham; crisp, greaseless chicken fried in deep cast-iron skillets; blini-shaped fried cornbread, soufflelike corn pudding, home-pickled beets and mashed potatoes better than your grandmother's. Oh, my.
 
LILLY'S, 1147 Bardstown Road, (502) 451-0447. Lilly's served us the best meal of a recent visit to Louisville. "God bless our local farmers!" the menu said; I understood why after eating a stack of phyllo rounds and ripe tomato slices topped with warm goat cheese. Even better: juicy roast pork tenderloin with a spicy red-brown sauce, gossamer cornbread and wasabi slaw.
 
LYNN'S PARADISE CAFE, 984 Barret Avenue, (502) 583-3447. Who needs a barrel of monkeys? Nothing could be more fun than Lynn Winter's place, with an eight-foot-tall coffee pot out front, corncob murals and a zany array of hideous lamps. Four thousand people a week come for gotta-try-'em grits or French toast at breakfast, meatloaf at lunch and Lynn's warming smile all day long.
 
THE OAKROOM, in the Seelbach Hilton (see above), features Kentucky products, from smoked spoonfish and Newsom's hams to mangolike papaws, gathered by foragers in Appalachia. The gifted chef, Jim Gerhardt, also marinates pork, the local meat of choice, in bourbon and molasses and pairs it with a fruit compote. Fine wines and cheeses are chosen by Adam Seger, the maitre d'hotel. Open daily 5:30 to 10 P.M.
 
VINCE STATEN'S, 9219 U.S. Highway 42, Prospect, (502) 228-7427. A co-author of the standard guide to the nation's barbecue restaurants, Vince Staten runs a joint of his own in the suburbs. The decor is plastic, but not the food. Ribs and pulled pork sandwiches are succulent, as are the beans and coleslaw; Staten's offers six sauces, culminating in Legal Limit hot.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
New Tower for Young Professionals on East Side

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Nearing completion on East 86th Street, the 246-unit Ventura is the newest addition to the Upper East Side streetscape, and the first luxury rental designed to attract young professionals in six years along the 16-block stretch from 80th to 96th Streets.
Most of the apartments -- 83 percent -- in the 22-story building at 240 East 86th Street, which is to be completed in April, will be studios and one-bedroom units of 500 to 900 square feet. The remaining apartments will have two bedrooms and 1,000 to 1,300 square feet. There will also be 40,000 square feet of retail space. 
 The $80 million building, between Second and Third Avenues, is being developed by the Related Companies of Manhattan, with the Multi-Employer Property Trust, a trade union pension fund, as a financial partner.
"This is not a stroller-friendly street," said David J. Wine, president of Related Residential Development, referring to the commercial character of the block. "But we saw a void in high-quality rental options for young urban professionals in a location that offered a convenient life style." He noted that a subway stop was two blocks away.
Monthly rents will be $1,950 to $6,000, which rental brokers say is comparable to apartments in the area. Since leasing began four weeks ago, 46 apartments have been rented.
Among the new tenants are Amy Rose and Allen Weinberg, who are moving from two separate apartments to a sixth-floor, one-bedroom unit they will share at the Ventura.
"Neither of our apartments were appropriate," Ms. Rose said, "so we chose one in this building because its location is close to transportation and our jobs." Ms. Rose, 31, works in Greenwich, Conn.; Mr. Weinberg, 32, works on 52d Street and Park Avenue. "For the monthly rent, you get a little less space, but the apartment is brand-new and well designed," she said.
Related has leased the retail space at the Ventura to Circuit City and Barnes & Noble.
Despite the stock market's roller-coaster ride in recent weeks, Brian G. Edwards, director of leasing at the Halstead Property Company, a Manhattan brokerage concern, said rents remained stable, though apartments renting for $6,000 or more a month are taking longer to lease.
Reba P. Miller, president of R. P. Miller & Associates, another brokerage company, said some would-be buyers of co-ops or condominiums were taking a wait-and-see attitude because of the stock market and deciding to rent for a year instead, which is good for the rental market.
What is more important for the Ventura than the short-term economic outlook, Mr. Edwards said, is the building's lack of competition. "Related is still providing a product that hasn't been built on the Upper East Side from 86th to 90th Streets since 1992," he said. Most of the buildings constructed in that time were either condominiums or large-sized rentals for families.
Other rental developments are planned on the Upper East Side, including three -- with a total of nearly 500 apartments, most of them studio or one-bedroom units aimed at young professionals -- that RFR/Davis, a Manhattan developer, will start building by the end of the year. One is at the corner of 90th Street and First Avenue; another is along First Avenue between 75th and 76th Streets, and the third is along 77th Street between Second and Third Avenues.
The Ventura is rising on a site once occupied by aging brownstones and retail shops, some of them boarded up and vacant in recent years. The property was assembled in the late 1980's and early 1990's by a previous developer -- Flic Properties, a Japanese investment company -- whose project never reached fruition. In the summer of 1996, the lender, FGH Realty, the American affiliate of Aegon Insurance, a Dutch company, foreclosed on the property, Mr. Wine said.
Related bought it the following February "because with the ability to have 40,000 square feet of retail space on 86th Street, the economics of the site were appealing," Mr. Wine said. He said it also "afforded us the opportunity to move quickly with construction."
Related began construction in September 1997 after completing the relocation of existing tenants, including the Elk Candy Company, long a neighborhood fixture that moved a block and a half away, and demolishing all but one of the existing structures. That building, a six-story prewar brownstone with 34 apartments, 19 of them vacant, at the corner of Second Avenue, was sold to Shore Assets Inc. and the Simon Development Group, both of Manhattan. The partners are renovating the unoccupied units and are to begin leasing them in May.
The Ventura, designed by the Manhattan architectural firm of Davis Brody Bond, has a stone base topped by a mostly glass tower that is cantilevered eight feet over the existing corner brownstone apartment building.
All the apartments will have washers and dryers, floor-to-ceiling windows and limestone baths. Some units will also have terraces.
A variety of layouts are being offered. There are two kinds of studios -- one with a walk-in closet, the other with a sleeping alcove -- "to give tenants the feeling they are not living in a single room," Mr. Wine said.
Planned amenities include a 1,500-square-foot health club and a 3,200-square-foot rooftop sun terrace with an entertainment room. Initial occupancy is to begin next month.

HEADLINE: Weekly Claims for Jobless Benefits Are Up

BYLINE: Reuter 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The number of Americans applying for state unemployment benefits for the first time rose for the third consecutive week, inching up by 2,000 in the latest week, the Government said today.
Initial jobless claims increased to a seasonally adjusted 318,000 in the week ended Saturday, from a revised 316,000 in the prior week. It was the highest level since 337,000 in the July 11 week, the Labor Department said. 
 California accounted for the bulk of the upward revision from the previous week's original estimate of 303,000, a spokeswoman for the Labor Department said.
Over all, new claims have stayed relatively low, at a level economists said would be consistent with fairly strong payroll growth in October. Wall Street economists had forecast new claims of 305,000 for the latest week.
The four-week moving average of new claims, a less volatile and therefore more useful measure of jobless benefit claims, also rose last week, jumping 6,000, to 306,500, the department said.
In a sign that the pace of hiring may have slackened, the number of people already claiming a week of benefits rose to 2.23 million in the Oct. 10 week, the latest figures available, from 2.17 million in the prior week.

HEADLINE: 2 Top Internet Music Sellers Make an Agreement to Merge

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
After weeks of negotiation, CD Now and N2K, the two biggest Internet music sellers, agreed to merge yesterday afternoon.
The all-stock deal gives holders of CD Now 60 percent of the new company and N2K holders get 40 percent. That means that CD Now is buying N2K for $7.83 a share, a 42 percent premium over the $5.50 price its stock closed at yesterday. 
 The stocks of both companies have plummeted in recent months to well below their initial offering prices, and a small fraction of the highs they reached in a brief, exuberant love affair with investors.
The companies now hope that their merger will cut costs and win back the hearts of investors who worried that neither of them had the strength to fight off new competitors like Amazon.com.
"We will have operating leverage from one brand, one service, one back end and one management team. And we won't have to compete against each other for marketing deals," said Jon Diamond, a co-founder and vice chairman of N2K.
Mr. Diamond will become the chairman of the new company. Jason Olim, the president and chief executive of CD Now, will retain those positions in the new company. Larry Rosen, N2K's chairman, and David Grusin, another vice chairman, will serve on the company's board but will not have management responsibility. Mr. Rosen is recovering from heart surgery.
The new company will use N2K's offices at 55 Broad Street in Lower Manhattan as its headquarters. But it will retain operations in suburban Philadelphia. CD Now has headquarters in Jenkinstown, Pa., and N2K has an operation nearby.
Mr. Olim said there would be some layoffs but he declined to say how many.
Initially, the company will be called CD Now/N2K Inc., but it will hire consultants to help pick the brand and corporate name. N2K's main store operates under the name Music Boulevard.
"It's a smart strategic move," said Maria LaTour Kadison, a senior analyst with Forrester Research. "There is no reason for the two of them to duke it out and grab market share from each other."
But she said that Amazon still appeared to have the upper hand, even though it had just entered the music market. "They simply have the brand recognition and loyal customer base that these two combined don't have," she said.
The companies said that they would have more than one million customers and would be the third-most- visited store on the Internet.
N2K has focused more on providing articles, reviews and other content related to music. It operates sites about the major music genres including Rocktropolis, Jazz Central Station and Classical Insites.
CD Now has countered by licensing music content from MTV and Rolling Stone.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: FLORIDA;
In Race for Governor, Democrat Is in Trouble

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Oct. 22

 BODY:
In the race for Florida governor, Kenneth H. MacKay is the candidate with the record as state legislator, Congressman and, most recently, Lieutenant Governor in an administration presiding over good times. He is the Democrat in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans. He is the native Floridian, and the one invariably described as nice.
He is also widely expected to lose. 
 "This is very unfair, but he's acquired the mantle of a loser," said Richard Scher, a political scientist at the University of Florida and a personal friend.
If polls that have given Mr. Mac Kay's opponent, Jeb Bush, a consistent double-digit lead prove accurate, Florida is poised to come under the rule of a Republican governor and a State Legislature led by Republicans for the first time since Reconstruction. It is a changing of the guard happening across the South, but Florida Democrats say it is not inevitable in their state.
Despite gains by Republicans over the last two decades, they note, Florida is still a two-party state where voters are prone to behave as independents regardless of party registration and are still electing Democrats in statewide elections.
What has so drastically dimmed the prospects of a viable Democratic candidate can be better attributed to a confluence of troubles: a spectacular miscalculation by the state's Democratic legislators, the successful reinvention of an opponent and Mr. MacKay's failure to excite even his own supporters.
"MacKay is a bland person, no charisma," said James A. Drayton, a bookstore owner in West Palm Beach and a supporter who attended a recent campaign appearance by Mr. MacKay. "Bush is attractive, somewhat glib, has a good name. That's what's happening."
Mr. Bush, 45, a son of former President George Bush and a Miami businessman who is running for governor a second time after narrowly losing to the retiring Democratic Governor, Lawton Chiles, in 1994, has undergone a political transformation. He has tempered his hard-edged conservative talk to present himself as someone who has "listened and learned," and he has courted blacks, Jews and other traditional Democratic voters he once ignored.
And while the 65-year-old Mr. MacKay, who is universally known as Buddy, focuses on qualifications and issues, Mr. Bush has contrasted leadership styles and dynamism to capture people's imagination.
"Florida needs a governor with a new vision, new energy," Mr. Bush said in a radio debate last week.
As recently as April, a group of prominent Democrats was looking for an alternative to Mr. MacKay, who started campaigning late, who has lost statewide elections before and who has been regarded by many as too much of a technocrat. The campaign also brought to the fore organizational problems in the state's Democratic Party that critics say account for a decline in its share of registered voters to 45 percent and its failure to revitalize as the Republicans gained dominance in Tallahassee, the state capital, in the 90's.
But a more pressing problem was the party's disarray after Democrats in the Florida House this year rejected a black State Representative who was next in line to become their leader, a snub that caused a rift that has yet to heal and has antagonized one of the party's most loyal and vital constituencies. Although Mr. MacKay, who calls Mr. Bush "Jeb come lately" on matters of concern to blacks, has held on to the endorsement of influential black political and religious leaders, the aggrieved Representative, Willie F. Logan, and a few other black politicians endorsed Mr. Bush, who got only 6 percent of the black vote in 1994.
While there have been other defections in the party. too, some Democrats say all these problems pale in comparison with that of finances. As of Oct. 9, Mr. MacKay's campaign had raised $3.9 million and spent all but $300,000. Mr. Bush's campaign had raised $7.1 million and still had $2.6 million to spend. Florida's Republican Party also has more to spend on campaign advertisements than does the Democratic Party.
In an interview, Mr. MacKay said that his party had typically been less organized and well-financed than its counterpart, but that its problems had subsided "just in time."
Mr. MacKay said a worse problem had been getting the public to focus on the race because "the noise level from Washington makes it more difficult for us to get our message out." Although President Clinton has helped with fund-raising and does not appear to have become a liability for Mr. MacKay, a longtime ally who still stands by the President, neither has Mr. Clinton been able to provide the boost that Mr. MacKay needs.
Asked whether his candidacy suffered from unfortunate timing, Mr. MacKay replied that "not everything is bad."
"This is the best economy we've had in 20 years," he said. " We've got a lot of good things going on this year, and I'm running in effect as the incumbent."
Mr. MacKay indeed has been an active partner of Governor Chiles during the last eight years, serving by most accounts as an able trouble-shooter in reorganizing state agencies, brokering deals and overseeing Miami during the city's financial crisis. But because he worked mostly behind the scenes, many voters may not have noticed him or become familiar with him.
On the campaign trail and during debates, Mr. MacKay, a lawyer and citrus farmer from Central Florida, is prone to begin answers with "the truth of the matter is," sometimes appearing passive next to the taller, more animated Mr. Bush. During the last televised debate of the campaign on Tuesday, Mr. MacKay came closer to matching the energy of Mr. Bush.
There are substantive contrasts as well: Mr. MacKay differs with Mr. Bush in opposing school vouchers, supporting a woman's right to abortion and favoring a ballot measure that would allow counties to impose stricter gun control but that Mr. Bush argues would prevent uniform statewide regulation. And Mr. MacKay asks voters whether they can trust a candidate with no government experience other than a brief stint as Florida's Commerce Secretary in the 1980's and who portrays himself as far more moderate than his party is and than he himself was four years ago.
As Election Day nears, Mr. MacKay has concentrated his attacks on Mr. Bush's business background. In a radio debate last week, he brought up what he called Mr. Bush's record of "questionable deals" and "mismanagement," including his tenure on the board of a company that collapsed and that was the subject of lawsuits alleging mismanagement and stock manipulation.
Addressing the issue in debates, Mr. Bush responds that the press has examined his past thoroughly and found no wrongdoing. A millionaire who has staked his business reputation on a successful South Florida real estate development firm that he joined in 1980, Mr. Bush has accused Mr. MacKay of "gross distortions."
Mr. MacKay said he expected his gap in the polls to close -- it has, to 10 percentage points this month, down from 15 to 17 points in September -- as people focus on the race in its last weeks.
But polls have also shown most voters barely interested in the race.
"Issues and trust will decide the race," Mr. MacKay said moments before a waitress in a Fort Lauderdale restaurant stared at him as he got up to leave.
"I saw you on TV," she said. "The Republican?"
"I'm the Democrat," Mr. MacKay answered with a smile.

HEADLINE: 3M Profit Declined 9.2% in Third Quarter

BYLINE: By Bridge News 

 BODY:
The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, better known as 3M, said yesterday that its third-quarter profit fell by 9.2 percent amid slower economic growth, both in the United States and abroad.
The company, which makes products ranging from Post-It Notes and Scotch tape to flexible computer circuits and drug delivery systems, said it earned $392 million, or 97 cents a share, in the third quarter, down from $432 million, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. The results were slightly below the expectations of Wall Street analysts, and shares of 3M tumbled $2.8125, to close at $81.4375 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 3M, which derives more than half its sales from outside the United States and 18 percent from Asia, said difficult economic conditions worldwide hurt its results in the quarter.
Worldwide sales totaled $3.77 billion in the quarter, down 1.6 percent from $3.82 billion a year earlier.
Outside of the United States, 3M said sales rose by 5 percent in local currency terms, but because of the strength of the dollar, sales in dollar terms fell by 2 percent, to $1.87 billion. To adjust to slower worldwide growth, 3M has announced a cost-cutting plan that includes closing plants, discontinuing certain product lines and eliminating 4,500 jobs by the end of 1999.
"While we are facing a challenging economic environment, we expect to see increasing benefits from our cost-reduction efforts," said L. D. DeSimone, 3M's chairman. "We are monitoring global economic conditions closely, and we will make further adjustments as necessary."

HEADLINE: Texas Agency Denies Permit For Waste Site

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Oct. 22

 BODY:
Citing concerns about a geologic fault line, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission voted today to deny a license to store low-level nuclear waste near the Mexico border.
The commission voted 3 to 0 to deny a permit for the proposed radioactive-waste dump at Sierra Blanca, a town of about 700 near El Paso and 16 miles from Mexico. 
 The project had the approval of the Federal Government and the support of state officials, who said it would help the area's economy.
Environmentalists and the Mexican Government opposed the dump as too dangerous, as did residents of Sierra Blanca.
"The place had no future with a dump," David Frederick, a lawyer for the Sierra Blanca Legal Defense Fund. "It may not have a great future now, but at least there won't be a dump."
The dump was to take in tons of Texas's low-level radioactive waste, most of which is generated by utilities, and waste from Maine and Vermont.
"We have a part of Texas that is in great need, and this facility could have helped that," the commission chairman, Barry McBee, said. But Mr. McBee said he and the other commissioners had too many questions about the safety.
The dump would be in the most seismically active region of the state and above a source of groundwater for several communities.
The Texas Low-level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority, a state agency created to find a site for the dump, has 20 days to file for a rehearing. If that is denied, the agency could go to court to try to have the commission's decision overturned.
Doug Caroom, a lawyer for the authority, argued that the site was needed to dispose of waste generated by power plants, industry, medical laboratories and universities.
"The real issue is, what are we going to do with our radioactive waste?" Mr. Caroom asked. "This site is completely safe to people and the environment. If we can't license this site, you can't license one at all."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Late Comeback Gives Dow 13.91-Point Gain for Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks staged a late comeback yesterday and pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to a seventh straight gain while the Nasdaq market continued a two-week advance.
"The market looks great," said Gary B. Kaltbaum, the chief technical analyst at J. W. Genesis Securities. "Every day it's repairing itself from the damage that had been done." 
 Oil stocks fell on another batch of poor earnings, notably Chevron's, dampening early trading, but the Dow, down as much as 97 points during the day, climbed after lunch and finished with a modest gain of 13.91 points, or nearly two-tenths of a percent, to 8,533.14.
The gain in the technology-laden Nasdaq was a much heftier 1.67 percent, lifting the index to 1,702.64, or nearly 20 percent above its low on Oct. 8. Microsoft, whose antitrust trial began on Monday, once again led the way, rising 3 9/16 , to 110. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged slightly higher, rising 8.56 points, or eight-tenths of a percent, to 1,078.48.
Prices of Treasury bonds fell yesterday, raising interest rates, suggesting resumed outflows of money that had poured in when the risk of world economic meltdown seemed most acute.
With credit now beginning to flow more freely -- and the difference in borrowing costs for borrowers of various quality narrowing -- a sense of relative stability has emerged on Wall Street. Bank and brokerage stocks are no longer in retreat but on the rise, with BankAmerica and Chase Manhattan, for example, up yesterday by 2 11/16 and 2 1/16 , respectively. Merrill Lynch climbed 1 3/4, to 55 3/16 , after stumbling to a low of 35 3/4 on Oct. 8.
To James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Norwest Investment Management in Minneapolis, the key to market recovery has been the decline in the dollar, which he said brought some stability to distressed currencies in Asia and other regions and allowed officials around the globe to cut interest rates.
"There is a lot of rocket fuel under this stock market if you just convince people we're not in a global abyss," Mr. Paulsen said. He called the extent of this year's decline in stocks "vastly underappreciated" -- thus putting them in position to rally -- because the decline in bond yields combined with the drop in stock prices have made equities more attractive than they were in any of the previous 12 postwar bear markets.
Other upbeat analysts pointed to earnings reports for the third quarter that have matched or slightly beaten expectations and, perhaps just as tellingly, to the fact that the handful of surprise disappointments has seldom had wide repercussions.
"Most things seem to be coming in on line, maybe a penny or two better," said Joseph Yurman, managing director of BankBoston Robertson Stephens.
Chevron, however, reported an unexpectedly severe, 47 percent drop in third-quarter profits, and its shares slumped 5 3/4, to 81 1/2. Atlantic Richfield, also reporting lower profits that reflected low oil prices, fell 2 1/2, to 67 1/16 , while Exxon, which reported on Wednesday, and Mobil fell 3 13/16 and 3, respectively.
At the same time, shares of Halliburton, Schlumberger and some other companies in the oilfield equipment business rose a point or more.
What had been a dormant market for new issues was enlivened by the arrival of Conoco, which traded 38.5 million shares and finished at 24 7/8, up 1 7/8 from its offering price of 23. This DuPont spinoff was the biggest United States initial public offering ever.
Among Dow components, Procter & Gamble was up 3 3/16 , to 87, to account for 94 percent of the index's modest gain. General Electric gained 2 3/4, to 86 5/8.
Most drug stocks posted solid gains, with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer and Warner-Lambert gaining more than 2 points, but Baxter International plunged 7 7/8, to 57, on fears about future earnings growth.
On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,852 stocks with gains compared with 1,228 declines, and the gap by which new lows exceeded new highs -- 37 to 28 -- continued to narrow yesterday. Volume was again moderate by recent standards, 754.97 million shares.
The Russell index of 2,000 small-company stocks resumed its advance, climbing 1.8 percent, to 366.40, beating even the Nasdaq composite.
Overseas stock markets were mixed, moving higher by 3.44 percent in Brazil, five-tenths of a percent in Japan and four-tenths of a percent in Britain but falling 1.88 percent in Germany, and six-tenths of a percent in Paris.

Treasury Prices Fall

 
(By Bloomberg News)
The prices of Treasury bonds fell for the second time in three days yesterday amid signs world markets are stabilizing.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell one point, to 10519/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.13 percent, from 5.07 percent, the highest in more than three weeks.
The rally that drove long-term bond yields to three-decade lows has faltered in recent days as stock markets around the world have risen and investors have become less pessimistic about the prospects for economic growth in the United States.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Boeing Results Beat Forecasts In 3d Quarter

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The Boeing Company reported third-quarter earnings yesterday that were higher than expected, but it warned that the recession in Asia would cause it to lose more airplane orders than it had previously estimated.
Boeing, the aerospace giant based in Seattle, became profitable during the quarter after facing production problems and other difficulties last year that forced it to take a $1 billion charge. But with the economic downturn in Asia threatening to spread to Europe and the United States, it appears that Boeing's internal troubles caused it to miss out on one of the biggest airplane booms in history. By the time next year when the company's airplane division is expected to be fully recovered, demand for new jets is expected to be declining. 
 For the quarter, the company earned $347 million, or 36 cents a share, on $12.7 billion in revenue. The per-share figure was well above the average estimate of 27 cents forecast by Wall Street analysts surveyed by the First Call Corporation. In the period a year earlier, Boeing reported a loss of $696 million, or 72 cents a share, on revenue of $11.4 billion.
"There were puts and takes that got you to the slightly better number than expected," said Howard A. Rubel, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York. "Most of it was driven by other income and tax benefits."
Boeing executives said the company was re-examining its market forecasts in light of Asia's economic turmoil. Airlines serving Asia are responsible for a large part of the sales of Boeing's 747 jumbo jet, its most lucrative civilian airplane. But many airlines have reduced their flights in the region over the last year or are switching to smaller planes.
Boeing recently increased production of the 747 and the newer 777 widebody to 5 and 7 a month but was planning to reduce production in the middle of next year. Now, it is considering cutting the production rates even further. The company says it is holding 34 completed planes in storage while its customers try to come up with the money to pay for them or Boeing tries to line up alternate buyers.
Meanwhile, the company is still struggling to meet its production schedules. To meet its target of delivering 550 commercial airplanes this year, it must produce 182 during the fourth quarter, more than ever before.
Alan R. Mulally, who was named head of Boeing's commercial airplane division last month after the ouster of his predecessor, Ronald B. Woodard, said yesterday that Boeing was delaying previously announced plans to begin production of 737 narrow-body jets in Long Beach, Calif., so the company could focus on meeting its delivery schedule.
Boeing was dealt a new setback recently when it learned that one of its suppliers had shipped it thousands of defective electrical connectors. Mr. Mulally said that no planes containing the faulty parts had been delivered to customers and that enough functioning parts were available to allow production to continue. But workers must spend hours inspecting recently completed planes to find out which ones were affected and then fix them.
Despite all its travails and weakening demand for its commercial airplanes, some analysts think Boeing, which has seen its stock fall 35 percent since April, has turned the corner. Nicholas P. Heymann, the aerospace analyst at Prudential Securities who was one of the first on Wall Street to turn bearish on Boeing last year, upgraded his advisory on the stock yesterday to "accumulate" from "hold."
He said that Boeing executives were beginning to cut costs and that the company would start generating a large amount of cash next year. Indeed, Boeing announced a stock repurchase plan in August and said yesterday that it spent $364 million to buy 10.6 million of its own shares in September.
"At this point, we believe people will have to revise upward their estimates after having revised them down for six quarters," Mr. Heymann said.
Boeing shares closed yesterday at $36.4375, up 43.75 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: When the Sure-Footed Stumble;
Swiss Banks Stagger After Several Investing Missteps

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: ZURICH, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The global financial turmoil has jolted big banks across Europe and the United States, but few can match the woes here in Switzerland.
First came the agreement this summer by the biggest Swiss banks, led by Credit Suisse Group and UBS A.G., to pay $1.25 billion to settle a suit brought by Holocaust survivors concerning plundered wealth that had been stored in Swiss banks. 
 Then, in September, Credit Suisse acknowledged that it had lost at least $500 million through its activities in Russia. Most analysts say the total losses could easily be twice that.
And three weeks ago, the chairman of UBS abruptly resigned after the bank lost $780 million in connection with the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn.
More bad news is probably on the way. Most analysts say Credit Suisse will have to write off at least another $500 million in Russian debt, while UBS faces a mountain of potential trouble in Latin America -- not to mention the lingering possibility of more bombshells from wayward derivatives trading.
All this has gravely undermined the elite mystique of Swiss bankers as too stable and sure-footed to be tripped up by the lure of fast money. Such stumbling also carries international significance, given the global reach of both institutions. After its merger in January with the Swiss Bank Corporation, UBS is by some measures the world's biggest bank.
And though both banks can easily handle their losses, their dignity and credibility will be far more difficult to repair. Indeed, the very notion of a "Swiss" bank is under strain. Two of UBS's top executives are now American, including the man charged with redefining "risk" for the entire institution: a 33-year-old derivatives wizard from Chicago named David Solo.
UBS is also still struggling with a sweeping reorganization in the wake of its merger with Swiss Bank, which drew some strident protests, and its trading catastrophe with Long-Term Capital.
"What we have had so far are only profit warnings," said George Koh, an analyst at Paribas Capital in London. "But sooner or later they are going to have to take new provisions" for expected losses.
How much? UBS has not spelled out much about its exposure to risky loans; its looming losses are unclear but expected to be big. At Credit Suisse, which has provided detailed information about its loan portfolios and trading activities, Mr. Koh and others are betting on $1 billion in additional losses just from Russia and Brazil.
Amid the turmoil, the two banks appear to be responding in very different ways. Ever since UBS stunned the industry by announcing that its chairman would resign, the bank has hunkered down in silence to rethink its strategy toward higher-risk activities like proprietary securities trading and investment banking.
UBS executives refused to be interviewed, but the bank told shareholders recently that it was re-evaluating its "risk profile." Some industry experts speculate that UBS might go so far as to sell or spin off its investment bank, Warburg Dillon Read, though most analysts say it will simply hew to a far more conservative tack.
At Credit Suisse and its investment bank, Credit Suisse First Boston, executives remain almost pugnaciously determined to stick to their strategy.
"Some European banks will decide this is a business they do not want to be in," said Richard Thornburgh, Credit Suisse's chief financial officer. "It appears to us that there is an opportunity here to capitalize on the reduction in capacity."
Though UBS and Credit Suisse face different problems, both have been expanding in more profitable but riskier areas. Because of Switzerland's historic role as an international financial center and the country's small domestic market, both banks are far more internationally minded than other European banks, and far less dependent on traditional commercial lending.
UBS became one of the world's biggest banks when it merged with the Swiss Bank Corporation early this year. But the giant new bank is now having intense heartburn because of its problems in Russia and Asia and its disastrous involvement with Long-Term Capital.
The bank disclosed last month that it had lost $780 million through a complex series of transactions with the American hedge fund, in part because top bank executives had failed to realize the extent of their exposure. Hoping to restore some of the bank's lost credibility, Matthis Cabiallavetta, the chairman, resigned along with other top executives on Oct. 2.
Analysts say the problems appear to have originated at the old UBS, which lost more than $450 million on derivatives trading in 1997. Executives from the old Swiss Bank, which had a much bigger business in derivatives, are now largely in control of the combined operation. Marcel Ospel, who built up much of Swiss Bank's investment banking business, is UBS's chief executive. Mr. Solo, the 33-year-old chief operating officer of UBS's Warburg Dillon Read, has been named to the new job of "chief risk officer."
But UBS's problems extend beyond its adventures with hedge funds. Many were dismayed Sept. 24 when UBS announced a loss of $468 million in emerging markets, much of it in Russia. Just four weeks earlier, the bank had said its losses in Russia were only about $133 million.
UBS also has a big exposure to Latin America, which has become infected by much of the currency turmoil that hit Asia and Russia. Total exposure in Latin America is about $3.56 billion, but the bank has taken provisions adding up to less than 10 percent of that amount.
That percentage would be "certainly too low," said Morgan Stanley in a recent report, should the region endure more financial turmoil.
Credit Suisse's biggest problem is Russia. In a bold bid to capitalize on the reconstruction of Russia after the fall of Communism, Credit Suisse First Boston became the dominant dealer in Russian Government bonds, accounting for 40 percent of the trading activity. It also became a big lender to Russian companies and municipalities.
All told, Credit Suisse has estimated its exposure in Russia -- through government bonds, currency contracts, loans and trading activities -- at about $3 billion. The bank has set aside about $1 billion in provisions, but most analysts now assume it will need to set aside far more.
"My assumption is they have another half-billion or billion to go," said John Leonard, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London.
Mr. Thornburgh of Credit Suisse acknowledged that more provisions might well be necessary, but said the ultimate extent of the losses would depend in large part on how the Russian Government restructured its bonds and how Russian banks decided to meet their commitments.
"The mistake we made in Russia was that no one ever thought that you would get the combination of a devaluation, a default and a fall of the Government -- and effectively the Government has fallen," he said today.
Credit Suisse's Russia problems come in several flavors. As of early September, it had trading positions in Russian Government and corporate bonds worth $147 million. It also had about $1 billion in loans to Government agencies or big Russian companies, like the natural gas conglomerate Gazprom, and about $571 million in loans to other corporations and banks.
Many loans were made in the expectation of underwriting future bond offerings, whose proceeds would be used to pay off the loans. But bond offerings are now virtually impossible, and the bank is waiting to see what happens.
One of the biggest dangers is in currency contracts, which are usually entered with Russian banks to hedge against a devaluation in the ruble. These contracts were crucial for investors buying up Russian bonds, which pay high interest rates -- but only in rubles.
Credit Suisse said it had about $1.1 billion worth of these contracts on its books, money that Russian banks theoretically owe it in the wake of the ruble's plunge in value since the summer. But the Russian Government has imposed a moratorium on paying off these contracts.
"The criticism that everyone can make is that our concentration on Russia was too high," Mr. Thornburgh said. "But there was nothing wrong about the activity in itself. This is what banks do."
In the wake of Russia's economic collapse, Credit Suisse said last week that it would eliminate about 100 jobs there. But in most parts of their business, bank executives say, they have no intention of retrenching.
To be sure, Switzerland's two big banks are hardly alone. Scores of other big American and European banks, from Deutsche Bank in Germany to BankAmerica, have taken big losses in Asia and Russia. Spain's biggest banks have huge exposure in Latin America, as do American and German institutions. Compared with Japan's big banks, many surviving only on life support, the giant Swiss institutions are bastions of robust health.
For all the problems, some analysts argue that the Swiss banks retain important advantages over rivals like Deutsche Bank or ABN-Amro of the Netherlands.
With the advent of the euro as a single European currency -- even though Switzerland will remain outside the new currency zone -- the overwhelming trend in Europe is toward a handful of money-center banks, said Hans Kaufmann, an analyst at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich.
"What will happen in the new euro area is that major companies will not need 11 different local banks," Mr. Kaufmann said. "They will go for the major banks that are capable of organizing large-scale economies. At the end of the day, there is only one way you can survive and that is by being efficient."

HEADLINE: Two Foreign Affairs Agencies Are Eliminated

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Two independent foreign affairs agencies were abolished this week by a stroke of President Clinton's pen, and a third will have its independence sharply curtailed under a reorganization plan for the State Department that was championed by Republican leaders in Congress.
The two agencies, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the United States Information Agency, were abolished under the catchall spending bill that President Clinton signed on Wednesday night. 
 Their responsibilities will pass to the State Department.
The legislation allows the United States Agency for International Development to remain in business but requires it to report to the Secretary of State instead of the White House.
The moves, which had been resisted by senior officials in all three agencies, represented an important victory for Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who made the reorganization of the State Department a priority when he took over as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1994.
"This is one of the first things that he said he intended to do when he became chairman," said Mr. Helms's spokesman, Marc A. Thiessen. "Senator Helms kept pushing and it has finally happened. We've actually shut down two Government agencies. It's slimming down the bureaucracy. It's bringing more coherence to foreign affairs institutions."
The Clinton Administration agreed to support the abolishments and the reorganization in part to win concessions from Senator Helms on other foreign policy issues.
The legislation signed by President Clinton said the purpose of the reorganization was to save money through "reductions in personnel, administrative consolidation, including procurement, program consolidation and consolidation of real properties and leases."
But Clinton Administration officials said today that it was unclear how many employees of the three agencies, if any, would lose their jobs as a result of the reorganization.
"This is more a reorganization than it is a downsizing," a State Department official said.
Under the legislation, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright must submit a plan to Congress describing how the State Department will incorporate the functions of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the Information Agency into the department. The United States Information Agency oversees a variety of programs, including the Voice of America radio network and the Fulbright scholarships.

HEADLINE: Man in the News: David Michael Walker;
A C.P.A. at Center Stage

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Just before adjourning this week, the Senate approved a 47-year-old accountant for one of the Government's most powerful and important positions: Comptroller General of the United States, the chief auditor of all Federal programs, contracts and operations.
In his new job, the official, David M. Walker, will be head of the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress that sooner or later infuriates almost every senior official by exposing waste, fraud, incompetence or plain silliness in remote corners of Government. 
 Mr. Walker, a partner and managing director in the Atlanta office of Arthur Andersen LLP, will be only the seventh Comptroller General, a job that carries a 15-year term and an exceptional degree of independence. Mr. Walker differs from his predecessors in several ways.
He seems likely to have a higher profile than most other heads of the G.A.O., who were anonymous, somewhat aloof and virtually unknown outside Washington. Friends and associates say Mr. Walker is a hands-on manager, deeply engaged in any project he undertakes. He is likely to be a strong advocate for the solutions he recommends, especially in his areas of expertise, which include Social Security, Medicare, pension policy and employee benefits.
Alan A. Nadel, another partner at Arthur Andersen, said Congressional leaders, who helped select Mr. Walker, probably "don't know what they're getting themselves into." And he explained:
"David is not your typical C.P.A. He's not a paper-pusher. He doesn't just go with the flow. He definitely speaks his mind." He makes things happen. He's always looking at the big picture. He's a very strong influencer of policy."
Mr. Walker has led the expansion of Arthur Andersen's work as a consultant on human resources issues. The firm's revenues for such work have increased to $250 million this year, from $10 million in 1989. Clients include Lockheed Martin, Nationsbank and Bell Atlantic.
Mr. Nadel said that Mr. Walker typically becomes "the focal point of any meeting: When he speaks, people stop and listen because his views are so well reasoned."
Co-workers said Mr. Walker had turned down more than a few lucrative assignments because he saw conflicts of interest or other ethical problems with the work.
In an interview this week, Mr. Walker volunteered this insight into his values: "The two Presidents I identify with the most are Teddy Roosevelt and John Kennedy. Both were conservative on economic policy, but they were also progressive on social policy. That's basically where I'm at, from a philosophical standpoint."
From 1976 to 1997, Mr. Walker said, he was a moderate Republican. Before that, he was a conservative Democrat. And since last year, he has been an independent.
"Once it became evident that I was a leading candidate for Comptroller General, I felt it was important to become independent in mind, action and word," Mr. Walker said.
The Comptroller General is paid $136,700 a year, about one-sixth of what Mr. Walker makes at Arthur Andersen. The General Accounting Office has 3,300 employees (down from 5,300 in 1992) and an annual budget of $363 million. It prescribes accounting standards for all Federal agencies, passes judgment on the legality of Federal spending and evaluates hundreds of Government programs each year.
The office of Comptroller General has been vacant since October 1996, when Charles A. Bowsher stepped down. During his 15-year term, Mr. Bowsher sounded early warnings about the savings and loan crisis, investigated the 1987 stock market collapse and exposed scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Mr. Walker, who is registered as an investment adviser in several states, appears well prepared for issues likely to dominate his tenure. From 1990 to 1995, he was one of two public trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. In that role, he submitted annual reports to Congress describing the programs' financial problems.
Moreover, he has written a book explaining how to plan for retirement ("Retirement Security," John Wiley & Sons, 1997). And he has worked with clients, including a major telecommunications company, to solve problems in their pension plans, showing them how they can provide better benefits at little or no additional cost.
Stanford G. Ross, the Democratic representative on the board of trustees, said Mr. Walker was "an excellent choice" to head the accounting office. "I don't think they could have gotten anybody better," he said.
Mr. Ross said that he and Mr. Walker "did everything on a bipartisan -- indeed, nonpartisan -- basis" while they were trustees. "Dave has tremendous energy," Mr. Ross said.
David Michael Walker was born on Oct. 2, 1951, in Birmingham, Ala. His family lived in Birmingham, Tuscaloosa, Selma and Mobile, Ala., before moving to Coral Gables, Fla., when he was in the seventh grade. His father, David Sellers Walker Jr., worked for Southern Bell, eventually as head of governmental affairs in Florida.
The younger Mr. Walker received a B.S. degree in accounting from Jacksonville State University in Florida in 1973. He was a 19-year-old sophomore when he married Mary Etheredge, who was then a senior. "Dave was instantly a husband and had a future to think about," his brother Steven recalled. "He was very conservative as a student, sticking to the books and focusing on his goals."
The Walkers have two children, Carol, 24, and Andrew, 21.
After graduation, Mr. Walker worked at two big accounting firms, Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand, and then at an executive recruiting firm. From 1983 to 1989, he worked in Government. For two years, he was a senior official of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which insures private pension plans. He then moved to the Labor Department, where he became the Assistant Secretary in charge of regulating pension and health benefits for workers and retirees across the country.
When he advises clients as a management consultant, Mr. Walker emphasizes one message above all others: Smart personnel practices enhance the value of a company and its stock.
"Given labor shortages, skill gaps and demographic trends," he said, "the real winners in the 21st century will have to put a higher priority on their employees and invest more in human capital."
In a book published this month ("Delivering on the Promise," Free Press), Mr. Walker and two partners at Arthur Andersen say that "capitalism has not achieved its full potential" because many employers underestimate the importance of human capital -- the talents and skills of their employees.

HEADLINE: Home Ownership in U.S. Rises to a Record

BYLINE: Reuter 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The United States home ownership rate soared to a record of 66.8 percent in the third quarter of this year, driven by a strong economy, Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo said today.
Mr. Cuomo said 7.4 million more families owned homes than did so when President Clinton first took office in 1993. 
 The number of families owning their homes climbed to 69.1 million in the third quarter, the highest number in history and an increase from 68.3 million in the second quarter.
The home ownership rate stood at 63.7 percent at the beginning of the President's first term. Mr. Cuomo predicted that 1998 would show the highest annual rate ever.
The rate rose in every part of the country, the department said. But a huge gap between whites and minorities remained.
Among the nation's white population, home ownership hit 73.1 percent for the third quarter, up from 72.5 percent. That compares with the 46.8 percent ownership rate among blacks, up from 45.3 percent in the second quarter, and 44.9 percent among the Hispanic population, up from 43.9 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MIDEAST TALKS: THE OVERVIEW;
Mideast Talks Show Progress on Final Obstacles

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WYE MILLS, Md., Oct. 22

 BODY:
Critical issues were resolved on Thursday at the Middle East peace talks here, and President Clinton pushed early today to try to close a deal.
Possible solutions emerged on issues that include an agreement by the Palestinians to revise their charter to remove clauses calling for the destruction of Israel and to arrest 30 of 36 Palestinians the Israelis want extradited. 
 Officials also said a deal on a third withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank, as the Palestinians demand, had been reached.
"There is a clear breakthrough," the Israeli Industry Minister, Natan Sharansky, said Thursday night of the talks between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
But the deal was not finished as midnight came and went, and a senior American official cautioned that "until everything is agreed upon, nothing is agreed upon." A senior American official said early today that he was "encouraged, but we have a way to go."
To try to keep up the momentum, President Clinton asked King Hussein of Jordan to speak to the leaders and their key advisers just after 10 P.M. They all gathered at a dining table overlooking the Wye River and heard Mr. Clinton summarize the state of the talks. The King, ailing with cancer, then delivered what officials called "an impassioned speech," lasting some 10 minutes, calling on Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat to keep making progress and press for peace.
Mr. Clinton's "spirits are good -- he is determined to stick with this as long as it's a productive use of his time," Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said late Thursday night. He and James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said advances had been made on a number of issues, but that advances did not mean complete resolution.
"On the half dozen serious issues, there have been advances," Mr. Rubin said. "But an advance doesn't mean that it's closed. I've seen them talk for hours over a few words."
One critical issue apparently resolved involved the Israeli demand that the full Palestine National Council amend the Palestinian charter, formally removing 26 clauses calling for the destruction of Israel.
This issue was finessed, Israeli officials said, when the Palestinians agreed to convene the council along with other Palestinian institutions in the territories at the end of the three-month settlement. The main elements of a deal would be carried out over 12 weeks, or soon after.
American officials say the Palestinian Central Council would vote to amend the charter after eight weeks, while that vote would be ratified informally by "all relevant bodies" including parts of the Palestinian National Council.
Both Palestinian and Israeli officials say Mr. Clinton will attend that larger meeting, presumably in Gaza, but there was no immediate confirmation from the White House.
The National Council, which includes expatriate Palestinians, some of whom are wanted as terrorism suspects, will not convene as a whole, officials say, in part because of fears that it could even vote Mr. Arafat out of office. The idea of the larger meeting is to "bless the whole process in the public way the Israelis wanted," an official said.
The key compromise idea came from the Israeli Defense Minister, Yitzhak Mordechai, officials said, and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright sold it to the Palestinians.
Another issue was the Palestinian demand that the Israelis guarantee a separate troop withdrawal from the West Bank, the third called for under the 1993 and 1995 Oslo accords. The Palestinians do not want it to be simply wrapped into talks about a final settlement that would also settle the Palestinian Authority's final boundaries.
A commission of both sides working in parallel with the final peace talks will handle the timing and size of the third "redeployment," or withdrawal, essentially postponing the issue for now. The commission is supposed to report in four months, while the Americans guarantee that a withdrawal will happen. American officials said that by being handled in that way, the issue should not block the peace process later, as the first two deployments have for 19 months now.
The Israeli demand for the extradition of 36 Palestinians -- 31 of them wanted for capital offenses like murder -- was resolved with a Palestinian agreement to arrest 30 of the 31.
Progress was being made on a Palestinian demand that Israel release 3,500 Palestinian prisoners arrested for security offenses, as called for under the Oslo accords. Israel had said it would not release those "with blood on their hands." American officials say that the Israelis have agreed to release "several hundred" prisoners, and that this may be enough for a deal.
Still outstanding is the exact method by which Israel will provide safe passage for Palestinians traveling between the West Bank and Gaza.
But the Israelis have agreed, on the issue of security for the Palestinian airport in Gaza, not to search Mr. Arafat's private plane.
Hanging over the talks is Mr. Arafat's threat to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state when the Oslo process ends on May 4, 1999, if there is not significant progress toward a final peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinians by then. Mr. Netanyahu has warned Mr. Arafat against such an act, and the Americans say they oppose unilateral acts by either side.
Mr. Clinton, who arrived on Thursday morning for his sixth day of intense personal involvement here, spent the evening talking first to Prime Minister Netanyahu, while Ms. Albright spoke with Mr. Arafat, and then vice-versa, in what the Americans called "tag-team diplomacy." King Hussein of Jordan spoke to the leaders on the telephone from a nearby farm.
The main discussions were taking place in a tent off the main dining room at the conference center here, to keep the numbers of participants small, officials said. On Thursday night, Mr. Clinton reconvened a joint meeting of the key members of both delegations to try to finish off the deal.
Earlier in the evening, the Israeli and the Palestinian delegations, of about 20 people each, chatted within 20 feet of each other in the dining room, with the Israelis gathered around a fireplace on couches and chairs and the Palestinians sitting at a table. The Americans were at the main dining table, with Mr. Clinton and Ms. Albright -- as well as the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, and special envoy Dennis B. Ross -- huddling over bridging proposals to bring to one side or the other.
Mr. Rubin compared the atmosphere to "a cloakroom, with the feeling and flavor of a legislative session drawing to a close," as final deals are being made. "But that doesn't mean that they will draw to a close," he added. "But it certainly had that flavor of a lot of people standing in different parts of the same room, shuttling between one another."
Mr. Rubin spoke over a speakerphone to a huddled mass of journalists crowded around a small table in the press center here, at Chesapeake College.
The leaders were working with the text of an American plan given to them at dawn on Thursday. After 19 months of stalemate, the American plan, a product of hundreds of conversations and many drafts, seeks to lay out a deal by which, over 12 weeks, Israel will redeploy from 13 percent more of the West Bank -- 3 percent to be a nature reserve -- in stages, in return for specific Palestinian steps to combat terrorism.
While the Americans have been briefing both sides for months on drafts of the plan, this is the first time it has been physically handed to the parties.
But the sticking points were real, however incidental they seemed to the main bargain.
At least one other issue -- a seaport for the Palestinians -- is also unsettled, but need not be resolved here, since the port would not be built for three years or so.
During a crucial part of the evening, the Americans got both sides to identify the issues of most importance to them. For the Israelis, it was the charter and extradition; for the Palestinians, the third redeployment in the West Bank and the prisoner releases.
As the night wore on, the leaders came together to go over the progress on these main issues and take stock of what remained to be done. Some of these issues, like security measures for an already-built airport in Gaza, were considered minor and easily finished, but not done yet. Other such issues were safe passage and economic assistance to the Palestinians.
"They're moving," a senior American official said. "But I've watched this too long to be too optimistic."
Still, Israeli and Palestinian officials grew increasingly upbeat through a long and difficult day, the eighth one of a negotiating process Mr. Rubin called "excruciating."
But American interests, and the interests of the region, required serious efforts to "get the peace process back on track" after the 19 months of stagnation, he said.
On Thursday morning the White House gave the two sides the American compromise proposal which became a basis for the day's bargaining sessions. President Clinton said that "the hardest decisions are at last on the table." The Americans had tried to pull the two sides together throughout the day, beginning with a lunch. Afterward, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat sat alone and spoke for some 20 minutes through Mr. Arafat's translator.

240 N.B.A. Players Balk at Salary Cap

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., Oct. 22

 BODY:
Karl Malone made an impassioned plea for unity. Michael Jordan and David Robinson said the greatest obstacle their fellow locked-out players may face was divisiveness.
The largest assembly ever of National Basketball Association players -- 240 from all of the league's economic classes -- stood shoulder to shoulder today in a Caesars Palace ballroom. From Joe Kleine to Jordan, the message to the owners was clear: they will not accept a hard salary cap even if it means canceling the season. 
 "We're in it for the long haul," said Buck Williams, the former union president. "We cannot give the owners the cost certainty they feel they need. It's not going to happen."
He added: "I've been in the union for a long time, but I've never seen the resolve or the dedication to the cause like today. I was really taken aback by it. This is phenomenal."
The players voted unanimously at the end of a three-hour session that they would not accept a hard salary cap in a new collective bargaining agreement.
Asked if his presence meant he would return to the Chicago Bulls, Jordan said at a news conference after the meeting: "My mind is still open. I haven't made my decision, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't be part of the union."
The league is no closer to opening for business than it was when it canceled the first two weeks of the season on Oct. 7. The next scheduled bargaining talks will probably be held on Thursday in Manhattan.
Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, boasted that the same number of players that showed up today would attend the owners' meeting next week. However, if 100 players showed, the union would be ecstatic.
The players listened to union leaders from other sports, including Gene Upshaw, the executive director of the National Football League's players association, and Donald Fehr, who holds the same title with the Major League Baseball players association.
"My message to them was that they have some options, but in my opinion I really believe they should decertify soon," Upshaw said. "With no progress, I think they should sue."
"It was a great plea for us to stay united and stick together," Charles Barkley said. "One of the reasons they wanted all of the stars here is to let them know we're in this together. The league wants it to be about the haves and have-nots. I'm one of the haves. If I never work another day in my life, I'm going to be fine. But it's not our intention to leave the young guys or the middle-of-the-road guys out in the cold."
The scene in the hotel lobby before the meeting was surreal: 7-footers mingling with 5-foot tourists. On-court rivals such as Malone and Robinson shook hands and laughed.
Because ownership representatives from all 29 teams will be in New York on Wednesday for the league's board of governors meeting, the next talks should take place next week.
Both parties have rejected luxury-tax proposals on player salaries and accused the other side of failing to negotiate with the notion of working toward a new agreement.
Russ Granik, the N.B.A.'s deputy commissioner, said the league would decide whether to cancel more games beyond the first two weeks of the season after the board of governors meeting.
Players today were not hopeful of a quick settlement. Some openly voiced their concern about losing a season's worth of salary. As they spoke inside a ballroom, a dozen or so of the game's most prominent agents waited outside the meeting. They were updated on the progress at the day's end.
"Right now, our effort should be focused on making the deal," said David Falk, the agent for Jordan and several other superstars. "If the league makes that goal impossible, I think you have to explore the other options."
Referring to the N.B.A. commissioner, David Stern, Falk said, "I think David is way too intelligent and understands what's at risk for the owners and the fans, most importantly, to not make a deal."
Added the agent Arn Tellem: "My attitude is, if the league is going to ask for cost certainty, then David shouldn't wait until Dec. 15 to cancel the season. He can go ahead and cancel it now because the players aren't going to agree to that."
After losing a key arbitration decision on Monday that killed any opportunity for players to be paid during the lockout, a few players voiced genuine concern and wondered aloud whether a hard-line approach should be kept up against the owners.
But as they left the ballroom this afternoon, each player sounded as if he was working toward the same goal.
Said Juwan Howard, the executive vice president of the union, "After today, there will be no sell-outs."

HEADLINE: Francis W. Sargent, 83, A Massachusetts Governor

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Francis W. Sargent, the moderate Republican, defender of the environment and solver of fiscal crises who served as Governor of Massachusetts from 1969 to 1975, died today at his home in Dover, Mass. He was 83.
Mr. Sargent moved up from lieutenant governor when Gov. John Volpe was made Transportation Secretary in the Nixon Administration and was elected in 1970 over the Mayor of Boston, Kevin White, to a full term. 
 Mr. Sargent was also known for his delicately middle-of-the-road approach to Boston's busing strife and helped gain passage of a no-fault car insurance law. He backed public housing, environmental protections and a statute challenging the Vietnam War on legal grounds.
Mr. Sargent was born in Massachusetts, attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, (which led to a favorite motto of his: "Don't ask me, I didn't go to Harvard.") and went on to serve in a variety of state and Federal jobs involving fish, game, and other natural resources.
He lost an election for the state Senate in 1962 but ran successfully in 1966 for lieutenant governor. His campaign slogan was "Put Sarge in charge."
As Governor, he set a record by signing 1,000 new laws in 1971, and in 1972, he won a battle he called his own Vietnam: he helped defeat a plan for an "inner belt" expressway in Boston.
But in his run for re-election during a sour economic period in 1974 he lost to his Democratic challenger, Michael S. Dukakis, and stayed out of the central fray of politics from then on, though he taught and wrote commentary in his later years.
During the friction-filled busing period in Boston in the early 1970's, Mr. Sargent responded to the racial tension raised by the integration plan to shuttle black and white children between neighborhoods by proposing a "freedom of choice" scheme that would have allowed white children to remain in their neighborhoods while black children were bused to better schools.
Mr. Sargent was married since 1938 to his wife, Jessie, with whom he had three children, Jessie, Fay and Bill.
He was decorated for his service as a paratrooper in World War II. Upon his return from the war, he lived on Cape Cod, and, an enthusiastic fisherman, became interested in environmental issues when he saw the effects of overfishing there.
A profile earlier this month in The Boston Globe described Mr. Sargent as the last of a breed of homegrown Yankee governors that included names like Saltonstall, Peabody and Bradford.
In person, he has been described as salty and flinty in typical Yankee fashion. His penchant for economizing came in handy when Massachusetts hit a budgetary crisis brought on largely by high welfare costs. In response, Mr. Sargent pushed legislation that altered eligibility requirements for Medicaid and imposed a new tax on special interests and corporations.
Mr. Sargent suffered from heart trouble, and had recently been sharply restricted in his activities, unable to drive or fish anymore.
He had open-heart surgery in 1981. But in his interview with The Globe, he sounded as feisty as ever, asking at one point, "How'd I get to be so old?"

Democrats Renew Push in New Mexico

BYLINE: By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 

 BODY:
The Governor's race in New Mexico was a dead heat a month ago -- and it still is. Neither the Republican incumbent, Gov. Gary E. Johnson, nor his Democratic challenger, Martin Chavez, a former Albuquerque mayor, has been able to break clear.
But state and national Democratic leaders still see the contest as one of the best opportunities to pick up another governorship, and they have begun pouring in manpower and money. The Democratic Governors' Association sent a check the other day for $165,000, and over the past week both Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton, the First Lady, have dropped in to campaign for Mr. Chavez. 
 Governor Johnson, a political conservative, is hammering away with the same message that helped him get elected four years ago: that he will improve schools, but will otherwise cut state spending, along with taxes and bureaucracy, and will freely use his veto power. He insists that he is a "nonpolitician" despite almost four years in the Governor's office.
Mr. Chavez, a political moderate, says he is "a public policy person" who will concentrate on improving New Mexico's low standing nationally in social and economic rankings. The Governor, he argues, has done next to nothing to improve those rankings because he has concentrated on killing and vetoing programs.
The race may be decided by the Green Party vote, which is more important in New Mexico than in most states. Four years ago, a Green Party candidate siphoned off dissident Democratic votes, thereby helping Mr. Johnson win.
This year there is no Green Party candidate. So if Mr. Chavez can win the Greens back to the Democratic side, he just might become the state's next governor.

New Offer to Big Board

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
New Jersey officials plan to sweeten their offer to the New York Stock Exchange in the hope of persuading it to move across the Hudson River to Jersey City, a state development official said yesterday.
While the official, Gualberto Medina, chief executive of the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission, declined to offer specifics about the discussions between the exchange and the state, he said in a statement that "these discussions will include refinements of a proposal already made to the exchange." 
 New Jersey and New York have long been engaged in a high-stakes contest to find a new home for the exchange, which is desperate to escape its cramped quarters on Wall Street.
After The New York Times reported last Saturday that officials from the exchange were less than enthusiastic about New York's latest offer for a new headquarters and trading complex directly across the street from its current site, New Jersey officials have told local newspapers that they were encouraged about their chances of luring the business across the river.
Richard Adamonis, a spokesman for the exchange, declined to comment on such talk. "We continue to work with all parties, and all options remain open," he said. DAVID W. CHEN

A Hedge Fund's Stars Didn't Tell, And Savvy Financiers Didn't Ask

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and LAURA M. HOLSON 

 BODY:
Sanford I. Weill, the co-chief executive of Citigroup, excels at sizing up risks. He has swallowed up numerous firms, including Salomon Smith Barney, to create the world's largest financial company, winning praise for shrewdly negotiating the financial pitfalls of Wall Street.
Yet, when it came to doing business with the hedge fund giant Long-Term Capital Management, Mr. Weill acknowledged that he did not know enough about the dangerous bets that fund was making. 
 Long-Term borrowed heavily, made risky investments across many markets and nearly failed last month, threatening many firms with big losses. It survived only after a $3.6 billion cash investment by big brokerage firms and banks under the guiding hand of regulators worried that the fund's collapse would disrupt the global economy.
Why did seasoned financiers around the world not recognize the problem earlier? Mr. Weill, one of the few Wall Street executives to speak publicly about Long-Term, concedes the sheer star power of the fund's financial brain trust blinded him to the huge risks Long-Term was taking. The fund's managers included acclaimed economists who last year shared a Nobel Prize, former government officials and bond traders known for generating immense returns.
The downfall of Long-Term Capital Management provides a rare window on the clubby world of high finance, where decisions about where to steer vast sums can be made with few questions asked.
Like Mr. Weill, many of Long-Term's investors, lenders and trading partners were satisfied for nearly four years to put hundreds of millions of dollars at stake with only a glimpse of the fund's trading and borrowing practices. The fund provided a brief monthly financial statement, minus information on specific investments -- far less disclosure than many other hedge funds. And at times it took secrecy to great lengths. When representatives of a private Swiss bank met with the fund to discuss investing more money, notepads and pens were whisked out of the room so no one could take notes.
Long-Term also received generous terms on its loans -- like a credit line of $900 million from Chase Manhattan and other banks requiring no collateral -- and amassed far greater amounts of debt than its competitors.
Bankers typically lend to hedge funds on an overnight basis, requesting daily information to reassess the quality of the collateral, but some of Long-Term's lenders provided financing for months at a time without checking the fund's books, according to a person who has recently seen the books. Though some lenders wanted daily information about asset values and positions, Long-Term refused.
All of this permitted Long-Term to make financial bets far out of proportion to the amount of cash it had on hand.
Part of the reason no outsider knew the size of the fund's problem for so long was that everyone had only a small piece of the Long-Term puzzle. Lenders were unaware of the sums others were extending, and firms trading with Long-Term did not know anything about trades other than their own.
"I haven't met anyone who knew how big they were," said a senior executive at a major bank who insisted on anonymity. "They wouldn't let anyone look at their positions."
Why did Long-Term get special treatment? Prestige names and, in the early years, stellar returns. "When you have two Nobel laureates, plus a former Federal Reserve vice chairman, a cast of star bond traders, and have extraordinary returns for a couple of years, the whole thing becomes self-reinforcing," said Henry Hu, a professor of financial law at the University of Texas at Austin who has testified before Congress on hedge fund activities. "There was a willing suspension of disbelief by very sophisticated investors when it came to Long-Term."
That opinion was echoed privately by Wall Street executives as well as by regulators, consultants and hedge fund managers.
"I think their lineage and Nobel Prize status allowed them to provide less information, although I'm not in a position to know entirely," said Leon Cooperman, chairman of Omega Advisors, one of the world's biggest hedge funds. "We provide investors with a lot of information like balance sheet statements. Long-Term was apparently very different. Caveat emptor."
The Federal Reserve Board is now examining how well the banks it regulates gauged the riskiness of their loans to and trades with Long-Term, and is paying special attention to whether firms used computer models to test how the investments would fare in a market plunge. Banking regulators in Switzerland are conducting their own investigation.
Mr. Weill, who says his company began taking a close look at Long-Term's activities only in June, now expects more disclosure from his trading partners. "I think the lesson of this is that if it's structured so that you can't get more than a fraction of the picture," he said, "then in the future we will be taking our business elsewhere."
 
Exclusive List Of Big Clients
Hedge funds -- largely unregulated investment pools open to wealthy investors and big institutions -- aim to provide consistently outsized returns on stocks, bonds, other securities, or currencies while limiting losses from market downturns. Like the baseball slugger Mark McGwire, such funds swing for the fences. And like Mr. McGwire, winning funds attract a devoted, often rhapsodic following.
Long-Term provided eye-popping gains on the billions of dollars it managed. In 1995, investors hauled in almost 43 percent after fees and nearly 41 percent the following year, before returns dropped to about 17 percent last year.
"Unfortunately, what you get in a bull market is people who forget there is a down side, especially if they have stardust in their eyes," said Paul N. Roth, an attorney with Schulte Roth & Zabel, a law firm that represents hedge funds.
At its outset, Long-Term established relationships with global banks that it deemed strategic investors. The initial pitch, according to a person close to the fund who insisted on anonymity, was to a hand-picked group of fewer than 10 commercial and investment banks that were offered the exclusive opportunity to invest in the hedge fund.
As part of the arrangement, the hedge fund got research and intelligence on markets around the world, while the bank investors got advice on risk management from Long-Term's usually reclusive brain trust and such other perks as speakers for seminars. "We hoped the relationship would be mutually beneficial," said the person.
Big banks in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America each invested $10 million to $100 million in the fund for this privilege. The investors were heavily European and Asian, and included Dresdner Bank of Germany, Sumitomo Bank of Japan, and Merrill Lynch & Company, which helped raise much of the original capital.
The relationship between Merrill and Long-Term Capital blossomed over the years. In September 1997, about 10 executives from Merrill, including the retired chairman, Daniel Tully, convened at the famed Waterville golf course in Ireland to meet with the course's owners, which included Long-Term's founder, John W. Meriwether, and several other Long-Term partners. The group golfed and fished for trout by day and discussed global markets over sumptuous dinners.
The golf weekend was a rare event, since Long-Term was so ardently sought after as a business partner that it seldom engaged in the wining and dining that normally cements business relationships on Wall Street.
Mr. Meriwether, a legendary bond trader who left Salomon Brothers in the early 1990's in the wake of a trading scandal, recruited a coveted cadre of bond traders from his former firm. Long-Term's partnership rolls also included some marquee names: David W. Mullins, a former Harvard Business School professor and a former Federal Reserve vice chairman, and Robert C. Merton and Myron S. Scholes, two economists who would win Nobel awards for their work in modeling financial risk.
"When I met Myron Scholes I was like, 'Wow, I'm meeting Myron Scholes. Nobel Prize. This is something special,' " said a senior executive whose multinational bank traded with Long-Term but who insisted on anonymity. "They were asked fewer questions because of their pedigrees. No question."
 
The Attraction Of Celebrities
As Wall Street celebrities, Mr. Meriwether and his colleagues needed little salesmanship, attracting $1.3 billion by the time the fund began trading in February 1994. Still, whenever Long-Term's partners visited a bank abroad, they often played golf or had dinner with its executives. The banks never sent their junior people -- only senior executives met with Long-Term partners.
Long-Term's partners liked the idea of knowing their business associates personally, so disputes about trades could be worked out quickly and amicably, according to the person close to the hedge fund. And partners emphasized that their own money was at stake as "a selling point." They initially put in $100 million and later used a financial contract to increase their stake markedly.
From the beginning, the fund's partners agreed to furnish only sketchy information about their practices and not to play favorites by giving some investors, lenders or trading partners more information than others, according to people close to Long-Term and bankers.
They provided investors a monthly statement, usually just two pages. The first page showed the net asset value for the fund, a profit and loss tally, and any additions or withdrawals. The second page was an abbreviated balance sheet with quarterly information on broad categories of investing, like government bonds and equities, but no information on specific securities.
Antoine Bernheim, president of Dome Capital Management, which advises institutional investors about hedge funds, said some funds send not only a detailed write-up discussing strategy each quarter, but also a list of their 10 biggest positions. "Now the trend is toward more openness," he said.
Long-Term's penchant for secrecy extended to a meeting during the last year with bankers from Bank Julius Baer & Company, a private bank in Switzerland. At that meeting, pens and notepads were removed so the bankers could not jot down any information, according to people with knowledge of the visit. Julius Baer declined repeated requests for information about the incident or its relationship with the fund.
Even with sketchy information, big banks were lining up to lend to Long-Term, according to executives of investment and commercial banks.
Among the fund's big debts was a credit line of $900 million led by Chase Manhattan that was parceled out to two dozen other banks and not backed by any collateral -- which is unusual for hedge fund loans. Long-Term used $500 million of that credit line, which has since been repaid with the proceeds of the rescue fund.
"I think it's fair to say that banks were eager to do business with Long-Term because the firm had strong relationships and sizable positions," said Mr. Bernheim of Dome Capital. "It was the lender's responsibility to demand more information. They should have had a much bigger picture of the overall balance sheet and that seems to have been missing."
Regulators say they had warned banks about easy lending to hedge funds.
"We have had concerns about lending standards to hedge funds, and on April 28, 1994, we put out a letter to all banks expressing concern about the growth of trading activities to institutional investors, including leveraged funds," said Peter Bakstansky, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve's New York branch. "It has been a matter of continuous supervision." Despite such concerns, the Fed says it did not become aware of how much debt Long-Term Capital had until Sept. 20, when the fund verged on collapse.
Secrecy is not uncommon among hedge funds. They are not required to report their positions even to their investors. But several managers of big hedge funds said that along with providing regular, detailed statements, they gladly answer investor inquiries about their trading strategy or even a specific position, say in a stock or a bond.
Bank representatives who visited Long-Term were told what the fund was doing in concept only and nothing specific about trades. Long-Term worried that if its trading positions or strategies became too widely known, competitors would take advantage of them. And the fund's financiers deliberately did not share data with each other.
"We were concerned about exchanging information too much," said David H. Komansky, Merrill's chairman and chief executive. Firms lending to Long-Term Capital did not have a clear idea how much each had lent, he said, and sharing such information could have had legal repercussions. "Collusion is illegal," Mr. Komansky added. A top executive at another Wall Street firm echoed that belief and pointed to the painful experience of the Nasdaq trading scandal, in which firms agreed to pay hefty fines for fixing prices.
When it came to trading, Long-Term engaged in a bit of bravado. In mid-1997, the partners and Credit Suisse entered into a transaction in which the partners bet that the fund would increase in value. When the fund faltered, Credit Suisse took a hit on the complex transaction, resulting in a $55 million reduction in revenue.
Long-Term got generous agreements with its trading partners as well as its lenders. For example, a borrower wanting to buy $100 million in Treasury securities might be asked to provide $10 million of its own assets in addition to the Treasury securities as collateral. In some of its trades, Long-Term did not have to put up any additional collateral.
Clearly the appeal for banks and brokerage firms doing business with Long-Term was the enormous fees it generated. Long-Term was one of the top five money-making clients for many of the big brokerage firms, according to people on Wall Street.
The list of firms investing or trading with Long-Term ultimately became a who's who of international finance: Mr. Weill's Citigroup; Merrill; Morgan Stanley; Goldman, Sachs; Chase Manhattan; Bankers Trust; J. P. Morgan; UBS; Credit Suisse; Deutsche Bank; Sumitomo -- even the foreign exchange office of Italy's central bank.
 
Some Key Officials Join the Firm
Long-Term's global power was enhanced by the presence of former government officials at the firm. Mr. Mullins joined in 1994 as soon as he left the Federal Reserve, a move made possible because the Fed, unlike the Treasury Department, does not have a mandatory waiting period for its former officials' return to the financial sector. Mr. Mullins declined to comment.
"He was looking to move on" and asked Long-Term for advice, said the person close to the fund who insisted on anonymity. The fund's partners knew Mr. Mullins -- among other duties, he was the Fed's point man on the bond trading scandal at Salomon Brothers -- and invited him aboard.
This person said that Mr. Mullins joined after the firm had completed its initial fund-raising, but later helped with such efforts.
Alberto Giovannini, a former Italian treasury official, worked as an economist at Long-Term and played no role in encouraging the Italian central bank to become involved with the firm, according to the person close to the fund. Mr. Giovannini was primarily involved in setting up a new asset management business in Italy.
Although central banks are generally conservative investors, the Italian central bank put a lot of money into Long-Term. The foreign exchange office of Italy's central bank had a $100 million equity stake in the fund and lent it $150 million more. Antonio Fazio, head of Italy's central bank, said at a recent news conference that there was "nothing illegal" about the investment.
While questions are now being raised in Italy, regulators in Switzerland are investigating its bankers' ties with Long-Term.
One report has indicated that UBS, the former Union Bank of Switzerland, at least suspected how much debt Long-Term was taking on. According to an internal credit report cited by the Reuters news agency, UBS knew Long-Term was heavily indebted as early as December 1996. The bank report refers to a limit on dealing with a client that had "leverage," or the ratio of debt to assets, of more than 30 to one. Yet UBS estimated that, when derivatives activities were accounted for, Long-Term's leverage might be 250 to one, according to the report. UBS declined to comment on the Reuters report, citing the Swiss investigation.
Still, the bank recently announced a loss of about $700 million because of its exposure to Long-Term. Several top UBS executives, including the bank's chairman, resigned.
 
As Markets Sour, Questions Arise
Once financial markets began to plummet this summer, Long-Term's creditors and trading partners pressed the rapidly deteriorating hedge fund for more information -- and got it. It was only then that Mr. Weill -- whose firm was suffering from its own errant bond bets and would announce a month later that it was quitting the arcane business of bond arbitrage -- had his minions begin to closely examine Long-Term's bond trading strategies.
Others started to look closely, too. A banker who insisted on anonymity said he visited Long-Term's partners in August "and sat with them for about two and a half hours and talked about the kinds of things you would want to know when there's stress in the system, and I got much more disclosure than previously."
By then, what bankers heard was disconcerting. Besides the extraordinary debt burden, the fund had been engaging in risky trades and had been responsible for big moves in certain markets. In one instance, a major bank estimated that Long-Term's trading was responsible for 30 percent of the volatility on the major French stock index, the CAC-40, during much of 1998.
Bankers also discovered that Long-Term's computer model was terribly outmoded in its capacity to test how the fund's investments would perform in an unusually rough market.
For its part, once a little daylight was let in, Long-Term was reminded why it never wanted to broadcast its trading positions or strategies. Investors were invited in over the summer to help inject some money into the firm to keep it afloat. But individuals close to the fund's operations believe that some potential investors simply used what they learned to begin speculating against Long-Term, betting the fund would collapse.
Regulators, also late to discover the size of the problems lurking behind Long-Term's glittering facade, feared that a collapse would undermine the global financial system. So a rescue of the hedge fund by a consortium of investment and commercial banks was arranged in late September.
Whatever infatuation Wall Street bankers once had with Mr. Meriwether and his colleagues, they are now putting distance between them. When members of the banks arranging the rescue gathered at the offices of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom one day late last month, Mr. Meriwether was not invited. When he did show up the next day, he was sequestered in an office far away from the meeting room, people who attended said. To talk to Mr. Meriwether, bankers stepped out into the hallway.
And the starry-eyed interaction that characterized previous encounters was notably absent. "There wasn't any backslapping," said one person at the meeting, "and there was no talking about golf."

Sparkling Wine Makers Look Beyond the Year 2000

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: EPERNAY, France

 BODY:
Champagne is to New Year's as cotton candy is to carnivals. So, with the millennium approaching, and with it the biggest New Year's Eve party in a while, makers of sparkling wine throughout Europe are happy to talk about how well they are doing these days.
In this quaint city at the heart of the Champagne district in northeastern France, as elsewhere in the country and in Spain and other countries, sparkling wine makers are busily taking orders for the celebration. Some wineries will release special millennium champagnes, others have increased the amounts they produce, and there will be emphasis on distinctive packaging, with bigger bottles and memorable labels. 
 The makers of champagne -- who are expected to deliver 280 million bottles worldwide this year -- expect to top 300 million for the first time ever in 1999. The makers of cava, the sparkling wine from northeastern Spain, expect to sell 215 million bottles in 1998, 20 percent more than last year, and are forecasting similar growth in 1999.
"The world of bubbles is booming," said Daniel Lorson, spokesman for the organization here that represents the Champagne producers.
But among those bubbles is at least one cloudy enough to cause analysts and wine makers to worry.
As the economic malaise in Asia threatens to put a damper on sales in a region that no longer has much to celebrate and to infect the rising middle class in other emerging markets that have proven lucrative to European sparkling wine makers, the industry is banking increasingly on the turning of the millennium to maintain the momentum of its recovery from a severe battering in the early 1990's. Indeed, wine makers are so optimistic that some experts are increasingly apprehensive about a possible post-2000 hangover.
"The next two years will be very positive for Champagne," said Jean-Marie L'Home, an analyst with Banque Nationale de Paris. "After that, we'll see."
For now at least, the industry's overall export business is coming up roses. This year, producers of cava will export 105 million bottles, double the amount five years ago; in France, exports of champagne will rise to 110 million bottles, up from 73 million in 1992. "They have very, very good income," said Michel Bettane, editor of Revue du Vin de France, a French trade publication.
Indeed, Champagne sales qualify as one of the few bright spots for luxury goods conglomerates like LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French group that makes not only Louis Vuitton bags and Hennessy brandy but also owns several of the most prestigious Champagne brands, including Moet & Chandon.
Flagging sales in Asia, where LVMH generates roughly half its revenue, have pushed its share price down to about 950 French francs, or $158, from 1,600 last year. But of all LVMH's businesses, Champagne "is getting more profitable, and is the only one improving," said Joseline Gaudino, who follows the group at Societe Generale in Paris.
Production of French Champagne, in the region that invented sparkling wine in the 17th century, represents just 4 percent of total French wine production. But in 1997, Champagne generated roughly 33 percent of France's $4 billion in earnings from wine exports.
It was not always so for the industry.
In the heady years of the 1980's, sales of sparkling wines like Champagne and Spanish cava, borne aloft by the decade's conspicuous consumption, grew rapidly. By 1989 champagne makers delivered 249 million bottles to consumers, compared with 35 million bottles in the 1950's. In Spain, cava's triumph was equally spectacular. In 1989, sales reached 142 million bottles, up from 81 million a decade earlier.
But as corks popped around the globe, prices for sparkling wine soared, as did the cost of the grapes used to make it. In 1992, as recession engulfed Europe, the bubble burst. That year, Champagne sales plummeted to 214 million bottles; by the following year, sales of cava had slumped to 128 million bottles.
In the United States, one of the biggest markets, consumption of sparkling wines peaked in 1985 at 18 million 9-liter cases (216 million bottles) but then hit the skids and declined to about 12 million cases (144 million bottles) last year.
"Until two years ago, one of every two companies in the Champagne region was losing money," said Jean-Marie Laborde, chief executive of Moet & Chandon, which has made Champagne since 1724.
When the market collapsed, prices did, too. In France, Champagne prices dropped by as much as 65 percent, and those who rarely drank Champagne before could not resist picking at the bargains.
That, paradoxically, started a market recovery. Faced with the dilution of Champagne's image by excessive sales, big houses like Moet & Chandon introduced new and fancier products to revive Champagne's cachet, and poured millions of dollars into promoting their qualities.
Bollinger, for example, a family- owned producer, focused on educating the consumer. "The way people drank Champagne in the 80's, like a bottle of beer in the wine bars, was wrong," said Guy Bizot, director of marketing at Bollinger, which countered the trend by publishing a "charter of ethics and quality," and spruced up its labels to improve their products' image and explain them to consumers.
Wine makers poured on the marketing, though, to counter the biggest obstacle to a comeback -- fresh competitors from abroad.
In Australia, giants like Southcorp, one of the world's largest producers of premium wines, began delivering to Europe and Japan. In the United States, E.& J. Gallo Winery, with sparkling wines that were drinkable yet cost as little as $3.99 a bottle, did likewise.
Pressed to the wall, European sparkling wine makers realized they had to respond or be marginalized in the marketplace.
In Europe, where 80 percent of the world's sparkling wines are consumed, there was lavish spending to plant the idea that sparkling wine was essential to a comfortable style of life. Companies with grand old names like Veuve Clicquot and Piper-Heidsieck emphasized the inherent difficulty of producing Champagne and the cachet that its relative scarcity afforded.
"There is a sex appeal to Champagne, almost a physical attraction," said Michel Bourqui, of the Office International de la Vigne et du Vin, a Paris trade organization that helped devise the strategies.
At the same time, Spanish cava makers used aggressive marketing, with film stars like Sharon Stone and Paul Newman, and more affordable prices to expand their market share.
The efforts have clearly paid off as the wine companies -- each with markedly differing strategies -- appeal to different groups of customers. And all of them, keeping in mind that possible sales hangover, are getting ready to pull out the stops for the millennium.
Moet & Chandon, which dominates the French business, will put a special double-sized magnum on sale in January for $60 to $70 a bottle with a silk ribbon, the date 2000 and a red wax seal. As a promotion, it is donating Jeroboams (double magnums, and thus the equivalent of four bottles) of its premier Dom Perignon champagne to charities in the United States for fund-raising. The first of the big bottles, which were auctioned last year, fetched $2,500 to $4,000 each.
But the real growth at Moet has come from a proliferation of champagne varieties, many sold under its lower-priced Mercier label, the No. 1 brand in France. "We decided to open to the consumer more choices," Mr. Laborde, the Moet & Chandon executive, said. "We used to be like Ford: any color, as long as it's black." Yet Moet's growth next year will be "lower than the Champagne industry," he said, so that "if there is a hangover afterward, it will be less so for us."
Bollinger, which dates from 1829, is also preparing a millennium bottle, but Mr. Bizot called it "nothing out of the ordinary, for Bollinger." With thinly veiled swipes at big corporate competitors like LVMH and Seagram, which owns Mumm and Perrier Jouet, Mr. Bizot said scarcity was a valuable marketing device to maintain Champagne's exclusive image. "You cannot take advantage of a situation to jeopardize our future," he said. "I think a lot of companies are doing that."
Among Spanish cava makers, estimates of next year's sales vary.
At the Freixenet wineries in the village of Sant Sadurni, south of Barcelona, the director of domestic sales, Jose Maria Ferrer, who until last year directed operations in the United States, ventured that "sales in 1999 will be huge."
Across town at Freixenet's rival, Codorniu, the forecast is more cautious. "The trade is definitely going to load in next year," said Clay Philipp Daum, export director at Codorniu, a market leader. "How much consumers will consume, no one will know till January of 2000."
Indeed, although robust sales are certainly expected, no one knows exactly how much more Champagne will be consumed in the holiday season next year than in ordinary years. Moreover, since Champagne must be aged, the sparkling wines that will be used to toast in the new millennium have already been made.
"For me as a wine maker, the year 2000 is already in the cellar," said Richard Geoffroy, chief taster at Dom Perignon.
Could supplies run out, and bottles of Champagne be available only at outrageous prices, or through shady black market channels? Or might the whole thing fizzle?
Perish the thought. If the industry succeeds in making steady customers of merely 5 percent to 10 percent of those consumers who on New Year's Eve 1999 will taste sparkling wine for the first time, Mr. Ferrer says, it can celebrate itself and weather any headache the morning after.
In fact, Mr. Laborde of Moet & Chandon said he believed the best antidote to a slump may yet prove to be Asia. "The next three years will not be what we expected two years ago," he acknowledged. But a recovery in Southeast Asia, led by a revival of the Japanese economy, might just coincide with the early years of the new millennium.
"We believe in those markets," he said. "They have 30 million to 50 million people with occidental buying power."

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN;
Focusing on Jobs, Education and the Economy

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview yesterday with Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker and Democratic candidate for governor, by editors and reporters of The New York Times:
I think George Pataki is a hologram. He's there, but he's not there. 
 I don't remember him ever participating in a debate; he never has, to my knowledge. I don't remember him ever standing at a press conference and answering any question you wanted to ask. I don't remember him in anything other than a very orchestrated setting.
I am willing to sit down and debate him on very important substantive issues, which I'll get to in a moment, any time, anyplace, anywhere. The only condition I'm setting is that it be in the state of New York -- and with or without the other candidates. At his time, at his pleasure, at his convenience. Since that time, this same mysterious answer: "I want to do it, but it's not up to me. It's up to someone else." That's his entire reign as Governor. It's apparently not up to him; it's up to someone else.
I have put forth issues which I think are very, very important. That's the only reason I'm running, is that I believe that this state is crying out for reform. I believe that we have a Governor who either doesn't understand, he doesn't know or he doesn't seem to care.
Let's take job creation: I was shocked, when I traveled throughout the rest of the state, at the lack of job creation, the lack of hope even for attracting new industry into our state. . . .
In Buffalo, N.Y., which is a desolate region, George Pataki did a commercial four years ago at a closed General Motors factory with 1,500 workers that are gone. He lambasted Mario Cuomo. It's still closed.
We just had a bill passed in the State Legislature -- Republican Senate, Democratic Assembly, nearly unanimous -- which gives you as governor the right to give a preference for 5 percent. He vetoes it. He vetoes it and says, "I'm more worried about retaliation from the other states than I am about -- " I said, "Retaliation?"
I wouldn't mind if we were No. 1, but we're No. 47 out of 48 in job creation. That's a substantive issue. Should he not be coming forward and talking about this? Why? I mean, what is this great fear of retaliation that he has, since we're in such a difficult situation as it is now in the state?
 
The State Economy
Yes, there's been jobs created, but we are in last place, literally, in terms of job creation. And that's because of a booming national economy, which is not booming in New York State. If we just looked to New York first before we gave contracts out, we would have more than $3 billion of economic activity and more than 40,000 new jobs. That's just from our existing companies.
If we ordered Kodak film, for instance, buying film for the City of New York -- if I just bought Kodak film from Rochester, where it's being made, that's the kind of thing I'm talking about.
 
Health Care
 The problem is, three million New Yorkers are working who can't afford health insurance. If you are on Medicaid, you don't have this problem. If you are on Medicare, you don't have this problem. But we have working people who can't afford health care, three million of them.
So we came up with a plan. Our plan is since the H.M.O.'s and the insurance companies are involved in, how many different systems -- there were something like 43 different systems -- why don't we eliminate them all, use the Medicare as the formula to follow, and have a one-single-source situation. Get rid of the 25 percent profit that is now being taken out of the system for the private insurance companies. Use the $1.8 billion -- which is the lowest figure, I understand -- of the tobacco settlement. We have $1.8 billion coming in from a tobacco settlement for a 20-year period. Each year, $1.8 billion for 20 years. Take that for two purposes: one, to make sure that the -- what we call quality care system -- health system works at at least a 10 percent reduction; two, to reduce the Medicaid disproportionate burden that's placed on every single municipality throughout the state of New York.
 
Public Education
 Kids are graduating school today owing more money than it cost most of us to own a home where I come from, in Queens County, or anyplace else in the state. And you've got to do something about making public education not only excellent and competitive from preschool, but right through the university system. And instead of closing the doors of the CUNY-SUNY system to people who need help, it strikes me that we have to start at a much earlier age. So I have programs that we have reduced class size to -- the President's goal is 18 -- but we're down to, like, 23 or 24, 25.
I have a substantive after-school program that we're funding; we have a preschool program and I have a university program. And my question to George Pataki is, why did you slash funding for higher education, why did you raise tuition by 30 percent? Do you understand the difference between slashing funding and vetoing funding of $500 million, which you just did in the latest budget, and putting $500 million for prisons? Do you understand that perhaps if we do something at a lower end, that we may not need as many prisons as we go into the future?
 
 Campaign Financing
 I know a heck of a lot more about campaign financing now than I did when I started this campaign. Do you have any conception what's going on out there? Do you have any realization about the accumulation of funds that is taking place in a Pataki-D'Amato machine? Do you have any idea of why so many people are giving to that campaign and are afraid to give to any other campaign?
Are you aware of the fact that there are at least four United States attorneys' investigations all directly involved in campaign financing?
 Referring to his opponent He's out of town. He's out of touch. And he's out of issues. And it's fine. I mean, have we gotten to the point now where, because someone has raised enough money and he's the favorite or she's the favorite, that's who we should endorse? Is that where we are now? So why bother with elections at all? Why don't we just figure out who's got the most money and let's have our papers endorse him or her? If that's what we've come to.
I'm really outraged that there is no outrage out there. You know, I'm not running this campaign because I'm trying to get name recognition. I honestly believe I could be an excellent governor, far better than the existing Governor, or I would not have run.
Now he's a nice enough guy. I don't know anything about him, other than what has been orchestrated for me to see. And I don't think anybody else does. And I think it's absolutely essential that we do something to reform the system. And the way I see it, nobody seems to care. And that, to me, is very, very troubling.
While this may not show on the polls -- campaign financing and reform -- I still believe that it's having an effect out there. It really does. When I go out there and I tell people: "You're not going to be able to run for governor. You're not going to be able to tell your kids or your grandchildren, 'You're going to be able to run for governor someday' unless you have $100 million liquid assets on the side. And if that's what we've come to, we might as well go back to the British Empire and let just aristocrats run the country, if that's where we're at. And that folks, is where we're at.

HEADLINE: U.N. Report Faults Big Accountants in Asia Crisis

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
After putting their stamp of approval on the financial statements of Asian financial institutions that then collapsed, the world's five largest accounting firms are coming under increasing pressure to strengthen their auditing procedures in Asian and other emerging markets.
The Big Five, which audit almost all major corporations in the United States, also audited most of the big Asian banks that failed last year, according to a new study by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Investors and lenders had been given a false sense of assurance that the banks were strong, the study said, when they saw the accounting firms' names on the audited financial statements. 
 The study, an early draft of which was obtained by The New York Times, concluded that the Asian crisis would have been detected sooner if the banks and companies had been forced to follow stronger accounting rules than those now in use in most Asian countries. The study urged the Big Five firms to do the same strong auditing tests on financial statements in Asia that they do in the United States and Europe.
The World Bank is also pressing the accounting firms to do more to get Asian banks and companies to use better accounting. The lending agency wants the accountants to ask the companies they audit to follow international standards, which are stronger than the rules now followed in Thailand, Indonesia, China and other Asian countries.
If the companies refuse, the World Bank wants the accounting firms not to sign the financial statements with their world-famous names -- PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, KPMG, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and Arthur Andersen.
In many Asian countries, the global accounting concerns have gained a presence by taking over local firms. The World Bank wants the big firms to instead sign the name of the local accounting firms if their clients apply the weaker local rules in preparing their financial statements.
"There is a major expectation gap when they put their global names on accounts that don't meet international standards," said Jules W. Muis, the World Bank's vice president and controller.
Mr. Muis said the big accounting firms "have been in the forefront" of an international effort to get Asian governments to adopt stronger accounting rules. "But at the moment," he said, "it's not enough."
The Big Five say that they must follow the accounting and auditing rules that are now in place in every country. And, they say that they are doing what they can to move countries toward using a single set of global rules.
"Just like electrical outlets are different in every country, so are the accounting rules," said Robert A. Campbell, regional managing partner for the Asia-Pacific region at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. "The Big Five are eager to apply consistent standards around the world."
The accounting firms and the World Bank are both helping a group known as the International Accounting Standards Committee complete its work on a set of global rules.
The group hopes that most countries will adopt the international rules so that investors can easily compare companies around the world.
But even the international rules are weaker and less detailed than the accounting standards in place in the United States, so it is doubtful that Washington regulators would allow companies following the international rules to trade their shares on exchanges in the United States.
Mr. Muis said it would be difficult to get other countries to adopt the more detailed American accounting standards.
"Throwing those at the world would probably be counterproductive," he said, "because the world would not understand."
The United Nations study, which will be released early in November, reviewed the financial statements of the largest companies and banks in South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.
In its preliminary conclusions, the study said that poor accounting did not directly cause the Asian financial crisis that began in the summer of 1997. But it said that the Asian financial difficulties would have been detected sooner, and the crisis would have been less severe, if the accounting methods used by the companies and their auditors had been stronger.
The study also attributed part of the blame for the crisis to international money managers, financial analysts and credit-rating agencies.
Knowledgeable international investors continued to pour money into East Asia, the study said, even when they knew that the companies followed weak accounting rules and could easily hide their financial problems.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Rally in Equities Takes a Holiday; Dow Declines 80.85

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stock prices retreated yesterday, breaking a run of seven advancing sessions, the longest in 16 months.
No particular news seemed to account for the broad downturn, though the procession of quarterly earnings reports and company projections again claimed casualties. The victory parade for the New York Yankees was said to have held down midday volume. 
 Even in decline, smaller companies continued to fare better than the blue chips, with the Nasdaq market -- including some high-technology giants -- easing five-tenths of 1 percent, or 8.78 points, to 1,693.86, while the Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 1 percent, or 80.85 points, to 8,452.29. The Russell 2000, composed of small companies, managed a marginal advance. Most analysts seemed unfazed by the setback, regarding it as a normal respite after an almost unbroken two-week advance that began just as major indexes flirted with declines of 20 percent from their peaks, the standard definition of a bear market.
"The market is due for a pause, especially before a weekend," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal & Company. "It doesn't hurt to have some consolidation here, a little pullback."
On the other hand, some said the underpinnings of the extended rise had been none too solid, as reflected in the unimpressive volume of rising stocks compared with falling stocks.
"The last few days, the quality of the rally has been mediocre at best," said Nora McAuley, a technical analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "For a big up leg, you need to see 3-1 or better" for the ratio of advancing to declining volume.
Ms. McAuley called the last two weeks an interim rally in a downtrend and said it was "not unlikely" the market would slip back and test its Oct. 8 lows.
Stocks were also lower in most foreign markets yesterday. But except for Brazil, where the Bovespa index slumped 4.36 percent, none fell much more than 1 percent.
The biggest contributors to the Dow's decline yesterday were Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which dropped 4, to 77 7/16 , after it reported a 9.3 percent profit decline. The stock fell 2 13/16 on Thursday. Next came Merck, J. P. Morgan and DuPont, all down between 2 and 3.
"We've rolled 1,000 points" from the Dow's Aug. 31 low, said Philip Schettewi, managing partner at Loomis, Sayles in Washington.
He added, "I think it's just natural short-term profit taking."
Among blue-chip gainers, Citigroup did best yesterday, rising 1 9/16 , to 46 5/8. Wal-Mart climbed 1 3/16 , to 68, and Johnson & Johnson, rose 5/8, to 83 3/4.
With a few exceptions, computer and software stocks were mostly lower. Microsoft, however, slumped 3 5/8, to 106 3/8, following a sizable gain, while Gateway beat earnings forecasts and rose 1 7/8, to 51 5/8.
Bankers Trust jumped 5 1/2, to 66 7/8, in a weak bank group. It said it would turn a profit this month after having reported a huge third-quarter loss. Brokerage stocks were mixed, with Schwab, up 1 3/8, to 45 3/8, the best performer after announcing a dividend increase and a 3-for-2 split.
Cox Communications, which hit a 52-week high on Thursday, dropped 5 yesterday, to 56, in a broad retreat in cable company shares. At least one analyst downgraded Cox.
Other movers included Dole Food, down 5, to 29 5/8, after warning of poor third-quarter profits because of a world slump in banana prices.
On the New York Stock Exchange, 637.6 million shares changed hands, compared with 754.8 million on Thursday. Losing issues dominated winners, 1,709 to 1,292, with 33 issues making new lows and 22 new highs.

Bonds Prices Weaken
(By Bloomberg News)
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday, as the turmoil that gripped financial markets in recent months began to abate and investors moved away from the refuge of Treasury securities.
Confidence in world financial markets "is gradually returning," said Tad Rivelle, who helps manage about $2.4 billion in bonds at Metropolitan West Asset Management in Los Angeles.
The price of the 30-year Treasury fell 21/32 , to 104 29/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.17 percent from 5.13 percent Thursday.
Even after this week's declines, 30-year Treasury bonds have had a total return of 16 percent so far this year.
Yet the rally that drove long-term bond yields to a three-decade low of 4.69 percent on Oct. 5 has halted, at least for now, analysts said. "We're seeing a reversal of the flight to quality," said Bill Hornbarger, a fixed-income strategist at A. G. Edwards & Company in St. Louis.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE MIDWEST;
Republicans Are Flush and Scenting Victory

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: OMAHA, Oct. 19

 BODY:
These are flush times for Republicans in the Midwest, and Mike Johanns is not being shy about it.
"We are within days of recapturing the governor's office," Mr. Johanns, the Republican candidate for governor in Nebraska, crowed to a luncheon of the Benson Women's Republican Club in a church basement on the north side of Omaha. As for the other state and Federal offices, he asserted, "If we do our job right, we'll have a clean sweep." 
 If the polls are any gauge, he is probably right. In the latest poll, Mr. Johanns leads his opponent, Bill Hoppner, by 20 percentage points in their race to replace Gov. Ben Nelson, a Democrat who is barred by law from seeking a third term. Republicans are expected to retain all three of the state's Congressional seats; in fact, no Democrat is running in the Third Congressional District. In state races, the Democrats are running no candidates for two seats on the Nebraska Public Service Commission, which regulates phone service, and the Democratic candidate for attorney general was chosen by the party only after no candidate made the filing deadline and a write-in candidate declined to run.
"It's not just the governor's office, it's up and down the line," said Dr. Robert Sittig, a political science professor at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln.
Democrats have seen better days in much of the Midwest. Only Nebraska, Indiana and Missouri have Democratic Governors. And Republicans are considered likely winners in at least seven of the nine governors' races in November.
Republicans now control 14 of the 23 legislative chambers in the 12 Midwestern states. (Nebraska's unicameral legislature is nonpartisan.) Democratic United States Senate seats in Ohio, Illinois and Wisconsin are considered vulnerable and Democrats are in tough races to retain Congressional seats in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin.
"The Midwestern Republicans have done much better in the 1990's than they did in the 1980's," said John C. Green, director of the Bliss Institute, a nonpartisan political research institute at the University of Akron. "These folks have been able to take their program down to the state legislatures. Even when they don't win, they're kind of the dominant force politically."
In the last few years, especially since Republicans won control of Congress in the 1994 elections, the party's influence has grown stronger and deeper in nearly every Midwestern state, experts say.
They say Midwestern Republicans have crafted a different strain of elected official. Drawing on the plain-spoken, no-nonsense Midwest ethos -- and realizing that to win they have to play to urban centers like Cleveland and Detroit -- these politicians are seen as pragmatic and moderate, focusing more on fiscal and administrative issues and less on ideological ones.
"The Midwestern Republican parties are much more moderate than the party at large and than the South," Professor Green said. "They tend to stay away from issues that you can't compromise on: abortion, gun control, gay rights. Some of these Midwestern Republicans are kind of uninspiring people. They are really managers rather than ideologues. You ask them where are the big policy changes and they just give you a blank look -- 'This is the big policy change. We're running the government well.' "
These Republicans are not only interested in running government efficiently, but also in using the government to implement policy, experts say.
Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin has been the nation's most aggressive governor on welfare reform, an issue that has also been seized by Gov. John M. Engler of Michigan and Gov. George V. Voinovich of Ohio. And Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois and Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa have tried to convince more conservative Republican legislators to increase education funding.
"They aren't conservatives who don't want to do anything," said John Bibby, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee. "They want to solve problems."
Many Republican candidates for statewide office in the Midwest seem to fit the more moderate mold. In the Kansas primary for governor, Gov. Bill Graves defeated a candidate backed by the conservative Christian right. In Nebraska, Mr. Johanns, the Mayor of Lincoln, who describes himself as a "pragmatic conservative," defeated two more conservative opponents in the primary.
One exception is Peter Fitzgerald, a Republican Illinois State Senator who is ahead in the polls against Senator Carol Moseley-Braun. Experts said they believed that his conservative views would make victory difficult were it not for Ms. Moseley-Braun's political and personal missteps.
In general, Democrats say Republican efforts to embrace more moderate constituencies, and their ability to preside over the recent booming economy, have made it difficult for Democratic challengers.
"There wasn't enough difference between me and Bill Graves to motivate moderate Republicans to vote for me," said Jim Slattery, a former Democratic Congressman from Kansas who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1994 against Mr. Graves. "That's the problem that Democrats are running into. If you drift to the right or the left, there isn't much room in there before you drift into the danger zone."
In this climate, it seems no accident that in Indiana, former Gov. Evan Bayh, a Democrat who is given a solid chance of winning the race for Senate, uses the word "conservative" several times in his advertising and does not mention the word "Democrat." In Illinois, the Democratic nominee for governor, Representative Glenn Poshard, with his opposition to abortion rights and some gay rights issues, as well as his past votes against gun control, has been seen as more conservative than the Republican candidate, Secretary of State George Ryan.
James Reichley, a professor of political science at Georgetown University, said that with the decline in Midwest Democratic machine politics and the further sprawling of cities into the suburbs, Democrats "can't rely on those bases like they used to, in cities like Detroit and Cleveland."
In Nebraska, the Republican ascendancy did not happen overnight. Registered Republicans in the state have long outnumbered Democrats, but Dr. Sittig said there had been such a strong Republican surge in the past few years that there were now about 125,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats. Republicans have even pulled ahead in Douglas County, which includes Omaha and has been the most reliable source of Democrats.
And registered Republicans now seem more likely to vote Republican. Over the years, Nebraska, proud of its independent-minded voters, has elected many Democratic governors and senators. But in 1996, Chuck Hagel, a Republican businessman and political newcomer, won a race for the United States Senate against Governor Nelson.
"For whatever reason we've seemed to always elect Democrats," said Kerry Winterer, chairman of the Douglas County Republican Party. "Historically, we've always had this populist streak, and, frankly, I think that's what changed. Republicans have done a better job of trying to get people to identify with parties."
Mr. Hoppner, a former aide to Senator Bob Kerrey and former Senator Jim Exon, said he was confident, polls notwithstanding, that Nebraskans would continue voting for Democratic governors.
"There's more and more Nebraskans that understand what my background is and what I'm about," he said.
But Anne Boyle, chairwoman of the Nebraska Democratic Party, said it had been difficult for Democrats to raise enough money to campaign across a large rural state. She also believes, Ms. Boyle said, that Republicans have managed to win the votes of anti-abortion Democrats. Ms. Boyle said she was trying to re-energize the party and noted that Democrats had historically been able to unseat Republican governors after just one term.
But these days, there is even talk about whether Governor Nelson, considered a conservative Democrat, will switch parties. Mr. Nelson, who is believed to be toying with another run for the Senate in 2000, says he did not start the speculation. But he is not discouraging it either.
"I've been very careful not to rule anything in or rule anything out," Mr. Nelson said.

Stocks Decline Slightly After Advancing for 7 Days
Stock prices retreated yesterday, breaking a run of seven advances, the longest in 16 months. No particular news seemed to account for the downturn, though the procession of quarterly earnings reports and company projections of weaker results again claimed casualties. Wall Street's victory parade for the New York Yankees was said to have held down midday volume. 
 Even in decline, smaller companies continued to fare better than blue chips, with the Nasdaq market -- including some high-technology giants -- easing 8.78 points, to 1,693.86. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 80.85 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 8,452.29. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 7.81 points, to 1,070.67. Page C3.
 
Treasury bond prices fell, reflecting the diminished allure of United States Government securities as a safe investment. The price declines pushed up the yield on the 30-year issue to 5.17 percent from 5.13 percent. C3.
 
Scandal Leads to NEC Resignation
Tadahiro Sekimoto, the chairman of the computer-chip maker NEC, has resigned that post to take responsibility for a military-procurement scandal. He also resigned an influential post at the Keidanren, Japan's largest business organization. C2.
 
Judge Rules Against Orange County
A Federal judge has rejected the main legal argument Orange County has been using in its lawsuits against more than a dozen securities firms in connection with the county's 1994 bankruptcy. C2.
 
Apparel Maker Anne Klein for Sale
Anne Klein & Company, the women's sportswear maker, is for sale and industry executives estimate it could sell for $50 million to $100 million although it has been losing money for several years. The company has brought in new designers, changed the name of its Anne Klein II line, shown left, to just Anne Klein, and started an advertising campaign featuring well-known women politicians, executives and athletes wearing its clothes to bolster sales. C3.
 
AMP Lost $76.3 Million in Quarter
AMP, which is fighting off a proposed takeover by Allied Signal, reported a third-quarter loss of $76.3 million, or 35 cents a diluted share, and said it planned layoffs that would now total 4,200 employees. C15.
 
Health Insurers Warned
The Clinton Administration threatened to impose fines on insurance companies that refuse to sell coverage to elderly Medicare beneficiaries. H.M.O.'s in 30 states have notified the Government that they are pulling out of Medicare or reducing their service areas on Jan. 1, in part because their costs have risen faster than expected. A15.
 
Malaysia Proposes Own Cure
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia presented a 1999 budget intended to pull the economy out of its first recession in more than a decade. The plan, which calls for tax cuts for favored industries, reflects Mr. Mahathir's philosophy of spending more to bolster corporate health and create employment. He blamed foreign currency speculators and the International Monetary Fund for much of Asia's crisis. C15.
 
Ellington Capital Covered Its Losses
Ellington Capital Management, the hedge fund firm in Old Greenwich, Conn., that was forced to sell many of its holdings to meet margin calls earlier this month, told its investors that the losses in its three funds, while sizable, appeared to be limited. C2.
 
Head of Telecom Italia Resigns
Gian Mario Rossignolo, the chairman of Telecom Italia, resigned after 10 months in that position. He had been criticized by some board members for a series of errors. C2.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: CONNECTICUT;
In Debate, Dodd's Rival Says Senator Does Little for State

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

DATELINE: NEW LONDON, Conn., Oct. 23

 BODY:
Gary A. Franks, the Republican seeking to unseat Senator Christopher J. Dodd, used their opening debate tonight to scold Connecticut's senior Senator repeatedly, accusing him of missing crucial votes and paying more attention to Hollywood than to the home crowd.
Senator Dodd, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, disputed few of the accusations, but instead responded placidly and with occasional humor, stressing accomplishments like his sponsorship of the Family Medical Leave Act, which allows workers to take time off without pay to care for a sick child or family member. 
 Mr. Franks brought up the D.N.C. -- the issue his staff calls "the bomb" because of the associated campaign fund-raising controversies -- when he noted that Mr. Dodd had served 24 years in the House or Senate without serving as ranking member or chairman of a committee. Mr. Franks, said, "The only thing he headed was a party, and that doesn't count, as far as I'm concerned." He added that Connecticut was not receiving its fair share of Federal funds.
"Wake up!" he told Mr. Dodd at one point. "We need these dollars." Mr. Franks went on, "You can't explain this away, Chris. You've missed so many votes, you don't show up, you've stayed away from the state 90 consecutive weekends -- 90 consecutive weekends. How are you supposed to be in touch with the people of Connecticut?"
Mr. Dodd said he believed he had delivered for the people of Connecticut, and said he would leave it up to them to decide if he had enough clout. "It's not just the chair you sit in," he said, "it's what you do in the chair you're in." He then joked that, in view of some of the budget cuts Mr. Franks supported when he was in Congress, he wished that Mr. Franks had missed a few more votes than he did.
Senator Dodd said he had a voting record of 98 percent for the last six years, and 95 percent for his 18 years in the Senate.
The debate, held in a renovated theater now called the Garde Arts Center, was sponsored by The Day of New London and the League of Women Voters of Connecticut.
Mr. Franks referred over and over to Senator Dodd as "Chris," while the Senator consistently referred to Mr. Franks as "my opponent." The format was loose, allowing the candidates to decide how many rebuttals they wanted to take. At one point, when the moderator asked if he wanted to respond to one of Mr. Franks's fusillades, Mr. Dodd suppressed his apparent annoyance and said, "Why don't you just move along?"
When asked about campaign financing, Mr. Franks said 75 to 85 percent of his contributors were from Connecticut, a statement he said his opponent could not make. "Most of his dollars are coming from New York City, Washington, D.C., and California -- the Hollywood, Beltway, Broadway candidate," Mr. Franks said. Senator Dodd responded that he had received donations from 8,000 individuals, half of which were for $100 or less. "I also believe that my strongest support has come from small donors."
"He's being far too modest," Mr. Franks cut in, "because he's one of the leaders of the PAC."
In Mr. Franks's closing statement, he referred to his status as a Republican who is black. "There are some people out there who are of color who may have never voted for a Republican, and there are some white people out there who may have never voted for a black individual," he said. "I know that in this great state of ours, that's not an impediment, it's just an interesting little twist. And I also know that when all is said and done, when you look at my record versus my opponent, what I plan to do for Connecticut and for your families, you will see a distinct difference."
Senator Dodd used his closing statement to thank the state's voters for the chance to serve. "We talk a lot about our records and so forth," he said. "I think people in an election want to know what you're for, as well -- what your plans are for the future. I think we need to keep our economy on a steady foot: a good fiscal policy. We need to improve our educational system. I mentioned health care as a critical issue. I'd like to see us do better with transportation and privacy. We're about to have the last election of the 20th century, and I think we need to prepare well for that 21st century."
The candidates' second and final debate will be held on Thursday in Farmington, west of Hartford.

ITALY: VOTE OF CONFIDENCE -- Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema won a vote of confidence from the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Parliament, for his newly formed government, the first to include Communists in Italy since 1947. Alessandra Stanley (NYT)
 
RUSSIA: AN OPTIMISTIC YELTSIN -- President Boris N. Yeltsin said that Russia's economic plight remained difficult but that the country was already starting down the long road out of crisis. Mr. Yeltsin's views are not shared by most officials. Russia is deep in recession, has no clear recovery plan and is threatening to print more money if it does not secure foreign loans. An aide also said that Mr. Yeltsin is fed up with speculation over his ailments and feels hurt that even former allies have fanned the gossip about his health. (Reuters, Agence France-Presse) 

RUSSIA: TAX CUT ON STAPLES -- The Russian Government lowered taxes on imports of meat, milk and other staples in an effort to make sure there are not any shortages this winter. The flow of foreign goods into the country has dropped sharply since Russia's crisis began. (AP)
 
IRELAND: FOCUS ON PEACE -- Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and the Irish Prime Minister, Bertie Ahern, will take time out of a European summit meeting in Austria this weekend to discuss ways to keep Northern Ireland's peace deal on track. The accord in April set a two-year deadline for completing the disarmament of paramilitary groups. (Reuters)
 
GERMANY: SUSPECTED TERRORIST -- The United States has asked Germany to extradite a Sudanese man linked to the alleged mastermind of the bombing of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the Bavarian justice ministry said. Mamdouh Mahmud Salim is suspected of working with Osama bin Laden, who is accused of having ordered the bombings that killed 224 people in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. (Agence France-Presse)
 
ASIA
 
AFGHANISTAN: U.N. ACCORD -- The United Nations signed an agreement with the ruling Taliban movement that would allow the return of its international staff to Afghanistan. More than 60 United Nations employees were pulled out because of security concerns after the United States fired missiles at suspected terrorist bases in Afghanistan on Aug. 20. (Reuters)
 
CHINA: TWO VIEWS OF JUSTICE -- European Union diplomats who held human rights discussions this week in Beijing said that China was making genuine efforts to end abuses in its criminal justice system. But a Hong Kong-based human rights group reported that a veteran dissident, Chen Zengxiang, had been jailed for seven years for "leaking state secrets." (Reuters)
 
NORTH KOREA: FIGHTING DEADLOCK -- Negotiators from North and South Korea struggled to hammer out an accord that could open talks on ending conflict on the divided peninsula. The talks are deadlocked over North Korea's demand for the withdrawal of 37,000 American troops from South Korea and a separate peace agreement with the United States. Washington says both issues are nonnegotiable. (Reuters)
 
INDIA: BORDER REINFORCEMENTS -- China has increased troop deployments on its border with India since the latter's nuclear tests in May, an Indian police chief said. Gautam Kaul of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police said China had reinforced its frontier troops three times in the last five months. (Agence France-Presse)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAQ: U.N. TALKS DELAYED -- The Security Council postponed until next week its discussion of questions that Iraq wants clarified before it lifts the ban that it imposed on weapons inspections on Aug. 5. The Council is awaiting the return of Secretary General Kofi Annan, who is in South Korea, and a review on whether Iraq loaded nerve gas on its missiles. Youssef M. Ibrahim (NYT)
 
TUNISIA: POLITICAL AMNESTY -- President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali will grant amnesty next month to the political opposition, which includes Muslim militants, the newspaper Al-Hayat reported. (Agence France-Presse)
 
AFRICA
 
CONGO: MORE FOREIGN TROOPS -- President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is pouring more troops into Congo to confront rebels in the east. Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have pledged to help President Laurent Kabila contain a widening war by tackling the rebels, who are backed by Uganda and Rwanda. (Reuters)
 
GUINEA-BISSAU: A CEASE-FIRE -- Mutinous soldiers seeking to topple the elected Government of President Joao Vieira agreed to observe a 48-hour cease-fire in the former Portugese colony to allow time for talks. The rebels now control all towns in the interior of the tiny West African state, a diplomat in the capital said. Senegal has sent more men and hardware to reinforce its troops backing the Government against a widening army rebellion. (Reuters, Agence France-Presse)
 
COMOROS: ISLAND REBELLION -- The Organization of African Unity called for an inter-island conference to resolve a crisis sparked by the unilateral declaration of independence by the tiny island of Anjouan in the Indian Ocean. (Agence France-Presse)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
ARGENTINA: CLAIM TO FALKLANDS STANDS -- President Carlos Saul Menem said Argentina would "never renounce" its claim for the return from Britain of the Falkland, South Georgia and South Sandwich islands. But Mr. Menem, who travels to Britain Tuesday, said in the daily newspaper Clarin that he would seek to normalize relations with London and that Argentina could only win the islands back through negotiation. (Agence France-Presse)
 
BRAZIL: PERU-ECUADOR PACT -- Ecuador and Peru will sign an agreement on Monday formally ending a border dispute that led to four weeks of war in 1995. Diplomats said President Alberto K.

COLOMBIA: SEEKING PEACE -- President Andres Pastrana, who is due to visit Washington next week, said he would not allow the American-backed war on drugs to stand in the way of peace in his country. Colombia is to begin talks with the country's largest rebel group next month, after temporarily clearing Government forces out of an area the size of Switzerland. Some Republicans in Congress are supporting a bill that would cut aid if Colombia bars chemical fumigation anywhere in the country. Diana Jean Schemo (NYT)

APPLIED MATERIALS PLANS $285 MILLION EARNINGS CHARGE

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Applied Materials Inc., the No. 1 maker of semiconductor equipment, said yesterday that it would take charges of $285 million, or 56 cents a share, as part of a previously disclosed plan to reorganize operations. The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it completed the revamping disclosed in August, which included cutting 2,000 employees, or 15 percent of its work force, and that the moves would save it $40 million a quarter. Applied is trying to cope with a slowdown in the chip-equipment market, caused by weak computer sales and the economic crisis in Asia.

The Negotiators' Pledge: Commitment to Peace Through Perseverance

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks by President Clinton, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Yasir Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization and King Hussein of Jordan at the signing of the Middle East peace agreement at the White House yesterday, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company. Mr. Arafat's remarks were translated from the Arabic.
 
 President Clinton
 Over the last nine days, I have witnessed extraordinary efforts on behalf of peace. I thank our team, beginning with its head, the Secretary of State, who showed remarkable creativity, strength and patience. And I thank the Vice President for his interventions. I thank my good friend Sandy Berger; our director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, who had an unusual, almost unprecedented, role to play because of the security considerations; Special Middle East Coordinator Dennis Ross, who was a young man with no gray hair when all this began. 
 I thank Prime Minister Netanyahu, who stood so firmly for the security of his citizens and of his country, and of the impressive members of his Cabinet and administration. I thank Chairman Arafat, who tenaciously defended the interests of his people, and the very impressive members of his team as well. In the end, after all the twists and turns and ups and downs, all their late and ultimately sleepless nights, both reaffirmed their commitment to the path of peace. And for that, the world can be grateful.
And finally, let me thank His Majesty King Hussein, whose courage, commitment, wisdom, and frankly, stern instruction at appropriate times were at the heart of this success. Your Majesty, we are all profoundly in your debt.
This agreement is good for Israel's security. The commitments made by the Palestinians were very strong, as strong as any we have ever seen. They include continuous security cooperation with Israel and a comprehensive plan against terrorism and its support infrastructure.
This agreement is good for the political and economic well-being of Palestinians. It significantly expands areas under Palestinian Authority to some 40 percent of the West Bank. It also offers the Palestinian people new economic opportunities. With an airport, an industrial zone, soon safe passage between Gaza and the West Bank, and in time, a seaport, the Palestinian people will be able to breathe a little easier and benefit from the fruits of peace.
Most importantly perhaps, this agreement is actually good for the peace process itself.
For 18 months, it has been paralyzed -- the victim of mistrust, misunderstanding and fear. Now ordinary Israelis and Palestinians once again can become partners for peace.
To bolster this effort, Chairman Arafat will invite members of the Palestinian National Council and other important political entities to reaffirm his prior commitments and their support for the peace process. I have agreed to address that meeting, several weeks hence, and to underscore the values of reconciliation, tolerance and respect, and my support for those commitments and this process.
People around the world should be heartened by this achievement today.
These leaders and those with whom they've worked have come a very long way. The Israeli and Palestinian peoples whose bitter rivalry in this century has brought so much suffering to both sides have moved yet another step closer toward fulfilling the promise of the Oslo accords, closer to the day when they can live peacefully as true neighbors with security, prosperity, self-governance, cooperation, and eventually, God willing, genuine friendship. No doubt as peace gains momentum, forces of hate, no matter how isolated and desperate, will once again lash out. They know this, the leaders, and they are prepared to face it.
Staying on the path of peace under these circumstances will demand even greater leadership and courage. The work at Wye River shows what can happen when the will for peace is strong.
But let me say once again to all the rest of you, everyone who is tempted to handicap every little twist and turn over the last nine days, you need to know one overwhelming thing: The Prime Minister and the Chairman and the members of their delegation who supported this process, even when there were things about it they did not agree with, are quite well aware that the enemies of peace will seek to extract a price from both sides. They are quite well aware that in the short run they themselves may have put themselves at greater risk.
But by pledging themselves to the peaceful course for the future, to the same values, and ultimately to the same enemies, they have given both Israelis and Palestinians a chance to have the future we all want for our children and our children's children.
Every effort will have to be exerted to insure the faithful implementation of this agreement -- not because the parties do not want to do so, but because the agreement covers many things, was developed over many days, involved many discussions and sleepless nights.
It will test whether the Palestinian people are prepared to live in peace, recognizing Israel's permanence, legitimacy and a common interest in security. It will tell us whether Israelis want to help build a strong Palestinian entity that can fulfill the aspirations of its people and provide both real security and real partnership for Palestinians and Israelis.
The United States is determined to be of whatever help we can to both sides in their endeavors. I will consult with Congress to design a package of aid to help Israel meet the security costs of redeployment and help the Palestinian authority meet the economic costs of development. I hope we will have support from Republicans and Democrats in that endeavor.
With respect to Mr. Pollard, I have agreed to review this matter seriously at the Prime Minister's request. I have made no commitment as to the outcome of the review.
Ultimately, the parties will have to translate the gains of Wye River into renewed efforts to secure a just and lasting peace, for as big a step as today is -- and after 17 months, it is a very large step indeed -- it is just another step along the way. Therefore, perhaps as important as any other statement to be made today, let me say how grateful I am that the Prime Minister and the Chairman have agreed to begin permanent status talks upon ratification of this agreement.
 
Prime Minister Netanyahu
Today's a day when Israel and our entire region are more secure. Now this has required sacrifice from both sides and reaching into what Lincoln called the better nature of mankind. This is an important moment to give a secure and peaceful future for our children and the children of our neighbors, the Palestinians. We have seized this moment.
I'm asking all people of good will, of honesty and candor, I'm asking all of them to join us in support for this important step for a secure future, a future of peace.
We are more secure today because, for the first time since the signing of the Oslo accords, we will see concrete and verifiable commitments carried out. Our Palestinian partners will join us in fighting terrorism. They will follow a detailed and systematic plan to fight terrorists and their infrastructure, to jail killers that have so far roamed at large, to stop vitriolic incitement, and, above all, finally, after 35 years, to cancel the articles in the Palestinian charter which call for the destruction of Israel. This means that our world today will be safer for our children and for our neighbors' children.
But it has been said here -- and it's true -- that we are just at the beginning or maybe in the middle of the road to a permanent peace.
We will soon embark on negotiations for a permanent peace settlement between our two peoples. Now, I guarantee you it will not be easy, and it will not be simple . . . .
But I am today brimming with some confidence, and not overconfidence, simply because we have overcome tremendous challenges and achieved success for both sides. Not at the expense of one side and the benefit of the other, but success and advantage and progress for both sides. And that fills me with the confidence that we are able to tackle the larger challenges that still await us and that still await our two peoples.
There are so many people that I could thank in the American delegation . . . . But I want to especially thank President Clinton. He is, if I can borrow a cliche, he is a warrior for peace. I mean, he doesn't stop. He has this ability to maintain a tireless pace and to nudge and prod and suggest and use a nimble and flexible mind to truly explore the possibilities of both sides, and never just on one side. That is a great gift, I think a precious and unique one, and it served us well.
So I thank you, Mr. President, for serving us and the cause of peace well. And I thank you, too, for your boundless optimism, without which these qualities cannot come into effect. You needed a lot of optimism.
I want to thank Chairman Arafat. Mr. Chairman, your cooperation was invaluable. And I want to thank you personally once again for the kind wishes you extended me on a birthday that I shall never forget. Thank you very much.
I want to thank Minister Sharansky. Mr. Sharansky is in Israel. He is celebrating now his daughter's bat mitzvah. I'm sure you all send him the best and excuse him for not being here. But he and Defense Minister Mordechai and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon brought to Wye their patriotism and their commitment. . . .
I want to thank King Hussein, who visited us twice. And, Your Majesty, you gave us an unforgettable and inspiring example of courage and humanity, and it moved me deeply. It moved every one of our people and our delegates deeply, and I thank you for that. . . .
 
Chairman Arafat
This is an important and a happy day, a day of achievement that we will always remember with optimism and hope. It is true that whatever we achieved is only temporary, and has come late. But our agreement in the Wye River underscores that the peace process is going ahead and that whatever we agreed upon in Madrid, Oslo, and in Washington and Cairo is being implemented on the same bases that has been agreed to and that we will never go back.
We will never leave the peace process, and we will never go back to violence and confrontation -- no return to confrontation and violence. . . .
This reconciliation between the two peoples, the Palestinian and the Israeli people, will not be diverted from its path, and will go through negotiations on the table and not through tanks, grenades and barbed wire.
We have achieved today a large step, but it is important, my co-partner, Mr. Netanyahu, it is important in establishing the peace process because this is the peace of courageous people, the implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of land for peace, achievement of political rights of the Palestinian people, and putting every effort possible in the service of achieving security for all, particularly for the Israeli people.
All this will bring us to begin at once and quickly in the negotiations of the final solution that will try to achieve just and peaceful and permanent peace in order to complement what takes place also on the Syrian and the Lebanese paths very soon.
What we achieve together with the leading and effective role of President William Clinton and his United States team is something, if fully and sincerely implemented, that will open the door before the Palestinian and Israeli people for more achievements, more hope and more optimism, not only for ourselves, but also for the Middle East region as a whole.
Once again, I'm saying that it is a big step that came late, but it is indeed an important one because it will allow the return of 13 percent of the Palestinian land on the West Bank to the Palestinian people, to their sovereignty and will allow to double the area where the Palestinian Authority will enjoy full-fledged authority and sovereignty. Yes, indeed, it is a start that will allow Palestinian airplanes to fly to and from the Gaza International Airport carrying visitors and merchandise, carrying to the whole world Palestinian flowers and fresh fruit. . . . It will also allow the achievement of real happiness for hundreds of Palestinians prisoners in Israeli jails. . . .
I led those children during their struggle for freedom, and they gave their freedom and their lives for the sake of the land. However, they adopted the peace process, adopted peace and stood by peace while they were in jail. And now they are joining us in our peace process for the sake of peace. It is the peace of courageous people.
We have succeeded in the agreement in ending all unilateral actions that would undermine the final solution and bring about a difficult climate for negotiations on peace. With this agreement, we begin the final-solution negotiations, which we will take very seriously and commitment in order to achieve it on its stipulated times in all the agreements we signed together, which is May 4, 1999.
We will have understanding around this date between us and the Israeli partners, and between us our friends in the United States, and between us and our brothers the Arabs, at the forefront of which is His Excellency, His Majesty King Hussein, and my brother, President Mubarak, who has been following with commitment what we are doing here in the United States. And also our brothers, the Arabs, the Arab leaders who have been following our work minute by minute. . . .
We are quite certain that we will stand together here in this place, which is at a high-level forum, and under the guardianship of the President Clinton, in order to announce the achievement of permanent peace between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples; that we have completed the solution of all issues: the return of the land, the status of Jerusalem, the status of the settlements, the final frontiers, and return of refugees, and the just distribution of water, and security and good relations with our neighbors, and that we have achieved freedom and independence and security for all.
We will begin a new era of new relations based on equality, mutual feelings and cooperation between two independent neighboring countries enjoying security and openness with their neighbors in a regional framework that will bring about peace, justice and stability for all. . . .
I am quite confident that I'm talking in the name of all Palestinians when I assure you that we are all committed to the security of every child, woman and man in Israel. Here we have come to a detailed agreement, and we are committed to play our independent role to keep security. And we will achieve whatever we promised here.
I will do everything I can so that no Israeli mother will be worried if her son or daughter is late coming home or any Israeli would be afraid when they heard an explosion. It is true that nobody can secure 100 percent results of security for all Palestinians and all Israelis.
But I am proud that we were able to work together. And we will be able to do more together with the assistance of all our friends all over the world, in America and in Europe, and with great commitment to achieve much more in the years ahead.
Yes, indeed, ladies and gentlemen, we want achievements of the peace of courageous people to end this long suffering, in order to build an independent nation having a lot of democracy and caring for these children. We want a school and education for every child and young man. We want a job for every man and woman and a modern medical clinic and a hospital, and a small house as well, where everybody feels comfortable and where laughter is heard of happy healthy kids. We want that and more for our neighbors and co-partners, the Israeli people and the Arabs.
We want a factory, a lab, an airport and a seaport, a clean environment and an ability to grow and to develop. And on the occasion of the new millennium, which represents the birth of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem where his light came out to the world, we would like to receive the whole world now, calling for peace and justice and freedom, for a world where there is stability, fraternity and cooperation.
We would also like to pursue the joint work with our neighbors the Arabs, as well as the regional work which is cooperative and successful. And even through I realize the difficulties that we face and my full knowledge of -- whatever we sign today will only trickle down to worthless ink and paper unless it is implemented accurately and quickly.
So I call upon President Clinton to remain with us, alert and supportive, in order to make sure that we implement everything we agreed upon. However, I'm also happy that I call upon my sons and children in Palestine, in the diaspora and confinement, bringing to them the good news of a better future where they can enjoy a better life with freedom, dignity and independent country. I want them to work with me seriously and sincerely in order to do everything we can, all the sacrifices to build our nation, Palestine.
And so I also say something special for my children, that they are in our imagination and minds and conscience, and we will never forget their rights, their efforts and their tortures. And in particular, I call upon my brothers and sisters in the refugee camps in Lebanon that this long standing apart will not be long and they will come back to Palestine in their dignity.
For those who sacrificed for Palestine -- the martyrs, the wounded, the widows, the orphans and the prisoners -- without whom we wouldn't have achieved this day for freedom for them all, I tell them that we are going to achieve peace. To all our brothers, the Arabs who embraced us in our difficulties and supported us during war and peace, I tell them that we will continue our effort and will be committed to our cause.
And at last I would like to direct my talk to Mr. Netanyahu and his colleagues, to say today we have achieved a great, positive agreement. We have to continue that together very soon and to implement it quite sincerely in reality.
Your security is our security. Your security is our security, and peace for your children and our children. And we will work together, through the peace process and negotiations, even though they are difficult, in order to achieve a final solution. We will not retreat. We will not go back to violence or confrontation. And we together will be the leaders in order that peace would prevail on our land and the land of our neighbors, and peace be with you all.
 
King Hussein
As the President said, Dennis has lost his black hair and replaced it with gray. I have lost all mine and even my eyebrows!
But this is part of the life in which we live, and -- I was privileged to be with you all, and no matter what, I would have been. If I had an ounce of strength, I would have done my utmost to be there and to help in any way I can.
By the way, many in our part of the world, in different parts of the world, have written me off. But I have a lot of faith in God and I believe that one lives one's destiny. And as far as I am concerned, my morale is the highest it has ever been, and this has been a shot in the arm for me, what you have accomplished today, President Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu.
I recall discovering past events over many years, and one thing that remained with me throughout those many years was a total commitment to the cause of peace. We quarrel, we agree, we are friendly, we are not friendly, but we have no right to dictate through irresponsible action or narrow-mindedness the future of our children and their children's children.
There has been enough destruction, enough death, enough waste, and it's time that together we occupy a place beyond ourselves, our peoples, that is worthy of them under the sun, the descendants of the children of Abraham -- Palestinians and Israelis -- coming together.
I have attended previous occasions here, and of course, you, Mr. President, together with the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, were my partners four years ago in the Washington Declaration, and later on when the state of peace was finalized in our meetings in Jordan and in Aqaba. I don't think we might have given you as much hard work or less sleep than you have been subjected to of late.
But what I found this time, and what really gives me hope and confidence, is that that same chemistry after the first meeting between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Arafat is there. I think that we passed a crossroad. We have made our commitment to the welfare and happiness and security and future of our peoples in all the times to come. And now our partners are numerous, and we wish them every success in their endeavors, and we'll do everything we can to help them.
I think such a step as is concluded today will inevitably trigger those who want to destroy life, destroy hope, create fear in the hearts and minds of people, trigger in them their worst instincts. They will be skeptical on the surface, but if they can, they will cause damage wherever they are and wherever they belong. Let's hope that the overwhelming majority of us, those who are committed to the future, those who know what responsibilities they hold now, will be able, through steady progress and a determined combined joint effort, be able to thwart their aims and their objectives and move and maybe, God willing, witness the dawn that we have all been seeking of a comprehensive peace in our entire region.

MAX LERNER
 Pilgrim in the Promised Land.
 By Sanford Lakoff.
 323 pp. Chicago:
 The University of Chicago Press. $25. 
 Max Lerner, who died in 1992 at 89, was a public intellectual of the variety whose passing everyone loves to lament these days. "It can safely be said," Sanford Lakoff safely says in "Max Lerner: Pilgrim in the Promised Land," "that no American writer in the century wrote for as many different audiences." Academic and journalist, teacher and critic, Lerner contributed to both social science periodicals and Playboy magazine, highbrow opinion journals and The New York Post. His erudition ranged over law, economics, history, culture and foreign affairs -- all touched on in his 1957 magnum opus, "America as a Civilization" -- and he wrote regularly into his final year.
Lerner, however, was no boring egghead. Well into his golden years, he caught people's fancy not just with his political columns but with his frank embrace of the sexual revolution, frequenting free-love communes in the early 1970's and befriending Hugh Hefner.
A life as colorful as Lerner's poses a special challenge to a biographer. Should you focus on the rich story of the man's intellectual development or explore his psyche? Lakoff, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of California, San Diego, and a former student of Lerner's, has gamely attempted both in his concise and thoughtful new biography. Strong as an analysis of Lerner's ideas, it is somewhat less so as a portrait of the man.
"The trajectory of Lerner's change of political views," Lakoff writes, "is an illuminating index to the shift in thinking among many public intellectuals in 'the American century.' " A radical foe of capitalism in his youth, Lerner became a spokesman for mainstream liberalism in his middle years and a cranky neoconservative as he aged. Lakoff doesn't challenge this common appraisal, but he does complicate it. He argues, for example, that Lerner, even in his youth, was drawn less to Marx than to the sociologist Thorstein Veblen, whom he admired as "a tongue-in-cheek agitator, more Mencken than Lenin." Lakoff also shows that if, as some have charged, Lerner was slow to acknowledge the brutality of Stalin's Soviet Union or to see the folly of the Vietnam War, he was prescient in calling for American entry into World War II and recognition of Israel. Less adequately explained, however, is the civil libertarian's embrace of anti-flag-burning laws.
While the book generally succeeds as intellectual biography, it disappoints a bit as a character study. To his credit, Lakoff recognizes the significance of his subject's private life, from the affairs he had with his students as a young Sarah Lawrence professor to the goings-on at the Playboy mansion. But he never really takes us into Lerner's inner life, perhaps because he seems never to arrive there himself. He sterilizes Lerner's countercultural escapades by dwelling on their intellectual aspects -- by explicating, for example, Lerner's opinions about Freud and Norman O. Brown. Topics such as Lerner's second marriage or his relationship with his children get only passing attention, depriving us of seeing critical sides of Lerner's personality.
Still, in the dangerous territory of the links between private behavior and public persona, Lakoff lays out a plausible correlation between his subject's intellectual and sexual ardors; both, he suggests, grew out of the same craving for experience. "In my own case," he quotes Lerner as writing, "the hunger for erotic acceptance, still unsated, and the impulse to storm the city and conquer the domain of ideas and letters . . . were connected in a circuit." For Lerner, as for Freud, eros was a life force. And a key to understanding this most ambitious and vital of public intellectuals is appreciating his intense and passionate engagement with the world.

 In "The Shape of the River," William G. Bowen and Derek Bok -- former presidents of Princeton and Harvard Universities -- seek "to build a firmer foundation of fact" under America's affirmative action debate. Amen. Facts have been sorely missing in accounts of the role played by race in admissions to institutions of higher education. To some degree the fact gap exists because both those who defend affirmative action and those who oppose it argue from positions of high principle: a commitment to diversity on the one hand or a defense of individual merit on the other. When principle is at stake, facts become conveniences to be cited when helpful and to be explained away when harmful.
But the absence of hard information is also due to the policies of educational institutions themselves, which keep secret the kinds of data which would shed light on who gets admitted to them and who does not -- and why. (Even Bowen and Bok are obligated not to reveal the names of the five institutions whose admissions policies they examine in detail.) With the publication of their book, and of "The Black-White Test Score Gap," edited by Christopher Jencks, the Malcolm Wiener Professor of Social Policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, and Meredith Phillips, an assistant professor of policy studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, the fact gap has closed considerably. Both volumes are masterly in their technical use of data and sensitive to the limits of what data can reveal. It detracts nary a whit from the accomplishments of either to say that even with the facts they present, the roles race should and does play in college admissions will remain hotly contested.
As Thomas J. Kane, who teaches public policy at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, points out in his contribution to the Jencks and Phillips collection, roughly 60 percent of America's institutions of higher education admit nearly all who apply and therefore do not give preference to any particular race. At the best schools, by contrast, efforts to diversify the student body translate into a 400-point bonus for minority students on the SAT tests. The bonus is so large because, in 1995, 70 African-Americans scored over 700 on the verbal portions of the SAT; 221 more scored over 650. (The corresponding numbers for whites were 8,239 and 16,216.) The five or six most competitive colleges, in other words, fight over the 300 or so African-Americans with the highest scores; the next 20 or 30 colleges, still top ranked, have to drop down to those scoring in the 1200's or below if they want their student bodies to reflect the percentage of the population that is black or Hispanic -- all the while rejecting many white applicants with much higher scores.
One effect of taking race into account into account in the admissions process is that among applicants with combined SAT scores in the low 1200 range, a black applicant is three times as likely to get into an elite college as a white applicant. Bowen and Bok argue that both the colleges and the black students who attend them still benefit. We ought not to forget, they write, that although whites with very high scores may be "spectacularly well qualified" for college, blacks with somewhat lower scores are anything but unqualified. In addition, SAT scores, while important, are not a one-to-one stand-in for merit; not only do they predict academic performance poorly, they also say little about who will contribute most to other students or will become eventual leaders in their fields.
Critics of affirmative action say that it is unfair to black students to be forced to compete against whites who are better prepared for demanding academic work. Some of the evidence collected by Bowen and Bok confirms this; in less selective institutions, black graduation rates six years after entering college are significantly lower than white graduation rates. Black students nearly always perform less well than white students, and also perform below the levels predicted by their SAT scores. A chapter in the Jencks and Phillips collection calls this "disturbing" and adds that "most sobering of all, the performance gap is greatest for the black students with the highest SAT's." A co-author of that chapter is William G. Bowen. Still, Bowen and Bok conclude that the overall picture proves that minority students are not "overmatched" in comparison with whites admitted with much higher SAT scores to the nation's top schools. The picture improves even more if one examines the years after college. Despite their lower SAT scores, black graduates of the nation's selective colleges are active participants in civic life. They report high degrees of satisfaction with their experiences in college.
In their most impressive finding, Bowen and Bok show that of the 700 or so black entering students from the class of 1976 who would not have been admitted to one of the nation's more selective institutions had strictly race-neutral criteria been applied, 225 obtained professional or graduate degrees, 70 became doctors, 60 became lawyers, 125 became business executives; and as a body, they earned an average of $71,000 annually. Bowen and Bok interpret these facts to mean that an increase in the size of the black middle class justifies racial preferences. They may well be correct. There is no more important step to be taken along the road to racial justice than building and strengthening a black middle class. Every African-American who enters a profession or buys a house in the suburbs gives the lie to two pervasive cynicisms -- one that blames black Americans for their own inequality and the other that in blaming white racism for all the ills of America ends up excusing self-defeating black isolationism.
But it would be wrong to conclude from "The Shape of the River" that affirmative action works. What Bowen and Bok have proved is that going to a top college works. Their book unintentionally fuels rather than quenches the passions over affirmative action. For if a degree from a top college benefits those who receive it as much as Bowen and Bok clearly demonstrate, then those passed over for admission to those colleges really do have cause for complaint.
And because Bowen and Bok's data are limited to the more selective institutions, they have little to tell us about the fates of minority students who never make it to the level of applying to those colleges. The material assembled by Jencks and Phillips helps explain why that group is so large. A gap between blacks and whites on intelligence tests appears when children are 4 years old. By the age of 6, black vocabulary scores match those of whites who are 5. By the age of 17, black scores are equal to those of white 13-year-olds. This means that African-Americans who show up in the Bowen and Bok study have already won some of life's biggest battles. By scoring in the 1200 range on SAT tests, they are most likely either middle-class already or will push themselves into the middle class through their determination and effort.
The real problem arises among those black high school graduates who never fully recover from their initial disadvantage in testing and who therefore wind up scoring in the 800-1000 range on SAT's. The best of these students will attend colleges that are somewhat selective, and which therefore still exercise some degree of racial preference in admissions. But while the preference is smaller than at the most selective colleges, the impact on many students is larger (Thomas Kane's data indicate that black and Hispanic students receive an 8 percent to 10 percent preference at the most academically selective fifth of four-year institutions, but only a 3 percent preference at schools ranked in the fourth of the five tiers). Getting into and graduating from one of these colleges may well play a more significant role in the life prospects of a medium-range SAT scorer of either race than graduation from a top college plays for a high scorer of either race, for these are the colleges that historically made it possible to move from the working class into the middle class. The benefits gained by minority students at the top colleges, in other words, could come at the price of greater conflict between black and white applicants to those less selective colleges where middle-class aspirations meet head on.
An even greater number of minority high school students will score so low on the SAT's or equivalent tests that they will not go to college at all or will attend technical schools and community colleges. Should they lose out because they test so badly? Are the tests biased? There is, as Jencks points out, a "labeling" bias: "People hear statements like . . . 'blacks have less academic aptitude than whites' as claims that blacks are innately inferior." The pervasive use of such tests, he adds, constitutes a "selection system bias," because relying on the tests rather than performance will invariably discriminate against blacks and Hispanic applicants.
Nonetheless, Jencks writes, "the skill differences that the tests measure are real." They also matter. In their chapter in "The Black-White Test Score Gap," William R. Johnson, who teaches economics at the University of Virginia, and Derek Neal, a professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, show that wage differentials between black and white male workers can be attributed largely to differences in the acquisition of basic verbal and mathematical skills. Between 1971 and 1996, according to Meredith Phillips and her colleagues, the gap between black and white test scores narrowed considerably, even though minorities were still underrepresented at the very highest levels. This closing of the gap, moreover, was due to rising black scores, not falling white ones, indicating that something -- perhaps the War on Poverty, perhaps increased black expectations, perhaps improved schooling, especially in math -- was working. If such improvements dramatically undercut genetic explanations of intelligence, the fact that the gap appears once again to be growing is a great puzzle for social policy.
Chapters in "The Black-White Test Score Gap" explore the influence of parents, teachers, peers and society as a whole in explaining why blacks and whites perform differently on such tests. Firm conclusions are hard to come by, and some of the authors disagree with the hypotheses suggested by others. Still, the bulk of the material in this book leaves the reader with the sense that the causes are deep and difficult to overcome. As Phillips and her colleagues point out, we could eliminate at least half, and probably more, of the black-white test score gap at the end of the 12th grade by eliminating the differences that exist before children enter first grade. Such is the disparity between the races that a frightening number of African-Americans lose a good shot at entering the middle class even before they enter kindergarten. There are nonetheless good reasons to do our best to overcome this gap. "Eliminating racial differences in test performance," Jencks and Phillips write, "would also allow colleges, professional schools and employers to phase out the racial preferences that have caused so much political trouble over the past generation." Of all the facts presented in these two sobering books, the most important is this: When we debate using racial preferences to admit more black and Hispanic students to the nation's best colleges, we are considering the fate of a shockingly small number of people.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Moment of Truth: What to Tip

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
HOW much to tip is an anxiety-provoking question that follows a traveler from airport to hotel to restaurant, nationally and internationally. Do you tip a hotel-room housekeeper? How about the masseuse? The golf pro? A restaurant's captain?
The general manager of the Inn at Union Square in San Francisco, which has banned tipping, says the ban ranks high on guests' lists of favorite features. But few have followed this lead. Generally, tipping is the custom throughout America. 
 Customs overseas are usually noted in guide books, though the size of tips may not be specified. In Japan, for example, service charges are added and there is no tipping at hotels or in taxis, according to Marian Goldberg, a spokeswoman for the Japan National Tourist Organization. But she said tour guides in Japan are not offended by tips.
At the edge of some aspects of American travel, the service charge added to the tab can be seen working its way in. For example, it's not uncommon now to see on a menu, "For parties of eight or more, a service charge of XX percent will be added to the total bill." The percentage is frequently 15 or 20 percent. Restaurants want to present one check, not juggle eight, and getting a hot meal in front of so many people at once is difficult and individual tips may not cover this extra effort.
Resorts add service charges to bills because otherwise the guest may envision a battalion of hands held out: bellmen, housekeepers, waiters, golf pros, bartenders, lifeguards and many others. In addition, it is difficult to figure out where to keep cash while lifting weights. On the other hand, when it is clear that a service is performed by someone who is not a resort employee, there should be a tip: for a massage, I usually give 10 percent, rounded up, but the manager of a New York health club said that 15 to 20 percent was the usual amount there.
There aren't a lot of general guides about tipping. Original Tipping Page (www.cis.columbia.edu/homepages/ gonzalu/tipping/tipping.html) may be found on the Web, but its rates strike me as eccentric.
Here are a few rules of thumb, with the understanding that some organizations, like cruise companies, publish guidelines on amounts and that these should take precedence. But no tip should be provided when service is discourteous. It is demoralizing to those providing good service and undermines the idea that tipping is optional.
 
Step 1: Plan
The primary way to avoid tipping anxiety is to be prepared. A supply of new one-dollar bills should be held at the ready. Really fussy travelers on long trips carry along smaller envelopes or notecards and envelopes to meet situations where naked currency seems awkward, for concierges, for example.
At hotels and motels, according to Katherine Potter, a spokeswoman for the American Hotel and Motel Association, tips typically do not rise and fall with the price of the room. Like most experts in this area, Ms. Potter emphasized that no tip is ever required, but this nostrum does little to soothe a traveler who wants to avoid seeming stingy or a fool. I have watched people suffer for hours after grossly overtipping through error. The solution is to forget the error; recipients focus on their good luck, not the scorn of the donor.
The person who cleans the hotel room should get $1 or $2 a guest for each night, and more if you are messy or have asked for many extra deliveries. A prompt delivery of an iron and board is worth $2.
Travelers who go to conventions and meetings in hotels might want to be sure to tip well because they are identified as representatives of an organization and want to create good will. If you get particular help, ask whether the employee will be on duty the day you leave. If not, tip on the spot. Leaving the tip on the bathroom counter helps assure it gets to the person who does the work.
Room service can be a bother. Check the menu first to see if a service charge will be added. A tip beyond that is not necessary unless there is something special about the delivery. If no charge is added, 15 to 20 percent of the bill is fine.
The person who brings up the bags and opens the room for you should get $1 or $2, unless you have a whole trolley of luggage, when it should be more. The door attendant who calls a cab should get $1.
Employees at airports indicate that tips range from $1 to $2 a bag. Fred Baer, manager of ground transportation for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said that the airlines had policies that skycaps -- the uniformed porters who are the only people legally allowed to carry bags at New York airports -- were not allowed to solicit tips. At Terminal 4 of Kennedy International Airport, Mr. Baer said, a minimum charge of $1 a bag is in effect, and signs on the skycaps' carts note this.
 
Some Aren't Tipped
Economy hotels with no bell staff may have security guards in the registration area. Anthony G. Marshall, president and dean of the Educational Institute of the American Hotel and Motel Association, said that guards help prevent crime just by their presence, and that they should not have tasks that take them away. But he said, if they escort a guest to a room, they can be tipped like a bellman.
Salaried people who sit behind desks, like managers of hotels, are not usually tipped. Luxury-hotel concierges are. When they have really delivered -- tickets for a hit show for that night, say -- they should get substantial money (perhaps $50 for a couple of $150 tickets) in an envelope, with a note; Incidentally, calling ahead with requests to the concierge can produce better results.
Cruise lines that permit tipping -- some luxury lines like Seabourn and Silversea do not -- are not shy about providing guidance on giving. Almost everywhere, a 15 percent service charge is added to wine and liquor service, so no further tip is needed.
Housekeepers and dining room workers on cruise ships get nominal pay, and tips are part of their basic compensation. If no suggestions are provided, spokeswomen for the Cruise Lines International Association, a marketing group, say that the basic tips are $2.50 to $3 a day per passenger for the waiter, the same amount for whoever cleans the cabin, and half as much for the dining room bus employee.
Flight attendants are not tipped. Waiters on trains are tipped as in restaurants: 15 to 20 percent. If the meal is included the price of the ticket, it is easy to be generous: $5 at a minimum.
People at the car-rental counter are not tipped, but if someone brings your car to the door in the rain and loads your bags, it's worth $1 or $2.
Tour guides may be tipped. Paul Luskin, secretary of the Guides Association of New York, recommends $1 a person. "But never tip if it is asked for," he said.
At the Inn on Union Square where tipping was banned in June 1995, "We asked how much they earned from tips," said Brooks Bayly, the general manager. "Then we raised their pay that much and abolished tips."
"We do have a codicil," he added. "If a guest tries to tip an employee three times, we tell them to accept. Don't want to make a guest mad."

HEADLINE: WINTER IN THE SUN;
Georges Was an Island Hopper

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER; LARRY ROHTER is the Caribbean bureau chief for The Times.

 BODY:
FOR 11 days last month, Hurricane Georges plowed across the Caribbean, killing at least 500 people and inflicting property damage estimated at more than $5 billion as it weaved through nearly a dozen countries before expiring as an early fall rainstorm over Georgia. It was a disaster -- although not for the entire region and not necessarily for the tourist industry on which the area's economy depends.
In other words, damage, though extensive, was selective. Indeed, the majority of Caribbean islands were not affected at all by the storm and its winds, which reached a peak of 135 miles an hour. Georges may have inflicted widespread destruction throughout the Greater Antilles, but "most of our 32 member states were untouched," said Jean Holder, secretary general of the Caribbean Tourism Organization. "So over all, our position, as usual, is a good one, and we want the traveling public to be in no doubt as to that situation." 
 The entire Windward Islands group of the Eastern Caribbean, for example, was bypassed by the storm, meaning that visitors thinking of traveling to Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, the Grenadines, Martinique, St. Lucia or St. Vincent have no reason to change plans. Similarly, Trinidad and Tobago, the Dutch islands of Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao and Margarita Island just off Venezuela were all outside the hurricane zone. The Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Jamaica and the Turks and Caicos Islands also were not affected by Georges.
Even on the larger islands that suffered a direct hit, such as Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, many important tourist destinations were spared. Though parts of the southeastern Dominican Republic were severely damaged, for instance, and will not return to full normal operations for weeks, all of the hotels, restaurants and attractions in popular northern-coast towns such as Puerto Plata are reported to be functioning normally. So, as always, it is advisable to check with travel agents, hotel chains and national tourist offices about conditions at specific locales and properties.
Though hotels were the section of the tourism infrastructure that proved most vulnerable to Georges's depredations, as is clear in the country-by-country assessment that follows, the storm also forced the closing of several major airports, including the regional hub in San Juan. But at American Airlines, the principal carrier in the region, and its affiliate, American Eagle, Caribbean service is pretty much back to normal, said Al Becker, a company spokesman, except for La Romana, in the eastern Dominican Republic. There, he said, regular daily jet flights from Miami are not scheduled to resume until December, though prop service from San Juan has been restored.
According to airline and tourism officials, a few other airports remained available on a limited basis into October because, for instance, damage to landing towers, radar equipment or runway lights prevents after-dark landings. Mayaguez, in Puerto Rico, and St. Croix, in the United States Virgin Islands, fell into that category, but have now returned to normal operations. In St. Kitts, where an extensive renovation and expansion of Robert L. Bradshaw International Airport had been completed just weeks before the storm struck, restrictions are still in force.
"That is God's hand," Dwyer Astaphan, Minister of Tourism for St. Kitts and Nevis, said resignedly early this month. "We received damage to the tower and also to our terminal, but procurement is in process right now, and there is no reason why we cannot be completely finished with repairs by Dec. 1."
Cruise lines, on the other hand, say they were virtually unaffected. Many vessels were still on summer routes in the Mediterranean and Alaska when Georges was ripping through, and will be returning to the Caribbean only this month. "The only place we really ran into problems was Key West," said Rich Steck, a spokesman for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, "and since they really have got their hands full now and are closed to tourism anyway, we are going to be substituting other destinations, such as Nassau, until things are under better control there."
IN addition, one pier at the harbor in San Juan, which is second only to South Florida as a home port for cruise ships, suffered damage, according to officials of the Puerto Rican Government. But that has caused no inconvenience because "we have enough other docks to receive cruises" at the main harbor, said Jorge L. Davila, executive director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company. The damage at Port Zante in St. Kitts, opened in 1997, was somewhat more serious, officials there said, but not enough to require cancellation of cruises.
"The first cruise ship to come in was on Oct. 8, a Norwegian Cruise Line vessel with a capacity of 1,534 passengers," Mr. Astaphan said. Those returning vessels are tying up not at Port Zante but at old piers nearby. "I am advised they will be replaced within three to five months," he said. "In the interim, vessels with up to 1,600 passengers can tie up at the old pier, which is where they tied up previously."
On islands that bore the brunt of the storm, beaches, tropical forests, golf courses and nature reserves were also damaged. So even though hotels in the affected areas may be functioning again, the landscape may not appear as lush as it normally does, and some visitors may therefore wish to postpone trips. On the other hand, tourism authorities on several islands say they may institute cut-rate packages this winter to lure back reluctant travelers.
In addition, damage to fields and crops on several islands means that some food items may be unavailable at hotels or considerably more expensive. In the end, then, whether or not to go to the Caribbean during the coming high season is largely a matter of individual preference. A survey of the most affected islands follows, adhering to the same northwesterly course as the hurricane:
 
ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA Most of the destruction in this nation involved residences: Officials estimate that more than half of all homes suffered some damage. But at least half of Antigua's 28 main hotels were also affected. Most are back in business, but the Caribbean Hotel Association reports that several do not plan to reopen until December. Among them are the Pineapple Beach Club, the Inn at English Harbor, Coco Point Lodge, the Galleon Beach Club and the Hawksbill Beach Resort.
 
ST. KITTS AND NEVIS Both of the islands that make up the smallest country in the Caribbean were struck with considerable force, which damaged residences and government buildings. "Every area was impacted, some more than others," Mr. Astaphan said. Government officials estimate that 85 percent of homes suffered some damage, most of it to roofs, and put preliminary estimates of repairs at nearly $500 million. On Nevis, the smaller of the pair, many of the elegant plantation homes that attract upscale visitors have recovered quickly. But the island's main resort, the Four Seasons, is not expected to reopen until Dec. 15, due in part to beach erosion. Nearly half the buildings at the Hurricane Cove Bungalows are said to have been leveled, but the hotel remains open.
Both the Fort Thomas Hotel and Jack Tar Village Resort and Casino on St. Kitts are closed. Officials said the Fort Thomas probably will not open this season and that the Jack Tar, the biggest property on the island, is likely to remain closed until May.
 
NETHERLANDS ANTILLES On St. Maarten, Princess Juliana Airport remained open throughout the storm, an indication that the island was pummeled by less than full-force winds. Almost all of the 19 hotels and condominiums are said to have full power, water and telephone service, although some residential areas were still without electricity early in October, and the Millennium Beach Resort and Maho Beach Hotel and Casino are expected to be closed at least until December.
Nearby, tiny St. Eustatius was hard hit by the storm. As a result, one-sixth of the island's homes lost roofs, residents were still being advised to boil water as of mid-October, and extensive damage to natural foliage was reported. Hotels and restaurants, however, are fully operational.
 
UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS Early reports of widespread damage on all three main islands have proved exaggerated. Such well-known destinations as Caneel Bay on St. John and the Buccaneer on St. Croix briefly stopped taking guests and reservations, but returned to normal after a quick cleanup. Airline service is normal and all attractions are open.
 
PUERTO RICO By official tally, more than $2 billion in damages was inflicted to property across the island. In the San Juan area, several hotels suffered significant damage and, according to the Caribbean Hotel Association, remain closed for repairs, among them the Condado Plaza, Crowne Plaza, Ramada Hotel Condado and Radisson Normandie. Farther away, the hotels most seriously affected appeared to be the Hyatt Dorado Beach, which tourism officials expect will reopen Nov. 9, and the Hyatt Regency Cerromar, whose tentative reopening date is Dec. 15.
The most significant problem in the wake of the storm was the lack of electricity. An extraordinarily high level of preparedness mitigated some of the havoc caused by Georges on other islands, but could not prevent damage to power lines and generators. Telephone service was restored almost immediately; water supplies returned shortly afterward.
Mr. Davila of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company said he expected that complete electrical service would be restored in metropolitan San Juan by today. But, he added, it may take a little bit longer in the central mountains, where some paradores, or inns, are. The luxury Horned Dorset Primavera Hotel, in Rincon, suffered no structural damage, but was closed until Oct. 8 because it had no utilities.
 
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC The highest human toll, more than 280 dead and at least 100,000 homeless according to official estimates, was inflicted here, and the country remains in a state of shock and mourning. Also, the Government has come under fire for its alleged lack of preparedness, and the population has complained about slow restoration of public services, electricity in particular.
The most severe damage to tourist facilities was concentrated in the east, around La Romana and Punta Cana. The area's best-known resort, Casa de Campo, is one of several hotels still closed, though a reopening date of Dec. 20 has been set for "a limited inventory" of the hotel's 300 rooms and 150 villas. The Allegro Resort Bavaro and the Viva Dominicus expect to be fully operational by mid-November, but the Casa del Mar is scheduled to remain closed until Dec. 1, and officials say the Allegro Resort Caribbean Village Decameron should be able to resume operations by Christmas.
 
HAITI The tourist infrastructure in the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation is so ramshackle even under ordinary circumstances that it has been hard to detect Georges's impact. Hotels in Port-au-Prince, the capital, were suffering frequent power failures and breakdowns in telephone service in mid-October, a normal state of affairs there. Georges appears to have done its most severe damage in the Artibonite Valley, far off the tourist track. Royal Caribbean canceled at least one cruise to Labadie, on the north coast, but that was because of reports of civil unrest, not hurricane damage, said Mr. Steck, of Royal Caribbean.
CUBA It is off-limits to American tourists, but still draws more than one million visitors a year from other countries. According to reports from Havana, hotels there were affected only marginally. Some hotels in northern coastal resorts such as Cayo Coco, however, reported that they had suffered some damage, but have now reopened.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
Tokyo, Folksy and Affordable

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE 

 BODY:
TOKYO, a city infamous for its $15 cups of coffee and $200 cab rides from the airport, has been sitting on the back burner of my travel list for many years. I'd visited there on business in 1979, and the city had intrigued, baffled and stimulated me. Zen gardens, pachinko parlors, temples, gadgets, sumo matches, Hello Kitty -- Tokyo's quirky urban weirdness appealed to my New York sensibility. But vivid memories of the outrageous costs of my trip made me too anxious to think of attempting Tokyo without an expense account.
But when the Japanese yen dropped to around 140 to the dollar a few months ago (it rebounded to around 133 when I left on Sept. 24 and had risen more than 10 percent by early last week), I figured it was a good moment to return. Coincidentally, the very morning in August that I began scanning the Internet, Japan Airlines announced a sale on its home page: a round-trip economy ticket from New York to Tokyo for $675. 
 Wondering what the catch was, I phoned and found that there wasn't any and that I could get seats for travel dates in late September to early October if I got to JAL's office and paid for my ticket within 24 hours. With tax, and an extra $25 charge for a Friday departure, it came to $740 -- less than my fare in 1979!
There were more surprises in store, but the best one was this: I spent several perfect September days in Tokyo -- wandering the back streets of old neighborhoods, slurping noodles and sake elbow to elbow with fans glued to the afternoon TV sumo matches, poking into neighborhood museums -- and when I toted up my expenses, I'd spent as little as $60 and no more than $89 a day on meals and accommodations.
Favorable exchange rates have made Tokyo more affordable and accessible to Americans, but they aren't the only thing that has transformed the city from daunting to delightful. I can still remember my frustration in 1979 as I stumbled like a helpless 4-year-old through Tokyo's bewildering streetscape of signs and symbols, all in kanji, katakana and hiragana, the complex triad of Japanese writing systems. While I still find Tokyo confusing, it has become a puzzle that's easier to solve. There is much more English in Tokyo now -- it is there as a side dish rather than a main course, but the little bit of Roman script that dots public transportation maps, buildings, packages and menus is enough to steer non-Japanese readers in the right direction. And thanks to globalization more Japanese speak excellent English (while most American urbanites, at least, are fluent in sushi).
With only a few phrases of travelers' Japanese and my sushi vocabulary, I navigated through Tokyo's excellent subway system, sampled unfamiliar restaurants, bathed in a traditional Japanese public bath, and even found my way out to an outlying suburb for a shiatsu massage from a master practitioner. It was not difficult. In fact, to my amazement, I discovered Japan to be one of the easiest foreign travel experiences I've had recently.
One of the biggest boons, from a budget traveler's perspective, is that Japan's network of inexpensive small hotels, inns and bed-and-breakfasts, once reserved for Japanese or Japanese-speakers, has become user-friendly for foreigners. Indeed, arranging my accommodations in Tokyo was so problem free that I kept waiting for a disaster or misunderstanding.
I began my planning with a visit to the Japanese National Tourist Office in New York, where a staff member spent 20 minutes with me discussing my itinerary, then proceeded to fill up a shopping bag's worth of brochures, maps, discount coupons, railway timetables and -- most important -- a guide to an independent association of English-speaking ryokan and small hotels, the Japanese Inn Group. This group offered basic rooms, mainly with shared toilets and bathrooms (in Japan, baths and toilets have traditionally been separate rooms). The price for a single at one of the group's ryokan in Tokyo ranged from around $35 to $57, with the higher priced places offering private toilets and/or baths.
These prices put Tokyo well within my range, so I started comparing the descriptions of the ryokan (also available on the tourist office's Web site, www.jnto.go.jp) with those in independent guidebooks, and reading up on the different neighborhoods they were in. Finally, in early September, I'd made my choice of two ryokan at slightly different price levels.
The first, Ryokan Sawanoya, offered a Japanese-style room with a futon, tatami mats and shared bath, for $37 including tax. The price was attractive, and so was the location, Yanaka, an old Tokyo district close to the Ueno terminal, where Keisai Railway runs trains to and from Narita Airport for about $7.50 each way.
The other, Ryokan Asakusa Shigetsu, was in the middle of Asakusa, another interesting old Tokyo neighborhood of temples, markets and public baths. It was a bit more up-market than Sawanoya -- it had Western and Japanese-style rooms with private bath for $57, and a restaurant that offered breakfasts ($9) and dinners ($18 to $25).
Using the reservation form included the Japanese Inn Group pamphlet, I faxed my requests, in English, to both. In the morning, two confirmations were sitting in my fax tray.
Although I'm accustomed to living in cramped New York apartments, I had an attack of claustrophobia when entering my single room at the Sawanoya. A fluffy futon covered with a Japanese comforter took up most of the clean 6- by-7-foot space; the remainder was a small recessed area with a television set, phone, floor cushion and low table set with a hot water pitcher, china cups and a canister of green tea.
As I settled in, however, the room began to feel more cozy than cluttered. Sliding shoji screens along one wall provided a double-door buffer with which I could close out noise from the hallway. There was a window and air-conditioner on the other wall.
I didn't mind that the toilet (for women only, with both a Western toilet and a Japanese-style squat one) was in the hall, since my third-floor room was directly across from it. And I enjoyed the ritual of the evening Japanese bath, where you enter, undress, scrub yourself down with soap and water while sitting on a stool in front of a low spigot, rinse off, then jump in a deep hot tub (Sawanoya's tubs, while used by all the guests, were private -- only one person could use it at a time. And, perhaps as a concession to foreigners, the baths had hand-held shower fixtures and were open in the mornings for showers.) Between the hot tub soaks and the fluffy futon, my jet lag evaporated in 24 hours.
Sawa-san, a charismatic man in his 50's, was both Sawanoya's proprietor and its lead character: dressed in a kimono and with a cockatoo perched on his shoulder, he simultaneously tended to phone reservations while laughing and joking with guests in English and Japanese. He grew up in, and is a major booster of this neighborhood, Yanaka, a warren of streets and old-fashioned shops that has an urban character of Dickensian richness.
Yanaka, along with the nearby neighborhoods of Nezu and Sendagi in the Ueno district, is considered by Tokyoites to be one of the last strongholds of Tokyo's salt-of-the-earth downtown spirit, or shitamachi -- a spirit that I understood as roughly akin to the way New Yorkers feel about Brooklyn. At check-in, Sawa-san gives guests a exuberant, hand-drawn map entitled "Let's Find Out the Japanese Life" -- his idiosyncratic guide to Yanaka, which lists such local must-sees as the tatami weaver's shop, the rice cracker and tofu factories, the fancy paper store and the tea merchant.
His map, along with the Yanaka chapter of an excellent small book of walking tours, "Little Adventures in Tokyo," by Rick Kennedy, an American expatriate, was invaluable. It led me effortlessly into something that often takes weeks of travel time to find: the daily life of a neighborhood.
I spent an entire rainy day roaming Yanaka. I peeped into the tofu factory, bought a rice-and-seaweed cracker freshly toasted over hot coals (75 cents), and clapped my hands to wake up the gods at a half dozen Shinto and Buddhist shrines crowded into the cramped blocks of this neighborhood. Turning into the largest of them, the Nezu, I happened upon a Shinto wedding, and stayed to watch the ceremony.
It was a solemn affair; the families were dressed in black suits and gray dresses, the bride regal in a kimono of heavy ivory brocaded satin. The priest's' prayers were murmured over the tinkle of canned Japanese traditional music, and, three times, the participants ceremonially sipped sake from lacquered cups. Then, suddenly, the priest made a discreet signal, moved to one side and the scene erupted in a dazzle of flashbulbs as excited family members moved into position for that all-important wedding shot.
The pelting rain only added to the atmosphere of Yanaka's old Buddhist cemetery, where funerary staffs sprouted and burning incense thickened the damp, heavy air. I continued down streets of two-story wooden houses, every one fronted by lovely homespun container gardens bursting with ferns, petunias, palms and impatiens. I bought a packet of green tea ($4) and a porcelain tea canister ($12) at an elegant shop where I was greeted with a cup of tea by the kimono-clad sales clerk. I paid a visit to the Asakura Choso Museum, the exquisitely appointed former home of a master Japanese sculptor of the 1920's.
I meandered on, in a dreamy state, until finally hunger brought me down to earth. Yanaka has plenty of inexpensive corner yakitori shops, noodle shops and mom-and-pop restaurants. As is the custom in Japan, they all display plastic replicas of their daily specials in window cases outside. The menus, for the most part, are only in Japanese, but pointing works.
I chose Yaegaki, a restaurant on the corner near the ryokan, and ordered cold soba noodles and nori seaweed strips with a soy sauce. With an Asahi beer, the tab came to $7.50 -- about average for the working-class places in Yanaka where I took most of my meals.
I got used to the tatami way of living at Sawanoya, so when I moved into my Western style single at Ryokan Shigetsu (the Japanese rooms had all been booked), in the nearby district of Asakusa, sleeping in a bed gave me a bit of reverse culture shock. My spotless, recently renovated room was about nine feet long, and narrow enough that I could reach out and touch each wall. Two windows at one corner looked out onto an airshaft. It had a single bed, refrigerator, television and desk attached to the wall, and it felt so much like a ship's compartment I kept waiting for the roll.
The Shigetsu staff was friendly and helpful, but formal and professional rather than homey -- there was nary a cockatoo in sight. But I did have my own, nifty compact bathroom with tiny tub and shower -- I ruefully realized I'd missed that. And Shigetsu's Japanese hot tub, in a rooftop room, was built of cedar; guests use it one at a time and when I jumped in at the end of my long days, I imagined I was in a miniature spa.
Just a few blocks away was the Senso-ji shrine, one of Tokyo's most important, with its enormous five-tiered pagoda. Dedicated to the Buddhist goddess Kannon, the shrine attracts a nonstop flow of tourists, worshippers, schoolchildren and street characters -- like the old man who lulls pigeons to sleep by stroking their necks as spectators snap away.
The street leading away from the temple was a busy arcade of shops selling everything from shoes to crackers to fancy silk kimonos. The carnival air was very different from the relaxed, homey atmosphere of Yanaka -- until the 40s, Asakusa, especially the Rokku section, had been the center of Tokyo's entertainment and "pleasure" district. Yet, exploring a bit outside Asakusa's touristy kitsch, I found interesting, low-cost delights were everywere. I spent a whole morning rummaging through the profusion of exotic shiny cooking gadgets, plastic food displays, pottery and assorted Japanese kitchen equipment in the restaurant supply shops on nearby Kappabashi Street.
In the course of my two ryokan stays, I learned that there are drawbacks. My biggest complaint is that most ryokan ask guests to vacate their rooms between 10 A.M. and 3 P.M. so the rooms can be cleaned (though at some, like Sawayona, guests can ask that they not do so). I found it uncomfortable to be without a home base from which to rest between bouts of sightseeing, particularly since it rained for five days straight.
The other problem is that many ryokan do not have a night desk clerk. Instead, they lock the front door at 11 P.M., and if you don't make curfew, you could be out of luck (Sawanoya will arrange to lend you a key if you ask beforehand). This could complicate the logistics of late-night activities.
Still, I found that the benefits of staying in a small, traditional hotel far outweighed these inconveniences. Sprawling, chaotic Tokyo is best absorbed neighborhood by neighborhood. Would I have ever noticed the old Tokyo charm of Yanaka's shitamachi if I hadn't stayed at Sawanoya? I doubt it. Could I have explored my own shitamachi in New York at the bargain basement Tokyo price of under $90 a day? Fuhgedaboudit.
 
The bottom line for shitamachi
 
Getting There
When I went to Tokyo, the yen was trading at about 133 to the dollar, but since my trip, the yen has rebounded strongly to well under 120, so prices have risen from what I paid.
I spent $740 in August for a round-trip economy class ticket on Japan Airlines, (800) 525-3663. From Narita Airport, the Keisei Skyliner train runs about every 20 minutes to Ueno Station, about a mile from the Yanaka district, and costs around $14.50 for the 51-minute trip. Only 20 minutes and reclining individual seats distinguish it from the Keisei Limited Express, which makes the same trip in 71 minutes, and cost me $7.50. Keisei ticket counters are in Terminals A and B of the airport.
Taxis in Tokyo are expensive. A cab from Ueno Station to Ryokan Sawanoya, about a mile, cost me $5.
Once in the Yanaka and Asakura districts, I averaged about $75 a day for food and lodging.
The Japanese National Tourist Organization was very helpful, providing free advice, maps and brochures. In New York, J.N.T.O. is at 1 Rockefeller Plaza, Suite 1250, New York, N.Y. 10020; (212) 757 5640. Its Web site is www.jnto.go.jp.
I picked up a copy of Rick Kennedy's "Little Adventures in Tokyo" ($12.95, Stone Bridge Press) at a Barnes & Noble in Brooklyn before leaving and it provided many delightful and offbeat suggestions.
 
Where to Stay
Both ryokan I stayed in are are often booked up as much as two months in advance.
My Japanese-style room without bath at the Ryokan Sawanoya, 2-3-11 Yanaka, Taito-ku, Tokyo 110, was tiny, but tidy and functional, and cost $37 a night, including tax; phone (81-3) 3822-2251, fax (81-3) 3822-2252.
Ryokan Asakusa Shigetsu, 1-3-11 Asakusa, Taito-ku, Tokyo, was recently renovated, and has both Japanese- and Western-style rooms on six floors near the bustle of Tokyo's most visited shrine. My Western single had its own toilet, shower and tub, a single bed, a built-in desk/refrigerator and a television. It cost $55 a night, including tax; (81-3) 3843-2345, fax (81-3) 3843-2348.
 
Where to Eat
Both Yanaka and Asakusa have a profusion of inexpensive restaurants. Two are Kameya, 2-18-2 Bunkyo-ku, Nezu, (81-3) 3821-0861, and Yaegaki, corner of Shinobazu street by the turnoff for Nezu shrine, (81-3) 3821-8997, where I got decent, if not spectacular, meals of noodles, fried fish or yakitori for $8 to $12.
 
What to Do
I adored the Kamekichi Tea Shop on Yanaka Ginza in Yanaka, (81-3) 3823-0015), which sells hundreds of varieties of Japanese green tea, or ocha, from the everyday to the rarest leaves. They also sell tea accessories and pots, and discount purchases 10 percent on the 1st and 15th of every month. Open 10 A.M. to 7:30 P.M.
Asakura Choso Museum, 7-18-10 Yanaka, Taito-ku, Tokyo, (81-3) 3821-4549, is the former house and studio of Fumio Asakura, a prominent 20th-century sculptor. It has examples of his work, and is built around an evocative meditation garden. Admission: about $2.25, $1.10. Hours: 9:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. Closed Monday and Friday and Dec. 29 to Jan. 5.
The Shitamachi Museum, Ueno Park, Taito-Ku, (81-3) 3823-7451, is an interesting place to visit after one has prowled through the present day shitamachi of Yanaka. Downstairs, it has copies of city shops, circa 1920, and upstairs is a fascinating collection of ephemera from Tokyo's prewar period through the 1950's, including magazines, household goods, and a working-class living room from the 50's. The museum is open daily except Monday 9:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. and admission was about $1.50. It will close from Dec. 29 to Jan. 4. DAISANN McLANE

HEADLINE: Stuck in the Rough

BYLINE: By David Noonan; David Noonan last wrote for the magazine on Larry David, the co-creator of "Seinfeld."

 BODY:
It is a hot and sunny Friday afternoon, the temperature just a few crucial degrees beyond comfortable. Jerry Foltz is working on his swing on the nearly deserted practice tee of the Dominion Club golf course in Glen Allen, Va., a Richmond suburb. The fair-haired Foltz, flushed and sweaty, hits ball after ball after ball, carefully studying the flight of each one. After two rounds of the Nike Dominion Open, Foltz, who led after the first 18 holes with a 65, is in a three-way tie for third place, nine under par. But he's not happy with the state of his game. "The way I'm hitting it right now," the easygoing Arizonan says, "I'm as liable to shoot 86 as I am 65. It's all I can do to pull the trigger on most tee shots without panicking."
Foltz, 36, is a member of the Nike Tour, golf's minor league, the second-rank circuit made up entirely of players who are not quite good enough to be members of the PGA Tour. Over the course of 30 tournaments, from January through October, Foltz and his fellow golfers take part in what could be the most cruelly Darwinian struggle in all of sports. At the end of their season, out of more than 150 regular players, only the top 15 on the money list achieve their goal and "graduate" to the PGA Tour. 
 "I've changed my swing quite a bit," says Foltz, who is in his eighth full season and has never quite been able to break through to the next level. "The new swing is far superior to my old swing, but it's kind of like my brain still feels the shots with my old swing while it's trying to execute them with the new swing."
Besides the underlying neurology of his swing, Foltz has a few other things on his mind, including the rest of his life. A Nike Tour player since 1990, with more than 180 tournaments behind him (among them a victory in the 1995 Nike South Carolina Classic), Foltz knows that time is working against him. Married, with a 2-year-old son, he is caught between his belief in himself and his game and certain cold facts. He earned just $12,912 in prize money on the tour in 1997, which left him 110th on the money list. Going into the Dominion Open, the seventh of 23 tournaments he will enter this year, he was 105th on the 1998 list, with winnings of $5,234 in five tournaments. "Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting my time out here," he says, then hits a shot with the unmistakable timing and power of a tour professional. "And sometimes I feel like I'm right on the verge."
Without hope, of course, there could be no golf. And without the particularly virulent strain of the stuff that afflicts Jerry Foltz and his colleagues, there could be no Nike Tour. Because life is too tough out there in Broussard, La., and Owens Cross Roads, Ala., and Hershey, Pa., and all the other big towns and small cities where the tour stops. The competition is too brutal and the money is too small and there's no fame in sight from those fast-food restaurants and shared motel rooms.
What keeps the players going is their undying belief in the verge and in their proximity to it -- their absolute faith in the idea that things are going to get better, whether it's next shot, next hole, next round, next tournament or next year. Sooner or later all the pieces are going to fall into place -- the grip, the stance, the shoulder turn, the hips, the hands, the elbows, the knees, the head, the feet, the mind the mind the mind. It's all going to come together and it's all going to stay together. And when it does, well, goodbye Taco Bell and hello Tiger Woods. Nike Tour golfers may not be the game's best players, but they are its best dreamers by far.
Perhaps best known as the home of Casey Martin, the disabled 26-year-old who fought for and won the right to use a golf cart in tournaments, the Nike Tour features a motley mix of athletes that breaks down roughly into three groups -- hungry young players in their 20's looking to start their careers, former PGA Tour players in their 40's looking to restart their careers or get ready for the Senior PGA Tour and die-hard journeymen in their 30's like Foltz, for whom the Nike Tour has inadvertently become a career. What they all have in common, besides tan arms, is their burning desire to be elsewhere.
"The reason we're out here is that we all feel like we can play on the PGA Tour," says Foltz's roommate on the road, 39-year-old Steve Haskins, who, like Foltz, has spent nearly a decade on the Nike Tour. In fact, most of the regulars are there only because they failed to win a spot on the PGA Tour in the first place. Every fall, the PGA Tour holds its annual qualifying tournament, a three-stage stress-fest known as "Q-school." Of the 168 players who made it to the final stage in 1997 (winnowed down from 1,200 initial entrants), only the top 38. The rest, including Haskins, who finished 106th, and Foltz, who finished 155th, became eligible for the Nike Tour.
Not surprisingly, Nike Tour players are obsessed with the PGA Tour, which they usually refer to as "the regular tour" or "the big tour," implicitly acknowledging the smaller, more irregular dimensions of their own corner of the golf universe. But it's much more than just a matter of injured pride. There are some tangy economics involved as well. The total prize money available to the 150 or so players on the PGA Tour this year is $96 million, compared with $7.4 million on the Nike Tour. This cash gap is only slightly less dramatic at the tournament level. While first place in the Nike Dominion Open pays $40,500, first place in the GTE Byron Nelson Classic, the concurrent PGA Tour event, is worth $450,000.
Any way a Nike Tour golfer looks at it, the grass is deeper and at least 10 times greener on the PGA Tour side of the fence. A 19th-place finish in the Dominion earns $2,083, compared with $29,250 in the Byron Nelson; the 100th golfer on the final PGA Tour money list last year earned $240,936, while the 100th player on the Nike Tour list earned $16,401.
Endorsement money is also in short supply on the Nike Tour, thanks in large part to limited TV exposure. The Golf Channel carries just 10 tournaments between January and August, and ESPN broadcasts only this weekend's season-ending Nike Tour Championship.
"The philosophy is that this is not a tour where you come over and make a living for an extended period of time," says the PGA Tour commissioner, Timothy W. Finchem. "If a player can do that, that's fine, but it's certainly not designed for that purpose. It's designed to be a proving ground, a place where players move up or move on."
While it may be hard on the players, the absence of big money on the Nike Tour has a definite appeal to the weary sports fan. The tournaments have a relaxed, low-key atmosphere that is in many ways more fun than the high-powered PGA Tour. At the Dominion Open, golfers and fans mingle on the grounds around the clubhouse and actually talk to one another. There's nothing relaxed, however, about the golf itself.
Nike Tour fields are jammed with seasoned competitors, including PGA Tour winners, members of National Collegiate Athletic Association championship teams, Walker Cup players and battle-hardened veterans of just about every foreign tour that exists. With players like that competing for small, top-heavy purses (in a typical Nike Tour event, the top six finishers share more than half the prize money) and a measly 15 spots on the PGA Tour, there's no such thing as playing it safe and laying up -- everybody goes for it all the time.
That includes the duo of Haskins and Foltz, who play some of their best golf of the year in the first two rounds of the Dominion Open. When he finishes his second round at noon on Friday, Haskins is alone in first place with scores of 66 and 67, 11 strokes under par. And when Foltz completes his second-round 70 an hour later, he's just two shots back. This Friday thunder is an echo of 1991, when Haskins and Foltz each had his best year ever and finished 10th and 11th on the money list, respectively. Unfortunately, at that time only the top five Nike Tour finishers made it to the PGA Tour.
"If we keep playing like this," Foltz says, "I'll have to get my wife her own room when she comes out on tour so I can stay with Steve."
The modest money on the Nike Tour dictates a decidedly cost-conscious life style; the golfers count dollars as carefully as they count strokes. Weekly expenses generally run from $1,000 to $1,400, including $350 base pay for a caddie. Many of the players have sponsors, wealthy individuals or groups who cover all or part of their overhead for the season; sometimes these are business people the players have met at tournaments or corporate golf outings. Other players are supported by their families, and some of the first-year players live on savings.
Given the cost of air fare, most of the Nike Tour golfers drive from tournament to tournament, and one sure way to distinguish a Nike Tour event from a PGA Tour event is to check out the clubhouse parking lot -- if it's full of enormous, loaded-down closets on wheels, it's definitely not the "regular tour." Nike Tour players seem to favor full-size American road iron, late-model sedans with big trunks for clubs and equipment and plenty of room for the wardrobe. Like, for instance, the Ford Crown Victoria taking up much space in the Dominion Club lot, its back seat jammed with golf clothes hanging from a bar, its rear window filled with golf hats from obscure tournaments. And there on the front seat, amid a clutter of maps and empty coffee cups, is the possible key to getting out from behind the wheel once and for all -- an audiotape called "Great Putting Right Now."
To save money, many players like Foltz and Haskins also share motel rooms. "It was logical," Foltz says of the arrangement. "We've known each other since what seems like the beginning of time out here. Like I told Steve, we ran out of friends. Everybody else is either on the PGA Tour or at home, working." Foltz, an ex-smoker, doesn't mind Haskins's cigarettes, and by splitting the cost the two can afford to stay in nicer places than if they traveled alone. "We even have pretty similar swings through impact," says Foltz, "so we can help each other quite a bit."
They can also commiserate about the pain of being away from their families. "I really miss my son," Foltz says, "but you can't think about it or you can't play the game." Haskins has two boys, age 6 and 8, back home in Texas. "Each year it gets harder," he says. "When they're first born, it's not quite as bad. But when they get older, it's tougher. You want to go swimming with them or go to baseball games."
Haskins is the senior man on the circuit, having played in more than 180 Nike Tour events since it began as the Hogan Tour in 1990. His sole victory came in the 1991 New England Classic. Friendly and easy to talk to, Haskins nevertheless has the slightly distracted air of a man with a lot on his mind. He has been to the final stage of the PGA's Q-school 10 times but has never been able to play his best there. "In the late 80's and early 90's, I was playing some of my best golf," says Haskins, who didn't turn pro until he was 26. "And I was very bitter and disappointed on the Hogan Tour because I felt like I belonged on the PGA Tour." No longer bitter, he is simply determined to reach his goal at last. After failing to qualify for the Nike Tour in 1997, he's glad to be back. Though he made just $6,994 in eight events prior to the Dominion, he came into the tournament feeling good about his game, as his play in the first two rounds confirmed.
Like two guys stuck in an airport watching other people catch their flights, Haskins and Foltz have seen some great golfers come and go, among them Tom Lehman, David Duval, John Daly and Jeff Maggert. If anything, says Haskins, the quality of the players on the Nike Tour just keeps getting better. "We have young guys out here now who are just unbelievable," he says on Friday afternoon, surveying the field from his comfortable vantage point at the top of the leader board. "I've never even heard of a lot of them, and I've been around, you know. You think you've heard of everybody, but guys just keep coming up."
Just a few hours later, his words take on the hue of prophecy when 25-year-old Notah Begay 3d, a former teammate of Tiger Woods and Casey Martin at Stanford, shoots a mind-boggling 59 and knocks Haskins into second place. Although they are too experienced to let another golfer's play affect them, Foltz and Haskins both stumble on Saturday. Foltz shoots 75 and drops into an 11-way tie for 34th place. Haskins, playing his third round with the now-famous Begay before an unusually large Nike Tour gallery of more than 300 people, shoots 73 (one better than Begay) and ends up tied for eighth with five other golfers.
On Sunday, Foltz plays poorly again, shooting 74 and finishing in a three-way tie for 43d. He earns just $810, which brings his season total to $6,044 (100th on the money list) and leaves him pondering his erratic play. "Sometimes I feel like I'm being selfish, staying out here," says Foltz, who was working as a bartender before going on the tour. "But the reason I'm here is, I never wanted to be one of those guys who says, 'What if?"'
As the fourth round comes to a close, the Virginia humidity works its magic: the Dominion Club golf course steams like some kind of groomed jungle; golfers and fans alike slowly boil in their own sweat. Steve Haskins, who looks as if his brain is about to blow right out of his ears, stands on the 18th tee trying not to think about the 12-foot birdie putt he just missed on 17 or the tee shot he put in the water on 15. After losing all his momentum on Saturday, he has floundered throughout the final round. With one last hole to play, the one-time leader of the tournament is tied for 19th place with a dozen others. He's two over for the round, six shots behind the current leader, out of the running and seemingly out of gas. As he waits for the fairway up ahead to clear, the frustration and disappointment on his face are as easy to read as the logo on his bag.
And then Haskins does an amazing thing: he simply wills himself into total concentration. When it's his turn to tee off, his troubled look suddenly evaporates and he becomes completely focused. He steps forward and gazes thoughtfully into the distance. At 537 yards, 18 is a risky but reachable par 5 with a lake that runs all the way down the right side of the fairway and wraps around a peninsula-like green. Haskins plants his tee in the ground, takes his stance and launches a rocket 300 yards down the center of the fairway. It is a gallant blow -- the old pro has decided to risk the wrath of the water gods once more and play for an eagle.
Moments later, standing over his ball, 229 yards from the pin, Haskins squints and thinks and squints and thinks and pulls out a 3-iron. Then he squints and thinks some more. There's all that water to the right, ugly rough and bunkers to the left, and the hole is cut near the back of the two-tiered green. To get it close, Haskins must land the ball in a target area no bigger than a queen-size mattress. He finally swings, and when the ball stops rolling it's just 15 feet from the cup. He then follows two great shots with a not-so-great one; his eagle putt slips past the hole and he settles for a birdie. Haskins finishes the Dominion Open, his 189th Nike tournament, in a four-way tie for 15th place. He earns $3,031.87 and moves up from 86th on the 1998 money list to 78th. Without the birdie on 18, he would have made nearly $1,000 less.
Through the summer and into the fall, Foltz and Haskins continue to room together and to struggle together. "It's been a season to forget," Foltz says in early October, on the eve of the Inland Empire Open, his 23d and final event of 1998. With winnings of $9,905, he is 128th on the money list; though he has played in 16 tournaments since the Dominion Open, he has added less than $4,000 to his pile. "I just lost my confidence and started hitting it kind of bad and never really took the time off to get my head squared away," he says. "I just got fried. And it's eight years of friedness, not just this year."
Weary as he is, Foltz is planning his ninth trip to Q-school later this year. "It will be my last real chance to get where I want to be," he says. If he does not qualify for the PGA tour he will work as a commentator for the Golf Channel, covering 11 Nike events and hoping for a chance to move up to the PGA or L.P.G.A. He'll probably play in a few Nike tournaments, but his career as a touring pro finally will be over. "My wife didn't mind sacrificing all these years," he says, "but now I've got a kid at home. I'm not going to make him sacrifice so I can go chase this dream that keeps outrunning me."
Having already won $18,010 this year -- nearly double the money of his roommate -- Haskins is 96th on the money list going into his 25th and last event of the season. "But I'm not as disappointed as I would have been in the past," he says, and proceeds to describe several technical changes he has made to his swing during the year. Armed with these improvements, the inveterate optimist is actually looking forward to his 13th trip to Q-school; the thing with feathers has got nothing on the Texan's new backswing. "It's not been a good year," says Haskins, just a month shy of 40, "but I feel like my game has really been on the verge of coming around. I really feel like no matter where I play next year, I'm going to have a good year."

 BODY:

Planting
Today I planted something new in my vegetable garden -- something very new, as a matter of fact. It's a potato called the New Leaf Superior, which has been genetically engineered -- by Monsanto, the chemical giant recently turned "life sciences" giant -- to produce its own insecticide. This it can do in every cell of every leaf, stem, flower, root and (here's the creepy part) spud. The scourge of potatoes has always been the Colorado potato beetle, a handsome and voracious insect that can pick a plant clean of its leaves virtually overnight. Any Colorado potato beetle that takes so much as a nibble of my New Leafs will supposedly keel over and die, its digestive tract pulped, in effect, by the bacterial toxin manufactured in the leaves of these otherwise ordinary Superiors. (Superiors are the thin-skinned white spuds sold fresh in the supermarket.) You're probably wondering if I plan to eat these potatoes, or serve them to my family. That's still up in the air; it's only the first week of May, and harvest is a few months off. 
 Certainly my New Leafs are aptly named. They're part of a new class of crop plants that is rapidly changing the American food chain. This year, the fourth year that genetically altered seed has been on the market, some 45 million acres of American farmland have been planted with biotech crops, most of it corn, soybeans, cotton and potatoes that have been engineered to either produce their own pesticides or withstand herbicides. Though Americans have already begun to eat genetically engineered potatoes, corn and soybeans, industry research confirms what my own informal surveys suggest: hardly any of us knows it. The reason is not hard to find. The biotech industry, with the concurrence of the Food and Drug Administration, has decided we don't need to know it, so biotech foods carry no identifying labels. In a dazzling feat of positioning, the industry has succeeded in depicting these plants simultaneously as the linchpins of a biological revolution -- part of a "new agricultural paradigm" that will make farming more sustainable, feed the world and improve health and nutrition -- and, oddly enough, as the same old stuff, at least so far as those of us at the eating end of the food chain should be concerned.
This convenient version of reality has been roundly rejected by both consumers and farmers across the Atlantic. Last summer, biotech food emerged as the most explosive environmental issue in Europe. Protesters have destroyed dozens of field trials of the very same "frankenplants" (as they are sometimes called) that we Americans are already serving for dinner, and throughout Europe the public has demanded that biotech food be labeled in the market.
By growing my own transgenic crop -- and talking with scientists and farmers involved with biotech -- I hoped to discover which of us was crazy. Are the Europeans overreacting, or is it possible that we've been underreacting to genetically engineered food?
After digging two shallow trenches in my garden and lining them with compost, I untied the purple mesh bag of seed potatoes that Monsanto had sent and opened up the Grower Guide tied around its neck. (Potatoes, you may recall from kindergarten experiments, are grown not from seed but from the eyes of other potatoes.) The guide put me in mind not so much of planting potatoes as booting up a new software release. By "opening and using this product," the card stated, I was now "licensed" to grow these potatoes, but only for a single generation; the crop I would water and tend and harvest was mine, yet also not mine. That is, the potatoes I will harvest come August are mine to eat or sell, but their genes remain the intellectual property of Monsanto, protected under numerous United States patents, including Nos. 5,196,525, 5,164,316, 5,322,938 and 5,352,605. Were I to save even one of them to plant next year --something I've routinely done with potatoes in the past -- I would be breaking Federal law. The small print in the Grower Guide also brought the news that my potato plants were themselves a pesticide, registered with the Environmental Protection Agency.
If proof were needed that the intricate industrial food chain that begins with seeds and ends on our dinner plates is in the throes of profound change, the small print that accompanied my New Leaf will do. That food chain has been unrivaled for its productivity -- on average, a single American farmer today grows enough food each year to feed 100 people. But this accomplishment has come at a price. The modern industrial farmer cannot achieve such yields without enormous amounts of chemical fertilizer, pesticide, machinery and fuel, a set of capital-intensive inputs, as they're called, that saddle the farmer with debt, threaten his health, erode his soil and destroy its fertility, pollute the ground water and compromise the safety of the food we eat.
We've heard all this before, of course, but usually from environmentalists and organic farmers; what is new is to hear the same critique from conventional farmers, government officials and even many agribusiness corporations, all of whom now acknowledge that our food chain stands in need of reform. Sounding more like Wendell Berry than the agribusiness giant it is, Monsanto declared in its most recent annual report that "current agricultural technology is not sustainable."
What is supposed to rescue the American food chain is biotechnology -- the replacement of expensive and toxic chemical inputs with expensive but apparently benign genetic information: crops that, like my New Leafs, can protect themselves from insects and disease without being sprayed with pesticides. With the advent of biotechnology, agriculture is entering the information age, and more than any other company, Monsanto is positioning itself to become its Microsoft, supplying the proprietary "operating systems" -- the metaphor is theirs -- to run this new generation of plants.
There is, of course, a second food chain in America: organic agriculture. And while it is still only a fraction of the size of the conventional food chain, it has been growing in leaps and bounds -- in large part because of concerns over the safety of conventional agriculture. Organic farmers have been among biotechnology's fiercest critics, regarding crops like my New Leafs as inimical to their principles and, potentially, a threat to their survival. That's because Bt, the bacterial toxin produced in my New Leafs (and in many other biotech plants) happens to be the same insecticide organic growers have relied on for decades. Instead of being flattered by the imitation, however, organic farmers are up in arms: the widespread use of Bt in biotech crops is likely to lead to insect resistance, thus robbing organic growers of one of their most critical tools; that is, Monsanto's version of sustainable agriculture may threaten precisely those farmers who pioneered sustainable farming.
 
Sprouting
After several days of drenching rain, the sun appeared on May 15, and so did my New Leafs. A dozen deep-green shoots pushed up out of the soil and commenced to grow -- faster and more robustly than any of the other potatoes in my garden. Apart from their vigor, though, my New Leafs looked perfectly normal. And yet as I watched them multiply their lustrous dark-green leaves those first few days, eagerly awaiting the arrival of the first doomed beetle, I couldn't help thinking of them as existentially different from the rest of my plants.
All domesticated plants are in some sense artificial -- living archives of both cultural and natural information that we in some sense "design." A given type of potato reflects the values we've bred into it -- one that has been selected to yield long, handsome french fries or unblemished round potato chips is the expression of a national food chain that likes its potatoes highly processed. At the same time, some of the more delicate European fingerlings I'm growing alongside my New Leafs imply an economy of small market growers and a taste for eating potatoes fresh. Yet all these qualities already existed in the potato, somewhere within the range of genetic possibilities presented by Solanum tuberosum. Since distant species in nature cannot be crossed, the breeder's art has always run up against a natural limit of what a potato is willing, or able, to do. Nature, in effect, has exercised a kind of veto on what culture can do with a potato.
My New Leafs are different. Although Monsanto likes to depict biotechnology as just another in an ancient line of human modifications of nature going back to fermentation, in fact genetic engineering overthrows the old rules governing the relationship of nature and culture in a plant. For the first time, breeders can bring qualities from anywhere in nature into the genome of a plant -- from flounders (frost tolerance), from viruses (disease resistance) and, in the case of my potatoes, from Bacillus thuringiensis, the soil bacterium that produces the organic insecticide known as Bt. The introduction into a plant of genes transported not only across species but whole phyla means that the wall of that plant's essential identity -- its irreducible wildness, you might say -- has been breached.
But what is perhaps most astonishing about the New Leafs coming up in my garden is the human intelligence that the inclusion of the Bt gene represents. In the past, that intelligence resided outside the plant, in the mind of the organic farmers who deployed Bt (in the form of a spray) to manipulate the ecological relationship of certain insects and a certain bacterium as a way to foil those insects. The irony about the New Leafs is that the cultural information they encode happens to be knowledge that resides in the heads of the very sort of people -- that is, organic growers -- who most distrust high technology.
One way to look at biotechnology is that it allows a larger portion of human intelligence to be incorporated into the plant itself. In this sense, my New Leafs are just plain smarter than the rest of my potatoes. The others will depend on my knowledge and experience when the Colorado potato beetles strike; the New Leafs, knowing what I know about bugs and Bt, will take care of themselves. So while my biotech plants might seem like alien beings, that's not quite right. They're more like us than like other plants because there's more of us in them.
 
Growing
To find out how my potatoes got that way, I traveled to suburban St. Louis in early June. My New Leafs are clones of clones of plants that were first engineered seven years ago in Monsanto's $150 million research facility, a long, low-slung brick building on the banks of the Missouri that would look like any other corporate complex were it not for the 26 greenhouses that crown its roof like shimmering crenellations of glass.
Dave Stark, a molecular biologist and co-director of Naturemark, Monsanto's potato subsidiary, escorted me through the clean rooms where potatoes are genetically engineered. Technicians sat at lab benches before petri dishes in which fingernail-size sections of potato stem had been placed in a nutrient mixture. To this the technicians added a solution of agrobacterium, a disease bacterium whose modus operandi is to break into a plant cell's nucleus and insert some of its own DNA. Essentially, scientists smuggle the Bt gene into the agrobacterium's payload, and then the bacterium splices it into the potato's DNA. The technicians also add a "marker" gene, a kind of universal product code that allows Monsanto to identify its plants after they leave the lab.
A few days later, once the slips of potato stem have put down roots, they're moved to the potato greenhouse up on the roof. Here, Glenda DeBrecht, a horticulturist, invited me to don latex gloves and help her transplant pinky-size plantlets from their petri dish to small pots. The whole operation is performed thousands of times, largely because there is so much uncertainty about the outcome. There's no way of telling where in the genome the new DNA will land, and if it winds up in the wrong place, the new gene won't be expressed (or it will be poorly expressed) or the plant may be a freak. I was struck by how the technology could at once be astoundingly sophisticated and yet also a shot in the genetic dark.
"There's still a lot we don't understand about gene expression," Stark acknowledged. A great many factors influence whether, or to what extent, a new gene will do what it's supposed to, including the environment. In one early German experiment, scientists succeeded in splicing the gene for redness into petunias. All went as planned until the weather turned hot and an entire field of red petunias suddenly and inexplicably lost their pigment. The process didn't seem nearly as simple as Monsanto's cherished software metaphor would suggest.
When I got home from St. Louis, I phoned Richard Lewontin, the Harvard geneticist, to ask him what he thought of the software metaphor. "From an intellectual-property standpoint, it's exactly right," he said. "But it's a bad one in terms of biology. It implies you feed a program into a machine and get predictable results. But the genome is very noisy. If my computer made as many mistakes as an organism does" -- in interpreting its DNA, he meant -- "I'd throw it out."
I asked him for a better metaphor. "An ecosystem," he offered. "You can always intervene and change something in it, but there's no way of knowing what all the downstream effects will be or how it might affect the environment. We have such a miserably poor understanding of how the organism develops from its DNA that I would be surprised if we don't get one rude shock after another."
 
Flowering
My own crop was thriving when I got home from St. Louis; the New Leafs were as big as bushes, crowned with slender flower stalks. Potato flowers are actually quite pretty, at least by vegetable standards -- five-petaled pink stars with yellow centers that give off a faint rose perfume. One sultry afternoon I watched the bumblebees making their lazy rounds of my potato blossoms, thoughtlessly powdering their thighs with yellow pollen grains before lumbering off to appointments with other blossoms, others species.
Uncertainty is the theme that unifies much of the criticism leveled against biotech agriculture by scientists and environmentalists. By planting millions of acres of genetically altered plants, we have introduced something novel into the environment and the food chain, the consequences of which are not -- and at this point, cannot be -- completely understood. One of the uncertainties has to do with those grains of pollen bumblebees are carting off from my potatoes. That pollen contains Bt genes that may wind up in some other, related plant, possibly conferring a new evolutionary advantage on that species. "Gene flow," the scientific term for this phenomenon, occurs only between closely related species, and since the potato evolved in South America, the chances are slim that my Bt potato genes will escape into the wilds of Connecticut. (It's interesting to note that while biotechnology depends for its power on the ability to move genes freely among species and even phyla, its environmental safety depends on the very opposite phenomenon: on the integrity of species in nature and their rejection of foreign genetic material.)
Yet what happens if and when Peruvian farmers plant Bt potatoes? Or when I plant a biotech crop that does have local relatives? A study reported in Nature last month found that plant traits introduced by genetic engineering were more likely to escape into the wild than the same traits introduced conventionally.
Andrew Kimbrell, director of the Center for Technology Assessment in Washington, told me he believes such escapes are inevitable. "Biological pollution will be the environmental nightmare of the 21st century," he said when I reached him by phone. "This is not like chemical pollution -- an oil spill -- that eventually disperses. Biological pollution is an entirely different model, more like a disease. Is Monsanto going to be held legally responsible when one of its transgenes creates a superweed or resistant insect?"
Kimbrell maintains that because our pollution laws were written before the advent of biotechnology, the new industry is being regulated under an ill-fitting regime designed for the chemical age. Congress has so far passed no environmental law dealing specifically with biotech. Monsanto, for its part, claims that it has thoroughly examined all the potential environmental and health risks of its biotech plants, and points out that three regulatory agencies -- the U.S.D.A., the E.P.A. and the F.D.A. -- have signed off on its products. Speaking of the New Leaf, Dave Stark told me, "This is the most intensively studied potato in history."
Significant uncertainties remain, however. Take the case of insect resistance to Bt, a potential form of "biological pollution" that could end the effectiveness of one of the safest insecticides we have -- and cripple the organic farmers who depend on it. The theory, which is now accepted by most entomologists, is that Bt crops will add so much of the toxin to the environment that insects will develop resistance to it. Until now, resistance hasn't been a worry because the Bt sprays break down quickly in sunlight and organic farmers use them only sparingly. Resistance is essentially a form of co-evolution that seems to occur only when a given pest population is threatened with extinction; under that pressure, natural selection favors whatever chance mutations will allow the species to change and survive.
Working with the E.P.A., Monsanto has developed a "resistance-management plan" to postpone that eventuality. Under the plan, farmers who plant Bt crops must leave a certain portion of their land in non-Bt crops to create "refuges" for the targeted insects. The goal is to prevent the first Bt-resistant Colorado potato beetle from mating with a second resistant bug, unleashing a new race of superbeetles. The theory is that when a Bt-resistant bug does show up, it can be induced to mate with a susceptible bug from the refuge, thus diluting the new gene for resistance.
But a lot has to go right for Mr. Wrong to meet Miss Right. No one is sure how big the refuges need to be, where they should be situated or whether the farmers will cooperate (creating havens for a detested pest is counter-intuitive, after all), not to mention the bugs. In the case of potatoes, the E.P.A. has made the plan voluntary and lets the companies themselves implement it; there are no E.P.A. enforcement mechanisms. Which is why most of the organic farmers I spoke to dismissed the regulatory scheme as window dressing.
Monsanto executives offer two basic responses to criticism of their Bt crops. The first is that their voluntary resistance-management plans will work, though the company's definition of success will come as small consolation to an organic farmer: Monsanto scientists told me that if all goes well, resistance can be postponed for 30 years. (Some scientists believe it will come in three to five years.) The second response is more troubling. In St. Louis, I met with Jerry Hjelle, Monsanto's vice president for regulatory affairs. Hjelle told me that resistance should not unduly concern us since "there are a thousand other Bt's out there" -- other insecticidal proteins. "We can handle this problem with new products," he said. "The critics don't know what we have in the pipeline."
And then Hjelle uttered two words that I thought had been expunged from the corporate vocabulary a long time ago: "Trust us."
'Trust" is a key to the success of biotechnology in the marketplace, and while I was in St. Louis, I asked Hjelle and several of his colleagues why they thought the Europeans were resisting biotech food. Austria, Luxembourg and Norway, risking trade war with the United States, have refused to accept imports of genetically altered crops. Activists in England have been staging sit-ins and "decontaminations" in biotech test fields. A group of French farmers broke into a warehouse and ruined a shipment of biotech corn seed by urinating on it. The Prince of Wales, who is an ardent organic gardener, waded into the biotech debate last June, vowing in a column in The Daily Telegraph that he would never eat, or serve to his guests, the fruits of a technology that "takes mankind into realms that belong to God and to God alone."
Monsanto executives are quick to point out that mad cow disease has made Europeans extremely sensitive about the safety of their food chain and has undermined confidence in their regulators. "They don't have a trusted agency like the F.D.A. looking after the safety of their food supply," said Phil Angell, Monsanto's director of corporate communications. Over the summer, Angell was dispatched repeatedly to Europe to put out the P.R. fires; some at Monsanto worry these could spread to the United States.
I checked with the F.D.A. to find out exactly what had been done to insure the safety of this potato. I was mystified by the fact that the Bt toxin was not being treated as a "food additive" subject to labeling, even though the new protein is expressed in the potato itself. The label on a bag of biotech potatoes in the supermarket will tell a consumer all about the nutrients they contain, even the trace amounts of copper. Yet it is silent not only about the fact that those potatoes are the product of genetic engineering but also about their containing an insecticide.
At the F.D.A., I was referred to James Maryanski, who oversees biotech food at the agency. I began by asking him why the F.D.A. didn't consider Bt a food additive. Under F.D.A. law, any novel substance added to a food must -- unless it is "generally regarded as safe" ("GRAS," in F.D.A. parlance) -- be thoroughly tested and if it changes the product in any way, must be labeled.
"That's easy," Maryanski said. "Bt is a pesticide, so it's exempt" from F.D.A. regulation. That is, even though a Bt potato is plainly a food, for the purposes of Federal regulation it is not a food but a pesticide and therefore falls under the jurisdiction of the E.P.A.
Yet even in the case of those biotech crops over which the F.D.A. does have jurisdiction, I learned that F.D.A. regulation of biotech food has been largely voluntary since 1992, when Vice President Dan Quayle issued regulatory guidelines for the industry as part of the Bush Administration's campaign for "regulatory relief." Under the guidelines, new proteins engineered into foods are regarded as additives (unless they're pesticides), but as Maryanski explained, "the determination whether a new protein is GRAS can be made by the company." Companies with a new biotech food decide for themselves whether they need to consult with the F.D.A. by following a series of "decision trees" that pose yes or no questions like this one: "Does. . .the introduced protein raise any safety concern?"
Since my Bt potatoes were being regulated as a pesticide by the E.P.A. rather than as a food by the F.D.A., I wondered if the safety standards are the same. "Not exactly," Maryanski explained. The F.D.A. requires "a reasonable certainty of no harm" in a food additive, a standard most pesticides could not meet. After all, "pesticides are toxic to something," Maryanski pointed out, so the E.P.A. instead establishes human "tolerances" for each chemical and then subjects it to a risk-benefit analysis.
When I called the E.P.A. and asked if the agency had tested my Bt potatoes for safety as a human food, the answer was. . .not exactly. It seems the E.P.A. works from the assumption that if the original potato is safe and the Bt protein added to it is safe, then the whole New Leaf package is presumed to be safe. Some geneticists believe this reasoning is flawed, contending that the process of genetic engineering itself may cause subtle, as yet unrecognized changes in a food.
The original Superior potato is safe, obviously enough, so that left the Bt toxin, which was fed to mice, and they "did fine, had no side effects," I was told. I always feel better knowing that my food has been poison-tested by mice, though in this case there was a small catch: the mice weren't actually eating the potatoes, not even an extract from the potatoes, but rather straight Bt produced in a bacterial culture.
So are my New Leafs safe to eat? Probably, assuming that a New Leaf is nothing more than the sum of a safe potato and a safe pesticide, and further assuming that the E.P.A.'s idea of a safe pesticide is tantamount to a safe food. Yet I still had a question. Let us assume that my potatoes are a pesticide -- a very safe pesticide. Every pesticide in my garden shed -- including the Bt sprays -- carries a lengthy warning label. The label on my bottle of Bt says, among other things, that I should avoid inhaling the spray or getting it in an open wound. So if my New Leaf potatoes contain an E.P.A.-registered pesticide, why don't they carry some such label?
Maryanski had the answer. At least for the purposes of labeling, my New Leafs have morphed yet again, back into a food: the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act gives the F.D.A. sole jurisdiction over the labeling of plant foods, and the F.D.A. has ruled that biotech foods need be labeled only if they contain known allergens or have otherwise been "materially" changed.
But isn't turning a potato into a pesticide a material change?
It doesn't matter. The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act specifically bars the F.D.A. from including any information about pesticides on its food labels.
I thought about Maryanski's candid and wondrous explanations the next time I met Phil Angell, who again cited the critical role of the F.D.A. in assuring Americans that biotech food is safe. But this time he went even further. "Monsanto should not have to vouchsafe the safety of biotech food," he said. "Our interest is in selling as much of it as possible. Assuring its safety is the F.D.A.'s job."
 
Meeting the Beetles
My Colorado potato beetle vigil came to an end the first week of July, shortly before I went to Idaho to visit potato growers. I spied a single mature beetle sitting on a New Leaf leaf; when I reached to pick it up, the beetle fell drunkenly to the ground. It had been sickened by the plant and would soon be dead. My New Leafs were working.
From where a typical American potato grower stands, the New Leaf looks very much like a godsend. That's because where the typical potato grower stands is in the middle of a bright green field that has been doused with so much pesticide that the leaves of his plants wear a dull white chemical bloom that troubles him as much as it does the rest of us. Out there, at least, the calculation is not complex: a product that promises to eliminate the need for even a single spraying of pesticide is, very simply, an economic and environmental boon.
No one can make a better case for a biotech crop than a potato farmer, which is why Monsanto was eager to introduce me to several large growers. Like many farmers today, the ones I met feel trapped by the chemical inputs required to extract the high yields they must achieve in order to pay for the chemical inputs they need. The economics are daunting: a potato farmer in south-central Idaho will spend roughly $1,965 an acre (mainly on chemicals, electricity, water and seed) to grow a crop that, in a good year, will earn him maybe $1,980. That's how much a french-fry processor will pay for the 20 tons of potatoes a single Idaho acre can yield. (The real money in agriculture -- 90 percent of the value added to the food we eat -- is in selling inputs to farmers and then processing their crops.)
Danny Forsyth laid out the dismal economics of potato farming for me one sweltering morning at the coffee shop in downtown Jerome, Idaho. Forsyth, 60, is a slight blue-eyed man with a small gray ponytail; he farms 3,000 acres of potatoes, corn and wheat, and he spoke about agricultural chemicals like a man desperate to kick a bad habit. "None of us would use them if we had any choice," he said glumly.
I asked him to walk me through a season's regimen. It typically begins early in the spring with a soil fumigant; to control nematodes, many potato farmers douse their fields with a chemical toxic enough to kill every trace of microbial life in the soil. Then, at planting, a systemic insecticide (like Thimet) is applied to the soil; this will be absorbed by the young seedlings and, for several weeks, will kill any insect that eats their leaves. After planting, Forsyth puts down an herbicide -- Sencor or Eptam -- to "clean" his field of all weeds. When the potato seedlings are six inches tall, an herbicide may be sprayed a second time to control weeds.
Idaho farmers like Forsyth farm in vast circles defined by the rotation of a pivot irrigation system, typically 135 acres to a circle; I'd seen them from 30,000 feet flying in, a grid of verdant green coins pressed into a desert of scrubby brown. Pesticides and fertilizers are simply added to the irrigation system, which on Forsyth's farm draws most of its water from the nearby Snake River. Along with their water, Forsyth's potatoes may receive 10 applications of chemical fertilizer during the growing season. Just before the rows close -- when the leaves of one row of plants meet those of the next -- he begins spraying Bravo, a fungicide, to control late blight, one of the biggest threats to the potato crop. (Late blight, which caused the Irish potato famine, is an airborne fungus that turns stored potatoes into rotting mush.) Blight is such a serious problem that the E.P.A. currently allows farmers to spray powerful fungicides that haven't passed the usual approval process. Forsyth's potatoes will receive eight applications of fungicide.
Twice each summer, Forsyth hires a crop duster to spray for aphids. Aphids are harmless in themselves, but they transmit the leafroll virus, which in Russet Burbank potatoes causes net necrosis, a brown spotting that will cause a processor to reject a whole crop. It happened to Forsyth last year. "I lost 80,000 bags" -- they're a hundred pounds each -- "to net necrosis," he said. "Instead of getting $4.95 a bag, I had to take $2 a bag from the dehydrator, and I was lucky to get that." Net necrosis is a purely cosmetic defect; yet because big buyers like McDonald's believe (with good reason) that we don't like to see brown spots in our fries, farmers like Danny Forsyth must spray their fields with some of the most toxic chemicals in use, including an organophosphate called Monitor.
"Monitor is a deadly chemical," Forsyth said. "I won't go into a field for four or five days after it's been sprayed -- even to fix a broken pivot." That is, he would sooner lose a whole circle to drought than expose himself or an employee to Monitor, which has been found to cause neurological damage.
It's not hard to see why a farmer like Forsyth, struggling against tight margins and heartsick over chemicals, would leap at a New Leaf -- or, in his case, a New Leaf Plus, which is protected from leafroll virus as well as beetles. "The New Leaf means I can skip a couple of sprayings, including the Monitor," he said. "I save money, and I sleep better. It also happens to be a nice-looking spud." The New Leafs don't come cheaply, however. They cost between $20 and $30 extra per acre in "technology fees" to Monsanto.
Forsyth and I discussed organic agriculture, about which he had the usual things to say ("That's all fine on a small scale, but they don't have to feed the world"), as well as a few things I'd never heard from a conventional farmer: "I like to eat organic food, and in fact I raise a lot of it at the house. The vegetables we buy at the market we just wash and wash and wash. I'm not sure I should be saying this, but I always plant a small area of potatoes without any chemicals. By the end of the season, my field potatoes are fine to eat, but any potatoes I pulled today are probably still full of systemics. I don't eat them."
Forsyth's words came back to me a few hours later, during lunch at the home of another potato farmer. Steve Young is a progressive and prosperous potato farmer -- he calls himself an agribusinessman. In addition to his 10,000 acres -- the picture window in his family room gazes out on 85 circles, all computer-controlled -- Young owns a share in a successful fertilizer distributorship. His wife prepared a lavish feast for us, and after Dave, their 18-year-old, said grace, adding a special prayer for me (the Youngs are devout Mormons), she passed around a big bowl of homemade potato salad. As I helped myself, my Monsanto escort asked what was in the salad, flashing me a smile that suggested she might already know. "It's a combination of New Leafs and some of our regular Russets," our hostess said proudly. "Dug this very morning."
After talking to farmers like Steve Young and Danny Forsyth, and walking fields made virtually sterile by a drenching season-long rain of chemicals, you could understand how Monsanto's New Leaf potato does indeed look like an environmental boon. Set against current practices, growing New Leafs represents a more sustainable way of potato farming. This advance must be weighed, of course, against everything we don't yet know about New Leafs -- and a few things we do: like the problem of Bt resistance I had heard so much about back East. While I was in Idaho and Washington State, I asked potato farmers to show me their refuges. This proved to be a joke.
"I guess that's a refuge over there," one Washington farmer told me, pointing to a cornfield.
Monsanto's grower contract never mentions the word "refuge" and only requires that farmers plant no more than 80 percent of their fields in New Leaf. Basically, any field not planted in New Leaf is considered a refuge, even if that field has been sprayed to kill every bug in it. Farmers call such acreage a clean field; calling it a refuge is a stretch at best.
It probably shouldn't come as a big surprise that conventional farmers would have trouble embracing the notion of an insect refuge. To insist on real and substantial refuges is to ask them to start thinking of their fields in an entirely new way, less as a factory than as an ecosystem. In the factory, Bt is another in a long line of "silver bullets" that work for a while and then get replaced; in the ecosystem, all bugs are not necessarily bad, and the relationships between various species can be manipulated to achieve desired ends -- like the long-term sustainability of Bt.
This is, of course, precisely the approach organic farmers have always taken to their fields, and after my lunch with the Youngs that afternoon, I paid a brief visit to an organic potato grower. Mike Heath is a rugged, laconic man in his mid-50's; like most of the organic farmers I've met, he looks as though he spends a lot more time out of doors than a conventional farmer, and he probably does: chemicals are, among other things, labor-saving devices. While we drove around his 500 acres in a battered old pickup, I asked him about biotechnology. He voiced many reservations -- it was synthetic, there were too many unknowns -- but his main objection to planting a biotech potato was simply that "it's not what my customers want."
That point was driven home last December when the Department of Agriculture proposed a new "organic standards" rule that, among other things, would have allowed biotech crops to carry an organic label. After receiving a flood of outraged cards and letters, the agency backed off. (As did Monsanto, which asked the U.S.D.A. to shelve the issue for three years.) Heath suggested that biotech may actually help organic farmers by driving worried consumers to the organic label.
I asked Heath about the New Leaf. He had no doubt resistance would come -- "the bugs are always going to be smarter than we are" -- and said it was unjust that Monsanto was profiting from the ruin of Bt, something he regarded as a "public good."
None of this particularly surprised me; what did was that Heath himself resorted to Bt sprays only once or twice in the last 10 years. I had assumed that organic farmers used Bt or other approved pesticides in much the same way conventional farmers use theirs, but as Heath showed me around his farm, I began to understand that organic farming was a lot more complicated than substituting good inputs for bad. Instead of buying many inputs at all, Heath relied on long and complex crop rotations to prevent a buildup of crop-specific pests -- he has found, for example, that planting wheat after spuds "confuses" the potato beetles.
He also plants strips of flowering crops on the margins of his potato fields -- peas or alfalfa, usually -- to attract the beneficial insects that eat beetle larvae and aphids. If there aren't enough beneficials to do the job, he'll introduce ladybugs. Heath also grows eight varieties of potatoes, on the theory that biodiversity in a field, as in the wild, is the best defense against any imbalances in the system. A bad year with one variety will probably be offset by a good year with the others.
"I can eat any potato in this field right now," he said, digging Yukon Golds for me to take home. "Most farmers can't eat their spuds out of the field. But you don't want to start talking about safe food in Idaho."
Heath's were the antithesis of "clean" fields, and, frankly, their weedy margins and overall patchiness made them much less pretty to look at. Yet it was the very complexity of these fields -- the sheer diversity of species, both in space and time -- that made them productive year after year without many inputs. The system provided for most of its needs.
All told, Heath's annual inputs consisted of natural fertilizers (compost and fish powder), ladybugs and a copper spray (for blight) -- a few hundred dollars an acre. Of course, before you can compare Heath's operation with a conventional farm, you've got to add in the extra labor (lots of smaller crops means more work; organic fields must also be cultivated for weeds) and time -- the typical organic rotation calls for potatoes every fifth year, in contrast to every third on a conventional farm. I asked Heath about his yields. To my astonishment, he was digging between 300 and 400 bags per acre -- just as many as Danny Forsyth and only slightly fewer than Steve Young. Heath was also getting almost twice the price for his spuds: $8 a bag from an organic processor who was shipping frozen french fries to Japan.
On the drive back to Boise, I thought about why Heath's farm remained the exception, both in Idaho and elsewhere. Here was a genuinely new paradigm that seemed to work. But while it's true that organic agriculture is gaining ground (I met a big grower in Washington who had just added several organic circles), few of the mainstream farmers I met considered organic a "realistic" alternative. For one thing, it's expensive to convert: organic certifiers require a field to go without chemicals for three years before it can be called organic. For another, the U.S.D.A., which sets the course of American agriculture, has long been hostile to organic methods.
But I suspect the real reasons run deeper, and have more to do with the fact that in a dozen ways a farm like Heath's simply doesn't conform to the requirements of a corporate food chain. Heath's type of agriculture doesn't leave much room for the Monsantos of this world: organic farmers buy remarkably little -- some seed, a few tons of compost, maybe a few gallons of ladybugs. That's because the organic farmer's focus is on a process, rather than on products. Nor is that process readily systematized, reduced to, say, a prescribed regime of sprayings like the one Forsyth outlined for me -- regimes that are often designed by companies selling chemicals.
Most of the intelligence and local knowledge needed to run Mike Heath's farm resides in the head of Mike Heath. Growing potatoes conventionally requires intelligence, too, but a large portion of it resides in laboratories in distant places like St. Louis, where it is employed in developing sophisticated chemical inputs. That sort of centralization of agriculture is unlikely to be reversed, if only because there's so much money in it; besides, it's much easier for the farmer to buy prepackaged solutions from big companies. "Whose Head Is the Farmer Using? Whose Head Is Using the Farmer?" goes the title of a Wendell Berry essay.
Organic farmers like Heath have also rejected what is perhaps the cornerstone of industrial agriculture: the economies of scale that only a monoculture can achieve. Monoculture -- growing vast fields of the same crop year after year -- is probably the single most powerful simplification of modern agriculture. But monoculture is poorly fitted to the way nature seems to work. Very simply, a field of identical plants will be exquisitely vulnerable to insects, weeds and disease. Monoculture is at the root of virtually every problem that bedevils the modern farmer, and that virtually every input has been designed to solve.
To put the matter baldly, a farmer like Heath is working very hard to adjust his fields and his crops to the nature of nature, while farmers like Forsyth are working equally hard to adjust nature in their fields to the requirement of monoculture and, beyond that, to the needs of the industrial food chain. I remember asking Heath what he did about net necrosis, the bane of Forsyth's existence. "That's only really a problem with Russet Burbanks," he said. "So I plant other kinds." Forsyth can't do that. He's part of a food chain -- at the far end of which stands a long, perfectly golden McDonald's fry -- that demands he grow Russet Burbanks and little else.
This is where biotechnology comes in, to the rescue of Forsyth's Russet Burbanks and, if Monsanto is right, to the whole food chain of which they form a part. Monoculture is in trouble -- the pesticides that make it possible are rapidly being lost, either to resistance or to heightened concerns about their danger. Biotechnology is the new silver bullet that will save monoculture. But a new silver bullet is not a new paradigm -- rather, it's something that will allow the old paradigm to survive. That paradigm will always construe the problem in Forsyth's fields as a Colorado potato beetle problem, rather than as a problem of potato monoculture.
Like the silver bullets that preceded them -- the modern hybrids, the pesticides and the chemical fertilizers -- the new biotech crops will probably, as advertised, increase yields. But equally important, they will also speed the process by which agriculture is being concentrated in a shrinking number of corporate hands. If that process has advanced more slowly in farming than in other sectors of the economy, it is only because nature herself -- her complexity, diversity and sheer intractability in the face of our best efforts at control -- has acted as a check on it. But biotechnology promises to remedy this "problem," too.
Consider, for example, the seed, perhaps the ultimate "means of production" in any agriculture. It is only in the last few decades that farmers have begun buying their seed from big companies, and even today many farmers still save some seed every fall to replant in the spring. Brown-bagging, as it is called, allows farmers to select strains particularly well adapted to their needs; since these seeds are often traded, the practice advances the state of the genetic art -- indeed, has given us most of our crop plants. Seeds by their very nature don't lend themselves to commodification: they produce more of themselves ad infinitum (with the exception of certain modern hybrids), and for that reason the genetics of most major crop plants have traditionally been regarded as a common heritage. In the case of the potato, the genetics of most important varieties -- the Burbanks, the Superiors, the Atlantics -- have always been in the public domain. Before Monsanto released the New Leaf, there had never been a multinational seed corporation in the potato-seed business -- there was no money in it.
Biotechnology changes all that. By adding a new gene or two to a Russet Burbank or Superior, Monsanto can now patent the improved variety. Legally, it has been possible to patent a plant for many years, but biologically, these patents have been almost impossible to enforce. Biotechnology partly solves that problem. A Monsanto agent can perform a simple test in my garden and prove that my plants are the company's intellectual property. The contract farmers sign with Monsanto allows company representatives to perform such tests in their fields at will. According to Progressive Farmer, a trade journal, Monsanto is using informants and hiring Pinkertons to enforce its patent rights; it has already brought legal action against hundreds of farmers for patent infringement.
Soon the company may not have to go to the trouble. It is expected to acquire the patent to a powerful new biotechnology called the Terminator, which will, in effect, allow the company to enforce its patents biologically. Developed by the U.S.D.A. in partnership with Delta and Pine Land, a seed company in the process of being purchased by Monsanto, the Terminator is a complex of genes that, theoretically, can be spliced into any crop plant, where it will cause every seed produced by that plant to be sterile. Once the Terminator becomes the industry standard, control over the genetics of crop plants will complete its move from the farmer's field to the seed company -- to which the farmer will have no choice but to return year after year. The Terminator will allow companies like Monsanto to privatize one of the last great commons in nature -- the genetics of the crop plants that civilization has developed over the past 10,000 years.
At lunch on his farm in Idaho, I had asked Steve Young what he thought about all this, especially about the contract Monsanto made him sign. I wondered how the American farmer, the putative heir to a long tradition of agrarian independence, was adjusting to the idea of field men snooping around his farm, and patented seed he couldn't replant. Young said he had made his peace with corporate agriculture, and with biotechnology in particular: "It's here to stay. It's necessary if we're going to feed the world, and it's going to take us forward."
Then I asked him if he saw any downside to biotechnology, and he paused for what seemed a very long time. What he then said silenced the table. "There is a cost," he said. "It gives corporate America one more noose around my neck."
 
Harvest
A few weeks after I returned home from Idaho, I dug my New Leafs, harvesting a gorgeous-looking pile of white spuds, including some real lunkers. The plants had performed brilliantly, though so had all my other potatoes. The beetle problem never got serious, probably because the diversity of species in my (otherwise organic) garden had attracted enough beneficial insects to keep the beetles in check. By the time I harvested my crop, the question of eating the New Leafs was moot. Whatever I thought about the soundness of the process that had declared these potatoes safe didn't matter. Not just because I'd already had a few bites of New Leaf potato salad at the Youngs but also because Monsanto and the F.D.A. and the E.P.A. had long ago taken the decision of whether or not to eat a biotech potato out of my -- out of all of our -- hands. Chances are, I've eaten New Leafs already, at McDonald's or in a bag of Frito-Lay chips, though without a label there can be no way of knowing for sure.
So if I've probably eaten New Leafs already, why was it that I kept putting off eating mine? Maybe because it was August, and there were so many more-interesting fresh potatoes around -- fingerlings with dense, luscious flesh, Yukon Golds that tasted as though they had been pre-buttered -- that the idea of cooking with a bland commercial variety like the Superior seemed beside the point.
There was this, too: I had called Margaret Mellon at the Union of Concerned Scientists to ask her advice. Mellon is a molecular biologist and lawyer and a leading critic of biotech agriculture. She couldn't offer any hard scientific evidence that my New Leafs were unsafe, though she emphasized how little we know about the effects of Bt in the human diet. "That research simply hasn't been done," she said.
I pressed. Is there any reason I shouldn't eat these spuds?
"Let me turn that around. Why would you want to?"
It was a good question. So for a while I kept my New Leafs in a bag on the porch. Then I took the bag with me on vacation, thinking maybe I'd sample them there, but the bag came home untouched.
The bag sat on my porch till the other day, when I was invited to an end-of-summer potluck supper at the town beach. Perfect. I signed up to make a potato salad. I brought the bag into the kitchen and set a pot of water on the stove. But before it boiled I was stricken by this thought: I'd have to tell people at the picnic what they were eating. I'm sure (well, almost sure) the potatoes are safe, but if the idea of eating biotech food without knowing it bothered me, how could I possibly ask my neighbors to? So I'd tell them about the New Leafs -- and then, no doubt, lug home a big bowl of untouched potato salad. For surely there would be other potato salads at the potluck and who, given the choice, was ever going to opt for the bowl with the biotech spuds?
So there they sit, a bag of biotech spuds on my porch. I'm sure they're absolutely fine. I pass the bag every day, thinking I really should try one, but I'm beginning to think that what I like best about these particular biotech potatoes -- what makes them different -- is that I have this choice. And until I know more, I choose not.

Enough Already! What Am I, Chopped Liver?

BYLINE: By William Safire 

 BODY:
'What red-blooded American hasn't surveyed the muck and mire of our national politics," writes Mark Jurkowitz of The Boston Globe, "and said, 'Enough, already'?"
"Time magazine reports that Clinton's woes have left U.S. foreign policy adrift," writes The Guardian of London, "though Garrison Keillor says, 'Enough already!' " 
 Howard Fineman of Newsweek asks, "Is there any way out of this mess?" leading to an inch-high, 102-point, block-letter headline: "enough already."
The stylistic issue raised is: Should there be a comma between the first and second words of this increasingly important phrase? The publication that pioneered in its popularization is The Toronto Globe and Mail; of the 19,000 entries in the Dow Jones database, the first 22 uses (from 1977 to 1983) were in that newspaper. According to Warren Clements, style editor, "We abandoned the comma in 1979 because enough already was considered one of those expressions that is almost one word. It rips rollingly off the tongue; the comma would slow it down." Adds Michael Kesterton of that newspaper, "I know it's a Yiddishism, but it just fits the Canadian soul -- you know, 'I've had it and I'm not gonna take it anymore.' "
The origin is the Yiddish genug shoyn, literally "enough already." It is part of an array of phrases using shoyn for emphasis, from the similar gut shoyn, "All right already!" in the sense of "Stop bugging me," to shvayg shtil shoyn, "Shut up already!" one calibration more irritated than genug shoyn.
"This use of already began to appear early in the century," says Sol Steinmetz, the lexicographer who has taken the place of the late Leo Rosten as my primary Yiddish adviser, "among immigrant Yiddish speakers living in New York who were just starting to talk English. By the 1930's it had become common usage among their children who no longer spoke Yiddish -- a development that enabled it to entrench itself in the American language."
Another scholar, Lillian Feinsilver, in her "Taste of Yiddish" (1970), notes that "English would normally use the mild now, as in 'Come, now,' or the stronger 'Come on, now.' "
Now is an adverb of time that can be used as an admonition before a statement ("Now, I want you to listen to this. . . "). Similarly, already and yet are adverbs of time that can be used to intensify a statement when used at the end. ("Were you bitten by a mad dog?" "And the dog is mad, yet.") Thus, already -- in Standard English, "beforehand; by this time" -- can be used in this idiomatic sense to mean "without further ado" or "and you'd better believe it."
We have seen how this Yiddishism has been thoroughly assimilated and is now an Americanism. Because other American English expressions have been adopted in many other languages -- O.K. and no problem are examples -- does this mean that this particular emphasis of exasperation is taking root elsewhere?
Some evidence exists that it does. Here is a letter to The Washington Post from Robert Hill, an American working in a large Saudi hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: "The overwhelming -- by 9 to 1 -- response to the Clinton affair varies among 'What is the very big deal?' to 'What about the problems in the rest of the world?' to 'Enough already!' "
When a Yiddishism takes root in Riyadh, that's saying something. Have we exhausted this subject? The reader may now vent exasperation at a surfeit of data by expostulating the very phrase being so minutely examined.
 
WHAT AM I?
At a chic Washington cocktail party, Elizabeth Drew, author of "Whatever It Takes: The Real Struggle for Political Power in America," accepted an hors d'oeuvre of chopped liver smeared on a cracker and asked: "Chopped liver is delicious. Why do people derogate it so? As in the expression, 'What am I, chopped liver?' "
The earliest use of this phrase in its derogatory sense -- that is, "something trivial; something to be scoffed at" -- in the Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang is by Jimmy Durante on his 1954 CBS-TV show: "Now that ain't chopped liver."
In a 1980 monologue about the Reagan-Carter Presidential debate, Johnny Carson noted Ronald Reagan's statement that if all the unemployed were lined up, they would stretch from New York to Los Angeles. "He came up with another one today," said Carson. "If everyone on welfare were chopped liver, you could spread them on a line of Ritz crackers from here to Bulgaria." A decade later, the actor-producer Michael Douglas applied the phrase to himself, complaining about his secondary role in a movie: "That hurt me in the industry as an actor, and it ticked me off. I thought, What was I -- chopped liver or something?"
This show-biz usage contributed to the treatment of the ethnic culinary delicacy (in Yiddish, gehakte leber) as an object of disdain. It may have also been influenced by its sense in underworld lingo as "a beaten and scarred person," or by the urbanization of the once-rural expression "That ain't hay." Steinmetz speculates: "Chopped liver is merely an appetizer or side dish, not as important as chicken soup or gefilte fish. Hence it was often used among Jewish comedians in the Borscht Belt as a humorous metaphor for something or someone insignificant."
Nobody who tastes properly made chopped liver can use it as a derogation. I turned to my Times colleague Marian Burros, author of "The New Elegant But Easy Cookbook," for the recipe: "Saute one finely chopped medium onion in two tablespoons hot chicken fat until lightly golden and very soft. Add 1 pound chicken liver and saute until cooked through; process in food processor with one small raw onion and one hard-cooked egg. Season with salt and pepper and mix with enough chicken fat to make it moist and spreadable."
Then you can say, "I feel just as terrific as chopped liver!"

HEADLINE: New Housing Based on a Colonial Tradition

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

DATELINE: RYE BROOK

 BODY:
TWO young lawyers, Marc and Dana Zimmerman, both 29, live in Riverdale and commute to their law practice in Manhattan. Mrs. Zimmerman, who grew up and went through school here, has many friends in the area, which she loves.
Eileen and Walter Sinnott raised four sons in the large house in Harrison where they have lived for 34 years. Mr. Sinnott, a retired environmental engineer, was born in Harrison and has lived there all his life, as his parents and grandparents did before him. 
 What the two couples -- one retired, empty nesters, the other starting out -- share is their enthusiasm for Belle Fair at Rye Brook. Without seeing actual model houses, they and 100 other buyers have signed contracts for new houses to be built on a 140-acre site, which the developer, Mitchell C. Hochberg, president of Spectrum Skanska of Valhalla, said is not only the largest new residential community in Westchester but also the first new old-fashioned town incorporating such turn-of-the-century neighborhood features as a village green with a meetinghouse and a wide range of housing for people of all ages: young married couples, families with children, professionals, empty nesters and retirees. In addition to the many housing choices, a three-story building for the elderly is planned.
"Belle Fair has been designed in the tradition of 'new urbanism,' a trend in residential development that begins with pedestrian-friendly streets, where the focus is on people, not cars," Mr. Hochberg said. "We call Bell Fair the new traditional hometown. Like the old town square, we have a village green, which is an open green space, the size of a football field, as the heart of the community, accessible to young and old alike by foot, bike or car. It will be bordered by landscaping and park benches framing a lawn where children can play and families picnic. Flanking it, will be a Meetinghouse, a bell tower, a general store and village homes. The environment is deliberately designed to foster interaction between people."
Although new urbanism communities exist in places like Florida and California, Mr. Hochberg said Bell Fair is the only such development in the Northeast.
"I spent two years traveling around the country looking at new urban developments such as Sea Side in Florida, which is in the front ranks of new urban design, "Mr. Hochberg said. "We then incorporated some of the elements that were applicable, such as streetscape landscaping, elevations, making houses open to the streets, sidewalks, winding roads and off-street, out-of-sight garages."
Amenities include the meetinghouse, which, Mr. Hochberg said, will have an indoor pool, spa, health club, catering kitchen, gymnasium, computer study room and library suitable for after-school study.
A full-size basketball court will encourage formation of basketball leagues for teen-agers and older players, he said, adding, "The idea being, that at Bell Fair, people have a chance to interact." An outdoor pool and a day-care center subsidized by the developer are also planned.
"There will also be a general store and an old-fashioned soda fountain on the village green, both subsidized by us," Mr. Hochberg said.
Prices of the Colonial-style houses range from $400,000 to about $600,000 and include a mix of 100 single-family, three- and four-bedroom houses, 73 luxury four-bedroom houses, 30 single-family, 3- and 4-bedroom maintenance-free Village houses around the village green and 46 maintenance-free villas suitable for empty nesters and retirees.
"We wanted a balanced community, one that spans generations," Mr. Hochberg said.
The Belle Fair concept has been received "beyond anything I could envision," Mr. Hochberg said. "On our opening day, late in June, traditionally not a good time to launch a new housing development, 400 people turned out. We expected to see 100."
He added that because of the unprecedented demand for homes at Belle Fair, the developers decided to hold a lottery. "We thought it was the most equitable way to sell the first phase of 30 houses, which 200 people were vying for," he said.
The buyers have yet to see a completed house. "They examined site maps, floor plans, saw a virtual reality video and toured the site where they saw 300,000 yards of fill being moved around," Mr. Hochberg said. "And they signed contracts. To date we've sold over 100 houses before our model house is built."
Most buyers are Westchester residents, and sales to members of different generations are not uncommon.
"We've had young couples with children buy, then their parents come and look and they end up buying," Mr. Hochberg said. "People who are absolutely delighted with the idea of living near their grandchildren."
The Sinnotts, who bought one of the town houses, said they liked the multigenerational aspect of Belle Fair. "I like to see kids around," Mr. Sinnott said. "We didn't want to be in a place where everyone is the same age. And we wanted to stay in Westchester. We have very strong ties to Harrison."
Mrs. Sinnott said: "We've been looking for a long time. Our house is actually four stories and too big for us, but we couldn't find anything we liked in the area. Then I saw an ad for Belle Fair, and it seemed right for us. The house we bought has everything we need on one floor, with two bedrooms and bath on the second floor, perfect for our visiting children. And the people were so friendly that I think we're going to enjoy living in this community."
As for the Zimmermans, Mrs. Zimmerman said that she heard about Belle Fair from a friend. "I'm a local girl, and I always wanted to move back to Rye Brook," she said. "But there was nothing to be had. My dad lives at the Arbors down the road, and I still have a lot of friends here. We immediately liked what we saw at Belle Fair and went to look at some other Spectrum developments to see the finished houses. We also heard great things about the developer, which made us feel O.K about buying from plans. We bought the smallest house, a three-bedroom, with a two-car garage."
Mrs. Zimmerman said two other young couples, friend of theirs, have also bought houses at Belle Fair. "Our next-door neighbors will be people we already know," she said. "The day-care center, the shuttle to Metro-North and the pool are added attractions for all of us. So is the school system. I started in the first grade at the Ridge Street School and went right through. Our move-in date is June 3, and we can't wait."
Mr. Hochberg said that when the development is completed it will generate approximately $3.4 million annually in taxes for the village of Rye Brook and the Rye Brook School district, which would be more than the expense generated by the additional students coming from Belle Fair.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
They're Tacky All Right, Deliriously So

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY 

 BODY:
DON'T be fooled by the family's tacky living quarters outside Dallas: a cramped, broken-down trailer home whose chief amenities are a fridge used mostly for beer, a large television set that seldom shuts up and plastic cutlery accumulated over years of eating takeout. The slobbish Ansel Smith, his tarty second wife, Sharla, his pot-smoking son, Chris, and his 20-year-old still-virginal daughter, Dottie, haven't abandoned -- nor have they been abandoned by -- the miraculous American economic juggernaut. They are part of the system and each, in his or her own way, contributes to the national weal and woe.
As much as Jeeter Lester and his "Tobacco Road" clan were symptomatic of the Great Depression of the 1930's, the Smith family reflects the values of the boom years of the 1980's and 1990's. It's just that the Smiths haven't participated to quite the degree that made billionaires of those who wheeled and dealed in savings-and-loan institutions, real estate development and computer technology. The Smiths are on the bottom rung of the ladder, but at least they're on it, or so they believe, possibly because television tells them so. 
 That is one of the unstated factors giving zest to "Killer Joe," Tracy Letts's violent, satiric and often dangerously funny family comedy, now at the SoHo Playhouse Off Broadway. The new production, a commercial venture starring Scott Glenn and Amanda Plummer, is being presented in association with the 29th Street Rep, which produced an earlier, equally effective production of the play in New York four years ago.
Ansel Smith (Marc A. Nelson) is an auto mechanic, Sharla (Ms. Plummer) waitresses at a Pizza Hut, Chris (Mike Shannon) sells dope whenever he pulls himself together, and Dottie (Sarah Paulson) once had a job with a chiropodist. Ansel's extended family would also include his alcoholic ex-wife, Adele, and her boyfriend, Rex. Adele and Rex are never seen but they become as vivid to the audience as any of the characters who are.
Presiding over the play, until the Smith family revels get lethally out of hand, is Killer Joe Cooper (Mr. Glenn), a cool, nattily dressed Dallas police detective who runs a little business on the side. Other cops might be in laundromats or vending machines; Joe is in contract murder.
It's Chris who first proposes the plan that propels the play, mostly because his mother stole the cocaine he was going to sell to pay off his $6,000 debt to some local hoods. Having learned that Adele has a $50,000 life insurance policy, of which Dottie is the sole beneficiary, Chris suggests to his father that they hire Killer Joe to carry out a contract on her. Ansel mulls over the idea for a minute or two before deciding that it might be just the ticket to provide the family with some much needed cash. Sharla thinks it's a swell idea, and even the quiet, almost beatific Dottie agrees. She remembers how, when she was 2, her mom once tried to suffocate her with a pillow.
Problems arise when, during the contract negotiations, Joe demands his $25,000 payment in advance. Since they scarcely have enough cash to pay for their Kentucky fried chicken, they are stymied until Joe proposes a compromise. He's been much taken by the childlike Dottie. He says that, instead of cash, he will accept Dottie as a retainer. This pleases everyone, including Dottie who, in her turn, has been much taken by the smooth-talking, well-scrubbed detective who hardly ever uses four-letter words.
"Killer Joe" begins like a white-trash cartoon in which middle-class behavior is turned inside out. The sodden Chris objects to his stepmother's opening the door to him when she is wearing nothing below the waist. Sharla points out that it is the middle of the night and she didn't know who was knocking. Dottie's virginity is a source of worry. The potbellied Ansel plods around in gray-tinged briefs in need of a new elastic. Whenever he tries to act like a father, his attention inevitably slides over to the more compelling images on the television set.
Though "Killer Joe" behaves like a cartoon, its firm dramatic structure builds to a furious climax that has the punch of reality. It is both dismaying in its physical and psychological brutality and horrendously comic. As written by Mr. Letts and as beautifully acted by Mr. Glenn and Ms. Paulson, the courtship of Joe and Dottie even succeeds in being moving. They are the only characters in the play who don't traffic in double-crosses.
The director is Wilson Milam, who staged the play's 1993 premiere in Chicago, the first New York production, and successful runs in London, initially at the Gate Theater and then at the Vaudeville in the West End. By this time, it is clear that he has complete control of the exotic material as well as the actors to realize it.
Ms. Plummer's Sharla is a delight, at the beginning a brassily self-assured trailer park Circe, then a bewildered wreck, while Mr. Shannon's Chris is a perfect, self-pitying lout. Mr. Nelson gives the production's most consistently realized performance as Ansel, but then he has been doing the role off and on from Chicago through the London runs.
The Smiths may seem outrageous but, as someone in the play observes: "A normal person is just someone you don't know very well." "Killer Joe" is an immensely entertaining pop artifact, written, directed and performed with neon-lit flamboyance. Lift your Styrofoam cups to toast a hit.

Victory In Variety

BYLINE: By MICHELLE COTTLE; Michelle Cottle is a Washington writer.

 BODY:

Q. I am a junior at the State University of New York at Buffalo. So far, I've completed internships in international business, public relations and city government. I am currently working as an intern with a political campaign, and I plan an internship in international relations or security before I graduate. How will prospective employers react to my involvement in such a wide range of apprenticeship programs? I don't want to look as though I'm "internship hopping" or can't commit myself to a single job.
 
A. Relax. Yes, a handful of preternaturally focused people know from Day One of kindergarten that they want to be doctors or lawyers or forest rangers -- and build their lives accordingly. Few employers will penalize you, however, for not being one of that rare (and somewhat disturbing) breed.
"Many people, even in their late 20's, don't know exactly where they want to work," said Mark Oldman, managing director of Vault Reports, a New York company that provides job seekers with detailed information on internships and employers. It would be unrealistic, he added, for companies to expect college students to know their exact career paths. 
 Besides, your internship choices hardly seem off the wall. On the contrary, all of them point in the general direction of public relations. And far from raising alarm bells, the accumulation of so much workplace experience in your college years is likely to please potential employers, whatever path you pursue.
"Most employers see internships, even in fields that are not directly relevant to the one you end up in, as a way of gaining the soft skills needed in an office," Mr. Oldman said. "There are things common to most businesses: gaining a professional demeanor, knowing how to fit within a hierarchical institution, not stepping on toes. These are things you learn only by being on the job."
Price Hicks, who directs the intern program for the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in Los Angeles, agreed. "I don't think employers want to spend their time acclimating a person to the realities of everyday work life," she said.
Even more broadly, internships are a signal to employers that you are equipped to deal with life after college. Mr. Oldman said intern coordinators believe that "internships in general are a real sign of maturity and initiative -- that someone hasn't spent his summers flipping burgers or twirling the lifeguard whistle."
If eyebrows are raised about the diversity of your experience, pitch your background as a plus. "In addition to showing that you can work in a variety of environments, it suggests you might have something interesting to contribute to your new office," Mr. Oldman said.
What's more, having explored several options, you are now better qualified to choose the field that's right for you -- and to avoid job-hopping in your post-college years. "One of the great things about internships," Mr. Oldman said, "is that they help you decide where you don't want to go."

HEADLINE: Step Aside Party Loyalty. Make Way for Incumbency.

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

 BODY:
AS Nov. 3 closes in, two statewide candidates in Connecticut are holding onto blowout-sized leads that pollsters and even the lucky campaigns had predicted for months would shrink in the fall frost. One is a Republican and one is a Democrat -- throwing into a cocked hat the many theories about Democratic disillusionment and, depending on the day, Republican rage or Republican backlash.
Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, and United States Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat, each held 40-point edges on their challengers in recent polls, underscoring the decline of party affiliation as a decisive factor in elections, replacing it with personality and incumbency. Their challengers -- United States Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, a Democrat running for Governor, and Gary A. Franks, a Republican and former Representative running for the Senate -- were left with lonely runs in a booming economy and a season of apparent voter contentment. 
 So the drama this year will be lower on the ballot, and those who follow the state's campaigns and watch its politics say the length -- or lack -- of Mr. Rowland's coattails could produce some real surprises on Election Day. Voters choose the Senate candidates first, so Democratic strategists are calling Senator Dodd their firewall between Mr. Rowland's expected romp and a Democratic wipeout if voters follow his party all the way down their ballots. "Maybe fireball," Senator Dodd recently joked.
Mrs. Kennelly's campaign manager, Jonathan W. Pelto, said the tendency of voters to ignore or discount parties makes a challenger's job much more difficult. "You really start out much more from zero, as opposed to the days of yore when you started with 30 or 40 percent," he said. "These polls indicted that the long-touted realignment of voters has not been from Republican to Democrat, but a realignment from party partisanship to ticket-splitters and unaffiliated voters."
Voter-registration figures bear that out. Although more people are registered as Democrats than as Republicans, the largest group is unaffiliated voters. The most recent available figures show the state has 722,004 unaffiliated voters, 643,859 Democrats, 455,728 Republicans and 4,120 voters who are registered as members of minor parties.
Both major parties have strategies for using this landscape to their advantage. Edward L. Marcus, the state Democratic chairman, said the registration figures give his candidates farther down the ballot a strong shot. "If you get Democrats to vote Democrat, you pretty well have it made," Mr. Marcus said. "That's why I say that despite the polls, even Kennelly has an opportunity."
Republicans, however, are working on television commercials, mailings and telephone calls to try to spread Mr. Rowland's luster to candidates for Congress, the state's House and Senate, and for the other statewide offices -- Attorney General, Secretary of the State, Treasurer and Comptroller. "There has been a real effort to convince voters that it is not just giving the Governor another four years, but an entire Republican team to work toward the same goals," said Michael H. Broder, communications director for the state party.
State Republicans have figures indicating that historically, under-ticket candidates have run 5 to 7 percentage points behind the Governor. "If the Governor's polls hold up, there could be a really huge sweep," Mr. Broder said.
Douglas Schwartz, the director of the Quinnipiac College Poll, said history and his own surveys suggest that the coattail effect is minimal, however. "You can't transfer popularity," Mr. Schwartz said. "Voters think of each position as almost a separate election." He went on to say that the slump in party allegiance is a major factor in declining voter turnout. "Parties used to get people excited," he said. "But that doesn't happen automatically anymore."
Democrats are trying to buck that trend, however, by emphasizing issues that are likely to encourage their most loyal voters to go to the polls. This year, the Democratic turnout effort is called the Campaign for Connecticut Families. (Notice the lack of the "D" word.) Matt Miller, the group's communications director, said the issues emphasized at rallies and when contacting voters include health care reform, improvements in education and protecting the environment.
A recent poll indicates those efforts are succeeding. Despite Mr. Rowland's impending landslide, the two Democratic incumbents in under-ticket offices looked secure. The poll by Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research showed the Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, with a 27 percentage point lead over his Republican challenger, Santa Mendoza. The State Comptroller, Nancy Wyman, led her Republican challenger, State Representative Christopher Scalzo, by 17 percentage points.
The Republican incumbent among the constitutional officers, Treasurer Paul Silvester, led his Democratic challenger, Denise Nappier, by 16 percentage points. The closest race was between two non-incumbents. The Democratic nominee for Secretary of the State, State Representative Susan Bysiewicz, led the Republican candidate, Ben Andrews, by 13 percentage points.
Donald Ferree Jr., the director of political polling at the University of Connecticut, throws another ingredient into the stew. He said that despite the conflicting theories about the effect of President Clinton's woes on the state election, the issue has been too pervasive to avoid having some impact on voter mood or turnout. "If 1992 was the year of the woman, 1998 was the year of that woman," Dr. Ferree said.
All of this uncertainty exists only because of a change that was made in Connecticut just a dozen years ago -- long after most other states. In 1986, voters decided to abolish the party lever, which allowed voters to pick the top of the ticket, then automatically vote for the whole party slate -- legislators, constitutional officers and all. This year, the polls indicate that voters might try to split that lever in half.

HEADLINE: Teachers Try to Renew Interest in French

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

DATELINE: PLEASANTVILLE

 BODY:
SO much for studying French to read Moliere and Voltaire, Balzac and Sartre or to be able to order Filets de Dorade sur Lit d'Epinards a la Sauce Moutarde in Paris with elan (sea bream with spinach and mustard sauce).
In an effort to stem the decline in the number of students willing to pursue French at the high school and university level, language teachers spent a recent Saturday at a conference at Pace University here to learn how to make French more enticing. 
 "Ten years ago, there were 24 sections of French and 15 sections of Spanish at Horace Greeley High School," said Dr. Geraldine O'Neill, an adjunct professor at Pace University who had taught for 29 years at the high school in Chappaqua. "Now the school has 24 sections of Spanish and 14 of French." Until the 1980's, French was the first choice of most students for a foreign language. But since then, at Horace Greeley and many other schools in Westchester and and around the United States, the positions of French and Spanish have switched.
"There's a perception that Spanish is more practical," said Dr. Adelia Williams, chairwoman of the department of modern languages and cultures at Pace University. "And there is the reality that French has declined in the past 20 years. The idea behind this conference is to bring together a cross-section of teachers and educators in French to see how they can promote French outside the traditional curriculum and to give them hope. There are a lot of things going on now. We're at a turning point, and this meeting is part of the effort to combat the decline."
Such a reversal -- with the ascendancy of Spanish often coming at the expense of French -- has been attributed in part to the increase in the number of Hispanic immigrants to the United States, greater exposure of news organizations to Hispanic culture and a perception that Spanish is a more practical language.
"In the last 10 to 15 years, Spanish has developed a persona," Dr. O'Neill said. "The Hispanic population is more evident. They are more visible in politics and the media, and for any culture that type of publicity makes people aware. The fact that Spanish was becoming more obvious in the culture drew students."
The conference, which was attended by about 150 language teachers from the New York City area, was co-sponsored by Pace University's department of modern languages and cultures, the American Association of Teachers of French and the Cultural Services of the French Embassy in Manhattan.
Experts suggested using strategies and tools like the Internet and technology to attract students; exposing students to the Francophone world -- for example, the diverse French-speaking cultures of Canada, Africa, Asia and the Caribbean -- instead of focusing curriculum solely on France; showing students how French is important in the global economy, and introducing students to French and Francophone movies, music and other activities.
"It's a growing crisis," said Dr. Gladys Lipton, president of the American Association of Teachers of French. "There has been a 25 percent decline in French studies at the university level in the last five years. We have to market French in different ways. We need to stress the importance and practicality of learning French, with a special emphasis on beginning early."
Guilhene Maratier-Declety, director of the international division and deputy education director for the Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie de Paris, said:
"Students need to see the importance of French as an economic language. It's a bridge between the world of business and the world of academics. International companies recruit people who speak another language. And French is the language for 250 million people in the Francophone world. English is not the only language of business."
Some teachers have already applied innovative methods to appeal to students. David Graham, foreign language chairman for the Plainview-Old Bethpage Central School District on Long Island, has been using Quebecois music and culture to teach French to his students.
"I use the music to teach just about everything: culture, language, grammar," Mr. Graham said. "Quebec music is really American music in French. The idea is to use anything that appeals to the kids on the kids' level, like music and movies. In the last few years, I've used sports. We've brought in three to four French-speaking hockey players to a French night. And we keep reminding the students and their parents that Canada is the United States' best trading partner. New York State alone does $8 billion in trade with the province of Quebec."
Experts at the conference observed that, while English may be the first global language, French remains the second. And with the increasing importance of the European Union, its importance for the business community remains significant.
"Students need to see how French is used in the business world," said Linda M. Jouas, a French and Latin teacher at the Bronxville middle school and high school. "It's also important for French teachers to talk to one another."
Dr. O'Neill said: "We need to make students aware that France is not just about perfume and wine, or Louis the XIV, that France is in fact a very modern, progressive and technologically advanced country. The idea behind studying French is that going to France is not the only thing you can do, that there are many exciting things happening elsewhere in the world of France and the Francophone world."

HEADLINE: An East End Transfer Tax? Realtors Say No Way.

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
THE dead-heat contest between Alfonse M. D'Amato and Charles E. Schumer may be the highlight of the campaign season across the rest of New York State. But in Suffolk County, farm and environmental referendum issues are generating enough heat to compete with the Senate race as the hottest topic down at the coffee shop.
A proposition asking Suffolk voters whether the county should sell $62 million in bonds to preserve farms, buy open space and add playing fields to parks is the first item on the county ballot on Nov. 3. 
 In each of Suffolk's five East End towns, it will be followed by town propositions asking whether a 2 percent transfer tax should be imposed on the sale of expensive homes or when farmland is sold to developers. The proceeds, estimated at $100 million over 10 years, would go into town land banks for farm and open space protection.
And in the Town of Huntington, voters will decide on a $15 million bond that would include $10 million to buy open land and $5 million for park improvements.
Based on past performance, none of these propositions would appear to have much trouble winning approval. Suffolk voters have embraced every spending plan for farms, open space, groundwater and pine barrens placed before them by county and state government over nearly three decades.
In 1987 and again in 1988, about three-quarters of Suffolk voters approved a 0.25 percent rise in the county sales tax to buy pine barrens and protect groundwater. Two years ago, Gov. George E. Pataki's $1.75 billion environmental bond act passed in a walk in Suffolk -- and, for that matter, in Nassau County. Even Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's ill-fated $1.9 billion environmental bond act, rejected statewide in a less economically positive period in 1990, carried easily in both counties.
But the New York State Association of Realtors is trying to buck the recent trend and has spent about $100,000 on television and radio advertising to defeat one of the initiatives -- the East End transfer tax. The Long Island Board of Realtors also opposes the tax and by midweek had contributed $12,500 to defeat it.
The ads assert that $277 million is already available for preservation programs and question whether it is necessary to raise $100 million more.
Charles M. Staro, the association's executive vice president, said transfer taxes were "extremely unfair" because they placed "the entire financial burden on individuals choosing to buy and sell homes for a program that will benefit everyone on the East End, including tourists."
He said the association had opposed transfer taxes wherever they had been proposed. "It just so happens that this time it is occurring on the East End of Long Island," he said.
Elected officials, environmental and civic groups in Suffolk nearly unanimously agree that new infusions of money will be needed to protect Long Island's only remaining rural and agricultural area from development pressure, and many of them have reacted with vitriol to the real estate industry campaign.
"They are just a pack of lying Realtors with no community base and no options, trying to buy the East End referendums," said Richard L. Amper Jr., the executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society.
Backers of the transfer tax said the assertion that $277 million is already available for preservation programs was false.
"That is just a pernicious lie," said Kevin McDonald, vice president of the Group for the South Fork. "They are running an ambush campaign and they know it."
Mr. McDonald said the groups had calculated that $277 million in Federal, state, county and town funds would be needed, but was not yet secured.
The groups said that with the addition of $100 million from the transfer tax, which they said would be essential to attract matching funds from other programs, the hoped-for total of $377 million could be used to protect 24,000 acres of farmland and 9,000 acres of open space on the East End.
They said this would be the minimum acreage to assure that the rural character of the East End was not obliterated.
Donald F. Savage, the director of governmental affairs for the Realtors association, denied that the ads were deceitful. "Distilling complicated information into a 30-second ad is impossible," Mr. Savage said. "The point is, funds are available that haven't been used or haven't been applied for."
Mr. McDonald and others said that last year, real estate interests in Massachusetts used tactics similar to those being used by the New York association to defeat a transfer tax proposed on Cape Cod.
Transfer taxes have been approved by voters in Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and Block Island. Proponents of the tax say revenues have aided in preservation and helped maintain real estate values.
The East End version would impose the 2 percent tax on that portion of a house purchase price above $250,000 in Southampton, East Hampton and Shelter Island and above $150,000 in Riverhead and Southold.
It would also apply to the portion of vacant land purchase prices above $100,000 in the three towns, and above $75,000 in the other two. Sales of farmland between farmers would be exempt, a feature that helped win support for the tax from the Long Island Farm Bureau.
The East End groups said they could not match the association's spending, which they predicted would be $250,000 by Election Day. By contrast, supporters of the transfer tax have raised between $50,000 and $60,000, according to Mr. Amper.
The anti-tax ads are paid for by New Options for Open Space Preservation, a political committee financed by the Realtors association. Mr. Savage said it plans to spend more between now and Election Day but would not confirm the $250,000 estimate or predict the final amount.
"I've been around a long time and there's never been this kind of money spent before," said Edwin M. Schwenk, a former Suffolk Republican leader and co-founder with Mr. Amper of a preservation group called East End Forever.
Mr. Schwenk, who lives in Southampton, said that the transfer tax, rather than unfairly targeting buyers and sellers of real estate, involved buyers attracted to the East End in joining in local preservation efforts.
"The East End is very unique in the fact that we have done our share to save our farmlands and open space," he said. "We have paid our dues and continue to pay our dues. The next step is for people coming in from the outside because they like it here to help out."
Mr. McDonald of the Group for the South Fork said approval of the transfer tax would be "the key that unlocks the door to county, state and possibly Federal funds."
"Without it we have nothing," Mr. McDonald said.
Many backers of the tax said they remained optimistic it would be approved in all or most of the towns. "Knowing the people out here, I think they are going to support this," said Joseph M. Gergela, the executive director of the Long Island Farm Bureau in Riverhead.
Others sounded more wary. "You can sell a lot of lies for a quarter of a million dollars," Mr. Amper said.
Mr. Gergela said the town where the outcome was most in doubt was Riverhead, where the largest chunk of Suffolk's remaining farmland is located.
The transfer tax is supported by a number of real estate brokers on the East End, who split from the association and the Long Island Board of Realtors on the issue.
"This is a home-rule issue," said Jack Hangen, owner and broker of Agawam Realty in Southampton. "It's another means to preserve open space, which is one of the reasons people come to the East End, and it will keep property values up."
In contrast to the battle over the transfer tax, the $62 million county bonding proposal has moved serenely forward. Called the Suffolk County Community Greenways Fund, it was devised by County Executive Robert J. Gaffney and members of the County Legislature.
In includes $20 million for county purchase of farm development rights and $20 million for the purchase of wetlands, woodlands and open space.
To seek support in western Suffolk, where about 90 percent of county residents reside, it also includes $20 million to expand and add playing fields and other recreational facilities to county parks, primarily in parks in the five western towns. The remaining $2 million would establish an environmental education center.
Mr. Gaffney had been criticized by Mr. Amper and other preservationists for the slow pace of county action under existing protection programs. But in recent months Mr. Gaffney has sought to speed the pace, making farmland preservation a priority. "He has done a lot for the farm community," said Mr. Gergela of the farm bureau.
In announcing the bond plan in July, Mr. Gaffney said it would "insure that future generations will continue to enjoy the working farmland and open spaces that make our county so special and that our residents have access to the active recreational facilities they need." He said the cost would be $11 a year for an average taxpayer.
County officials and groups appeared confident the bond would be approved. Rejection, they said, would signal a profound shift in attitudes toward public spending for environmental programs.
In Huntington, officials said they had heard no opposition to the town's proposed $15 million environmental bond. "Huntington residents are keenly interested in environmental matters," Town Supervisor Frank P. Petrone said. "We haven't received one letter in opposition."
Mr. Petrone said approval would allow the town to apply for matching funds from county, state and Federal programs.
The Huntington proposal marks one of the first major land-preservation votes by a western Suffolk town.

Early Retirement: So Close, So Far

BYLINE: By JAMES SCHEMBARI; James Schembari is an editor at The Times. His column on the prime earning, spending and striving years will appear the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail may be sent to jimschem@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
A FEW years ago, when my sister-in-law Lee was turning 40, she made this announcement: "I plan to retire on Dec. 31, 1999. I will not work in the next century."
It was a bold remark. 
 But ever since, much as a bird builds its nest one twig at a time, Lee has been methodically laying the foundations for her future life -- retirement that would begin long before 50.
She left the large firm where she was one of many in-house lawyers, started her own law firm in Washington, wrote a legal reference book that promises a long stream of income and taught her sharp young hires how to run the firm and land new clients. She got into stocks and mutual funds early in the bull market and stayed with them. She has been relentless, and I'm confident that when the millennium comes, there will indeed be one less person practicing law in Washington.
My sister-in-law, of course, is not alone. Plenty of people have subdued the economic monsters of living expenses, their children's college educations and retirement savings and realized that they don't have to wait until they are in their 60's to call it quits.
And they are all not chief executives or Wall Street whizzes. Many, like Lee, are smart people who had a plan and simply stuck with it.
ONE of the fantasies of middle age is having the chance to enjoy it. We have worked hard, and the thought that we will have to toil for 10 or 20 more years before claiming our reward can be depressing. I know that I would love to wrap up my career in about 10 years, when I'm 56, but I also know that I probably won't be able to afford to.
Katy Hollister, a partner with the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche in Cincinnati, says she hears talk of early retirement all the time, as more and more clients chase the dream. Recently, she had to give a lesson in economic reality to a group of workers at a factory in the Southwest after dozens of them, having seen the value of their 401(k) plans jump, began considering such a move.
The reality is this: You have to start planning early and saving early. And you have to understand that if you retire when you are, say, 50, you might need to finance a retirement that will last as many years as your working life.
Figuring out how to pay our children's college costs is scary enough, but as Ms. Hollister pointed out, "There are no scholarships for retirement."
That doesn't worry someone else who is planning an early retirement -- a 41-year-old consultant in Manhattan who is married with two children. He started making his retirement plans when he was 33 and wants to have about $5 million in assets by the time he's 50, when he plans to retire. And he says he will achieve his goal.
"It takes financial discipline," said the consultant, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "You have to approach saving like you would paying a mortgage."
He lives frugally, owning two older cars and a modest house, and pours much of his and his wife's salaries into a combination of stocks, bonds and real estate.
"It's all about financial independence," he said. "It just means that at 50, I want to have flexibility. I don't want to have to have a job to make ends meet."
Lee, who is married and has no children, also decided to forgo a grand house; instead, she invested the money she would have paid in higher mortgage payments into the stock market.
"I've been in Washington 16 years, and I still live in a condo," she said. "I haven't had huge housing expenses."
She also decided that she could earn a lot more by working for herself, in her own law practice.
"That took the cap off my income level," she said. "It also eliminated debt from my life."
I ASKED Ms. Hollister how much I would need to retire in 10 years and still put my four children through college. She ran my numbers through her computer. Her short answer: $2.1 million. Her somewhat longer answer: Forget it, you'll never make it.
But maybe some people can. Ms. Hollister offered a rough formula to find out. First, assume that your retirement will begin in 10 years and last for 30 years, that your investments will earn a 4 percent real, or inflation-adjusted, annual return and that inflation will be a steady 4 percent a year. To estimate how much you'll need in savings on the day you retire, multiply your current annual expenses by 26.6 -- a number she derived in complex calculations from the assumptions above, based on the present and future value of money.
If, for example, you have $100,000 a year in expenses, you will need to set aside $2.66 million to join my sister-in-law -- who, by the way, doesn't plan to just lie on the beach. To her, retiring early means having the freedom to make her next move without economic pressure.
 "I don't want to retire early so I can stop doing what I am doing," Lee said. "I want to retire early so I can start doing things I am not yet doing. I have the feeling that the ability to do new things will diminish if I wait."

HEADLINE: Taking the Economy's Pulse?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
We rely on many statistics to measure the performance of the American economy, but we need to recognize that many of them are of uncertain accuracy and significance. 
 What happens when this frailty isn't acknowledged? An example is seen in "Muscleman, or 98-Pound Weakling? Taking the Measure of an Eight-Year Economic Expansion" (Oct. 18), which apparently intended to say that the United States economy has not been as strong as we might have thought.
The article said that real income of the median household increased only 3.5 percent over 24 years -- from $35,745 in 1973 to $37,005 in 1997, in constant dollars. This measurement was obtained by adjusting the actual dollar figures by increases in the Consumer Price Index.
But many well-qualified people believe that the C.P.I. overestimates inflation; indeed, a commission of experts headed by Michael J. Boskin, the Stanford Univeristy economist, put the overstatement at 1.1 percentage points a year. If that is true, real median income has risen by 35 percent since 1973, or 10 times as much as you stated.
Moreover, we really do not know how much poverty there is in the United States, and especially whether the poverty rate is rising. A chart with the article showed that the percentage of households in poverty was higher in 1997 than in 1970. But again, these figures are sensitive to the inflation measure. Mr. Boskin has estimated that if his C.P.I. calculation is correct, the poverty rate in 1995 was 9 percent, not the official figure of 13.8 percent.
But there are other uncertainties in gauging the poverty rate. For example, should poverty be measured by income or by expenditures? In contrast to the picture you paint -- of a poverty rate hovering in the 12 to 14 percent range for the past two decades -- one could plausibly draw a picture of the rate sharply declining, possibly to as low as 2 or 3 percent.
The article also made this observation: "A huge problem left unresolved as the expansion appears to wind down is a divisive inequality that has developed among income groups, a trend that took root in the 1980's and that the 1990's expansion has failed to interrupt." But income distribution is a subject in which the difficulties of definition, measurement and interpretation are especially great.
To say anything significant about this subject, we need to consider how age, family status and educational attainment are distributed among various groups and how income is defined and measured. For example, we know that the earnings of people who have not finished high school are lagging behind those of people with a college education. But we also know that far more people are now college graduates. Should we view this combination of facts as evidence of greater or less inequality?
I do not claim to know the truth about what has happened to real incomes, poverty or income distribution. My point is that you don't know, either, and should have acknowledged as much.

'Chief' Finds New Arena: Politics

BYLINE: By EDWARD LEWINE 

 BODY:
Robert Comas put down his half-eaten roast beef sandwich and explained how being a team mascot prepared him for politics. It was lunchtime Tuesday in the back of Brennan & Carr, a restaurant at Nostrand Avenue and Avenue U.
"During my years as the Chief, I learned a lot about shaking hands," said Mr. Comas, 54, the Conservative Party candidate for the State Senate in the 21st District, which includes Sheepshead Bay, Mill Basin and other parts of southern Brooklyn. 
 From 1971 to 1995, Mr. Comas was the Chief, the unofficial mascot of the New York Rangers hockey team. Without seeking approval from the team, Mr. Comas would don a feathered headdress and wander around Madison Square Garden shaking hands, whooping and doing a war dance. He retired as the Chief in 1995, one year after the Rangers had won their first championship since 1940.
This spring he was at a meeting of the local Republican club when it was looking for a Senate candidate. "I've always been a political junkie," he said. "There were no other nominees, so I raised my hand and said, 'I'll run.' "
In the end Mr. Comas failed to collect enough signatures and the Republicans have no candidate in the contest. But Mr. Comas is running, on the Conservative line.
Mr. Comas is a portly man with a pleasant lisp. He said he is all but unemployed and lives with his mother in the house where he grew up on East 28th Street. He also acknowledged that he has no campaign to speak of and little chance of defeating the incumbent, Carl Kruger.
"I know I'm a sacrificial lamb," Mr. Comas said. "My opponent is big in the community."
Mr. Kruger, a two-term Democrat, agrees. "I've never seen him in 25 years of public life," the Senator said. "I've only seen him at Rangers games."
But that doesn't mean that Mr. Comas is lacking in political ideas. He calls himself a moderate Republican and favors lowering subway and bus fares and either reducing or ending state sales taxes. "I want the nomination again in two years," he said. "This isn't the last Kruger will see of me."
But whatever the future brings, Mr. Comas has insured his legacy as the Chief, a character that just popped into his head one night during a game in 1971.
"He was one of the people who rallied the fans," said Sam Rosen, who announces Rangers games on television. "It was hard not to notice him. He was running around with a headdress on." EDWARD LEWINE

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT;
That Market Bottom Might Be A Trap Door

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
AS almost anyone with a market memory can attest, the month of October is not usually friendly for stocks. Since 1915, the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen an average 0.17 percent in the 10th month of the year, according to Birinyi & Associates. Only Septembers have been worse.
This year, September was a washout. But with one week to go, October has proved to be the best month since January 1987. The performance has been enough to induce hibernation in many bears. 
 Then there is James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
 
Q. Many people seem to think the stock market has seen its lows. You don't agree?

A. If this were the bottom, it would be the most remarkable one in history, one where the Standard & Poor's 500 index is trading at 25 times earnings. That is a valuation rarely achieved at the top of a market.
 I think that this is a bear market rally. I would suppose that if the market gods were designing a bear market rally, they would make it look as irresistible as possible and would want as many participants as possible before opening the trap door.
 
Q. But there are hundreds of stocks, especially small caps, that are down 25 percent or more this year. Are they overpriced?
 
A. Really cheap stocks are beginning to appear. The great, overarching question is whether you are well advised to seize values in the secondary and tertiary parts of the market when the primary market is selling at these multiples.
In my view, the answer is no, because when the G.E.'s, the Charles Schwabs and the other chosen fall, they will crush the smaller ones beneath them.
 
Q. Do you see value anywhere?
 
A. I have two favorite things: small-cap Japanese stocks and gold. There are opportunities in Japan to buy profitable companies at little more than the net cash on their balance sheets. You get the business for free. Gold, now at an 18-year low, has disappointed more people than the old Brooklyn Dodgers. But I think it will be the beneficiary of continued chaos in the credit markets and a worldwide economic slowdown.
 
Q. Do you see anything of value closer to home? Or a company that is a massive, screaming short?
 
A. I see both, actually.
In Canada, there is an outfit called Legacy Hotels, which is a real estate investment trust with a bunch of lovely properties spun out by the real estate division of Canadian Pacific. You can buy this stock for about half of book value, with a yield in the low teens, an outfit with good management that is priced in Canadian dollars, which are very cheap relative to the U.S. dollar. The risk is that there is a severe recession and the business travelers stay home.
 
Q. What about the screaming short?
 
A. The short sale is Charles Schwab, a stock that is trading at 38 to 40 times earnings, 10 times book value. Schwab is priced as if there were no doubt about the continued health and prosperity of the bull market.
 
Q. Now that the Fed has cut interest rates twice in a matter of weeks, fears of a credit crunch and recession have diminished. Is that an appropriate reaction?
 
A. The credit crisis may sound melodramatic, but over the last several months there has been a very severe bear market in credit of all kinds. And it should be seen in the context of the preceding bull market in credit, where it was freely, if not almost promiscuously, available.
There is no recession we know of right now, and yet we have had a credit crisis in this country, which in the postwar period is a rare if not unique occurrence. It makes you wonder what will happen to this institution of borrowing and lending if there is an actual deflation, or an actual recession.
 
Q. But isn't it the Fed's job to take steps to prevent a credit crunch?
 
A. It has been the suppression of cycles that paradoxically has created a lot of the volatility we have seen in the credit markets. By succeeding in perpetuating the expansion, the Fed has failed in the sense that it has changed the behavior of people with money.
By saving Mexico a couple of years ago, the authorities changed the way people view sovereign credit risk. Hence the surprise when the Russian Government defaulted. A visitor from Mars would not have been surprised that a country without money could not pay its bills. But many were surprised, because they had come to expect that the integrity of the system will be defended.
By suppressing the volatility of the credit and business cycle, by trying to head off price inflations and deflations, the Fed has thrown a boomerang in the air, which is the risk tolerance of people who invest money.
The Fed ought to be in the business of central banking, not central planning. Alan Greenspan ought to say that people who risk money stand to lose a lot of it. That is in the nature of cycles and markets.

Even Amida High-Tech Revolution, Evolution Is the Norm

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE New Economy is on trial here along with the Microsoft Corporation.
Sure, the company is the one in the dock. But the outcome of the case against Microsoft will establish the ground rules for how the doctrine of antitrust will apply to high-technology fields like computer software. And the software industry is seen as being at the forefront of new patterns of behavior by workers, companies and markets that define the New Economy. 
 In the New Economy, people live on Internet time and product cycles are measured in months, not years. It is the slice of the economy driven by entrepreneurs, stock options and network effects. Silicon Valley is its headquarters, with subsidiaries in Seattle, Austin and elsewhere. It is the future, its proponents insist, coming to your home soon.
If Microsoft wins, the digital age will unfold as a free-fire zone of let-'er-rip capitalism, for better or worse. If Microsoft loses, courts or the antitrust watchdogs may be getting their oars into such complex matters as product design, for better or worse.
Let the courts decide. But for an analytic examination of struggle and competition at the edge of the New Economy today, a new book, "Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft" (The Free Press), offers some intriguing insights. The book, written by Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, and David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School, was placed in evidence at the Microsoft trial last week.
In its defense, Microsoft points to passages in the book in which executives of Netscape Communications are quoted speaking candidly about their missteps. Microsoft calls these statements proof that Netscape's travails in the Internet browser market were its own doing, not because Microsoft was acting like a nasty monopolist.
Yet the book as a whole reads as a coming-of-age account of the triumphs and setbacks of a fast-moving Internet pioneer daring or foolish enough to take on the dominant company in computing. Netscape's experience teaches as much about what hasn't changed as what has.
A fundamental lesson is that even revolutionary technologies take time to cause a revolution. No matter how great the tail wind of hype and venture capital, the Next Big Thing takes time to change the practices and habits of companies and people. "Netscape got too ambitious and too wedded to the belief that the Internet revolution would change everything tomorrow," Mr. Yoffie explained.
The threat Netscape posed to Microsoft was that its browser could serve as an alternative "platform" to Microsoft's Windows. In other words, the browser could take the place of Windows as the first thing users see when they start their computers and as the departure point from which applications could be started.
But it takes a long time for a new computing platform to catch hold, as thousands of software programmers gradually become converts and write applications that work with the new platform. By often and publicly declaring that it was going to challenge Microsoft head-on, Netscape aroused the software giant, which trailed in Internet software. "Netscape had the perfect Trojan horse," Mr. Yoffie said. "But it woke up the enemy before it was entrenched."
As it matured, Netscape also found that while the speed of product development was important, so was traditional product quality. Netscape's freewheeling "hacker culture" fostered flexibility and creativity -- one Netscape manager quoted in the book described its development style as "slightly out of control" -- but also led to buggy software, a nuisance that became problematic with more sales to quality-conscious corporations.
In the last year or so, the authors note, Netscape has made strides in quality, hiring testers and increasing its use of automated testing software. Netscape has increased its ratio of testers to developers from one-to-five to one-to-three, though it still trails Microsoft's one-to-one ratio. "You can be fast and flexible in software development, but you have to pay the price in testing," Mr. Cusumano said.
Netscape's future is by no means assured. But for all the talk at the trial about Microsoft trying to crush it, Netscape has done a good job of changing its strategy to avoid tackling Microsoft head-on whenever possible.
What Netscape, the Internet pioneer, has learned -- setting aside the legal issues -- is precisely what the pioneers of the personal-computer revolution learned. They declared that their technology would change the world, but the process works in the other direction, too. For a breakthrough technology to move into the mainstream, it must become more mainstream -- easier, more reliable and more useful for the workaday chores of the economy. It does not change everything overnight.

Pier Developers Look Toward Harlem

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL 

 BODY:
ON a recent Friday afternoon, a beam of sun cast a glow on Rover Green's face, as his fishing line tightened under an unseen weight in the Hudson River. Mr. Green has been fishing on the esplanade at the western edge of 125th Street for the past 20 years, arriving most days about 3 P.M., after he gets off work as a building manager, and heading home to 127th Street a few hours later.
Mr. Green, 55, is one of the few diehard Harlem residents who still visit the Harlem waterfront esplanade. Once a hub of maritime activity, the area has been in disrepair for at least two decades. Today, the boardwalk is broken in many places, the road is littered with broken bottles and rats roam at night. 
 Still, the area from 125th to 133d Streets -- known as the Harlem Piers, even though the piers are long gone -- is the last stretch of Manhattan shoreline between 72d Street and Fort Tryon Park that offers direct access to the Hudson River, said Maritta Dunn, chairwoman of Community Board 9. As such, she said, it has great value.
"Right now it is lying dormant," said Ms. Dunn, who took the Day Liner ferry from the Harlem Piers to Bear Mountain when she was a child. "But the community would be foolish to allow it to continue to lie dormant."
For many years the city, developers and residents have debated what should be done with the area, but no idea has yet achieved enough support to move beyond the planning stage.
But last November, Board 9 asked the Economic Development Corporation to seek proposals for the site, and on June 15, the agency did so.
Charles Millard, president of the Economic Development Corporation, said the waterfront area was attractive to developers because it is near the 125th Street business corridor, and added, "The Mayor wants to do everything he can to keep the development ball rolling in Harlem."
Moreover, he said, "There is significant untapped spending power in Harlem, and significant tourism."
By the Oct. 16 deadline, the agency had received several proposals, although Bernadette O'Leary, a spokeswoman, said she could not discuss their exact number or nature because of confidentiality agreements. A few of the developers, however, shared their ideas.
Destination Harlem Development, a Harlem-based group, offered an $83 million plan to build a 24-story, 450-room hotel, called the New Teresa, on 125th Street overlooking the water. The group is made up of two private developers, Full Spectrum Hotel Partners and Resource Planning and Development.
Inside the hotel, there would be a museum of Harlem history, a dinner theater run by Sylvia's Restaurant, a seafood restaurant, a retail pavilion, conference centers for up to 500 people and an entertainment center. Outside, the developers plan to rebuild the esplanade and to construct a concert band shell and a Hudson River environmental center, which would be open to the public.
Carlton Brown, vice president of marketing for Full Spectrum Hotel Partners, said the New Teresa would be the only hotel in Harlem. The average daily rate for rooms would be $160, which Mr. Brown said is significantly less than the typical midtown rate.
"We think it's a great location because it has access to a highway, sits on the 125th Street corridor and is easily accessible to a large university area," Mr. Brown said. Columbia University, Barnard College and St. Luke's Hospital are some of the educational and other institutions in Harlem, he said.
Another idea, offered by Pier 63 Maritime Inc., which owns a pier at 23d Street, is to dock three large barges off 125th Street to serve as floating piers. They would be arranged to create an L-shaped marina off the esplanade, where people could dock boats, take sailing lessons, fish or enjoy the view. The rooms inside the barges would be community spaces, available for public meetings and private parties.
John R. Krevey, president of Pier 63 Maritime, owns a historic lighthouse boat, and he plans to dock that boat, or one like it, at the end of one of the barges as a tourist attraction.
David Avital, a private investor, and Vilkas, Peles Architects put forth another barge plan. Their proposal, called the Harlem River Center, would create an entertainment and sports complex on two parallel barges. One of the barges would be equipped with a golf driving range, a restaurant and a parking lot; the other would be a combined museum and sanctuary for the bald eagle.
The center would also include a volleyball court on the esplanade, a ramp for launching boats south of the piers and, during the summer, a floating stage. Mr. Avital said he would encourage New York Waterway, which runs the Ferry of New York, to use one barge as a terminal for the ferry, to transport people from the World Trade Center and New Jersey to and from Harlem.
The advantage of Pier 63's plan, called Harlem on the Hudson, is that it is relatively inexpensive, said Huntley Gill, a design consultant to the project. He said the whole endeavor would cost less than $1 million and would generate about $1.2 million in revenues each year.
"It's eminently feasible," Mr. Gill said. "It's not expensive, it's not complicated and it doesn't require a lot of capital to get started. So it could actually happen."
The Harlem River Center would cost more, $4 million, and employ about 70 people. Its advantages? "The elements we have are environmental and community oriented," Mr. Avital said.
The New Teresa Hotel proposal has been touted at community board meetings as a major revitalization plan. The developers say the project would bring in 573 jobs and generate $50 million in gross revenue annually.
The Economic Development Corporation will not complete its consideration of these and other proposals until next year. "Typically, it takes at least three months, but it can really depend on the specific site," Ms. O'Leary said.
In the meantime, a coalition of Harlem organizations, led by West Harlem Environmental Action and Community Board 9, is developing its own proposal. The group has received a grant from the Department of Energy to begin considering ideas to redesign the area from St. Clair Place to 133d Street, and east from the esplanade to Broadway. They are leaning toward creating a waterfront park, similar to that planned for the Hudson below 59th Street.
The coalition has asked the agency to postpone making a decision until the plan is complete.
"We don't feel this was the right way to go about doing a request for proposals," said Petty M. Shepard, executive director of West Harlem Environmental Action. "They should never have moved ahead on the process without coming to the community first."
Ms. O'Leary responded, "The community will be involved in the process. The request for proposals is an opportunity to see what possibilities the marketplace may offer for the site."
Those who fish on the pier, like Mr. Green, say they would like to be consulted, too.
"A fishing pier would be nice, benches, lighting at night, and maybe some pesticides to deal with the rats," said Juan Nunez, 35, who visits the piers three times a week. When asked if he would like to see commercial development at the shoreline, he said, "No way."

Russian Oil: So Much, Yet So Little

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
HIDDEN beneath the vast Russian land mass and the Arctic waters around it could lie more oil than enriches the Middle East, many experts believe. Yet despite decades of effort, the Russian oil industry has tapped only a small fraction of it.
For a brief time, that seemed about to change. The fall of the Soviet Union brought a flood of Western oil executives, offering to spend tens of billions of dollars and provide much-needed expertise. 
 Agreements were signed, wells were drilled, expertise and technology began to arrive and, most important, capital -- lots of it -- was on the verge of being spent.
But even before the latest Russian crisis, the winds began to shift. Political turmoil, combined with a growing concern that Russia would lose control of a vast natural resource, stalled the legislation and the changes demanded by Western companies before they would loosen the purse strings.
So, again, the world's oil executives must wait out a crisis. They could give up, of course, but most are convinced that they cannot afford to -- the potential is too great.
Still, it could be a long wait, because there is a growing suspicion in the industry that nothing can be accomplished in Russia until a new generation comes to power.
"The country is very reluctant to allow others to exploit their natural resources," said John J. O'Connor, a senior vice president at Texaco Inc.
Some analysts worry that unless investment begins to flow soon, Russian oil exports could slip. That could make it even harder for Russia to come out of its economic crisis and provide the money that Russian oil companies need to keep up production.
"Everybody is in a wait-and-see mode and will not give the cash," said John D. Hervey, an oil analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "If the major oil companies don't invest, then Russia won't be able to maintain its infrastructure even at its currently poor level."
Through it all, Russia has managed to keep some dollars flowing. "Even when their domestic consumption went down, they have been able to maintain their exports in the last few years," said John H. Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a research group based in New York.
Last year, Russian exports averaged 2.51 million barrels a day, and for the first half of this year they were up slightly. But because of lower prices for crude oil on the world market, revenue plunged to about $5.6 billion in the first half of the year from $7.3 billion in the comparable period last year.
Russian oil companies, meanwhile, are facing new obstacles as their country stumbles. Russian Customs officials have begun demanding prepayment of various charges, according to Georgi Bedineishvili, an analyst at Salomon Brothers.
At a time when Russian oil companies need capital desperately, it is drying up. Until recently, Western oil companies, often stymied in getting their own projects off the ground in Russia, invested in native companies as the only way to get into the game.
Atlantic Richfield bought an 8 percent stake in Lukoil, Russia's largest private oil concern, a couple of years ago for $344 million, and formed a joint venture that was planning to invest about $5 billion in Russia and neighboring countries. And British Petroleum bought a 10 percent stake in Sidanko in the spring for about $500 million.
The eagerness to invest, however, evaporated by June. The attempt to sell a 75 percent stake in Rosneft, the last big energy company on the Government's privatization list, did not attract any buyers, even when the price fell from $1.6 billion to $470 million.
Another blow was a decision earlier this month by Elf Aquitaine, the French oil company, to abandon an effort to buy a stake in Sibneft for about $570 million because of worries about lower oil prices.
In addition, the Government has been going after the oil companies for huge amounts of taxes that they owe, adding to the pressure to obtain capital.
Russian banks, which came into big stakes in most of the oil companies when the companies defaulted on loans, are largely unable to help.
Mr. Bedineishvili said the fate of the industry now rests largely on how the new Prime Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, and the Parliament respond to the country's overall financial crisis. "You cannot isolate the oil companies from what will happen in the country in general," he said.
For now, most Russian oil companies are trying to muddle through.
Rosneft -- in partnership with Exxon and Sodeco, a Japanese oil company -- has spent close to $400 million exploring an oilfield off Sakhalin Island in eastern Siberia, an area believed to contain about 2.9 billion barrels of oil. But the Russian company had trouble paying its share of the exploration costs.
Sergey Bogdanchikov, Rosneft's new president, said in a recent interview in the Russian newspaper Kommersant Daily that his company, unable to collect much of what customers owe it, , was in a critical situation. The sale of Rosneft was not feasible now, he said, adding, "To my mind, we shall need one and a half to two years to bring the company into the shape where it will be worth $2 billion to $3 billion."
Others have decided to divest. Yukos, Russia's second-largest private oil producer, is trying to rid itself of 53 oilfields and about 3,000 workers by transferring them to new companies partly owned by local governments.
Some Western executives are hopeful that the Kremlin can eventually work its way out of the crisis.
"The new Government offers pragmatic partnership potential," said Mr. O'Connor of Texaco, which is seeking to develop the Timon Pechora Basin in northern Siberia. It has also teamed up with Mobil Oil to develop some of the reserves in the Kirinsky field off Sakhalin Island.
"When we make multibillion-dollar decisions, you have to have the confidence that the system is predictable and stable," he said. "All these things are absent."

Russia is the world's second-largest exporter of oil, after Saudi Arabia. But low global energy prices have aggravated its economic crisis and hampered investment. Production has fallen sharply from its 1988 peak of 11.4 million barrels a day, and exports have stagnated at a time when world consumption is rising. Graphs show Russian oil production and Russian oil exports, from '92 through June '98. (Sources: Department of Energy; Cambridge Energy Resources)

For Japanese Tourists, It's First Stop Las Vegas

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
WHERE have all the Japanese tourists gone? To Las Vegas.
Because of Japan's continuing economic woes and the weakness of the yen, the numbers of Japanese visitors to California and Hawaii, where they have been a mainstay of the tourism industry, are falling sharply. And so is the amount they spend, amplifying a trend that began in earnest four years ago. Even Orlando, Fla., has seen declines in guests from Japan at its theme-park attractions. 
 But not Las Vegas, Nev. The number of Japanese tourists staying there has doubled since 1994 and rose 29 percent just last year, to 403,000. That was a year when overall visits to Las Vegas rose just 2.8 percent. Japanese guests at the gambling oasis now outnumber those from any other country outside North America.
The trend breaks a decades-old pattern of Japanese tourism in the United States, and will likely accelerate now that two airlines, Northwest and Japan Airlines, have introduced regularly scheduled nonstop flights to Las Vegas from Tokyo's Narita airport. Los Angeles, meanwhile, is now getting 10 fewer nonstop flights from Tokyo a week.
The golden triangle for the Japanese used to be Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas, said Frank Murakami, general manager of the Los Angeles office of the Japan Travel Bureau, Japan's biggest tour operator. "Now," he said, "it's Las Vegas, Disneyland and Universal Studios," with short side trips to those attractions replacing extended touring or long stays in California.
It all couldn't have come at a better time for a city trying to reposition itself as an entertainment stop. Tourists still flock to Las Vegas -- 30.5 million visitors last year spent almost $69 billion. But officials worry about depending so heavily on gambling when forecasts say that by 2001 some 90 percent of Americans will live within 200 miles of legal casino-style gambling.
Moreover, occupancy in the city's 106,000 hotel and motel rooms dipped last year to its lowest since 1992, and a wave of new capacity is coming on the market: the 3,025-room Bellagio opened on Oct. 15, and five new hotels with an additional 16,000 rooms will be completed next year.
Japanese tourists are prized because, while representing only 11 percent of all visitors to the United States in 1996, the latest year for which figures are available, they are the largest group from overseas and spent $19.3 billion, 21 percent of the total. That compares with $9 billion by British visitors, the No. 2 overseas group, and $6.3 billion by Germans, No. 3.
And Japanese visitors achieved their spending levels in average stays of only eight nights, compared with 16 and 17.3 for British and German tourists, respectively. Japanese visitors to Las Vegas stay 3.3 days an average, and the Commerce Department says they spend an average $192 a day in the United States.
These days, though, Japanese tourists are not quite as free-spending as before. They tend to stay in less-expensive hotels, shop in outlet malls and gamble less.
"Baccarat is down about 20 percent in Las Vegas this year," said Jim Murren, chief financial officer of the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, referring to the card game perhaps most closely associated with Asian gamblers.
If casino action is not the main attraction, why is Las Vegas luring so many more Japanese tourists -- as many as 15 percent more this year, according to Carlos Tello, head of the Las Vegas office of the Japan Travel Bureau?
One draw, perhaps oddly for a place with such a wide-open reputation, is safety. Always more security-conscious than most tourists, Japanese visitors regard compact Las Vegas as far less risky than sprawling Honolulu, where rising crime against Japanese tourists evoked a letter of protest from the Japanese Consul General to the Mayor of Honolulu, or Los Angeles, where rioting after the Rodney King verdict in 1992 virtually halted Japanese tourism for months.
But the principal attraction of Las Vegas, according to Japanese and Las Vegas tourist officials, is cost. The city's average room rate, $73, is less than half that at comparable hotels in Hawaii, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Entertainment, food and golf in Las Vegas are all inexpensive by American standards, and dirt-cheap compared with those of Japan.
These disparities have not gone unnoticed by young single Japanese working women, who often travel in pairs or groups -- though often on smaller budgets these days.
Yuka Saito, 25, a cosmetics saleswoman from Chiba, Japan, and her hometown travel partner, Megumu Uchida, a 26-year-old architect, wasted little time recently visiting the Fashion Outlet of Las Vegas, where they stocked up on tennis shoes, clothing, sportswear and gifts.
Later in the evening, they said through a translator, they would be off to see the Radio City Rockettes at the Flamingo Hilton, and planned to ride the roller coaster at the New York-New York Hotel and pack in as many other activities as they could in their weeklong first visit to the United States. The women were staying in a midpriced hotel far from the luxury hotels on the Strip that Japanese tourists favored when times were good.
Bargain prices also help explain why several thousand Japanese couples a year marry or renew their vows in Las Vegas. "For less than half the cost of a traditional wedding in Japan," the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority says, "the entire wedding party can travel abroad for this important family ritual."
A few weeks ago, about 40 Japanese family members and friends attended a wedding in the city's Candlelight Wedding Chapel, which performs as many as 1,000 Japanese weddings and renewal of vows a year.
An average $500 ceremony includes flowers, photographs, a videotape, a two-tier wedding cake and an organist playing "Here Comes the Bride." "They don't want Japanese music, and I've never seen a bride in a kimono," said Brandon Reed, general manager of the chapel.
Some Japanese newlyweds, of course, come to honeymoon rather than tie the knot. Aota and Mayumi Mokoto married in Amori prefecture before flying to Las Vegas on their first visit to the United States.
"We were very much touched by what we saw," Mr. Mokoto said through the interpreter for Eagle Scenic Airlines, which had just flown the couple on a four-hour sightseeing tour to the Grand Canyon. Some 250,000 Japanese tourists fly from Las Vegas to the canyon each year on tours that range from a few hours to overnight and cost $200 to $400 a person.
Many Japanese visitors also ride charter buses from Las Vegas to see the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon and Monument Valley in the nearby deserts of Arizona and Utah. "A third of our business is Japanese, and this year business is even better than last year," said Michelle Michalewicz, general manager of Western Leisure, a tour company based in Salt Lake City.
Los Angeles, meanwhile, is biding its time. "In the long term, L.A. will play an even bigger role role in Japanese vacation plans," said Bob Moore, an executive with the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau, "because here we have a mix of theme parks, sports, food, culture and so much else that Japanese tourists like."
For his part, Mr. Tello of the Japan Travel Bureau in Las Vegas says he has no doubt that Japanese tourists will return to Los Angeles in big numbers: "That's because we'll soon be selling package tours to Los Angeles from here."

HEADLINE: Too Many Cooks? Not Nearly Enough

BYLINE: By AMANDA HESSER 

 BODY:
ON a recent Sunday night at Le Cirque 2000, dinners were flying out of the kitchen like baseballs from a batting machine. In a matter of four hours, over 300 diners would be decadently fed, plied with wine, and sent home filled with black truffles and chocolate.
Mike Camelo, a 26-year-old cook whose arms are striped with burn scars, was working the meat station. When an order of beef tenderloin was ready to go, the saute cook handed it to him on top of a cloth napkin. Mr. Camelo sprinkled it with chopped parsley and coarse salt and placed it on a heated plate, atop a mound of glistening vegetables. He ladled on the sauce, made earlier in the day by the saucier, and then walked the finished dish over to Sottha Khunn, the executive chef, who looked it over, covered it with a silver dome and, with a flick of his wrist, signaled for the plate to be delivered to an expectant diner. 
 Mr. Camelo did this all night long. He plated food and poured sauce. Food. Sauce. Food. Sauce. And not just this particular evening. This is his routine six nights a week. His pay is $12.55 an hour. And his is a highly sought-after job in the cooking world -- a field gaining a reputation as one filled with opportunity, fame and fortune.
Opportunity certainly abounds. With the strong economy and the steady increase in two-worker households, more people are eating out. And as more restaurants open, the demand for restaurant workers just keeps growing. According to projections by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, food preparation and service will be the fastest-growing occupations through 2006. Among chefs, cooks and kitchen workers alone, the Government expects an average of 1.27 million jobs to be created each year.
But for all the job openings, there can be only one executive chef in every restaurant. And there are even fewer star chefs, the ones who clone their prestigious restaurants and turn themselves into hot "brands." Even in New York, where there are more restaurants than in any other city in the United States, only five have won four-star ratings from The New York Times.
In a simpler time, succeeding as a chef was primarily about talent and the ability to endure the long hours and physical demands. Today, though, rising to the top of the profession -- becoming the next Sottha Khunn or Jean Georges Vongerichten, of Manhattan's Jean Georges, JoJo and Vong -- involves much more. It takes careful planning and networking, years of sharp-elbowed ladder-climbing in the kitchen and, usually, a large financial investment on which the return will probably be slow.
First, of course, you must learn to cook. This year, there were 740 cooking school programs in the United States, compared with 360 in 1989. That count includes vacation classes for cooking enthusiasts, vocational school and community college programs, and academies like the French Culinary Institute in Manhattan. The largest schools that offer cooking programs -- like the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y.; the New England Culinary Institute in Montpelier, Vt., and Johnson & Wales University in Providence, R.I. -- are full-blown colleges with two- and four-year programs.
The benefits of top-drawer training are clear. "If you're lucky enough to go to a school like the C.I.A. or the F.C.I., that almost assures you some kind of higher entry-level position," said Michael Batterberry, the founder of Food Arts magazine, a trade publication.
BUT that assurance doesn't come cheap. Tuition and meals for the two-year degree program at the Culinary Institute of America, for instance, run $15,400 a year; students who stay on for a four-year bachelor of professional studies degree pay $10,800 for each of the last two years. After four years, graduates can leave with loans totaling more than $52,000, according to Andrea Harding, director of public relations at the school.
Yet while the graduates of top cooking schools have far more hands-on experience in their field than a Harvard M.B.A. does in, say, closing an investment banking deal, the payoff on a degree hardly compares.
Gina Santiago, a recent graduate of the New England Culinary Institute, has about $20,000 in loans to repay but makes just $12.55 an hour as a garde-manger (or cold-appetizer station) cook at Le Cirque 2000.
"For the experience I'm getting in a restaurant of this caliber, it's fine," said Ms. Santiago, 22, who returned to her native Puerto Rico after graduation but came to New York for the chance to work at the restaurant. "You're here so many hours, it all equals out. We get our meals here."
Le Cirque 2000 is hardly the most tight-fisted kitchen in fine dining. It is unionized, and its pay scales are higher than those in most independent restaurants. Prep cooks, who cut vegetables, strain stocks and perform minor cooking tasks, make $11.57 an hour; line cooks, who prepare dishes for table service, make at least $12.55.
One of those line cooks, Bridget Eagan, who works the pasta station, takes home $496 a week for six long days of work. Ms. Eagan, who is 21, considers that an acceptable salary for her first job out of school. But her roommate -- who is several years older and much more experienced -- earns less, as a line cook at Cafe Boulud, an expensive new bistro owned by one of New York's star chefs, Daniel Boulud. (Asked about the salaries at Cafe Boulud, Alex Lee, the sous chef, said, "I try to tell people who come here that they're investing in their future.")
These days, the first few years out of cooking school can be seen as a form of graduate school. In New York, the way you earn your advanced degree determines your future. Those aspiring to be four-star chefs try to get jobs in four-star restaurants like Le Cirque 2000. They put in at a least a year, but almost never more than two, covering as many stations in the kitchen as possible before moving on to study with other master chefs.
Mr. Camelo, a graduate of Johnson & Wales, has worked every station at Le Cirque 2000 during the last year and a half, from the garde-manger to the pasta and risotto station to the grill. He is now what is called a tournant, which means he floats around the kitchen, from noon to midnight, working wherever he is needed.
Cooks are competitive about stations, which in a kitchen this large -- there are over 40 cooks -- are clearly defined. Garde-manger is low on the ladder; a bit higher are the cooking stations for hot appetizers and pasta and risotto. Highly coveted are the positions at the fish, meat and grill lines, where the main courses are prepared.
The cooks keep track of who is coming, who is going and where they can make their next moves. Even Pedro Cabrera, 42, a prep cook who has not gone to cooking school and does not speak English, is positioning himself for promotion. He comes in early every day to study with the fish butcher, so that he can take over that position should the current butcher leave.
What is most important for these cooks, though, is to maintain a good rapport with Mr. Khunn. That way, when their time in his kitchen is up, he will help them get jobs at other top restaurants. A cook needs to move around, Mr. Khunn explained in his thick Cambodian accent: "Like a designer, he needs to see the Calvin Klein, the Prada, before he decides what style he wants."
New York's restaurant world, as enormous as it may seem, is actually quite cozy, chefs say. "Chefs get together, and they talk to each other," said Dorothy Cann Hamilton, founder of the French Culinary Institute. "They know when a cook is on the line and he's ready for the next step." Cooks who stay in the city come into contact with one another again and again. Networking is vital, and missteps can be costly. If, for instance, a cook leaves a job before completing the time the chef expected him to stay, word spreads quickly and he could lose his ticket into other kitchens.
IN large cities across the United States, cooks spend a few years traveling circuits similar to those in New York, trying to move up the ladder as they hop from restaurant to restaurant. After five to seven years at top restaurants, a cook can easily be poised to open her own small restaurant, if she can find backers, or to be hired as a sous chef -- the second in command -- at one of the top spots, if she can sublimate her ego to the proprietor's.
Some cooks, though, trade academic training, or the early years of domestic networking, for tours abroad. "I don't think there's any experience that replaces going to Europe," Ms. Cann Hamilton said. "It shows curiosity and stamina."
For instance, Traci Des Jardins, the chef and owner of Jardiniere, a San Francisco restaurant known for its blend of French and California cuisine, bypassed cooking school to apprentice with Joachim Splichal of Seventh Street Bistro in Los Angeles. Then she worked at several of Europe's gastronomic temples, including Lucas Carton and Arpege in Paris and Louis XV in Monte Carlo. After just eight months at these Michelin three-star restaurants, she returned to the United States and was snapped up by the Manhattan restaurateur Drew Nieporent, who hired her as the sous chef at Montrachet, his three-star restaurant in Tribeca.
As a cook gets closer to setting out on his own, he must know how to market himself. "As with any art, there's the element of luck -- meeting the right patrons who think your cooking is terrific, and terrific enough to back it," Mr. Batterberry said. "But that's a little like discovering Lana Turner at the soda fountain."
IT helps to work in a place where you have visibility. Thomas Keller, the chef at the celebrated French Laundry in California's Napa Valley, for instance, established a following in Manhattan with his inventive cuisine at Rakel. Mr. Vongerichten became known when he was the chef at Lafayette, the restaurant in the Drake Swissotel, where he helped revive the reputation of hotel restaurant dining. When these men made the move to chef and owner, both investors and faithful diners followed.
Advancement to the level of executive chef is faster these days. The emergence of the celebrity chef -- people like Wolfgang Puck and Emeril Lagasse, with multiple restaurants, television shows and book contracts -- has driven up the pace of ambition.
So have the career changers increasingly entering the field, drawn by the prospect of fame and familiar enough with success that they are disinclined to pay their dues. "People are leaving Wall Street; they're leaving law professions," Ms. Cann Hamilton said. "They're not going to want to wait to get a decent salary."
Many chefs lament this new attitude. "The kids, they go to school and they are made to think they become chefs," Mr. Khunn said. "But that is not the reality."
Though pay scales have improved over the years, they remain much like those for other artistic professions. "For every rock singer who makes a zillion dollars, there's a group that's barely able to eke it out," Mr. Batterberry said. It is the same, he added, for chefs. According to a study by the National Restaurant Association, salaries for people with the title of executive chef -- the kitchen C.E.O.'s -- averaged just $38,000 in 1995, and pay has not escalated much since then.
Other than salaries, probably the most eye-opening reality for aspiring chefs is learning what an executive chef does. Much more time is spent managing staff, controlling costs and schmoozing with customers than on cooking, much less creating.
At Le Cirque 2000, Mr. Khunn -- who generally works 12 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week -- spends much of his day taking inventory and ordering food so that there is enough to feed nearly 1,200 customers a day at lunches, dinners and banquets. He hires cooks, arranges schedules and, during mealtimes, darts around the kitchen, keeping an eye on the line cooks' sauces, advising the garde-manger about the thickness of the sliced prosciutto, expediting orders and putting those silver dome lids over finished dishes. But almost never does he stir, slice or saute.
In top restaurants, much of the cooking and creating is left to the sous chef, sometimes called the chef de cuisine. "If you want the focus of what you're doing to be cooking, then get to be a sous chef in a good kitchen," Ms. Des Jardins said. "I really miss that, coming in and being at the stoves all day."
But even getting to that level means years of hard physical work, long hours and mind-numbing repetition. Cooking is an art, but working proficiently in a professional kitchen is a craft. Perhaps Ms. Cann Hamilton summed it up best: "You make this fantastic Jean Georges dish, but then you have to serve it 10,000 times."
IT is no wonder that there is so much transience. Over two recent weeks at Le Cirque 2000, the entire fabric of the kitchen altered. One of the pasta cooks quit. Cooks from Germany and France arrived to begin 18-month apprenticeships. Mr. Camelo gave notice. ("I've been feeling trapped here a little," he explained.) And Andrew Carmellini, the sous chef, who had helped Mr. Khunn get Le Cirque 2000 up and running, dropped a bomb by giving notice, too; he had been hired away by Cafe Boulud.
Mr. Khunn was scrambling. In addition to making an appearance at Le Cirque 2000's new restaurant at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas and continuing to train his small army of New York cooks, who at various moments during dinner service looked confused, he had to search for a new sous chef.
For this important hire, Mr. Khunn cannot place collegial calls to other chefs. He has to headhunt, and it is likely that he will hire someone away from another restaurant, much in the same way his understudy was plucked away from him.
Resumes, anyone?

HEADLINE: PRIVATE SECTOR;
Preacher to the Doubters in Japan

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
MARTY WHITMAN undoubtedly the only person who ever called him Martin was his mother -- is on a crusade.
The man who has made several fortunes betting on corporate lost causes has now taken on Japan, the epicenter of the Asian financial crisis. At a time when many foreign investors have bailed out, Mr. Whitman's Third Avenue Value fund has 11.4 percent of its net assets sunk into Japanese stocks, mostly nonlife insurance companies and Toyota Motor Corporation affiliates. 
 But it was his ill-fated decision last summer to buy 50 million shares in the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan -- nationalized on Friday with $39 billion in troubled loans, and the symbol of the Japanese financial crisis -- that awakened his zeal.
With his Yale University rep tie perpetually askew and his shirt sleeves rolled to his elbows, Mr. Whitman, 74, looks like the Wall Street equivalent of John the Baptist, and his message is no less fiery.
If Japan fails to come up with a template for rescuing troubled companies and banks, he warns, the country's financial and economic system will collapse and bring the rest of the world down with it. "Unless Japan creates an environment in which bad loans can be worked out so that debtors are rehabilitated and creditors recover something, the bad-debt problem here is hopeless," he said.
In the past, Mr. Whitman has run funds that did well by buying into companies caught up in bankruptcy and later selling them for a big profit. And he thinks Japan would do well to imitate Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, which gives distressed companies protection from creditors while they set their houses in order and rewards creditors by restoring value to their holdings.
"Japan needs a Chapter 11 of some sort," he said. "Japan is particularly suited to that kind of process because it calls for consensus and this is a consensual society, unlike the United States, where things tend to get adversarial."
Alas, for all the urgency of his message, he is having a hard time persuading Japanese power brokers to listen to it. On a recent trip here, he held a series of meetings with financial executives, but the only politician who would give him the time of day was a senior researcher for the main opposition party.
"The nicest thing I have to say now is that I'm often wrong," he said wearily over a sushi lunch as he licked salmon roe from his fingertips.
He certainly was wrong about Long-Term Credit Bank. In July, he bought the stock for $1 a share, figuring it could not go much lower. Before it was nationalized, its shares were trading at about 2 cents apiece, and Third Avenue was bailing out, selling 49 million of its 50 million shares in recent weeks for a total loss of $46 million.
"Terrible mistake," Mr. Whitman mused of the investment.
Last month, he took the unprecedented step of suing the bank in an American court for its plans to forgive $1.9 billion in loans to three affiliates. After all, he said in the interview, "They're not running the bank for their borrowers."
Or are they? Mr. Whitman said he was told during his meeting with Tsuneo Suzuki, president of Long-Term Credit Bank, that debt forgiveness was "a matter of tradition."
"He kept telling me that the relationship between the bank and its affiliates was like the relationship between a mother and her child," Mr. Whitman recalled. "I finally asked him, 'Don't children have any obligation to their mother?' "
A spokesman for Long-Term Credit Bank said the bank did not want to comment.
Mr. Whitman says he was also was unsuccessful in pitching an idea to Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance, in which Third Avenue has a stake currently valued at $60 million, to pump up its flagging returns. Even so, he can take heart in some recent developments. The country's political opposition, sympathetic to his views, threatened to hold up passage of financial reform legislation if, among other things, Long-Term Credit Bank insisted on adhering to its original plan to forgive affiliates their debts. Consequently, the Government forbade the bank to pursue its debt-forgiveness plan, and on Sept. 29, one of its affiliates, the Japan Leasing Corporation, went bankrupt.
So despite his gloom -- "The future looks rather discouraging to me," he said during lunch -- he clearly found a few sympathetic ears during his visit. Although Kiyoshi Sugawa, the opposition researcher, had to cut short his meeting with Mr. Whitman to deal with legislative battles, he said he found Mr. Whitman's proposals provocative.
"I think his ideas for attracting private investment capital to increase the depleted capital bases of some banks are very good," Mr. Sugawa said, though he confessed he found some of Mr. Whitman's message too technical to understand.
Is Mr. Whitman's campaign to play a role in Japan's crisis quixotic? Asked whether he was aiming for a tombstone inscribed "Marty Whitman, Japan's Savior," he answered: "No! 'Marty Whitman, Savior of the world.' "
He was probably joking. But he believes he can make a difference, and even draws a parallel between the effort to restore Japan's health and the long struggle for human rights in the old Soviet bloc. "My wife is very involved in the whole human rights thing, and I used to always ask her why she was wasting her time," he said. "Then the Berlin Wall fell, and Vaclav Havel was there on television thanking all the human rights groups and telling them that without them, none of it would have been possible."

HEADLINE: A California Vote Could Rewrite U.S. Electric Bills

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

DATELINE: CHICO, Calif.

 BODY:
AS political rallies go, it wasn't much: a knot of about 20 people standing in front of a Pacific Gas and Electric Company office in this small city about 90 miles north of Sacramento. Passers-by ignored the signs they waved, placards that supported a proposition on the California ballot on Nov. 3 intended to upend deregulation of the state's utilities and sharply cut electric rates for residential and small-commercial customers.
But television crews from two local stations recorded the event, and the activists who organized it welcomed the free publicity for their cause. 
 "We're reduced to stunts," acknowledged Harry M. Snyder, a senior advocate for Consumers Union, the nonprofit group that publishes Consumer Reports magazine.
With little money for television commercials and an issue that confuses many voters, Consumers Union and other groups are trying to ignite a rate-payer revolt to pass Proposition 9 and rein in the state's utilities, which the groups say are failing to share enough of the benefits of deregulation with smaller customers.
This is a long-shot effort, but one that the utilities and their allies are taking very seriously. Opponents of Proposition 9 are spending more than $30 million on a campaign to defend the deregulation plan that went into effect earlier this year. Although the utilities' barrage of television commercials has cut into support for the proposition, polls still show it with considerable support among a befuddled electorate.
The stakes are high. Opponents of Proposition 9 say that if it ever took effect, it could cost utilities about $6 billion and put the state's credit at risk. More important, a victory for the measure -- even if it is tied up in the courts, as so many California ballot propositions are -- could help stall plans to deregulate utilities in other states.
"The effects would be devastating," said Scott Gebhardt, the president and chief executive of PG&E Energy Services, a subsidiary of the PG&E Corporation, the holding company for Pacific Gas and Electric, the largest utility in the state. "It would have a chilling effect across the nation."
Backers of Proposition 9 certainly hope so. The California battle comes as the early enthusiasm for deregulation is running into opposition in a few states.
Massachusetts will vote next month on a ballot initiative that, like Proposition 9, challenges the mechanism by which utilities can recover the costs of nuclear plants they built and high-priced power contracts they signed in the days of strict state regulation. In New Hampshire, deregulation is stalled in the courts.
California, which has moved further than other states to deregulate its utilities, has become the flashpoint for consumer discontent. Since residential power service was opened to competition earlier this year, the electric bills received by California households have shown a state-mandated 10 percent discount. But the bills now also include a variety of additional charges -- including one for those nuclear plants and high-cost contracts -- and consumer groups are arguing that smaller customers are actually saving very little, perhaps only 1 to 3 percent.
"They give us a rate cut, but then the utilities are using fees to get that back," said George West, a retired savings-and-loan executive who, along with his wife Jan, was one of the handful of people who showed up for the rally in Chico. "Something's not right."
By contrast, big industrial customers may end up cutting their power costs by a third within four years, according to energy marketers. The expected competition among electricity suppliers is taking place mostly for these big customers; as a result, it is utilities and industry that are providing most of the money for the campaign to defeat Proposition 9.
AT issue is a compromise reached two years ago by the state's three big utilities, environmental groups and others that enabled the Legislature to unanimously pass a law making California the first state to deregulate its utility industry.
As part of the deal, the utilities agreed to open themselves to competition from power suppliers outside California; electricity customers, meanwhile, would foot most of the bill for what are called stranded costs.
These include the costs California utilities incurred building nuclear plants that were much more expensive than anticipated. They also include the costs of long-term contracts for high-priced electricity from outside suppliers. In California, these stranded costs total a staggering $28 billion according to an estimate two years ago, which is to be paid off in about four years. Then, smaller customers are also expected to see larger savings, of 20 percent or more, as more marketers begin competing to serve them.
The Utility Reform Network, an activist group that has long battled the state's utilities on rate matters, took part in the talks over the 1996 deregulation plan and ultimately adopted a neutral stance, easing the deal's passage in Sacramento. But now, the group, known by the acronym Turn, has joined Consumers Union and others, including the League of Women Voters and the Sierra Club, to promote Proposition 9.
The groups, which have raised just $1.2 million to back the initiative, contend that Proposition 9, if passed, would quickly cut residential electric bills by 20 percent, basically by shifting $6 billion in stranded costs to the utilities and their shareholders.
It would also prevent the utilities from imposing fees on rate payers to pay off a separate $6 billion bond issue that enabled the power companies to give the rate payers a 10 percent rate cut this year. In effect, the initiative's backers say, it would stop the utilities from taking back with one hand the discount they extended with the other.
But if Proposition 9 is approved by the voters, the utilities say that bondholders would be left in limbo, endangering the credit rating of every public borrower in California. They are also threatening to go to court to uphold their right to be reimbursed for costs they incurred when rates were regulated. If that happens, the implementation of the proposition -- and possibly of utility deregulation here over all -- could be tied up for years.
"You will have to fight it all over again," said Robert D. Glynn Jr. chairman, president and chief executive of PG&E, which is based in San Francisco.
That prospect could inhibit other states from proceeding with their own deregulation plans. "People will be more inclined to wait and see," said Robert K. Johnson, executive director of the Electric Consumers Alliance, which represents about 260 consumer groups nationwide.
The other states that have adopted deregulation plans are Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Illinois and Montana; 15 others are putting plans together.
Here in California, the three major electric utilities -- Pacific Gas and Electric; Southern California Edison, which is owned by Edison International, and the San Diego Gas and Electric Company, owned by the Sempra Energy Corporation -- have spent heavily to saturate the state with prime-time commercials opposing Proposition 9.
The utilities have wide and formidable support, not only from such expected allies as associations for large industrial customers and local chambers of commerce, but also from labor unions, which worry about job losses because of high power rates; environmental groups like the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resource Defense Council, which favor the deregulation plan's incentives for using renewable energy and encouraging efficiency, and education groups like the California School Boards Association, which do not want to see borrowing costs rise.
Statewide polling on the initiative indicates that prospective voters are confused and divided. Three respected polls put support for Proposition 9 at anywhere from 43 percent of those questioned to just 19 percent; the undecideds range from 23 percent to 43 percent.
In their efforts to sway the result, both sides are making simplistic appeals to voters' pocketbooks and their sense of fair play.
In one anti-Proposition 9 TV spot, Thomas Hayes, a former state Treasurer, warns that after conducting an in-depth study he concluded that passage of the proposal would cause a default on the deregulation bonds, "leaving California taxpayers liable for about $6 billion." Such a default, he warns, would force California municipalities and schools to pay higher interest rates when they borrow money.
The other side relies on news interviews with spokesmen, like Harvey J. Rosenfield, the consumer activist who in 1988 spearheaded Proposition 103, an initiative that led to rebate checks for many of the state's auto insurance customers.
Interviewed this month by KRON, a San Francisco television station, Mr. Rosenfield assailed the utilities for persuading politicians to require rate payers to "pay 100 percent of the utilities' bad debts."
"This outrageous corporate welfare will cost every family in California $2,000," he said. An hour later, at another station, he struck out again, comparing the full recovery of stranded costs to the "utility mafia calling in all their chits."
But this lively debate has not made either utility deregulation or Proposition 9 much clearer to many people, who say in interviews that they remain unsure how to vote.
For example, Salah Atshon, a clerk at a small delicatessen near Union Square in San Francisco, has seen many of the ads. "They tell me to say 'no,' " he said, standing behind the counter, "but they tell me little about what exactly the proposition says."
Dan Davis, who owns a film processing business in Chico and follows utility deregulation for the Chico Chamber of Commerce, said he was unsure what Proposition 9 would do. "And I've read it twice," he said.
As a result, he is reluctant to tamper with the existing deregulation plan, especially because it has only begun to take hold. Indeed, the Chico chamber decided to oppose the proposition rather than disrupt deregulation at this point.
"Most small-business people want to take a wait-and-see approach and let things evolve," Mr. Davis said.
THE utility business was deregulated here in March, after a three-month delay. That wait was because of glitches in the software used to run a power pool in which electricity could be bought and sold by competing marketers, utilities and independent power producers, much as on a commodity exchange.
An $89 million statewide publicity campaign raised expectations that customers would be able to choose a supplier other than their established utility and that the competition would help drive down rates.
Smaller customers, however -- whether homeowners, renters or small-business owners -- found that there were few choices. Since the smaller customers were already guaranteed a 10 percent discount, most power suppliers could offer little in the way of savings and still cover their expenses, let alone eke out a profit.
The Enron Corporation, for example, tried offering two weeks' worth of free electricity to entice smaller customers. But after spending millions of dollars and months of effort, Enron, based in Houston, attracted only 30,000 customers. So it withdrew from the consumer market in April.
All together, only about 100,000 customers out of a potential 10 million statewide have switched away from their utilities. (Municipal systems, like the one that serves most of the city of Los Angeles, are exempt from the deregulation law unless they choose to compete outside their service area.)
But utilities and outside power suppliers like Enron are competing vigorously for large industrial customers, the market that, with its economies of scale, offers the greatest potential for profits.
For example, PG&E Energy Services is spending about $100 million pursuing manufacturers and other big businesses. Among other things, the company is providing staff to help customers find ways to conserve energy, change processes and shift power use to off-peak times, when it is cheaper.
Such steps, together with a decline in industrial electric rates because of the increased competition, are expected to save some large customers hundreds of millions of dollars, cutting their power costs by a third or more over about four years, according to Mr. Gebhardt of PG&E Services.
Numbers like these, the initiative's backers say, show that the fruits of deregulation are not being shared equitably. Moreover, in June, when various deregulation-related charges were broken out on bills for the first time, some smaller customers began to realize that even their 10 percent discount did not come without strings.
They saw, for instance, a charge labeled "Trust Transfer Amount," which is being collected to pay off the $6 billion of bonds that were sold on behalf of the utilities by agents to help make the 10 percent rate cut possible. On many residential bills, the charge is actually larger than the discount.
Some customers look at the two amounts and wonder where the savings are, even though the utilities insist that the two figures are not comparable.
The mathematics of California rate payers' bills underscore a big reason that most states have been slow to deregulate utilities: it is difficult to keep electricity rates from going up in the early years, because the utilities' stranded costs must be paid. Otherwise, the long-established power companies are stuck with plants that cannot compete once the shield of monopoly is lifted and cheap power begins to flow freely.
In California, that challenge was made a bit less formidable by the fact that many of the utilities' contracts for higher-priced power from independent suppliers were about to run out; that meant the price that the utilities were paying for power would drop quickly.
Normally, such savings would have been passed on to customers by the California Public Utilities Commission in rate reductions estimated at 8 to 12 percent.
Instead, the negotiators who cobbled together California's deregulation plan in 200 hours of marathon meetings agreed to allow the utilities to freeze rates. On the surface, that looked like a good deal for consumers used to regular increases in power costs. In reality, it was a huge source of revenue for the utilities to apply toward paying off their stranded costs.
"It was a very creative and pragmatic way to get to competition," said Mr. Gebhardt, who had gone through the slow process of deregulation of the natural gas industry when he was an Enron executive. "You keep the utilities whole while you open up competition."
Later, the 10 percent discount was insisted upon by legislators and advertised as a further inducement for popular support.
Consumer advocates like Mr. Snyder of Consumers Union see the compromise differently, complaining that no strong voice for rate payers was represented in the negotiations. "The person paying the bill was left out of the room," he said.
Besides forcing the utilities to pay about $6 billion of stranded costs -- those for building and operating nuclear plants -- Proposition 9 would also eliminate the Trust Transfer Amount from customers' bills, by prohibiting utilities from charging rate payers for the costs of retiring the $6 billion in bonds sold to finance the 10 percent rate cut.
Both sides agree, though, that any cost-shifting to the utilities will be borne by their investors and that the companies' stock prices are likely to fall."The shareholders will have to pay," Mr. Snyder said.
Californians reached this point in part because Turn, the rate-payer activist group, blinked during negotiations over the 1996 deregulation plan.
Nettie Hoge, Turn's executive director, said in an interview that she had misgivings about the agreement from the start but believed it was the best deal that could be reached. Businesses tired of paying some of the highest rates in the country were threatening to move plants to other states with cheaper power, and there was a sense that the state needed to act quickly.
While Turn lobbied to protect consumers during the negotiations, she said, "I did not have the courage to say, 'This doesn't meet our bottom line.' "
Since then, the group has been actively seeking to change California's program. "I don't think this is the best thing for residential customers," Ms. Hoge said. "I think the utilities got a windfall."

Charts: "A David-vs.-Goliath Battle With an Unclear Result"
Californians will vote on Nov. 3 on Proposition 9, a measure that would upend utility deregulation in the state. Opponents have a huge financial edge in the campaign, but three major polls conducted recently on the ballot initiative produced widely different results.
 
FUNDS
 
For Proposition 9
$1.2 million
Most of this money is being spent on a grass-roots campaign using volunteers.
 
Against Proposition 9
$30.1 million
Three big utilities -- Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric and San Diego Gas and Electric -- contributed $29.8 million of this total. The anti-9 campaign is advertising heavily on television.

"Completing the Circuit"
One result of utility deregulation in California is a set of confusing new entries on residential customers' electric bills:
 
Rate payers were granted a 10 percent reduction on their monthly bills effective Jan. 1.
 
Beginning in June, however, bills disclosed that customers were paying a fee called a Trust Transfer Amount to pay off $6 billion in bonds issued so utilities could refinance old debt at lower interest rates and thus better afford the 10 percent rate cut. For some customers, this charge is bigger than the discount itself. Over all, though, some consumer groups claim residential and small-business customers get a net savings of 1 to 3 percent.

Down Market Weighs on Donations, Too

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
SINCE June, gifts of cash to the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York are running several million dollars below last year.
The New York Community Trust received 13 gifts of stock in the last two weeks of August 1997. But when the stock market was falling in the equivalent period this year, not one gift of stock came in. 
 And at the San Francisco Opera, two board members have asked to defer or delay their pledges, as have several donors to the Boston Lyric Opera.
Across the country, many charities say that with the stock market's summer swoon, the wild swings in share prices that have followed and the recent drop in interest rates, they have observed a sudden drop in donations -- and, in what may be a more ominous sign, a decline in inquiries from donors about future gifts.
To be sure, many charities say they have seen no signs that donations are slowing. Leaders of charities in Silicon Valley and Minneapolis said that giving was growing. But in New York and a half-dozen other cities, charity officials say market volatility has created apprehension about the future value of assets. If those worries translate into a slowdown in giving after two years of robust growth, it would take some of the polish off what has been widely hailed as a golden age of philanthropy.
John H. Biggs, chief executive of the T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F. pension system and volunteer chairman of the United Way of New York City, said the drop in the value of his portfolio had affected his own thoughts about giving to a host of charities.
"Makes you think, 'Maybe a little less,' " he said last week at the kickoff for the current United Way campaign.
Such thinking is widespread. "The volatility in the market is causing a general mood of conservatism among all donors," said Karen Brooks Hopkins, development director for the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
Jonathan Rose, whose family members are prominent supporters of performing arts and low-income housing charities in New York, said the concern about gifts was highest among those with modest new wealth from stocks and mutual funds. "People who were giving surpluses now are concerned about having any surplus," he said.
Individual Americans gave $109.3 billion in 1997, the American Association of Fund-Raising Council Trust for Philanthropy estimated. Giving rose almost 7 percent in both 1997 and 1996, more than three times the rate of inflation.
But as charities approach the closing weeks of the year, when many collect half of their annual donations, there is concern that instead of a torrent of gifts there may be only scattered showers.
Many charities say that for the year, their donations are running ahead of 1997, but that the growth was all in the first six months of 1998, before the Dow Jones industrial average peaked at 9,337.97 on July 17.
Stephen D. Solender, executive vice president of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, which raised a quarter-billion dollars last year, said that gifts of appreciated property remained strong even as cash gifts dropped, but that the start of layoffs on Wall Street was worrisome. "It never helps when the financial industry is going through this kind of turmoil, and we are alert to potential implications," he said. "The last six weeks of the year will tell."
The New York Community Trust also said overall giving was up from last year.
Ms. Hopkins, the Brooklyn Academy of Music development director, said: "Right now we are in the contemplative-hysterical stage. People are saying, 'I lost 40 percent of my portfolio, I have to think this through,' when asked about another gift. No one has said out and out, 'We are not giving.' And if the market drop just turns into a correction, all it will mean is that we will have to work a little harder. But there is a lot of concern about the value of the market."
The prospect of job layoffs caused by turmoil in the financial markets and depressed oil prices is also raising concerns about how well annual fund-raising campaigns will fare in New York, Houston, New Orleans and some other cities.
A recession could actually benefit many charities, said Robert F. Sharpe, a planned-giving consultant in Memphis who has written extensively about giving patterns in this century. Giving, he has found, typically rises during hard times.
"Historically, the wealth effect takes about two years before it breaks the charitable giving cycle, so it will be 2001 before we really know what is going on," Mr. Sharpe said. "People cancel vacations before they cancel their pledges to their church or synagogue or college."
Recent wild swings in stock prices have prompted some donors to time their gifts, either in the hope of new market highs or to get the maximum tax benefit.
"There are clients who are waiting to fund charitable trusts as far into the year as they can," said W. Christopher Singleton, director of trust and nonprofit services for the Merrill Lynch Trust Company. "They want the opportunity of a rebound in individual securities they plan to transfer into the trust."
Eileen Heisman, president of the National Philanthropic Trust in Jenkintown, Pa., said she was running on a boardwalk in Cape May, N.J., the morning after the Dow plummeted 512 points on Aug. 31.
"I was thinking about a major donor who was waiting for the stock market to reach a certain threshold before making a gift, and when I saw the headlines on the newspaper racks, I shouted 'Oh, no!' so loudly a guy running by stopped to see what was wrong."
She said that the prospective donor "has never called back."
 
Giving Stock to Charities, With the I.R.S. in Mind
 Roller-coaster markets are producing visible shifts in donors' conduct.
 For example, fund-raising specialists say givers are taking more care in the timing of gifts of appreciated stock.
 The tax deduction for such gifts is set at the midpoint of the range of trading prices on the day a stock is donated, a date that can be fixed by postmark. David Blinder, vice president for resources at Wellesley College, said some donors now wait until the stock market closes at 4 P.M. to check the trading range and then decide whether to mail their stock certificates.
 The drop in interest rates has also made gift annuities much less attractive. In a gift annuity, a donor typically gives a charity highly appreciated stock and in return gets back a stream of payments, usually for life. The attractiveness of such gifts depends on the applicable interest rates, which are set by the Government. The rate was 6.8 percent in September but will fall to 5.4 percent in November.
 Lower interest rates also mean higher premiums on new life insurance, and that has virtually destroyed what had been rapid growth in gift annuities combined with life insurance. Such gifts were designed to allow a donor to replace the value of donated property with insurance proceeds, and pass that on to heirs free of estate taxes.
 "I have not had a client wanting to
 do the charitable remainder with
 the insurance ploy in several months," said Henry Lowett, an estate tax specialist at Anderson Kill & Olick, a Manhattan law firm.
 Lower interest rates have, conversely, increased the attractiveness of a lead trust, another kind of charitable gift. In a lead trust, a donor gives a charity the income from an asset for a period of time, usually 20 years, after which the property is passed on to the donor's heirs. Lower interest rates mean that more of the value of the asset can be passed to heirs without paying gift or estate taxes.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Oh, Those Yawning Spreads

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
True or false: The Federal Reserve's recent interest-rate cuts, and those expected forthwith, will forestall an economic recession in the United States and lower the risk that credit will dry up across the economy.
True, said the stock market as it meandered upward last week. In one of the calm est five-day trading stretches in months, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,452.29, up four-tenths of 1 percent. 
 The bond market, however, isn't sure that all is well yet. Smoke signals from much of the non-Treasury bond markets say a recession remains a possibility. Moreover, while it is unclear whether banks have stopped lending to good customers, the bond markets are still gripped by catalepsy. And so a credit crisis might start there.
Because movements of various fixed-income instruments, like mortgage-backed securities and high-yield bonds, aren't as easily tracked as stocks, what the bond market is saying isn't immediately evident. But one sign of continued fear among these investors is the difference between the yields they demand on junk bonds and those paid by Treasury securities with like maturities. This difference is known as the spread.
When investors embrace risk, as they did last spring, spreads between Treasury issues and more speculative debt are narrow. As investors rush into riskier bonds, their prices rise and yields decline. When investors shun risk, as they are now, spreads widen.
Despite the Fed's latest reduction in interest rates, on Oct. 15, spreads remain wide by historical standards. The estimated yield on Salomon Smith Barney's index of high-yield bonds exceeds that on Treasuries by 6.82 percentage points, compared with a 5.3-point spread before the rate cut.
"This spread is reflecting a great concern that the economic environment is not very healthy and that, if anything, surprises will be on the downside," said Ned Riley, chief investment officer of the BankBoston Corporation. Mr. Riley agrees with the market and expects corporate earnings to be chronically disappointing for six to nine months.
The hefty spread on junk bonds is also a sign that the huge market for these corporate bonds is still frozen. As a result, the credit squeeze that the Fed fretted about when it lowered rates remains a possibility.
According to Mr. Riley, credit contractions can happen for two reasons. One is a result of restrictive moves by bank regulators. The other is more emotional, with lenders pulling back from loans more out of fear of default than its reality. "It's the emotional action we have to worry about now," Mr. Riley said. "As lenders become gun-shy, they can create a credit squeeze even without monetary authorities being a catalyst."
Hence the interest in credit spreads. If they narrow, it will mean that lenders are becoming more optimistic about their customers' prospects. If they stay wide, a credit contraction is likely.
Both stock and bond investors think the Fed's recent rate cuts, though welcome, are not enough. Indeed, many are hoping for a one-half-point slash in the Federal funds rate at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting in November.
These hopes could be dashed. Late last week, several Fed members started telegraphing that further rate cuts were not necessarily a given. In a speech on Thursday, J. Alfred Broaddus, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said said the risk that the economy's growth rate could accelerate -- a k a inflation -- hadn't vanished. And, he said, the Fed cannot "be held hostage" to the markets on interest-rate policy.
The stock market has shrugged this off. So far.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Gay Politics and Anti-Politics;
A Movement Divided Between Push and Shove

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
THOUSANDS of gay demonstrators scrapped with police officers in midtown Manhattan on Monday, protesting the violent death of a young gay man in Wyoming. The clash recalled the Stonewall uprising, the brawl between homosexuals and policemen outside a Greenwich Village bar that launched the gay rights movement in 1969. More than a few of the people gathered in front of the Plaza Hotel last week had marched in Greenwich Village 29 years before.
On Tuesday, a very different expression of the gay rights movement was taking place in Washington. In a tense, quarrelsome conference call, 22 members of the board of directors of the Human Rights Campaign, the most mainstream of American gay organizations, voted to endorse Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican, over Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, in the race for the Senate. 
 This was the same Mr. D'Amato who had been the target of many of the gay men and women the night before; they were outraged by the anti-homosexual positions of many of his Republican colleagues, especially his allies in Albany who have blocked consideration of a gay rights bill.
 
Internal Struggle
As discordant as they might appear, the events in New York and Washington accurately reflected two major forces that have roiled the gay rights movement over the decades. This inherently fractious political movement has been torn by a struggle between pragmatic homosexuals who seek to work with government and more hostile advocates who tend to view government as an enemy.
In 1969, a group of young, radical New Yorkers formed the Gay Liberation Front, pushing aside the staid Mattachine Society, whose suit-and-tie leaders had quietly worked with Mayor John V. Lindsay to end entrapment of homosexuals in public bathrooms and police harassment of gay bars. Fifteen years later, young protesters picketed the Municipal Elections Committee of Los Angeles, the city's pioneer gay political action committee, after its leaders, adopting the anti-AIDS position of the more conservative forces in local government, called for bathhouses to close. The creation of Act Up in 1987 was, from its first demonstration in the Financial District, a repudiation of established gay rights groups from Washington to New York.
These days, the Human Rights Campaign plays the inside-the-system role. The organization, the first national gay political action committee, distinguished itself upon its founding in the early 1980's by holding black-tie fund-raisers at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, though it might be better remembered for the alliance it struck with Mr. D'Amato.
The struggle between defiant advocates and those who prefer to compromise has been mirrored in other civil rights movements, notably the one for black rights. But the gay rights movement is distinct because it is made up of such a diverse universe -- covering all ideologies, economic classes and races. Its members share only two traits: sexual orientation and, most likely, the experience of discrimination. It is not surprising, then, that the movement as a whole has never reached a consensus about its mission: An equal rights bill? Admission to the military? The right to marry? To be left alone?
The tension between those who want a place at the table and those who want to throw rocks through the window has been one of the few constants. On one side, the gathering at the Plaza Hotel, like that at the Stonewall Inn, was a spontaneous venting of frustration and a classic display of take-it-to-the-streets politics. No major organization put out the call for the protest; there was no list of demands, no leader. The spark was Matthew Shepard, the 21-year-old University of Wyoming student murdered in what authorities described as a bias-related crime.
On the other side, the Human Rights Campaign is about as establishment as politics get in Washington, with an annual budget of $13 million, a board of directors and stationery. Vice President Al Gore attends its annual dinner, which brings in money for candidates who support gay rights measures.
And like all establishment homosexual groups of the past 30 years, it is focused and pragmatic. Its members practice the kind of politics that the street firebrands have either rejected or failed to understand, starting with compromise.
To many people in New York, the notion of a gay rights organization endorsing Mr. D'Amato may seem astonishing. To the Human Rights Campaign it was the obvious decision: Mr. D'Amato took its side on many gay rights issues in recent years. And in a race involving two candidates with similar records on gay issues, the group has a policy of picking the incumbent. This determined pragmatism comes at a time when the board has been trying to demonstrate to Washington its readiness to work with Republicans.
The best way to appreciate the divergent views is to consider two people who were at the center of both the disturbances at the Stonewall and the Plaza Hotel: Andrew Tobias, a financial writer who is a member of the Human Rights Campaign board, and Jim Fouratt, a New York record producer who protested in front of the Stonewall and in front of the Plaza.
Mr. Tobias, who organized a fund-raiser for Mr. Schumer, makes a passionate case for Mr. Schumer's election. "I'm terrified of a filibuster-proof Senate," he said, referring to the possibility that Democrats will hold fewer than 40 seats after Nov. 3. "And I have very strong feelings about choice." Mr. D'Amato, unlike Mr. Schumer, opposes abortion.
 
Nuances, Nuances
Yet Mr. Tobias fully supports what his board did. How could the Human Rights Campaign hope to convince other Republicans to follow Mr. D'Amato's path and defy party orthodoxy, he asked, if it turned its back on the Senator now? It is a nuanced position, he acknowledged, but a rational one. "Clearly, D'Amato, by all of our policies, earned and deserved the endorsement," he said.
That is precisely the kind of argument that has perplexed people like Mr. Fouratt for years. Mr. D'Amato's endorsement was "shocking," Mr. Fouratt said, nothing more than the latest example of the short-sightedness of the "middle class," as he disparagingly calls the establishment homosexuals. "You don't change people's opinions and attitudes by power-brokering," he said.
Mr. Fouratt did not say it, but that is about the same point he made 28 years ago, when another group of gay activists, the Gay Activists Alliance, tried to nudge their new movement into the mainstream by lobbying for a gay rights bill in New York City. It seems safe to say it is a difference of opinion that is going to be troubling this movement for a long time.

HEADLINE: C. C. Killingsworth, 81, Mediator and Professor

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Charles Clinton Killingsworth, a labor-management economist, mediator and University Professor emeritus at Michigan State University, died Oct. 16 at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing. He was 81 and lived in nearby Okemos, Mich.
The cause was a heart attack, his family said. 
 Starting in 1943, Dr. Killingsworth was a mediator and arbitrator in labor-management disputes. At various times he was chosen to act as the national umpire and go-between for leading steel, rubber and airline companies on one side and their unions on the other.
He also sat on various Presidential boards appointed to head off or settle labor confrontations in vital industries. He was a panel chairman and special hearing officer for the National War Labor Board in World War II, and returned to Government service in the early 1950's as vice chairman, later chairman, of the Federal Wage Stabilization Board.
Dr. Killingsworth was an author of many articles on industrial relations and economics for law reviews and academic journals. He was co-author of a three-volume compendium, "Trade Union Publications, 1852-1940" (Johns Hopkins Press, 1944).
His book credits include "State Labor Relations Acts" (University of Chicago Press, 1948) and "Jobs and Income for Negroes" (1968), which remains in print at the University of Michigan's Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations.
Dr. Killingsworth was born in Webb City, Mo., and graduated from Southwest Missouri State University in 1938. He received a master's degree in science from Oklahoma State University in 1939 and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Wisconsin in 1946.
His first academic appointment was as an instructor in political economics at Johns Hopkins University, where he remained until 1945. He joined the faculty at Michigan State two years later, and was named a full professor and head of the department of economics in 1949.
For a time Dr. Killingsworth also headed the university's Labor and Industrial Relations Center, which he helped establish in 1956. He was promoted to University Professor of Labor and Industrial Relations and Economics in 1960.
Dr. Killingsworth's first wife, the former Beverly Kritzman, died in 1970 after 27 years of marriage. He is survived by his second wife of 27 years, the former Jacqueline Schrecengost; a son, Mark R., of Princeton, N.J.; a daughter, Charlotte Senour of Hermosa Beach, Calif.; two adopted daughters, Randi Tupper of Grand Rapids, Mich., and Tammy Hall of Boston, and eight grandchildren.

Chicken Little! Shut Up!

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
MAYBE it was just a false dawn there have been plenty of those.
But as the Dow Jones industrial average rose, the final touches were put on a $30 billion package to prop up Brazil, and Japan committed a half a trillion dollars to save its banks, there was hope last week that the worst of the global financial upheaval might be passing. 
 The case for optimism goes like this: Investors may be realizing that their panicky race for the exits, into Treasury bonds and anything else that seems secure, was as much an overreaction as their rush into the world's emerging markets in the mid-1990's was a triumph of blind optimism.
After all, the interest-rate cuts pulled off by the Federal Reserve in recent weeks show that someone is paying attention. Interest rates in Thailand and South Korea have fallen to 7 percent, evidence that their economies may finally get going. Sure, Indonesia has turned into a lawless land, with mobs burning out the shops of ethnic Chinese merchants and chopping off the heads of suspected sorcerers, but its currency, the rupiah, is making a surprising comeback.
Even the Commerce Department's announcement last week of a mammoth August trade deficit for the United States, $16.77 billion, was greeted by the markets as good news: America remains the last big-time consumer on the globe, the numbers showed, and projections that the 1999 trade deficit could hit $300 billion for the year suggests the United States will keep consuming. In other words, even as America's growth slows, it may pull Asia and Japan out of recession.
Of course, there were plenty of optimists around in the spring, declaring that the sky had stopped falling. That was just before Russia defaulted on its debts and backtracked on its commitments to economic reform. And it was when Japan's troubles still seemed limited to $600 billion in bad bank loans, instead of more than $1 trillion.
"It took a long time for these problems to develop, and it will take a long time for the world to work through them," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin cautioned last week. Meanwhile, his aides are explaining what fundamentally good shape Brazil is in, which must explain why it is about to become the fifth country to receive a multi-billion rescue package in the past year.

In Executive Job Hunts, Experience Doesn't Pay

BYLINE: By DANIEL M. GOLD 

 BODY:
It might seem that the job market is so strong and the labor pool so dry that experience, a car and a set of opposable thumbs ought to land you a corner office. Not so fast. Exec-U-Net, an outplacement service in Norwalk, Conn., cautions that age bias remains well ensconced in the corridors of corporate America, just in time to bedevil aging boomers.
The firm surveyed more than 400 executives who had engaged in job searches and found that the older the applicant, the fewer the interviews -- and the longer the search. Compared with an executive 35 to 40 years old, an executive aged 41 to 45 needed 18 percent longer to find a job; a 46- to 50-year-old, 24 percent longer; a 51- to 55-year-old, 44 percent longer, and a 56- to 60-year-old, 66 percent longer. 
 Finding a job should take nine months to a year, depending on age, and might take longer if the seeker is already employed than not. An "executive in transition," as the company describes an unemployed job hunter, can expect a search to take about nine months and include more than 10 interviews; an employed executive can expect an 11-month search and an average of nine interviews.

Opportunities Remain

BYLINE: By DANIEL M. GOLD 

 BODY:
This year has been a boon to serial refinancers, as the lowest mortgage rates in a generation have continued to entice homeowners. The Mortgage Bankers Association of America reports that refinancing activity accounted for nearly 60 percent of total mortgage applications in the most recent week.
Recently, however, rates have been bouncing up and down, and the swings have been much larger than those earlier in the year. The volatility has left some people wondering whether they have missed the chance to lower their monthly payments. 
 The latest numbers suggest not. After the Federal Reserve again cut short-term rates on Oct. 15, lenders surveyed by Bank Rate Monitor, a rate tracking service in North Palm Beach, Fla., made sharp cuts of their own. On average, a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped 12 hundredths of a percentage point last week, an unusually large change, to 6.78 percent, with jumbo rates falling to an average of 7.16 percent.
Rates could slide further; editors at Bank Rate Monitor say the consensus estimate is for the 30-year fixed to range from 6.50 to 6.75 percent through the end of the year.

Filling In Peace's Details Is the Painful Part

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

 BODY:
THE images were arresting. There they were, Ariel Sharon, who once sent the Israeli military to Beirut for Yasir Arafat's head, and Benjamin Netanyahu, who long avoided shaking the man's hand, sitting together in Maryland agreeing with the Palestinian leader on land and airports and prisoner releases.
It is often said that the weakness of the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace accord worked out in Oslo, Norway, was that it was embraced by only half of Israel, the secular liberals of European origin, and had never been sold to religious Israelis, the poor and those of Middle Eastern origin. 
 Now, three years after an Orthodox, Yemenite Israeli student sought to end the peace deal by assassinating Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, here were the representatives of that other Israel coming to terms with the reality that Oslo had created.
Yes, they were making it hard with their near walkouts and last-minute demands. But that was the way toward real peace: you relinquish holy land with a tear in your eye and an ache in your gut, not with the detachment of the previous Government. Here were negotiators who understood the fears as well as the hopes of their people, who could build an agreement that might survive those fears. Prime Minister Rabin, the messenger of peace, may have died, but his message has survived.
Perhaps. But the past five years -- since Mr. Rabin and Mr. Arafat shook hands on the White House lawn -- have offered sobering lessons on why optimism has rarely held sway in this process since.
In contrast to the intimate and personal Oslo negotiations, at the Wye Plantation it took the President of the United States and the King of Jordan days and nights of prodding to produce this next interim step. And its implementation is highly complex. Of course, details and implementation posed formidable barriers to peace from the start. What is different this time is that the Wye agreement comes in the context of difficult experience in making specific peace arrangements work.
"Until Netanyahu's election more than two years ago, the message from the Government was that we have to begin a new life with the Palestinians; let's be neighbors," said Yoel Esteron, managing editor of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. "But now there is no spirit of reconciliation. What we have is a deal among technocrats, a deal with no soul or spirit because there is so little good feeling left."
Shlomo Gazit, a former director of Israel's military intelligence, put it this way: "I am very doubtful that this is a new beginning. For the process to go on, there must be trust and understanding between the two sides and a joint will to move ahead to an overall agreement. What happened in recent months does not bring us any nearer to that."
One reason is that the Palestinians and Israelis agreed to make peace five years ago but never did much to alter the sense they had of each other. Schools on both sides have virtually no lessons in the other's history. Maps in Palestinian schools still show only the names of Palestinian villages destroyed by Israel, not the new Israeli cities. Israeli maps and textbooks make no reference to the destroyed Palestinian towns or to the life and culture of Palestinians before Zionist immigration in the late 19th century.
An official 8th-grade textbook from the Palestinian Authority was recently shown to include the sentence, "The prime examples of racial discrimination are Zionism and Nazism." Last August, Palestinian television was showing footage of a summer camp with youngsters training with automatic weapons and chanting, "I foresee my death and I rush toward it!" and, "A hero's death, the death of a suicide warrior!"
Mr. Esteron of Haaretz said that even the largely liberal, educated Israeli readers of his newspaper seem unmoved by the difficulties that Palestinians suffer as a result of Israeli rules and regulations -- checkpoints, bans on home building, severe restrictions on trade, industry and movement.
"People look at it as if it were somewhere in the Philippines, not right next door," he said.
Each side has tended to consider the Oslo accord a kind of apology from the other, an acknowledgment that it had done wrong. But each side sees only the other's misdeeds, not its own.
And the problem that has overwhelmed all others is the enormous imbalance -- military, geopolitical and economic -- between Israel and the Palestinians. For many Palestinians, Israel is simply a neighborhood outpost of the American-dominated global economy.
Since the new global system has little place in it for land, clan and honor, values upon which Palestinian society has long been built, and can be so unforgiving to those not part of it, Israel is seen as a threat in the most fundamental way to the values of many in the West Bank and Gaza. To many there, Israel stands for sexual permissiveness and godlessness, and so the battle against it goes beyond a fight over land and sovereignty.
The issue is, of course, still more complicated. A battle over values exists within Israel itself, where a religious-secular divide threatens internal politics. Mr. Rabin's assassin, Yigal Amir, like many Sephardi and religious Israelis, felt that peace was draining the nation of its biblical mission and spirit.
Now, with Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Sharon the advocates of peace, the opponents of peace within Israel may feel more and more marginalized. But that does not necessarily mean Israelis will see Palestinians in a more generous light. Israelis feel that what they are giving up is not fully appreciated -- as Mr. Netanyahu has said, 1 percent of the West Bank is the size of Tel Aviv.
But even if the end of this process includes something that bears the name "State of Palestine," as the Palestinians so fervently hope and the majority of Israelis now accept, many doubt it will end the century-old Jewish-Arab conflict.
"This deal does not change the basic rules of the game," asserted Meron Benvenisti, a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem and advocate of greater Israeli concessions. "Let's say the Palestinians get even 50 percent of the West Bank.
"Think about water resources, land development, sewage. Israelis use five times the water of Palestinians. What happens when the Palestinians want more? Where will it come from?
"The Israelis will say: 'We gave all we could. No more. The rest is ours.' So what the Palestinians will get is exactly what the Israelis can live with, peace without any real price. That's why they don't care if there is a Palestinian state. That's why even Sharon and Netanyahu can accept a state, because of the way they will define it."
 
At the End of the Track
Ali Jarbawi, a Palestinian political scientist at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank, said he was equally pessimistic. "I think that for Netanyahu this week's deal is the end of the track altogether," he said. "He won't give up much more land. And what kind of state will we get? There will be cantons with no direct links. It is a gloomy prospect for us."
Daniel Ben-Simon, a political analyst for Haaretz, said he believes the new accord will reshape Israeli politics because the issue that has defined left and right for so long -- territorial concession and a Palestinian state -- will no longer be there. In addition, he says that because of the Palestinian question, other Israeli problems, like the religious and ethnic divides, have festered. Now they can be dealt with and that process will produce an entirely new set of parties and coalitions.
But General Gazit, the former military intelligence chief, is far less hopeful. He believes that Mr. Sharon and Mr. Netanyahu have no long-term vision for the Palestinian question.
"There is huge writing on the wall," he said. "It shows us that without a comprehensive agreement with our neighbors we are doomed ultimately to war. I think the politicians see it. But they don't have the courage to act on it."

HEADLINE: The World: Pinochet in the Dock;
Arresting a Dictator Is One Thing. Then It Gets Tough.

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

 BODY:
NOT so many years ago, it would have been impossible to find Genaro Arriagada on the side of Chile's former military dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
As a prominent academic in the years after General Pinochet took power in 1973, Mr. Arriagada churned out critical studies of the military and its rule. When General Pinochet finally agreed to submit his regime to a popular vote in 1988, Mr. Arriagada organized the coalition that campaigned successfully for his defeat. 
 But as street demonstrations in Chile began to turn violent late last week, following the 82-year-old General's arrest in London on Oct. 16 on human rights charges filed by a Spanish judge, Mr. Arriagada argued bitterly against the prosecution. And though he has just taken over as Chile's new Ambassador to Washington, his reasons, it seemed, have more to do with his own views than with his Government's arguments that General Pinochet should be protected by diplomatic immunity or released on humanitarian grounds.
"Part of the achievement of our transition back to democracy has been to take all of the demons of this history and put them into some kind of closet," Mr. Arriagada said in an interview. "This case brings them all back out again. What right does some Spanish judge have to do that?"
Within hours of General Pinochet's arrest, a parade of law professors was pointing out that a strong basis for his prosecution has been established over the past decade in international law. The threat of what are often called universal crimes, so grotesquely demonstrated in Africa and the Balkans, has prompted many states, especially in Western Europe, to codify in their national laws the jurisdiction that international conventions have offered since the aftermath of World War II.
But Mr. Arriagada and others maintain that unlike the recent prosecutions of accused war criminals from Bosnia and Rwanda, the success of human-rights lawyers targeting General Pinochet will almost certainly come at the expense of the uneasy political compromise by which Chile achieved a measure of reconciliation and peace.
Beyond that argument, moreover, lie serious practical difficulties in mounting a legally compelling case against figures like General Pinochet -- particularly at a distance of several thousand miles.
When the investigating judge, Baltasar Garzon, prevailed on Scotland Yard to arrest the General on charges of murder, genocide and terrorism relating both to 94 Spanish citizens and others among the more than 3,000 people believed to have been killed during General Pinochet's reign, he overcame only the first obstacle to prosecution. Now, Mr. Garzon must persuade Spain's right-of-center Government to formalize his request for the general's extradition. Then he must convince the British Home Secretary, Jack Straw, to grant the extradition. Then Judge Garzon will almost certainly need some help from the Government of Chile to build a successful criminal case.
"We may be seeing an increasing readiness by governments to enforce these international human-rights laws," said Theodor Meron, a professor of international law at New York University. "But when you open up the code book and try to prosecute, you find that you have to deal with a lot of bread-and-butter criminal statutes to get there."
 
Reaching Across Borders
The lawyers, judges and activists seeking justice for human-rights crimes are not the only ones running into such challenges. Since the end of the cold war, countries like France, Britain and the United States have tried to extend the reach of their laws across borders to combat crimes like terrorism and drug trafficking. Although these efforts have had a more solid legal foundation than the human-rights cases, they have run constantly into questions of sovereignty and jurisdiction.
Officials in Switzerland were reminded of such difficulties last week when they announced the seizure of $114 million that was hidden in European banks by Raul Salinas de Gortari, the elder brother of Mexico's former President.
To some American law-enforcement officials, the Swiss detectives had done heroic work: They had started out with virtually no experience in Mexico's narcotics underworld, and faced considerable resistance from some officials in Mexico and the United States. Still, they managed to use a legal-assistance treaty to pry open American jails. There they found informants who, in several cases, had apparently been ignored or mishandled by United States prosecutors, and who said they had witnessed Mr. Salinas taking huge bribes from drug traffickers to arrange for the protection of their loads.
Not surprisingly, many Mexican officials viewed the conclusions of the Swiss investigation differently. They acknowledged that Swiss detectives might have developed enough evidence to keep the money; if Mr. Salinas's lawyers challenge the seizure in court, as they have promised to do, the Swiss Government will only have to argue a civil rather rather than a criminal case -- one with a considerably lower standard of proof than what would be required to convict General Pinochet. Nonetheless, the Swiss investigators were hit immediately by a barrage of procedural and jurisdictional questions from Mexican officials.
 
A Generous Deal
As United States Customs agents learned last May when they set off a diplomatic confrontation by disclosing that they operated under cover in Mexico to trap bankers accused of laundering drug money, it is hard to overestimate how quickly concerns about sovereignty can outweigh those of criminal justice when one country sees another acting unilaterally on its soil or in its affairs.
Echoing Chilean nationalists, Margaret Thatcher, the former British Prime Minister, offered such an argument on behalf of her old friend General Pinochet last week. "The people of Chile, through successively elected democratic Governments, have determined how they should come to terms with their past," she wrote to The Times of London. "An essential part of that process has been the settlement of the status of General Pinochet and it is not for Spain, Britain or any other country to interfere in what is an internal matter for Chile."
At nearly a decade's remove, the deal that centrist politicians like Mr. Arriagada reluctantly cut with General Pinochet strikes many Chileans as too generous, even accounting for the relative prosperity and political stability that the country has enjoyed since. Others, including some of the General's critics, argue that however unsatisfying Chile's solution might have been, the strength of its example can be seen in similar accommodations with military rulers and repressive regimes from Central America to South Africa.
"If these transitions to democracy were just about trials, we could leave them to the judges," Mr. Arriagada said. "But these transitions are about achieving a great number of goals, including political goals, economic goals -- and also human rights goals."

HEADLINE: The World;
Europe's Back, And It's Worried

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT

 BODY:
AN odd thing happened last week: A former Communist became Prime Minister of Italy for the first time in history, yet the Italian lira didn't drop in value amid fears of left-wing economic policies.
The seemingly benign reaction stems in part from the reality of Italian politics; the new Government under Massimo D'Alema is a hodgepodge of people from across the political spectrum. 
 But it was also a telling sign about the peculiar condition of Europe on the eve of its greatest experiment in the postwar era. Just 10 weeks before 11 European countries adopt the euro as a common currency on Jan. 1, eventually replacing marks, francs and lira, Europe has suddenly become the world's bastion of economic safety.
Far from being alarmed about the changes and uncertainties ahead, traders have seized upon European currencies -- including the lira -- as their preferred safe haven from the turmoil rocking Asia, Russia and now even the United States. European currencies have soared about 10 percent against the dollar since August.
In principle, that is testimony to Europe's soundness. But in practice it is creating a baptism of fire for the euro and its overseer, the new European Central Bank.
That became clear last week. The debate now raging across the continent is whether the euro will be a bit too credible and too strong, meaning that European goods will become too expensive for customers with other currencies. Precisely when the new central bank is most preoccupied with proving its political independence, politicians across Europe are badgering it for a weaker euro and lower interest rates to stimulate borrowing and investment.
The chorus got substantially louder last week, after the European Commission reduced its prediction for economic growth next year from 3.2 to 2.6 percent.
 
Pressure
In Germany, where the Social Democrats defeated Chancellor Helmut Kohl in elections last month, the incoming Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, and his Finance Minister stepped up calls for lower interest rates and even suggested a return to some form of fixed exchange rates in world markets. In France, the Socialist Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, made similar calls. And at the European Commission, officials are talking about softening the tough fiscal requirements that it set to bring the economies of the 11 countries in line with each other and thus insure the euro's credibility.
Europe's new central bankers are getting even more pressure from the United States. With the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in a sign of its own anxiety about the economy, the European Central Bank is suddenly the odd man out as the world's most hawkish supporter of hard money.
 
Reform Fatigue
Underlying all this is a more basic question about Europe's condition. Even though economists have recently begun slashing growth projections for next year, most still predict that Europe under the euro -- thanks in part to trade efficiencies produced by the use of one currency rather than many -- will grow faster than the United States for the first time in many years.
But as the rest of the world looks bleaker and bleaker, the question boils down to this: Is Europe an "island of stability," as many European leaders have argued? Or is it just the last domino to fall in a worldwide slump? Naturally, there aren't many clear signs. But there are trends worth noting.
Perhaps the most positive and least appreciated change is the dramatic improvement in the competitiveness of European manufacturing. Here in Germany, makers of cars and machinery have learned to produce far more with far fewer people. They have also redesigned their products, rethought the way they do business and cut innovative deals with labor unions to win more flexibility in the workplace.
Other developments are less encouraging. With the exception of countries like the Netherlands, continental Europe continues to be weighed down by high taxes, costly social programs and very high labor costs.
On top of that, there are clear signs of what might be called "reform fatigue." Having endured years of budget cuts to satisfy fiscal requirements for the euro, voters have ushered in left-leaning governments inclined to shore up social programs.
Mr. Schroder, who campaigned as a "new" and vaguely pro-business Social Democrat, has infuriated German industry by charting a return to left-wing priorities. His new coalition, which includes the environmentalist Green Party for the first time, has pledged to reverse the few labor reforms Mr. Kohl succeeded in pushing through. More important, it has drafted a tax plan with little reduction in the overall tax burden -- which consumes about half of Germany's total output -- and shifts much of it to business. It has also given tacit support to big wage demands by Germany's giant metalworking union.
The collapse of Italy's centrist Government under Romano Prodi was an even more vivid sign of reform fatigue. Mr. Prodi lost his parliamentary majority after the Reformed Communist Party rebelled over his plans for a budget cut.
The Communists tried the same thing last year, but they failed because Italians wanted to reduce their budget deficit enough to qualify for the euro. But all that changed last May, when Italy made the grade and the pressure for austerity eased.
Given all that, why are the currency markets so sanguine? The answer is that politicians do not control the new central bank. And the bank's president, Wim Duisenberg from the Netherlands, is almost typecast for the role of the gruff banker who doesn't let politicians push him around.
A big man with piercing blue eyes and a shock of white hair, Mr. Duisenberg has thus far refused to budge on his policies and has perfected a curmudgeonly scowl that projects wonderfully over television.
"The European Central Bank already has credibility in financial markets, and you can see that from what has been happening," said Bernhard Speyer, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank Research. But the task ahead is not easy: a bit too tough and Mr. Duisenberg could precipitate a real decline in Europe; a bit too easy and the euro's strength could be undermined for years.
"What we face in 8 to 10 weeks from now is a major regime shift, and in a situation like that there are always things that can go wrong," said Mr. Speyer. "You don't want to take any chances."

HEADLINE: Charles Schumer for Senator

 BODY:
The New York Senate race this year is one of those rare contests in which it is a pleasure to take sides. The incumbent Republican, Alfonse D'Amato, is a strong campaigner and a powerful politician who knows how to get things done. But his opponent, Representative Charles Schumer, is a more serious lawmaker with more rooted values, sounder policy positions and a deeper commitment to the common good. The chunks of pork Mr. D'Amato boasts of bringing home are no fair exchange for the damage he does with his impulsive style and devotion to special interests. New York deserves a senator who will grow in gravitas, not just in volume. The state needs a senator who hearkens to the yearnings of the average citizen rather than to the demands of contributors and his party's ideologues.
Mr. D'Amato's talent for political pyrotechnics has obscured the fact that he is far to the right of the average New Yorker on many issues. He supported the disastrous Gingrich/Lott strategy of forcing a Government shutdown in order to try to blackmail the White House into accepting repeal of key parts of the social safety net. He sides with the extreme positions of the National Rifle Association in opposing gun control. Mr. Schumer, in contrast, has been responsible for legislation to curb the sale of handguns to criminals and the mentally incompetent. Mr. D'Amato has consistently voted to deprive women of the right to legal abortion, while Mr. Schumer was responsible for passage of legislation to protect the right of access to abortion clinics. Mr. D'Amato has an unreliable record when it comes to legislation that protects the environment. Mr. Schumer's is excellent. 
 Mr. D'Amato, a successful but greedily unselective fund-raiser, has snubbed the crusade for campaign-finance reform by uttering platitudes about fixing the system but working behind the scenes to kill the McCain-Feingold reform bill. Mr. Schumer, although he has been a prodigious fund-raiser himself, has been a consistent supporter of bills to control the power of special interests in American elections. He was a faithful supporter of campaign finance reform not only this year, but also in the past, when Democrats were in the majority and his own party leadership was far less enthusiastic about talk of change.
Mr. D'Amato's re-election pitch has always been his ability to deliver for New York as "Senator Pothole." Although that talent seems to go into higher gear as elections near, he has scored some real triumphs in matters like getting the state its fair share of transportation funds and securing help for Holocaust victims in their fight with Swiss banking authorities. He has sometimes risen to the occasion on other fronts, most notably his handling of the Senate hearings on Whitewater. But he mainly is a man of the moment, who wins skirmishes without holding any greater vision of what the fight is for. He picks up cash for individual projects back home, but consistently undermines the state's long-term interests in the Senate. While other Republicans from the Northeast have fought to push their party toward the center, Mr. D'Amato buys into the overall vision of the Senate leadership, which is anti-urban and focused on the economic needs of the South and West.
The question before the voters, then, is how to use the past of these two men as a guide to the future. Mr. D'Amato will remain what he has always been, a scrapper who brings home at least some of the bacon and from time to time has to explain that his latest gaffe was not really intended as a slur against ethnic group X or religion Y or constituency group Z. With Al D'Amato, what you see is what you get, and what you get is often vital, sometimes useful and always unpredictable. But it is not now and never will be the kind of balanced leadership that New York ought to be supplying to the Senate and the nation.
In contrast to Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Schumer has used the 18 years since his election to the House to mature from a raw and ambitious young politician to a man with the legislative skills, overarching policy interests and demeanor of a high-impact Senator. Unlike Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Schumer has not faced questions about relatives using his Capitol office for business purposes or endured Congressional ethics investigations. Voters should not forget that Mr. D'Amato has never arranged for the Senate Ethics Committee to release his testimony during closed hearings on conflict-of-interest charges against him. Sealing records and escaping legal sanction are not good enough. New York needs a senator of notorious probity, and Mr. Schumer fits that bill.
It is ironic that Mr. Schumer, who is one of the most infamous workaholics in Congress, has been attacked by Mr. D'Amato as a no-show representative. The consistent harping on Mr. Schumer's attendance record was trivial, but it was also a tactically brilliant piece of demagogy that flattened the flight path of the Schumer campaign. Instead of building a poll lead as he needed to last week, Mr. Schumer has been struggling to hold his altitude. The political reality is that he can win, but he will need a flawless performance on the stump, smart and incessant advertising and every available progressive vote to do so. Mr. Schumer and the electorate will have to beware of last-minute tricks from Mr. D'Amato, such as his promise in 1992 not to seek re-election this year.
One advantage for Mr. Schumer is that Mr. D'Amato's desperate and overreaching charges may tilt the advantage back. The D'Amato attempt to capitalize on Mr. Schumer's missed procedural vote on using the Capitol Rotunda for a Holocaust memorial carried the whiff of panic. So, too, did Mr. D'Amato's use of a vulgar term to describe Mr. Schumer and his ridiculing of Representative Jerrold Nadler for being portly. These incidents reminded voters of the cruelty and tastelessness that have pocked this Senator's career. At bottom, the deal Mr. D'Amato offers voters is rough and candid. They have to put up with his gaffes, ethical problems and loyalty to an ultraconservative agenda because he knows how to play the bureaucracy and the budget game to get New York's slice of the pie.
But opportunism, however skillfully executed, is not leadership appropriate for a state that historically has been a national seedbed for talent in both parties. Mr. Schumer has the capacity to become the kind of senator New York deserves, a senator who will engender pride rather than embarrassment, a senator who will lead Congress on education, the environment, health care, gun control and abortion rights. For all those reasons, we endorse Charles Schumer for the United States Senate.

HEADLINE: The World;
Unstacking Milosevic's Deck

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia

 BODY:
SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC, Serbia's strongman, knows the playbook well.
His first big performance was in Bosnia; his second has just been completed in the Serbian province of Kosovo. 
 The plot goes like this: As a divided West looks the other way, create a crisis. Pursue your ends a little too harshly by destroying a few too many villages, permitting one too many massacres. Finally you catch Washington's attention. Then in a grand gesture grant some concessions -- like allowing monitors on the ground in Kosovo and NATO surveillance planes above.
The climax: You are elevated to the position of indispensable keeper of the peace; American and NATO officials come to consult and sometimes to scold. It all serves to pump you up in the eyes of your own people, to whom you present yourself as their champion and protector against hostile outsiders, namely the West, with which you have just done a deal. As a result, you are guaranteed more years in power as their autocratic ruler.
In moments of candor, American and European diplomats describe Mr. Milosevic's behavior in the last eight months in Kosovo in this neat sequence. They know, they say, that by offering some face-saving concessions to NATO -- which despite its bravado has been reluctant to carry out the air strikes that it continues to threaten -- Mr. Milosevic has outfoxed the West once again. The Yugoslav President was allowed to make a mess in Kosovo over the summer when the West was on vacation and when there was concern that getting tough with him might disturb elections in Bosnia.
 
The Bill
In the aftermath -- 250,000 refugees, burnt villages and irrevocably ruined relations between ethnic Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo -- the United States is left with the cleanup. Washington will foot a big portion of the bill for an expected 2,000 international monitors, and for much of the aid for refugees. Some put the total price at $500 million -- a lot for an underdeveloped, rural province about the size of Connecticut.
There are many reasons, of course, beyond the crises he creates that make Mr. Milosevic the man to deal with in Belgrade. For more than a decade, he has been the master manipulator of Serbian politics, and his political machine remains in firm control of the state-run press and broadcast media. Whatever horror officials in Washington express about his appeals to crude nationalism, it is depressingly clear that he has a lot of material to work with when he stirs ethnic passions: a distrustful culture built on long-held sagas of martyrdom. But to the West, Mr. Milosevic goes out of his way to present himself as less extreme than some others. To prove the point, he has chosen as his coalition partner Vojislav Seselj, who is even more of a nationalist and who has led a charge against "traitors" in the independent media and universities.
Still, does the West really have to play Mr. Milosevic's game? Is it time to think about whether -- and how -- he could be displaced as Serbia's leader? These questions are being increasingly raised in the aftermath of the Kosovo agreement.
"There needs to be a policy review that emphasizes ways of getting rid of Milosevic," said David L. Phillips, the executive director of the International Conflict Resolution Program at Columbia University and who visited Kosovo last month. "To have to go back to Belgrade while Milosevic holds court is no longer tenable."
Mr. Phillips says the United States can shape its policies so that Mr. Milosevic is weakened, not strengthened, and he maintains that one of the weakest chinks in Mr. Milosevic's armor is the existence of a United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague. "It is time for Louise Arbour to make a move against Milosevic and other Yugoslav officials," said Mr. Phillips, referring to the tribunal's chief prosecutor. "At this juncture there should be plenty of evidence and eyewitnesses to crimes against humanity by forces under the control of Mr. Milosevic."
Many pro-Western Serbs in Belgrade who oppose the Milosevic regime, like Srbobran Brankovic, a leading Serbian pollster, agree that the possibility of prosecution at The Hague could be turned to the West's advantage as it struggles to contain Mr. Milosevic's ambitions. He said a major motivation for Mr. Milosevic's agreement to sign the Dayton agreement on Bosnia three years ago was his calculation that, as a guarantor of the peace, he would not be made a target of the tribunal.
 
Playing to Fear
"I think he has an abnormal fear of the tribunal," the Serbian pollster said. "People in his circle said that when it was first mentioned that he might be tried in The Hague, that he was in a panic."
Mr. Milosevic's popularity at home is not quite what it is advertised abroad. His personal approval rating in Serbia has slid from a high of 40 percent in the early 1990's to 20 percent today.
Mr Brankovic and other pro-Western Serbs say they are not persuaded by the argument that the only alternative to Mr. Milosevic is Mr. Seselj, who enjoys about a 16 percent approval rating. There are, he says, substantial independent voices of moderation that need to be encouraged in Serbia's universities, in its independent media, in its trade unions and among its few struggling entrepreneurs -- even in the army.
Mr. Milosevic, who relies on the Interior Ministry's well-paid police force to protect him and to repress opponents, is not well liked in the Yugoslav Army; it is underpaid and has lost all the battles that he sent it into in the last eight years. This feeling was surprisingly evident in remarks last week by the army's chief of staff, Gen. Momcilo Perisic, who rose through the ranks during the glory days of Marshal Tito.
"Many leadership members have subjected everything to their own interests," General Perisic said in what seemed a veiled reference to Mr. Milosevic. "The Serbs have been at war since 1991 and we still don't have an ally. We were never this isolated and we were never without allies."
How to capitalize on these signs of dissatisfaction is the challenge.
In many quarters in the West, the notion of lightening the financial and investment sanctions that have been placed on Serbia is heresy, a sign of caving in to Mr. Milosevic. But educated Serbs who would like to see Mr. Milosevic disappear argue that the sanctions actually play into his hands by allowing him to argue that the wicked West is responsible for a catastrophic drop in living standards. The sanctions also encourage a pirate economy in which a tight circle of Milosevic cronies get all the spoils. And barriers to international travel fall especially hard on Western-oriented Serbs, rather than on Mr. Milosevic's rural supporters.
But given the West's pattern of letting Mr. Milosevic play out his hand, there is not much optimism among educated Serbs in Belgrade that the game will change very soon. They note the three-year time frame for the interim political status of Kosovo agreed to in the negotiations with the United States. "He will say I'm the guarantor of the peace and security in the region, and the West will say 'yes,' " said Mr. Brankovic.
Some diplomats in the Western embassies here are more cynically optimistic, however. They point out that instead of operating on a land-for-peace concept, Mr. Milosevic operates on a land-for-power principle. Thus, he gave up his fight for Slovenia, then Croatia, then Bosnia, but retained power as leader of a truncated Yugoslavia dominated by Serbia. In time, given the realities in Kosovo, where the majority ethnic Albanians are struggling for independence, he will also lose Kosovo, these diplomats say. Montenegro could follow, if Mr. Milosevic chooses to provoke a crisis there. At that rate, Mr. Milosevic is likely one day to wind up king of a suburb of Belgrade, still in power but of no relevance to the United States.

HEADLINE: New Technology Turns Useless Agricultural Byproducts Into Fuel for Autos

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: JENNINGS, La., Oct. 20

 BODY:
The plant was opened in 1977 to refine crude oil into gasoline, but when that proved unprofitable, it was converted in 1981 to run on molasses, and then in 1987, on grain. Bankruptcy followed.
Now, with rust on its tanks and pipes and grass growing through the gravel on its paths, construction workers are converting it yet again, to make fuel alcohol from agricultural garbage. 
 The plant's product, ethanol, which can be blended with gasoline to power cars and trucks or used on its own to power modified vehicles, has been produced around the country for years using corn and wheat and other high-quality, high-cost ingredients, but never with economic success. But the new owners of the plant here, BC International Corporation, with a subsidy from the United States Energy Department and help from a genetically engineered, patented type of bacteria, hope they are on the cusp of a new era.
"It is a bio-refinery," said Stephen J. Gatto, president and chief executive of the company. Exactly 25 years after the beginning of the Arab oil embargo, the Energy Department believes that Mr. Gatto's company may have a way to replace crude oil with garbage. BC International will be the first to try on a commercial scale.
"The input costs are close to zero," said Dan W. Reicher, Assistant Secretary of Energy. "In some cases they are less than zero, because people are paying to get rid of these materials." And if it works, he said, the technology could also reduce the accumulation of gases in the atmosphere that are thought to cause climate change, and could lower smog.
The plant here in this south-central Louisiana town will run on bagasse, a part of the sugar cane plant usually considered useless, as well as on rice hulls, a currently useless part of the rice plant. Later, it may digest sawdust as well.
Around the country, energy experts have their eyes on clippings from suburban lawns, prairie grasses and other woody materials, as fuel for the new process. "It's a lot cheaper to grow wood and grass than corn," said John E. Ferrell, director of the Office of Fuels Development at the Energy Department.
In the current generation of ethanol plants, the fuel is the corn kernel; plants using the new technology could digest the cob and the stalk as well, Mr. Ferrell said.
These materials are made of cellulose, which contains large amounts of sugar, the basic ingredient required for alcohol production. But the sugar in cellulose is in a chemical form that traditional fermentation processes, which use yeast, cannot digest.
BC's plant uses the KO11 bacteria, also used in the pharmaceutical industry, to break down the sugars.
The natural bacteria on which KO11 is based likes to eat sugars and produces a chemical called acetic acid. But then came gene splicing. Dr. Lonnie Ingram, a microbiologist at the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, borrowed four genes from another organism, Zymomonas mobilis, to make the bacteria produce alcohol instead.
Around the country, researchers are working with Z. mobilis to find other approaches, but BC International's will be the first commercial plant to make ethanol from woody material. The plant will take about 18 months to build and will cost $90 million, including $11 million from the Energy Department.
Existing ethanol plants do little to save energy or reduce carbon build-up in the atmosphere. They can use up to seven gallons of oil or its energy equivalent to produce eight gallons of ethanol, experts say. The energy is used by the coal in power plants and diesel fuel in tractors that plant, fertilize and harvest the corn, and in petroleum-based fertilizer. But using waste for fuel -- especially waste that might otherwise be burned and in the process dump carbon dioxide back into the air -- could allow production of seven gallons of ethanol from one gallon of oil.
And whatever the feedstock, whether trees or grasses, using it makes room for new growth, which will draw carbon back out of the atmosphere. This would be true, backers point out, wherever ethanol from cellulose might catch on, in this country or abroad, especially the third world, where demand for motor fuel is rising.
In the United States, retail distribution of ethanol in its near-pure form -- a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent unleaded gasoline -- is minuscule. But it is more widely distributed as ETBE, a gasoline additive used to raise octane and to reduce carbon monoxide emissions. Ford and Chrysler expect to turn out hundreds of thousands of vehicles that can run on ethanol or gasoline, to take advantage of credits offered under the Federal fuel economy rules, so a market is growing.
The stumbling block has been price. To compete, ethanol has to cost about one-fourth less than gasoline, because it has less energy per gallon. BC International sees an initial niche for ethanol as the basic ingredient of ETBE; later, the company says, it could compete with gasoline directly.
What would help, experts say, is using ingredients that are available free, or that others will pay to dispose of. In California, one area has banned burning of rice straw because of air pollution, and that could be a potential fuel for an ethanol plant, Mr. Gatto said.
The plant here, on the banks of the Mermentau River, is designed to produce 20 million gallons a year -- less than a pint for every car in America -- but several others using cellulose are planned around the country. One company, Masada Resource, of Birmingham, Ala., says it will break ground next year on a plant in Middletown, N.Y., that will use the cellulose in household garbage. In that case, sales of ethanol will not turn a profit but will help offset the cost of garbage disposal, in a region where a large landfill is scheduled to close soon. It will not use KO11, but a different proprietary process for rendering the cellulose into digestible form.
If the new technology does not revolutionize the fuels business, it would not be the first time, as the plant here bears witness. "It all depends on how good these bugs are, and what the price of oil is," Mr. Reicher said.

HEADLINE: U.S. PLANS TO SEND BILLIONS TO SHIELD BRAZIL'S ECONOMY

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
The United States is preparing to commit American taxpayer funds as part of a lending program of at least $30 billion to try to insulate Brazil, and with it the rest of Latin America, from the worst effects of the financial turmoil circling the globe, according to American and foreign officials assembling the program.
Details of the American contribution, which is expected to total several billion dollars in direct aid or loan guarantees, have yet to be negotiated. But several Congressional leaders have been alerted to the likelihood that the Administration would have to act while the Congress is in recess. 
 This early warning from the Administration reflects memories of how Congress erupted with objections and hearings in 1995 when President Clinton committed $20 billion in American funds to the bailout of Mexico. But Administration officials said this week that their early soundings indicate that members of Congress are deeply concerned about preventing an economic collapse in Latin America that would resound in the United States, and thus they expect few objections.
The timing of an aid package for Brazil -- originally expected within the next few days -- is complicated by unexpected delays that have cropped up in dealing with the Brazilian Government. The Government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso faces politically risky gubernatorial elections on Sunday, which may well determine whether Brazil can execute an austerity program that is the key condition for the loans it is concurrently negotiating with the International Monetary Fund. Page 13.
The biggest role in the rescue program for Brazil will be taken by the International Monetary Fund, which said this week that it would contribute at least $15 billion -- and appears to be under pressure from the United States to do even more. Another $9 billion or so will come from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, and the remainder from the United States and other major industrial nations.
Germany and Japan, though, have been reluctant to take part, one American official noted, suggesting that Latin America is chiefly Washington's problem, not their own.
So far, American officials working behind the scenes to organize the aid package have said nothing in public about the details of plans for a direct contribution to Brazil.
"Brazil is very important to the economic well-being of the region, the United States and the international community, and all of us are very much focused on seeing how we can be helpful," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said on Friday.
But in a wide-ranging interview about the global economic turmoil, Mr. Rubin declined to say what strategy he would pursue in dealing with Brazil's problems and insisted that no decisions had been made about how the United States might contribute.
But he discussed Brazil as an opportunity to engage in the kind of preventive financial diplomacy that President Clinton advocated in speeches to the I.M.F. and the World Bank here three weeks ago. At the time, Mr. Clinton argued the fund should "provide contingent finance to help countries ward off global financial contagion" rather than wait for disaster to strike.
Direct American aid to Brazil would clearly send a symbolic message: that after a year of trying to manage the financial crisis through the monetary fund, the United States is now ready to put a limited amount of its own capital at risk to prevent further havoc -- not only for Brazil, but to stop chaos spreading to Argentina, Mexico and other countries that are major American trading partners.
That would be a change of strategy. So far, the United States has operated almost entirely through international financial institutions, chiefly the I.M.F. But it would also be a risky move for President Clinton, economically and politically.
Even though Congress objected to the $20 billion in American funds committed to the bailout of Mexico, it turned out that only $12 billion was ultimately needed, and it has since been paid back, with interest. But Mr. Rubin noted on Friday that "it's a very different environment now." Other Administration officials say they believe that there would be few objections in Congress to direct American participation in a Brazil bailout.
"I think there are a lot more people in Congress who are now scared to death by what's been happening in the markets, and what could happen in their own districts," a White House official said this week, "and they won't say much as long as they don't have to vote on it."
By acting soon to stabilize Latin America, the Administration is hoping to capitalize on two weeks of relative calm after the late-summer panic that engulfed Russia and, at its height, led to an outflow of a billion dollars a day from Brazil, for fear that it would be the next country forced to devalue its currency.
Whether this calm marks the beginning of a turnaround or just another pause in the wildfires that have erupted since Thailand's currency crisis in July 1997 is a matter of considerable debate. But many experts cite the confluence of several events that have reassured jittery investors around the world: two successive interest rate cuts in the United States, Japan's long-delayed move to prop up its banking system with $500 billion in taxpayer funds, and a steady strengthening of currencies in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, the first signs that investors may be preparing to return.
Always circumspect when it comes to commenting publicly on markets, Mr. Rubin acknowledged that "in the last several weeks there have been a number of significant, positive developments." But the former trader, burned during a 26-year career by many false market rallies, warned that "serious issues remain" and that "it will take some time for the world to work its way out" of what he has repeatedly called "the most serious international financial disruption of the last 50 years."
In fact, Mr. Rubin's aides are clearly nervous about the possibility of another outbreak that could set off a new round of panic, which has made it virtually impossible for many emerging-market countries to borrow money on world markets.
"Brazil and Japan are the two obvious tinderboxes," said Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management, who served as undersecretary of commerce for international affairs during Mr. Clinton's first term. "In Brazil, the issue is whether the package that is coming together will really be big enough to deal with an exploding debt problem. And in Japan the question is whether there is real reform that goes along with the money."
But after spending 18 months in frustrating negotiations with the Japanese, Mr. Rubin clearly senses that the United States has little leverage in Tokyo; its problems are chiefly rooted in political gridlock, not lack of resources.
In Brazil, though, the United States has a better chance of buying time and influencing an economic reform program, as long as it does not appear to be dictating terms publicly to Mr. Cardoso and his team.
But demonstrating economic support will probably require tapping the Exchange Stabilization Fund, created during the Roosevelt Administration to help stabilize the dollar. The money is under Mr. Rubin's control, with Presidential approval, and he reached into it to circumvent Congressional objections to aiding Mexico in 1995.
But the reaction was so strong -- for a time Congress restricted tapping the fund for international bailouts -- that Mr. Rubin has been extraordinarily cautious ever since.
He committed $3 billion in a "second line of defense" in emergency aid programs for Indonesia and South Korea last year, but no money was ultimately dispersed to either country. American officials said that South Korea did not need the extra help, and that the collapse of the Suharto Government in Indonesia so changed the political scene there that it would be too risky to offer direct American aid.
In the bailout of Russia -- whose economy collapsed after President Boris N. Yeltsin abandoned an agreement to reform the economy and dismissed the leading reformers -- the United States offered no direct help. Those events set off a panicked exit by investors from all emerging markets, and greatly worsened Brazil's troubles.
So far, Brazilian officials have successfully calmed the market by constantly talking about a forthcoming aid program from the I.M.F., convincing speculators that it would be dangerous to bet against the country. But at the same time, the Brazilian officials have maintained the pose that they do not really need the cash -- and are certainly in no hurry to get it.
American officials and top officials of the I.M.F. are clearly nervous, worried that the longer the negotiations drag on, the greater the risk that Brazil will be caught in another round of market turmoil.
"The Brazilians want everyone to think that it's all under control," said an investment banker involved in the talks. "But the fact is that there's still a real risk that sometime in the next 18 months the Government is going to be forced to devalue" its currency, which is pegged to the dollar, but adjusts about 7.5 percent a year in a carefully controlled fall. To prevent a sudden devaluation, the Brazilian Government has had to raise interest rates to more than 50 percent, choking off credit for most companies. Meanwhile, the country is slipping into recession.
The aid would buy time for the Brazilians, but it is contingent on Mr. Cardoso's success in persuading the legislature to end huge deficits, chiefly through unpopular cuts in social spending. The first deputy managing director for the International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, spent Friday in Brazil to review the country's austerity plan, expected to be announced after Sunday's elections but before the international package, to avoid the appearance that the global lender is dictating conditions to Brazil.
"Brazil has to do a lot," Mr. Fischer said last week before leaving on his trip. "In return, I expect the international community will make a large contribution."

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: NEW JERSEY;
Former Professor Makes Bid Against First-Term Congressman

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: LAWRENCE TOWNSHIP, N.J., Oct. 24

 BODY:
Rush Holt, the Democratic challenger in New Jersey's 12th Congressional District race, was at a union dinner here when Beverly Dey, a Ewing Township secretary, asked why the age when she would be eligible for Social Security benefits had risen to 66 from 65. She thought that was unfair.
After Mr. Holt replied that he would protect Social Security, Ms. Dey was asked whether his answer had won her over. "He answered part of my question," she said, "but I want to hear his opponent first before I make up my mind." 
 His opponent is the incumbent, Michael Pappas, a Republican from Rocky Hill. That Ms. Dey did not say "Mike" or "Mr. Pappas" to refer to the first-term Congressman -- the way New Jerseyans say "Christie" when they mean their Governor, Christine Todd Whitman -- could bolster the Democrat's hope that Mr. Pappas is not yet so well known that he is unbeatable.
The district was drawn to be a Republican stronghold, and even Mr. Holt, a Democrat from Pennington, concedes that he has an uphill climb. Without a strong turnout, he will lose, he tells his audiences.
The 12th District stretches from the Delaware River in the west to the Raritan Bay in the east, takes in nearly 60 towns and boroughs in five counties but no cities, and includes the university town of Princeton, the older Trenton suburbs of Lawrence and Ewing, the sheltered farms and villages of Hunterdon County and the retirement communities that are springing up out of the flat coastal plain toward the shore.
"It's a terrible district in which to campaign in," said Thomas B. Hartmann, a retired Rutgers University political science professor. "It's just spread all over the place."
The 12th is also New Jersey's most populous and fastest-growing district, and ranks first in the proportion of residents with college degrees, first in standardized high school test scores and second in per capita income. More than 60 percent of its voters are enrolled as independents, and the two major parties split the remainder. In 1996, 75 percent of the district's registered voters went to the polls.
Mr. Pappas, 38, carried the 12th in 1996, when the seat was vacant, by 10,000 votes, less than 1 percent of the total, and he did it in part by turning out his core supporters in the segments of the party opposed to abortion rights and gun control.
The Democrats went into this year's campaign hoping that Mr. Pappas would be vulnerable to being painted as too conservative for the district. But the Congressman has spent this campaign focusing on his arguments for lower and fairer taxes and avoiding the more hard-edged social issues that helped him win the first time.
At the annual dinner of the Delaware Township Republican Club in Hunterdon County on Thursday evening, for example, Mr. Pappas was asked whether his stands on abortion or gun control ever came up during this campaign. "Only when someone from the media asks about them," he said.
"The central issue of my campaign two years ago was and continues to be balancing the Federal budget and reducing the tax burden on people such as yourselves," Mr. Pappas told his friendly audience of Republicans.
Where Mr. Pappas focuses on only a few issues -- he also supports preserving open space, a goal that also protects property values -- Mr. Holt offers his audiences a menu of ideas, including gun control, preserving Social Security and the environment, and abortion rights. But in the last few weeks he has emphasized improving education and defending patients' rights against health maintenance organizations; the latter point brought a murmur of approval from residents of a retirement village in Monroe Township last week.
Mr. Holt, 50, often closes with an unusual concession in his appeal for supporters to turn out on Nov. 3. "With all this effort, with all the campaigning and the media, we are poised to have a narrow loss -- a narrow loss," he said. "The difference between a narrow loss and a narrow win is you."
Mr. Pappas, who first ran for elective office when he was in his early 20's, delivers his speeches in a matter-of-fact way, while Mr. Holt, a former assistant director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and a former physics professor, still tends to pause and hunt for thoughts before crowds.
"He's good," said Jim Schroeder, a Holt supporter and a lobbyist for the New Jersey Education Association, a teachers' union. "If anything, he's a little green, but people like that -- it's fresh."
David Rebovich, a political scientist at Rider University in Lawrenceville, sees it a little differently: "I think Holt is trying hard to translate his academic, professorial self into a more populist candidate, but he needs a little more time on the campaign trail to hone his arguments and to generate more enthusiasm as a plausible political leader."
In one regard, Mr. Holt is entirely a professional at politics: He has raised about $600,000, nearly as much as Mr. Pappas, tirelessly calling supporters and urging them to be willing to spend as much to support their values as Republicans are.
In the last two weeks of the campaign, much of Mr. Holt's money has gone into a sardonic radio and television campaign in which Mr. Pappas himself is a star. The advertisements include a memorable moment when the Congressman took the floor of the House over the summer to deliver a ditty of praise for Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, to the tune of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."
"Twinkle, twinkle, Kenneth Starr," Mr. Pappas recites, "now we see how brave you are."
The Congressman has called the Holt commercials negative.
"It's good -- it definitely throws Pappas on the defensive in the sense of asking him what he does with his time down there," said Ross K. Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers. But because Mr. Pappas is running on noncontroversial themes and no overarching issue is stirring the voters, who are increasingly concerned about economic instability, Professor Baker said he thinks that Mr. Pappas has the edge.
"Mr. Holt has put up a very spirited and aggressive campaign," he said, "but the fact is that Mr. Pappas was elected in 1996 and not much has changed since then to make people throw him out. And with the economic problems, the electorate seems to be as nervous as a Christmas goose, so I think this is a good year to bet on the incumbent."

HEADLINE: In the West Bank, Almost Zero Jubilation

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Yasir Arafat has a tough crowd to please.
After the interim peace accord was signed in Oslo in 1993, they took to the bustling streets here with olive branches, wrapping themselves in Palestinian flags, cheering and honking in what they believed would be a new era for Palestinians. 
 This morning, barely 12 hours after Mr. Arafat signed an agreement that promises the Palestinians what amounts to 40 percent of the West Bank, there were no parties here, no outbursts of pride, no euphoria.
It was just traffic as usual in this busy, cosmopolitan town, daily commerce interrupted by heated conversations about hopes raised and hopes dashed. Few wanted to admit what many said they did feel -- a leap in the heart, a flash of faith -- because they did not want to end up dupes of a peace effort they no longer trust.
"Look, we can't believe," said Fatmeh Jwailes, a mother of 10, as she shopped for wall-to-wall carpeting, wearing traditional Islamic dress. "Until I see with my own eyes that their promises are worth the ink they're written in, I don't want to get my hopes up."
If carried out, the agreement could transform the nature of the Palestinian entity, making it larger and more autonomous. It would grant the Palestinians complete control over a sizable chunk of territory, much of it contiguous, and create safe-passage corridors between the West Bank and Gaza, linking the two axes of the Palestinian world here. It would create a Palestinian airport and an industrial zone in Gaza.
But to Palestinians, from the elite strata of the intellectual class to the angry ranks of the refugee camps, the "if" is a big one, and implementation is the key. The agreement signed at the White House on Friday is mostly a reiteration of actions already promised, in accords signed in Oslo in 1993 and 1995, and never undertaken. This agreement sets a precise timetable for Israeli troop withdrawal in exchange for specific Palestinian steps to eradicate terrorism. And, unlike the Oslo agreements, it is a trilateral one, with the Americans playing guarantor, policeman and financier, using promises of financial aid to both sides. These are distinctions, and they might make a huge difference, Palestinians say -- or they could crumble.
"The whole thing was like pulling teeth, so you hesitate to have confidence that there will be follow-up," said Hanan Ashrawi, a prominent Palestinian academic and member of the legislative council. "Only the absolutely naive would be carried away with the spectacle of the signing."
Egypt cautiously welcomed the accord, echoing on a state level what the Palestinians were saying on the street: not only that implementation is all, but that there are thorny issues yet to be resolved.
As Foreign Minister Amr Moussa put it: "The accord is one step on the right path toward restoring Palestinian land and negotiating fundamental issues, topped by Jerusalem and the Palestinian right to self-determination. The road is still long for a comprehensive peace."
In a village outside Ramallah, said Raafat Hamdan, 17, who works as a day laborer in Israel, he watched the White House ceremony on satellite television with his extended family. They sipped sweet, hot tea and munched on green grapes, speechless until the papers were actually signed. Then, he said, there were some sniffles, and he himself became choked up to think that the whole world was watching what he believed was Palestinian history being made.
"I am young so I like to have hope," he said. "Maybe with everyone watching them like hawks, the Israelis will behave. I think that if there are no suicide bomb attacks, they will, because they must be tired of the whole fight, too."
After the signing of the 1993 accord, the Palestinians, particularly those in the Gaza Strip, experienced hardships they did not anticipate. Owing to a series of terrorist attacks, the Israelis imposed frequent border closings, denied many work permits and tightened security at checkpoints. Many Palestinians felt the lands they had been granted -- mostly cities -- were bubbles that they were trapped in.
"Forget about the larger peace," said Moussa Zubedi, 27, who is unemployed. "Palestine is my homeland, and I want the right to go from one place to another without restrictions. So let them do just that, the safe-passage thing."
At a busy intersection, a crowd gathered to debate, as vendors poured shots of Turkish coffee.
An older man, Khalil Abi Hawa, chastised the younger ones for not having vision. "This is a step toward getting freedom and then independence," he said. "Even the details are astonishing; maybe you are too young to realize. Now we will get an airport, a Palestinian airport!"
He added, "We will have borders, then a state. You guys must keep your eye on the prize."
A taxi driver rolled his eyes at this. "Where is freedom if you can't go to pray in Jerusalem?" he asked.
The young men criticized Mr. Arafat for making concessions. They said he should have demanded that more Palestinian prisoners be released, and that he should have refused to convene the Palestinian legislature to amend the covenant that calls for Israel's destruction -- an amendment that Mr. Arafat has long claimed was already made. And some wondered if the promised crackdown on terrorism would give the Palestinian Authority license to crack down on dissent.
In Gaza, during the signing, the Palestinian Authority detained 11 journalists who had come to watch the ceremony with Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the fundamentalist Islamic Hamas movement. They were moved from his home, the authorities said, because Sheik Yassin's negative comments were "against the Palestinian Authority policy."
Palestinian and Israeli political experts noted that Mr. Arafat emerged from the nine days at the Wye Plantation in Maryland with what looked like a closer relationship with the Americans. As the Israeli party packed bags, threatened walkouts and delayed the final signing ceremony, he took on the air of a dignified elder statesman, even an insider.
On the street, the Palestinians noticed, too. "He doesn't look like a revolutionary anymore, despite the clothes," said Bilal Abedrobu, who is unemployed. "He looks like one of them. It makes you think that this is a peace between individuals and not between peoples."
Standing under the dresses that hung outside his clothing store, Ahmad Alfar watched the heated debate with a half-smile and sad eyes. "Why not be proud when you see the opportunity to get more land, to have our prisoners freed?" he asked. "We have been living in darkness, and this is a light that brings us back hope."

HEADLINE: In Final Stretch, Parties Turn Up Ad Blitz to Prod Voters

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 24

 BODY:
The campaign of 1998 entered an intense final 10-day stretch today as Democrats and Republicans turned their energies to vast telephone, mailing and advertising drives to prod millions of loyalists to the polls.
Though many Democrats no longer fear that their candidates will be sullied by the White House scandal -- some are even trying to turn it to their advantage -- politicians and party officials around the country say their biggest threat is that Republicans are tapping into a huge financial advantage to dominate the airwaves with commercials. 
"They're carpet-bombing right now with negative ads in most of the country," said Craig Smith, the White House political director. "The amount of money they have is obscene. The question becomes: How well are our guys holding up?"
From Senate races in California and New York to contests for governor in Maryland and Alabama to House matchups in every region, candidates are so evenly matched that officials in both parties say the outcomes hinge on a basic tactic: persuading their people to vote. That is particularly true given that in this time of relative economic contentment, compelling national themes have eluded both parties, leaving most candidates clashing over local issues and personalities.
Unlike the 1996 elections, when Speaker Newt Gingrich was the No. 1 villain in Democratic commercials, his face has hardly surfaced in advertisements this year.
Yet much of the activity is not on the airwaves but on the ground. In probably the largest turnout effort of any state, the California Republican Party today began making three and a half million phone calls to reliable Republican voters, urging them to vote on Nov. 3. Democrats have begun mailing slate cards to three million party members in California, urging them to vote the party line. The mailings close with a reminder of the White House scandal, but with a twist: "End the Washington witch hunt. Vote Democratic. Tell the Republicans to get back to the business of running the country!"
Nationally, the parties seem fairly evenly matched on the ground because get-out-the-vote efforts by many unions have helped the Democrats compensate for the Republicans' financial advantage.
But the battle over the airwaves is lopsided: Republican organizations have collected as much as $300 million in the run-up to the elections, edging out Democrats by more than $100 million. In the final week, Republicans will channel at least $10 million more into advertising than Democrats, according to estimates by officials on both sides. Democratic officials said that in some states they had so little to spend -- and waited so long to buy time -- that some television stations were turning them away because all the advertising time had already been bought by Republicans.
The financial disparity is particularly disconcerting for Democratic challengers for the House, who have a much greater struggle raising money than incumbents do. By contrast, many Republican challengers for the House who are considered long shots are being lavished with resources from the national party.
"This is an issueless year that has been driven by the good economy and the dominance of the Lewinsky scandal," said Mitchell Bainwol, chief of staff of the Republican National Committee. "With no other issues getting traction, we are left with a very microcampaign in the last 10 days, where Republican advantages in dollars, intensity and individual candidates will enable us to prevail."
With the monthslong distraction of the scandal having faded, at least for now, candidates and voters finally seem to be engaging each other. In some ways, the dynamic this year is like a British election: it is being fiercely fought in only two weeks.
Most strategists in both parties agree that Republicans will have the upper hand on Election Day. The big question, Democrats say, is how successfully they can contain their losses.
Few analysts are forecasting wild swings in either direction. Most Republicans and Democrats predict that Republicans will build on their thin 11-seat majority in the House; many say that more likely than not, the gains will be no more than a dozen seats. In the Senate, Republicans expect to pick up seats, although it is widely viewed as an uphill -- though entirely possible -- challenge to win a net gain of five seats. That would give Republicans the 60 votes needed to cut off filibusters by Democrats.
Though there are many competitive races for governor, strategists on both sides do not predict much shift in the dominance of Republicans, who control 32 governorships and could pick up a seat or two more. The overwhelming advantages of incumbent Republican Governors in Texas, Pennsylvania and Michigan -- who have extensive and powerful political organizations -- are expected to give an important lift to Republicans in tight House races in those states.
No matter what happens in other races for governor, Democrats will declare a huge victory if polls hold up and Lieut. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, defeats Dan Lungren for governor in California. The California governorship, which Republicans have controlled for 16 years, is the biggest prize of the season; the winner will preside over the redrawing of the state's Congressional boundaries after the 2000 census, affecting the composition of 52 House districts.
Warming up the audience for Mr. Davis at an event this week in Riverside, Calif., Joe Baca, a Democrat running for State Senate, implored a labor audience to vote for Mr. Davis for the sake of other candidates on the ticket -- and the party's future.
"What the other side is trying to do is to keep us from the polls and voting," Mr. Baca said. "We need him at the top of the ticket. Because if we don't have him, what's going to happen to labor?"
But while the state's Democratic candidate for governor seems comfortably ahead, another Democrat running statewide, Senator Barbara Boxer, trailed the Republican nominee, Matt Fong, in the polls for weeks. By the end of the week, polls indicated that she had closed the gap. That underscored how contests, at least in this state, seem to be turning on the characteristics of individual candidates and not on partisan advantages.
"You're going to see a very mixed result on Nov. 3," said David Axelrod, a veteran Democratic strategist in Chicago. "And both parties are going to have something to crow about."
Even without national themes, the outcome will carry important national implications: it will be interpreted as a referendum on whether the nation wants Congress to move forward with an impeachment inquiry against President Clinton.
For months, the prevailing question among politicians was how much the scandal would affect the elections. At first, Republicans seized on President Clinton's affair -- and tried to make character an issue in races around the country. Then, after fleeing from the matter for months, some Democrats embraced the scandal, asserting that voters would turn against the Republican-controlled Congress for approving an open-ended impeachment inquiry. Though the events in Washington seem to have heightened partisanship on both sides, most candidates in both parties are steering clear of the issue.
No Republicans are running commercials linking their opponents to the scandal; only a few Democrats -- all challengers -- are mentioning the impeachment inquiry in their advertisements. On Friday, Christine Kehoe, a Democrat from San Diego in an uphill effort to oust Representative Brian P. Bilbray, a Republican, unveiled a commercial about impeachment.
"Partisan bickering -- politicians no longer in touch," the narrator says. "Brian Bilbray is doing things the Washington way. Bilbray voted for impeachment hearings -- gridlock that could drag on for years."
Only weeks ago, Republicans boasted that Mr. Clinton was the best thing to happen to them. Indeed, month after month, the Lewinsky inquiry obscured the Democrats' efforts to take the offensive on the issues.
"We were calling him the motivator-in-chief," said Mike Madrid, political director of the California Republican Party. But, explaining that the outcome here will have little to do with Mr. Clinton, he added: "This election is going to come down to three things: turnout, turnout and turnout. Whoever gets their base to the polls is going to win."
Art Torres, chairman of California's Democratic Party, said he would decide in the next day or two whether to attack Republicans as overreaching on impeachment as part of the party's telephone efforts to get out the vote. But he said he was inclined not to. "I don't think it's as strong a message as where the Democrats stand on issues," he said.
Even with the mammoth drives, which include radio pitches tailored to particular voters like Hispanics or blacks, experts predict that turnout will be especially low this year for lack of issues that excite voters. The outcome is likely to be decided by a small core of people at the extremes of each party who usually vote no matter what.
"I believe a lot of these races will be decided by 1,000 or 2,000 votes," said Representative Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. "This is the ultimate roller coaster; you don't know whether the car is going to be up or down on Election Day."
The voter programs here are being mimicked on a smaller scale in districts around the country, like in Allentown, Pa., where State Senator Roy C. Afflerbach is in fierce competition with Patrick J. Toomey, a restaurant owner, for an open House seat. In the past week alone, the Afflerbach campaign has made more than 40,000 telephone calls through paid and volunteer efforts. Prospective voters are reminded that Mr. Afflerbach, a Democrat, has a "patient protection plan to rein in the big H.M.O.'s and make health care more affordable."
In another competitive House race, in a Florida district that extends from Jacksonville to Orlando, Representative Corrine Brown, a Democrat, has sent out campaign mailers that offer voters rides to the polls. The turnout efforts by her opponent, Bill Randall, have been more problematic because he enraged many black leaders by declaring that he had written off black voters and was focusing his attention on white voters. He sought to clarify himself by insisting that he was not writing off black voters. Ms. Brown is black.
Around the country, this much is clear: the deluge of commercials in recent days has brought a sharp, and decidedly negative, edge to the discourse.
Though Republicans are not directly mentioning the scandal in their advertisements, they are still lambasting the President. This week, for instance, the Republican Party unleashed a 30-second commercial in 39 Congressional districts.
"Remember the double talk?" the announcer asks.
Then, flashing on the screen, are snippets of videotape of Mr. Clinton offering different assessments over time of how long it would take to balance the budget. "We should balance the budget . . . in 7 years . . . in 10 years . . . in 8 years . . . so we're between 7 and 9 now," he says in footage that Republicans used for commercials two years ago.
Republican strategists said the "double talk" line was a subtle reminder of Mr. Clinton's denials of an affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "AT STAKE: A Fate of Senate Filibusters"
Thirty-four of the 100 seats in the Senate are up for election this year. Republicans hope to increase their majority from 55 to 60, enough to override filibusters, long speeches used to delay passage of a bill.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Champion Yankees Won't Be Taking a Page from the Marlins

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
A year ago this week the Florida Marlins executed a double play unique in baseball history. First they won the World Series and then they planned the instant demolition of the World Series champions. Fortunately for baseball and its fans, that scenario will not occur this year.
The Marlins' brain trust waited only four days from the last game of the World Series to lay the groundwork for the destruction of the 1997 champions. The Yankees' strategic planners won't take much longer than that to lay the groundwork for moves they hope will turn the 1998 champions into 1999 champions. 
 The Marlins' method has become one of the ugliest developments in recent history.
"I don't have second thoughts, but I have done a lot of thinking about it," Commissioner Bud Selig said when asked if the Marlins should have been prevented from dismantling their team. "While I still understand the reasons for it, I wish even more fervently that it hadn't happened."
Marlins players and fans, drastically reduced though their number may be, also wish it happened. The Marlins shed 68 percent of their players and lost 26 percent of their attendance.
As astute a businessman as H. Wayne Huizenga, soon to be the former owner, is supposed to be, he scuttled two economic opportunities with his demolition project. He lost out on the attendance increase that invariably follows a championship, and he lost the chance to generate public support for a new ball park.
His actions left even his friends wondering why he bothered spending the money he did, knowing how much he would lose and how fragile the chances were for getting to the World Series in the first place.
George Steinbrenner and the Yankees, on the other hand, are not going anywhere; nor are they going to embarrass baseball. In contrast to Huizenga, Steinbrenner will do what he thinks has to be done to repeat.
"It's the nature of people in our business to treat every year different," Randy Smith, the Detroit Tigers' general manager, said, discussing the Yankees and next season. "You look at their club and what they still have in their farm system, and they have a terrific situation. Look at the balance of the club up and down the lineup. Look at the pitching depth. They're going to be awful tough in the foreseeable future."
In addition, Smith said, if the Yankees lose a player, they can go out on the market and replace him.
The Yankees can also pursue a player without losing one. Speculation has sprung up, for example, on whether or not the Yankees might go after Mo Vaughn, a free agent, and trade their incumbent first baseman, Tino Martinez, even though he has led the team in runs batted in each of his three years with the Yankees.
The speculation about Vaughn has been fueled by the close relationship his agent, Tom Reich, has with Steinbrenner.
Offering his personal view of the matter, Reich said: "The Yankees, aside from having a great team, have the best chemistry team I've seen since the 1970's. It has as much a bearing on their success as their talent. I would think they'd like to try to keep that team together. The Yankees have a very good first baseman who's a terrific guy and a part of this chemistry."
The makeup of the team was reflected in the the way the Yankees played on a daily basis. Barely two months into the season, they had an 11-game lead with a 46-13 record, and they could have coasted the rest of the way. But they played as though every day they were a game out of first and had to win that day to gain a share of the top spot. They compiled a 68-35 record (.660) the rest of the way.
Compare the rest of their season with the experience of the 1984 Detroit Tigers and the 1990 Cincinnati Reds.
The Tigers started 35-5, then tailed off to 69-53 (.566) the rest of the way. The Reds began 33-12, then struggled at 58-59, a losing record, through the remainder of the season.
"I'm amazed at how they go about it more than how they do it," Sparky Anderson, who managed the 1984 Tigers, said during the World Series. The former manager is known for hyperbole, but in assessing the Yankees he didn't need it.
"This is one of the very best teams I've ever watched," he said. "You never remember walking into the Yankees clubhouse and seeing so many professionals. I would have been very proud to manage that team because they are professional-acting people. This team has done baseball proud, along with McGwire and Sosa. They've contributed so much to the whole game. At times I'm overwhelmed watching them."
 
Emotional Ceremony
When Bud Selig presented George Steinbrenner with the World Series championship trophy, the commissioner reduced the owner to tears. Steinbrenner later explained that he goes so far back with Selig, to 1973, that the emotion of the moment just overcame him. Selig said he, too, felt it.
"I've been through a lot with George," Selig said. "There have been, as he said, a lot of ups and downs. But through it all we've been able to maintain a remarkably good relationship. When I saw him and he saw me, and given the context of history, it was a very emotional scene."
One of Selig's favorite moments with Steinbrenner occurred in 1978 when the Yankees played in Milwaukee in the last series before the All-Star Game. Graig Nettles, the Yankees' third baseman, was hurt and didn't play in the last two games of the series, but he nevetheless wanted to play in the All-Star Game.
Steinbrenner felt that if he couldn't play for the Yankees, he couldn't play in the All-Star Game. During the Sunday afternoon game, Mickey Morabito, the team's public relations director, sought out the owner in Selig's box and told him reporters wanted to talk to him.
"Tell them I'm not here," Steinbrenner barked.
The only problem was Selig's box was right next to the press box, and it was encased in enough glass that Steinbrenner was easily seen by all.
 
Series Share: $312,137.33
 Based on post-season shares voted by the Yankees, a full winning World Series share will be worth $312,137.33 to the 41 members of the Yankees who are entitled to or were voted full shares. That total, swelled by an increase in post-season ticket prices, is a record, surpassing the $216,870 the Yankees received in 1996.
Homer Bush ($178,900), Jorge Posada ($250,000) and Ramiro Mendoza ($275,000) will receive more money from their full shares than they earned in salaries this season. The 55 percent share Mike Buddie will get based on the 99 days he spent with the Yankees in 6 separate visits will compute to $1,675.53 more than the major league minimum salary.
 
All Teams Equal to Williams
 If any of the Yankees' potential free agents leaves them, Bernie Williams is the most likely candidate. Given the opportunity last week to say the Yankees are his first choice, Williams declined.
"I'll say it's probably about as good as any other team right now," Williams said, then a minute later added, "We have had a lot of history of past things that have happened between both parties."
He alluded to his acerbic negotiating history with the Yankees, beginning in 1995 when the Yankees renewed his contract. That act has been a cloud hovering over all subsequent negotiations.
Earlier in the year, people throughout baseball speculated that the Arizona Diamondbacks already had an understanding that Williams would join them after this season. But now word among some front-office executives is that Jerry Colangelo, the expansion team's controlling owner, is reluctant to pay the price even though his manager, Buck Showalter, dearly wants Williams.
The Texas Rangers and the Detroit Tigers also could pursue the American League batting champion and Gold Glove winner. The Tigers thought they had Williams last November in a trade that they said the Yankees reneged on.
"That's the type of guy that certainly creates a lot of excitement if and when he's a free agent," said Randy Smith, the Tigers' general manager, who is prepared to pursue a big-name player, a departure from Detroit's past practice.
The team's strategy is to add star-type players this winter and next in advance of its move into a new park for the 2000 season. "We're going to have a little more money to spend," Smith said. "We feel we're getting closer to the point where we can try to fill in the last few holes.
 
A Dodger Memory
 He had told the story many times before, but the time and place were appropriate for relating it one more time.
When Davey Johnson was introduced as the Los Angeles Dodgers' manager Friday, he recalled the 1966 World Series in which he played against the Dodgers for Baltimore.
"I got a base hit off a guy named Koufax," Johnson said. "I was the last guy to get a hit off him. I was very proud. I saw him the next year at Vero Beach. I said, 'Sandy, I guess you know who got the last hit off you.' He said, 'Yeah, that's why I retired.'

Asian Ripples: Headquarters Buildings for Sale

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
ASIA'S economic turmoil is having a ripple effect on the New Jersey commercial marketplace, where a number of Japanese and Korean companies are selling buildings they own.
Eight such buildings, totaling nearly 1 million square feet, have recently been sold, are under contract or are on the market to be sold. They are headquarters buildings and office/warehouse/distribution complexes ranging in size from 70,000 to 200,000 square feet. Most are in Bergen, Hudson and Morris Counties. 
 Among them is a 72,000-square-foot building 200 yards from the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee that Nissin, a Japanese food company, sold three weeks ago. And Samsung, the Korean conglomerate , is under contract to sell its 147,000-square-foot headquarters building in Ridgefield Park.
James Yamauchi, a broker at the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield, the national commercial brokerage, who works with Asian firms, said the sales activity follows a national trend.
"The news coming from Asia is not good and coupled with some business sectors, like electronics, companies are not doing well," he said. "They want to take advantage of the United States real estate market to take out the equity from their buildings and put it elsewhere."
These companies purchased their buildings during a healthy time in Asia, which is known in Japan as "the bubble era," Mr. Yamauchi said, adding that "now the bubble has burst." He said institutional investors disposed of their properties earlier last year and in the summer user-owners started to follow suit.
"The sale of these properties will not have a meaningful impact on the overall market," said Steven M. Frank, senior vice president at the Teaneck office of CB Richard Ellis, another national commercial brokerage. "But it is creating a shift in ownership, providing a wave of opportunity for investors."
Of the list compiled by the brokerage of 320 major Japanese firms and 225 major Korean firms in New Jersey, Mr. Frank said, most had their businesses in leased buildings.
The sales activity by Asian firms, like all sales in the 11-county northern New Jersey market, is undergoing an adjustment in the aftermath of the stock market's roller-coaster ride in recent weeks. That has slowed the flow of money for acquisitions, especially for buyers who relied on Wall Street capital, such as real estate investment trusts, whose stock prices have deflated.
The withdrawal from the market by investment banks such as CS First Boston and Lehman Brothers as well as the general retreat of other lenders and the retrenchment of the commercial-mortgage-backed securities market has hampered the ability of private investors to buy existing buildings. .
THE investment banks were the S & L's savings-and-loan institutions of the 90's," said Douglas H. Haynes, president of the Alexander Summer brokerage, headquartered in Paramus. They have disappeared, leaving the market "in a situation of having less leverage," he explained, adding that the result was that sellers, including Asian companies, were being pressured by buyers to reduce asking prices. Other brokers agreed.
Most brokers said prices could fall by 5 to 15 percent, with marginal Class B and large trophy buildings hardest hit. Mid-sized Class A buildings are expected to hold their value.
Still projections are the sales market in New Jersey will end 1998 on a high note, albeit not as high as initially expected. There will be a total of $2.75 billion in building sales, $1.7 billion of which has closed or is under contract, up from $2.2 billion last year, but $500 million short of original estimates, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
"Though the capital market is funky, there are still plenty of sellers," said Andrew J. Merin, executive director of the Financial Services Group at the brokerage's East Rutherford office.
And while pricing is being adjusted the universe of players is also changing, he said. REIT's have tempered their aggressive appetites of a few months ago and are being replaced by, among others, pension funds, well-heeled private developers and European investors, Mr. Merin added.
Other good news for sellers is that vacancy rates remain low and rental rates are stable. As of the third quarter, overall average asking rents were $20.85, up from $20.09 the same time in 1997 and rents for Class A space, averaged $25.92, up from $24.43 last year, reported Cushman & Wakefield.
With demand still outstripping supply and some companies continuing to expand "the nuts and bolts of the real estate market remain strong," said Jonathan Schultz, president of the Schultz Organization, a Woodbridge-based commercial real estate services firm.
"This is a financial-market correction not a real-estate crisis," said Mr. Frank, of CB Richard Ellis.
Though the price adjustments may cause some sellers to pull back others will continue to sell, including those Asian companies, on whom the pressure to dispose of their properties are more acute.
MR. FRANK said he was advising clients who can afford to wait to do so for the next 60 to 90 days "to see where interest rates settle." For those "who need to sell to send money back home" the strategy is "to be very selective of the buyers they go into contract with," he added.
Mr. Yamauchi, of Cushman & Wakefield, said he was telling clients that "if they are interested in selling to sell now and if it is a substantial offer to take it." While the sales activity of Asian firms may not accelerate, it is expected to continue at least into the beginning of next year, he said, noting that demand remains strong for the commercial buildings the companies are selling.
Nissin sold its one-time American headquarters in Fort Lee, "because it was an opportune time to sell" and the sale provided a way for the company "to redirect funds into other businesses," said Mr. Frank, who represented Nissin in the transaction.
The sale price for the building, now 90 percent occupied by multiple tenants, was $7.5 million. Mr. Frank said the company "was fortunate because its buyer locked in financing before the credit crunch."
The buyer was Lincoln Property Company, a developer based in Dallas with offices in Edison. "It fits in with our strategy of buying smaller Class B properties" in prime suburban markets, said Michael A. Taylor, a Lincoln vice president. Within the last seven weeks the firm has closed on half of the one million square feet of office space it had put under contract since the summer, Mr. Taylor said, noting that the company's financial partner is the Whitehall Fund of Goldman Sachs.
"Our goal is to buy underperforming properties, turn them around and sell them at a profit in a rising market," Mr. Taylor said. With the Fort Lee building, he said, rents, now at below market rates could be brought up to market levels as leases expire over the next few years.
While the spigot has been turned off for awhile on sources of public capital, Mr. Taylor said, his company "is still out there looking for diamonds in the rough" and sellers, including Asian companies, are still selling.
Some firms are also looking to sell their buildings and lease back all or part of the space. A number of brokers say that Samsung wants to lease back more than half the space of its building in Ridgefield Park, which is under contract to be sold to Wellsford Commercial Properties Trust, a REIT based in Chatham. Wellsford refused to comment on specifics of the deal.
Richard R. Previdi, chief operating and investment officer at Wellsford, said his company had slowed its acquisition pace in recent months because, though it had access to financing, it was unwilling to pay the inflated prices for properties. But with prices adjusting "our investment partners see now as a better time to buy," he said.
Mr. Previdi added that he expects pricing to improve further, from the potential buyer's point of view, closer to the end of the year as sellers become more motivated to sell. And for some Asian sellers, he said, the motivation doubles.

HEADLINE: SoHo, TriBeCa And Now Dumbo?

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
IT took David C. Walentas 17 years to win permission from New York City to begin the residential conversion of a muscular old industrial complex on the Brooklyn waterfront.
With permission in hand, it took him only seven months to convert the first building, 1 Main Street, whose mansard-topped, four-faced clock tower holds its own as a skyline icon between the approaches to the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges. 
 Clearly, Mr. Walentas is in a hurry.
Now 60 years old, he has waited since 1981 for the political and economic stars to align that would allow him to redevelop the area once called Gairville (after the Robert Gair Company, a maker of cardboard boxes and paper bags) and now known as Dumbo (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass).
"It's like SoHo was 25 years ago," Mr. Walentas said. And he should know. Among his earliest investments in the 1970's were buildings on Broome and Spring Streets. "We went from SoHo to NoHo to Dumbo," he said.
In 10 buildings that Mr. Walentas owns, with 2 million square feet of space, are high-end apartments, artists' studios, offices, factories and storerooms. His vision -- by no means universally shared or admired -- is to supplement these with a waterfront entertainment, retail and recreation center, largely for Brooklyn residents, with a marina, a historic carousel, movie theaters, a hotel, many stores and plenty of parking in multilevel garages.
Like any precinct in transition, Dumbo shows different facets to different viewers. A newcomer might see it as raw, stark, desolate; a Depression-era Berenice Abbott photograph come to life, with a faintly sinister quality that is more than just imagined. Those who know the area see something else: joggers, artists, dog-walkers, parents taking children to school -- the seeds of a neighborhood.
"One day, it's all heavy machinery and trucks," said Ivan Schwartz, who has worked in the area since 1985. "The next day, there are happenings and Europeans with cameras."
That may be just the start. Two Trees Development, which David Walentas owns, has applied for the rezoning of five more blocks, has been conditionally designated as the developer of a city-owned waterfront lot north of the Gair complex and was the only respondent to a request for proposals for the adaptive reuse of the nearby Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park.
Jed Walentas, who is managing the project for his father, likened the broader redevelopment to Harborplace in Baltimore. "Brooklyn is a huge middle-class city with very few activities for middle-class families," he said.
Opponents see a forest of problems in Two Trees, believing that the company will commercialize and privatize the waterfront, flood the surrounding area with automobile traffic, deplete what little open space remains and create a social, economic and physical barrier between a precious segment of shoreline and less affluent neighborhoods like Vinegar Hill.
Mr. Walentas will face political obstacles no matter what he does. But in at least one respect, his prospects may be brighter than ever. Although he was anathema at City Hall during Edward I. Koch's mayoralty -- purely for personal reasons, he asserts -- Mr. Walentas has found a warmer reception from the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, even if it falls short of an unreserved embrace.
"There are a lot of people who are opposed to anything and some of them live in the Down Under area," said Charles Millard, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation (who dislikes the name Dumbo). "But the reality is that while there may be some specific flaws in this plan, it's going to create investment and jobs in New York."
Joseph B. Rose, the chairman of the City Planning Commission, was measured in his assessment of the larger development plan. "It's a great opportunity to develop an exciting piece of waterfront," he said, but it "has to balance a complex set of economic, transportation and land-use planning questions."
Mr. Rose was less reserved about rezoning measures that permit residential and commercial uses in this manufacturing district. "We're definitely sympathetic to the goal," he said. "It allows for the emergence of additional SoHos and TriBeCas."
The rezoning allowed Mr. Walentas to convert the 16-story factory at 1 Main Street into a 124-unit condominium loft building that is now called the Clock Tower.
Community Board 2 objected that the new zoning would permit "more extensive development" than Two Trees needed for its project and recommended disapproval.
But the measure was endorsed by Borough President Howard Golden of Brooklyn, who was described by his chief of staff, Greg Brooks, as being "very pleased to see that the change in zoning created the impetus for the Clock Tower, which is upscale housing, something that the borough really needs."
AND Mr. Millard said: "We have already learned the folly of trying to save manufacturing-only zoning in places where people would otherwise be willing to make a serious investment."
Serious, indeed. Mr. Walentas began the conversion with $3 million of his own money. Unable to obtain conventional bank financing, Two Trees turned to Emmes Capital, which provided a $30.7 million loan this year at a 17 percent annual interest rate.
The Clock Tower conversion was designed by Beyer Blinder Belle, which is also planning the more ambitious development.
Best known for the renovation of Grand Central Terminal, Beyer Blinder Belle has worked for Mr. Walentas since the mid-70's, rehabilitating hundreds of modest housing units, including the Kew Gardens Hills project in Queens; renovating the landmark Alwyn Court Apartments at 182 West 58th Street and converting the Silk Building, 692 Broadway, at East Fourth Street, into lofts.
Apartments in the Clock Tower range from one to three bedrooms and in price from $300,000 to more than $1 million (on average, about $300 a square foot).
For $4 million, a buyer with more imagination than budgetary restraints can pick up the clock loft, a raw space of 3,500 square feet with 25-foot-high ceilings and four see-through clock faces, 15 feet in diameter.
Mr. Walentas and his wife, Jane, plan to move into the unit immediately below the clock loft, which also commands unobstructed views to every point on the compass.
"Our life revolves around Dumbo so we thought, 'Why not?' " Mr. Walentas said.
Mrs. Walentas, an art director who holds a master's degree in fine arts, has been involved in the furnishing and design of the Clock Tower apartments.
In the first three months of sales, Mr. Walentas said, 75 contracts were signed. But purchases have started to slow. "I don't know whether that's because it's later in the year, or because of the market turmoil or because the units that are left are the larger family units," he said.
The application that is now under review would create a special mixed-use zoning district for five blocks on which seven of Mr. Walentas's buildings stand. This would permit residential use in addition to the light manufacturing, warehousing, offices and studios that are now allowed.
Mr. Walentas would convert two vacant buildings, probably into rental apartments: 75 Washington Street, at York Street, and 66 Water Street, near Main Street.
Because his broader redevelopment project involves city- and state-owned land, it will be subject to many approvals.
"There is almost nothing it doesn't need," said Raymond H. Levin, of Fischbein Badillo Wagner Harding, the lawyers for Two Trees. "Mappings, de-mappings, garage special permits, rezonings, zoning text changes, Landmarks, Corps of Engineers, Department of Environmental Conservation. There will be numerous opportunities for public review, comment and input."
And no one expects the residents of Brooklyn Heights, Fulton Ferry, Dumbo, Vinegar Hill and Bridge Plaza to be shy in expressing objections.
Already, several community-based plans have been drawn up. The Old Brooklyn Waterfront Alliance, which was formed last year, has called for "greenspace" from the Empire-Fulton Ferry park to a point one block north of the Manhattan Bridge.
Mr. Walentas said his plan would expand parkland. "Instead of a three-acre park," he said, "we'll have eight or nine acres of park, with a boardwalk that runs three-quarters of a mile." But that amenity comes at a price: the commercial development of the surroundings, including a city-owned parking lot on Plymouth Street that neighbors would also like to see as a park.
On that lot, stretching out to pilings in the East River, Mr. Walentas would build the Main Street Pier Building, envisioned as a 350,000-square-foot structure including a 150-room hotel, five to six stories high; a movie theater with 12 to 16 screens and 60,000 square feet of shops and restaurants.
More shops and restaurants, perhaps 250,000 square feet in all, would go into the Empire Stores, an abandoned warehouse on Water Street, between Dock and Main Streets, that looks almost medieval, with its solemn ranks of round-arched doorways and windows, some sealed by iron shutters.
Built in 1870 as Nesmith & Sons' Empire Stores, and expanded in 1885, it was memorably photographed in 1936 by Berenice Abbott, when it was a Yuban coffee warehouse. Beans still litter the floors.
The Empire Stores is in the Empire-Fulton Ferry park and the city-designated Fulton Ferry Historic District.
Two Trees was the sole respondent last year to the state's request for proposals for the adaptive reuse of the park. Besides redeveloping the Empire Stores, Mr. Walentas would extend the park up to 50 feet, to the pierhead line. At the water's edge, he would install a historic 1922 carousel from Idora Park in Youngstown, Ohio, with 48 wooden horses and 2 chariots.
Mr. Walentas is seeking a 49-year lease on the property, rather than the customary 20-year concession term, which would require the approval of the State Legislature.
A spokesman for the state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, Joseph A. Picchi, said last week that "negotiations are still going on."
Charles A. Gargano, the state commissioner of economic development, who backed the 49-year lease to the developers of Chelsea Piers in Manhattan, said he was inclined to support the idea in Brooklyn.
Neighbors are far less enamored of the redevelopment plan. "Everybody locally is in favor of a park," said Richard Brachman, an artist and member of the waterfront alliance, "yet this regional shopping destination is still seriously being considered."
A plan drawn up in May by the Community Board's land-use committee recommended that the waterfront be "devoted to the maximum extent possible to open space, park and recreational opportunities open to the public and accessible to all, including lower-income members of the community."
"There is no lack of opportunity for people in Brooklyn to find a place to spend money," said Paul DiLeo, chairman of the waterfront subcommittee of Community Board 2. "However, there are not many places where you can go and not be confronted with a commercial environment."
No less controversial is Mr. Walentas's proposal to build a 1,200-space parking garage under the Brooklyn Bridge and a 1,300-space garage under the Manhattan Bridge.
"For all this to work, you need parking," he said. "Our plan is to put parking where nobody wants to be anyway."
That is not how Doreen Gallo sees it. "Do you want parking there or a park?" she asked. "The closer to the waterfront you get, the more openness there should be." Ms. Gallo, an artist and member of the steering committee of the Dumbo Neighborhood Association, said she takes her 17-month-old daughter, Giovanna, to Empire-Fulton Ferry park every day.
Mr. Walentas also hopes to tear down a 1936 warehouse known as the Purchase Building, 11 Water Street, in the historic district. Because no demolition application has reached the Landmarks Preservation Commission, the chairwoman, Jennifer J. Raab, declined to discuss the matter.
Razing the building, Mr. Walentas said, would open an extraordinary vista from Old Fulton Street to the Williamsburg Bridge in the distance. "No one will believe the view," he said. "We're talking about a $300 million project and this is the front door."
IT is also a long way from his first investment, 30 years ago, in a five-story apartment building at Manhattan Avenue and 104th Street. That led to a partnership with J. Frederic Byers 3d, a descendant of W. R. Grace, whose family farm in Aiken, S.C., was called Two Trees.
Well ahead of the crowd, the partners bought a building at Broome and Wooster Streets in 1971 at the suggestion of Mr. Byers, who was well connected to the art world as the proprietor, with Klaus Kertess, of the Bykert Gallery on East 81st Street.
The recession of the mid-70's squeezed Two Trees and had a tragic consequence: Mr. Byers plunged to his death from his 14th-floor apartment on East 79th Street in December 1977, leaving behind a note that mentioned business problems.
Emerging from the recession, Mr. Walentas turned his attention to NoHo, and converted the Silk Building. Then he began looking for other opportunities. "I always believe in following the artists," he said.
Mr. Walentas cannot recall exactly who suggested the manufacturing lofts between the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges. But he does remember the day he first visited the site. "I saw the Empire Stores, I saw the views and I thought, 'Wow, where did this neighborhood come from?' " he said.
Where it came from was the Robert Gair Company, whose founder invented a process in 1879 that made practicable the mass production of folded cardboard cartons. The National Biscuit Company, for one, was "quick to realize that the folding box spelled success for the package food business," wrote William Thompson Bonner, in "New York, The World's Metropolis" (1924).
Running out of space on Reade Street in Manhattan, Gair crossed the East River in 1887 and built two six-story, red-brick factories at 25 and 30 Washington Street, between Water and Plymouth Streets.
In 1904, Gair built the first reinforced-concrete, multistory factory in the United States, 45 Washington Street, between Front and Water Streets. "He erected, one after another, the massive monolithic concrete buildings which now compose 'Gairville,' the most modern and thoroughly fireproof structures as yet known," Bonner wrote.
The literal high point of Gairville was the Clock Tower, completed in 1915. When Gair died in 1927, on his 88th birthday, the company had six factories around the nation. By the time it was acquired in 1956 by the Continental Can Company, Gair had 48 plants in the United States and Canada.
The Gairville buildings, about 1.8 million square feet in all, were acquired by Helmsley-Spear, which sold the complex to Mr. Walentas in 1981 for $12 million, less than $7 a square foot. Mr. Walentas also bought the old Sweeney Manufacturing Company buildings, with about 200,000 square feet of space. Many tenants were garment and accessory manufacturers, but there was also some heavy industry, including a screw-machine operator in the Sweeney Building and a gummed-paper maker in the Clock Tower.
In 1982, Two Trees was designated by the Koch and Cuomo administrations as the developer of the public parcels. A plan was drawn up by Benjamin Thompson & Associates and Beyer Blinder Belle. Called Fulton Landing, the project was "in many ways a precursor to the second go-around," said the architect John H. Beyer.
In February 1984, however, City Hall removed Two Trees from the project. Kenneth Lipper, who had been named Deputy Mayor six months after Mr. Walentas was designated, said the company had not demonstrated that it had enough financial backing.
Mr. Walentas countered that Mr. Lipper, who had been a friend and colleague of Mr. Byers, was acting out of personal animosity. Mr. Lipper dismissed this assertion as a "smoke screen."
There followed what Peter J. Johnson, a state development official at the time, called "an epic of Marx Brothers proportions, without the comic ending."
The Koch and Cuomo administrations wrangled publicly. An attempt to sell one or more of the buildings to the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union fell through. Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, which was to move some computer operations to the Clock Tower, dropped out after it was acquired by Shearson/American Express. To cap off a bad year, a smoky fire in one of the Gair buildings forced the brief closing of the Manhattan Bridge.
It was not until 1986 that Mr. Walentas found a tenant for the Clock Tower, when the State Labor Department took over the entire building on a 10-year lease. The agency's departure two years ago opened the way for the residential conversion.
TYPICAL of the older tenants is Majestic Sportswear, 45 Washington Street, which moved in 1981 from SoHo, where rents were too high. Majestic pays $3 a square foot annually for 20,000 square feet.
Sam and Bala Silver founded the company in 1965 and it is continued today by their son, Moses. Majestic employs 30 workers to make men's and boys' all-weather coats with zip-out linings, long dress coats, pea coats and suede-collar jackets.
"This is a dying trade in New York City, this kind of manufacturing," Mr. Silver said frankly. It is not a business he expects to hand over to any of his nine children. "None are interested," he said.
That is not to say that manufacturing has disappeared from Gairville, only that it is growing more in synch with the times.
StudioEIS (pronounced "ice"), run by the brothers Elliot and Ivan Schwartz, produces sculptural figures for museums, stores, restaurants, hotels and public sites -- from credibly lifelike humans to utter flights of fantasy. The company occupies 15,000 square feet at 35 York Street and employs up to 30 people, depending on business.
In the workshop now are figures of Diana Ross and the Supremes, bound for the Motown Cafe in Orlando, Fla., and the Martha Stewart holiday window displays for Sony Plaza on Madison Avenue, at 55th Street. Unlike Ms. Stewart's recipes, the Schwartz brothers' cakes are made of auto-body putty and chopped up Styrofoam.
Having moved to Dumbo from the West Village in 1985, Ivan Schwartz confesses to mixed feelings about the transformation of this "end-of-the-world spot."
"My own sense is that this will never be another SoHo," he said. "On the other hand, all it takes is a certain investment, a Walentas kind of spirit and before too long we'll see restaurants."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Two-Families for Soundview;
25 Homes On 3 Blocks

 BODY:
Construction is to start in December on the first market-rate, two-family home development in the Soundview section of the Bronx in nearly 25 years.
Levine Builders of Douglaston, Queens, will build Clason Point Homes -- 25 two-family semi-attached houses -- over a year on separate vacant sites spread over three blocks west of Soundview Avenue, a main artery in the neighborhood of mostly one- and two-family homes. The price is expected to be $229,000, said Jeffrey E. Levine, president of Levine Builders.
The two-story, brick and aluminum-sided homes will have two 1,100-square-foot, three-bedroom apartments, 30- by 30-foot backyards, fenced front lawns and one-car driveways. Rents for the second unit are expected to be $850, Mr. Levine said. 
 He said financing for the $5.48 million project includes a $4.2 million construction loan from the nonprofit Community Preservation Corporation, a $728,000 equity investment by the Fannie Mae American Communities Fund and $550,000 of his own equity.
Mr. Levine said he was also applying to the State of New York Mortgage Agency to offer 30-year mortgages with fixed rates at below market levels to eligible first-time buyers. Under a city tax abatement program property taxes on the homes, roughly $2,000, would be phased in over eight years.

Misfortune ofHedge Funds Is Converted Into Bargains

BYLINE: By ABBY SCHULTZ 

 BODY:
THE fallout from the recent hedge-fund eruptions continues to waft into the nooks and crannies of the financial markets. One asset class caught in the downdraft is convertible bonds, which according to the Credit Suisse First Boston Convertible Securities Index, have fallen 21.5 percent since April 30.
Converts, as they are known, initially fell for the same reasons that stocks did: the meltdown in emerging markets and fears of recession. But the slide in their prices -- and the corresponding increase in their yields, which move in the opposite direction -- was worsened by widespread selling among hedge funds. 
 Margaret Patel, manager of the Third Avenue High-Yield fund, which holds some convertibles, says leveraged players, including a very large number of hedge funds, felt compelled to sell their positions in convertible bonds to raise needed cash. In fact, hedge funds control 40 to 50 percent of the $120 billion market in convertible bonds, according to Salomon Smith Barney.
Converts are corporate bonds with a feature that allows the holder to convert the fixed-income securities into a set number of common shares of the issuing corporation. Converting such bonds can be a lucrative transaction in a rising market, making the securities popular among many investors because of the close relationship between the price of the bonds and the underlying stocks.
For hedge funds, however, a common tactic is to short the common stock of a company, betting that it will fall, and to buy its convertible bonds as a hedge against the possibility that the stock will rise. To short a stock, an investor borrows shares and then sells them, expecting to replace them after the price declines and pocket the difference. If the stock rises, however, the hedge fund is somewhat protected because the price of the convertible, which is also paying interest, is likely to rise, too, helping to offset the loss from the short transaction.
The unusually swift fall in converts in the third quarter caught many hedge funds off guard, forcing them to liquidate positions, which in turn put more pressure on the market. At the same time, hedge funds' bets in other markets were going awry, and many were forced to unwind convertible positions to raise cash, said John P. Calamos, president of Calamos Asset Management in Naperville, Ill., and manager of the Calamos Convertible Hedge fund.
A result is a table-thumping buy opportunity, money managers say. "This is the kind of opportunity we only see a couple of times each decade," said Charles Pohl, manager of the Putnam Convertible Income-Growth fund.
IN fact, investors can benefit from a resulting anomalous situation: Many converts have higher yields than those of the comparable nonconvertible bonds issued by the same company.
Columbia/HCA Healthcare, for example, has a nonconvertible bond, rated triple-B, with a 7 percent coupon due in 2007 that is trading at 92.25 percent of its face value, with a yield of 8.26 percent. The same company has a convertible bond that is rated slightly lower -- triple-B-minus -- and has a coupon of 6.75 percent due in 2006. It is trading at 80.25 percent of par, with a yield of 10.47 percent. So buyers of the convertible now get a security with a higher yield and retain the possibility of converting their investment into common stock.
The best course for individuals, however, may be investing in a convertible mutual fund. Buying individual bonds is costly -- one typically needs at least $10,000 to buy one bond -- and analyzing the securities can be complicated, because it requires an understanding of the underlying stock as well as the bond.

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about investing in convertible bonds misstated their typical cost. It is $1,000 a bond, not $10,000, though it is usually practical to buy convertible bonds only in lots of $10,000 or more.

Trip-Hop Reinvents Itself to Take on the World

BYLINE: By GUY GARCIA 

 BODY:
WHEN Massive Attack came on the British dance-music scene in 1991 with its debut album, "Blue Lines," the group's bass-heavy beats and brooding spirit of introspection became the sonic blueprint for trip-hop. A studio-concocted blend of hip-hop, ambient techno and reggae that set the tone for fellow Bristol artists like Portishead and Tricky, trip-hop seemed ideally suited to our globally aware, culturally fragmented times. Spawned by the latest recording technologies, yet resolutely human in its message, it was steeped in the ironic film-noir paranoia of 60's spy movies and apocalyptic angst.
Throughout the 90's, Massive Attack has maintained its underground appeal, partly because its music -- like trip-hop itself -- is a constantly mutating, sometimes clashing hybrid of styles and influences. Now Massive Attack is metamorphosing again, this time into a rock band. The group's muscular new sound, which was on display during the group's recent American tour, signaled its continuing evolution from a loose confederacy of DJ's, singers and studio wizards into a more conventional band that performs with live drums and guitars. On songs like "Angel" and "Group Four," both from the group's new album, "Mezzanine," the undulating dance pulse repeatedly morphs into spiraling electric guitar riffs. 
 The enthusiastic response to the album and concerts was especially satisfying for Robert Del Nada, a k a. 3-D, one of the core members of the group and the catalyst behind its new sound. "It really did bring in all the elements that made us," he said. "Funk, soul, reggae, hip-hop and punk thing -- it was all there."
It also showed that trip-hop has expanded well beyond the confines of its dance-beat origins, reflecting the multiethnic makeup of the genre's urban international audience. Most trip-hop bands are racially and sexually mixed, and their lyrics, while seldom overtly political, are charged with the social and economic apprehensions of the latest CNN headlines. And thanks to the rise of world music and a growing appreciation of native folk traditions, popular tastes are less parochial than they once were, paving the way for mass acceptance of trip-hop's polyglot textures. In fact, at a time when the boundaries between musical genres are increasingly blurred, trip-hop is becoming more diverse -- and relevant even, wrapping its mordant lyrics and sinuous beats around influences as disparate as Middle Eastern folk music, free-form jazz and Burt Bacharach.
"Trip-hop is the new world music," said the reggae singer Horace Andy, a longtime Massive Attack collaborator who contributed lyrics and vocals to several tracks on "Mezzanine." "It speaks to every culture."
It also speaks to musicians who grew up listening to everything from Public Enemy and the Sex Pistols to Joni Mitchell and Pink Floyd and who are searching for open-ended forms of expression that will not limit their choices. In recent months, trip-hop's atmospheric strains have spawned a slew of ambitious new acts, including England's Pressure Drop, the Belgian band Hooverphonic and Canada's Esthero.
"I think music in general has kind of grown up in the past few years," said Mr. Del Naja. "Everyone seems to have understood you could go in any direction that you want, and it's not something that has to be a cliche or generic. People are prepared to experiment."
Last year, Mr. Del Naja joined his fellow Massive Attack co-founders, Grant (Daddy G) Marshal and Andrew (Mushroom) Vowles, in starting their own record label, Melankolic. Among its first releases were "Skylarking Volume 1," a compilation of songs by Mr. Andy, and "Come from Heaven " by the British trip-hop newcomer Alpha, whose music has a breezy, retro feel and features samples of Herb Alpert and the Percy Faith Orchestra.
For some bands, the trip-hop trend has provided a vehicle for exploring other musical terrain. While Morcheeba's 1996 debut album, "Who Can You Trust?" was squarely in a trip-hop mode, the commercial success of that album and a collaboration with David Byrne on his album "Feelings" freed the group to tap its 70's rock roots. As a result, its even stronger second album, "Big Calm," moves away from dance club grooves and takes a more song-oriented approach, incorporating sitar, banjo and peddle steel guitar.
"We never really considered ourselves a trip-hop band, although we jumped on that bandwagon to get a record deal and get some profile," said Paul Godfrey, the band's lead lyricist and self-styled conceptualist. "We've always been way diverse," he said, "and the music that we were creating before 'Who Can You Trust?' was country blues with fiddles and hip-hop beats. So 'Big Calm,' in a way, was really a return to where we came from."
TRIP-HOP'S founders, in fact, now reject the term as outdated and limiting. "It doesn't describe our music at all, " said Mr. Marshall of Massive Attack.
Yet there are certain threads that continue to run through the genre, particularly a tendency toward slow, surging rhythms, minor-chord progressions and lyrics that evoke alienation and fear. There is also a palpable ambivalence toward technology, which can manifest itself in menacing drones and beeps or mellifluous rainbows of synthesized sound. And there is a free-floating sense of dread that has as much to do with race riots and terrorism as the emotional risks of post-modern romance.
On the song "Darkness," from Pressure Drop's album, "Elusive," Anita Jarrett, accompanied by ominous bass lines and a funereal beat, sings: "Something inside, under the skin/ Deep, deep down, Deep within/ You can't feel a thing/ That's what darkness brings."
"When we write tracks we try to represent things going on around us," said David Henley, who along with Justin Langlands makes up the creative core of Pressure Drop. "And in this world that were living in now, of mass communication and people not contacting each other physically as much, a lot of people are feeling quite insular, because they've sort of lost that contact of meeting people and interacting face to face. And I think that's increasing."
For Maurice Bernstein, the President of Giant Step records and a British concert promoter who produced the first American concerts for Massive Attack and many other trip-hop acts, the music's downbeat vibe can at least be partly attributed to the social and cultural realities of the working-class British communities where the movement was born. "It's coming from their experience," said Mr. Bernstein. "And they're offering an alternative to the groovy Cool Britannia image that usually gets offered to people. This is England the way they see it, and its a very dark score."
Trip-hop bands also tend to eschew traditional song structures in favor of panoramic soundscapes that unfold and evolve with long instrumental passages, more like classical or jazz compositions than typical pop songs. On Pressure Drop's album, "Elusive," woodwinds, trumpet and saxophone give the mix a bluesy, be-bop flavor, while on Hooverphonic's new album, "Blue Wonder Powder Milk," Geike Arnaerts ethereal vocals float over lush string arrangements and gently pulsing rhythms.
The propensity toward longer, more amorphous tracks springs from trip-hop's roots in the ambient techno raves of the late 80's and early 90's, in which music, lighting effects and sometimes psychotrophic drugs were used to induce an ecstatic, trancelike experience that could last all night.
But Mr. Bernstein sees another explanation. "Kids spend most of their time now walking around with headphones on," he said. "The Walkman has become part of our everyday reality. So what people are doing now is writing the soundtrack to their own lives."
For trip-hop bands like Massive Attack, that sense of detachment translates into music that mixes well with visual images, and that compatibility has been noticed by filmmakers looking for fresh sounds to complement their work.
Massive Attack has contributed to the soundtracks of "Batman Returns," "Welcome to Sarejevo" and the sci-fi thriller "Phi." Craig Armstrong, the Scottish composer who arranged the strings on Massive Attacks 1994 album, "Protection," and whose album, "The Space Between Us," was released this year on Melankolic, has contributed to the soundtracks for "Romero and Juliet" and "The Saint." And Hooverphonic's song "2wicky" was featured on the score of the Bernardo Bertolucci film "Stealing Beauty."
Despite such exposure, few trip-hop bands have been able to make their mark in an increasingly crowded market. "All of the musical scenes that there have been in the past 5 or 10 years, each of them seems to be strong in its own right," said Mr. Del Naja. "You've got an enormous drum-and-bass scene, and an enormous techno scene, and then you've got places that play more mellow stuff and jazz. And once in a while something pops up and gets big and everything else stays underground, which is healthy."
What remains to be seen is whether trip-hop, either in its original or mutated form, will ever gain amass following outside Europe's dance-club scene. "Is the next Massive Attack somewhere in America making the U.S. version of trip-hop?" asked Mr. Bernstein. "It would be pretty sad if there isn't. Because that's what it will take to push this to the next level."
Perhaps, but in the United States, where many hit songs reflect the optimism of the American dream, trip-hop's dark streak of realism has failed to catch on with the record-buying public. That could change. If political cynicism and a gyrating stock market continue to take their toll on the public mood, trip-hop may yet prove to be the perfect soundtrack for our anxious times.

'Deals of the Century' In Flights to Asia

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
ASIA'S economic woes have hit that region's airlines particularly hard, and many are slashing fares in a desperate attempt to attract passengers. For example, the regular full coach fare between New York and Seoul, South Korea, this time of year is about $2,500 round trip, while full coach fare between Newark and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is about $3,600. But bargain hunters can fly from New York to Seoul on Korean Air from $749, including five nights in a hotel, or between Newark and Kuala Lumpur for $739 on Malaysia Airlines, including four hotel nights.
While Australia has been spared most of Asia's troubles, this is also a good time to travel to Sydney from Los Angeles or San Francisco. Qantas has a package starting at $1,098, including five nights' accommodations. 
 "There are fabulous bargains out there for travelers to Asia," said Michael Boult, an international air travel specialist for Rosenbluth International, a travel management company based in Philadelphia. "They're the deals of the century."
Because Qantas is financially sound, after a record profit of $183 million for the fiscal year ending June 30, its package deal is more in the nature of the occasional fare sale than a fire sale. But because of their weakened economies and devalued currencies, Korean Air and to a lesser extent Malaysia Airlines have been hemorrhaging money, as have China Airlines (Taiwan), All Nippon Airways and Thai Airways.
Saddled by strikes and more than $2 billion in debt, 57-year-old Philippine Airlines shut down Sept. 23, ostensibly for good. But a week later the carrier's employees and management voted to give it another try, although with a reduced fleet and route system. International flights have not yet been restored.
While Philippine Airlines had been in the red for years, and Garuda Indonesia Airlines has had problems since well before Asia's woes, the more recently weakened carriers have no illusions that they will strengthen their balance sheets much with rock-bottom fares. They are mainly trying to buy time while they jettison unprofitable routes, cancel or delay orders for new planes, shift to smaller aircraft and forge international alliances.
For example, Qantas and Cathay Pacific recently joined American Airlines, British Airways and Canadian Airlines to form the Oneworld Alliance, which is expected to be up and running in February. Oneworld has also invited Japan Airlines, Iberia and Finnair. On Jan. 1, Air New Zealand, Ansett International and Ansett Australia will join the Star Alliance, which includes United, Lufthansa, Air Canada, Varig, SAS and Thai Airways. Singapore Airlines is also expected to join the Star Alliance next year.
While alliances enable passengers to book on any partner airline and offer convenient connections, they also allow pooling of frequent-flier miles and extend the reach of each airline partner.
Meanwhile, Cathay Pacific -- which through the six months ending June 30 recorded a net operating loss of about $22.6 million, its first such loss through the midyear in more than 20 years -- will soon begin pulling back from weaker Asian markets by suspending service to Sapporo, Japan, and reducing flights to Indonesia.
Qantas is not the only Asian-Pacific airline in the black, although the Asian economic downturn eroded the profits of Air New Zealand as well as those of Singapore Airlines, the longtime favorite in airline passenger polls. Japan Airlines, after restructuring its unprofitable nonaviation businesses and writing off large losses, expects to return to profitability this fiscal year (ending March 31, 1999).
Japan Airlines' wholesale-tour arm, Pacifico Creative Service, has several packages to Japan for travel through March 31, 1999: round-trip air fare, airport transfers and five nights in Tokyo starting at $1,015, departing from New York, Chicago, Los Angeles or San Francisco; air fare and three nights from $5,050, flying business class from the above four cities plus Atlanta, including hotels, and five-night package starting at $1,850 that includes hotels in Tokyo, Kyoto and Nara.
United States airlines have been bruised by the Asian economic downturn, but far from battered. Asia constitutes only about 10 percent of their revenues, said Mr. Boult, the international air travel specialist at Rosenbluth International. In fact, the Department of Transportation reports that the major passenger airlines worldwide this year have had the best net profit ever for a second quarter.
United Airlines dropped its San Francisco-Manila nonstop in February, while Northwest has suspended service between Honolulu and Nagoya, Japan, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Hong Kong, and Minneapolis-St. Paul and Osaka, Japan.
American Airlines has daily nonstops to Tokyo from Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth and Seattle, and will begin daily service from Dallas-Fort Worth to Osaka on Dec. 20. "Our Tokyo routes remain profitable," said Tim Smith, an American spokesman.
Airline officials estimate that Asia's airline industry will recover in two to three years. By then traffic is expected to rise about 5 percent annually rather than the 7 to 8 percent that the International Air Transport Association forecast only a little more than a year ago.
Meantime, from Bangkok to Bali, there are still bargains galore. For example, Singapore Airlines and Asian Affair Holidays are offering a $928 package to Bali through March 31, including round-trip air fare from the East and West Coasts, plus five nights at a hotel.

Expecting the Worst, Leisurely

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
It is safe to say that the mood of the conference sponsored by the Magazine Publishers of America in Orlando, Fla., last week, was one of caution.
Most of the 800 publishers, editors, subscription agents, advertising directors and investment bankers who gathered at the conference expressed trepidation about the potential for sluggish advertising sales in 1999; they were concerned about the European and Asian economies and how the downturn of those economies will affect marketers' budgets; they sweated over newsstand consolidation, which is making distribution more difficult. 
 "People are generally feeling scared to pessimistic about next year," said Michael Lafavore, the editor in chief of Men's Health, which is published by Rodale Press.
But it was hard to be too gloomy in a world where most people wear mouse ears and there's a 60-foot-high plaster swan perched atop the neighboring hotel. Disney World, the Walt Disney Company flagship where the conference was held, does not provide the most serious environment for thought-provoking, chin-in-hand discourse.
So while Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations, spoke gravely about the economy ("the global economy is rooted in deep political imbalances," was one phrase), some found it difficult to regard him as soberly as they would have had he been speaking from a U.N. podium. He was, after all, at the Disney Yacht and Beach Resort, and remember, this is central Florida -- with no places to anchor a genuine yacht and no beaches, save for the Disney-manufactured ones, upon which to sun.
Attendees could watch Steven Brill, the editor of Brill's Content, and Norman Pearlstine, editor in chief of Time Inc., debate the issues raised by the CNN Tailwind controversy, typical enough fare for a magazine convention.
But this conference also featured a unique combination: the chance to speculate about the economy, and the chance to watch an animated cartoon in a screening room in the base of an enormous, fake baobab tree at Animal Kingdom. While Michael Clinton, senior vice president and chief marketing officer for Hearst Magazines, shared his concerns with other publishers on a panel, he also got to ride Space Mountain for the first time.
Mr. Clinton said that 1997 and 1998 were such stellar years for the magazine industry that it was natural for publishers to wonder how long the good times would last, especially after the recent fluctuations in the stock market. It has been a good decade, over all. In 1997, magazine advertisers spent more than $12.7 billion in the publications tracked by the Publishers Information Bureau; in 1990, they spent only $6.7 billion. In 1997, magazine advertising pages topped 231,000, according to the Publishers Information Bureau -- up 35 percent from 1990.
"We are all asking ourselves, 'How high is high?' " Mr. Clinton said. "So as we look around at all the global markets, it keeps us very concerned about next year. Certainly, I think that the market in the last week or two has been encouraging."
The real tell-tale sign will be retail sales this Christmas season, he said, "because that's a great barometer of consumer confidence, and when consumers are spending, marketers will feel more comfortable about increasing their spending."
Mr. Lafavore expressed concern about the 12 international editions of his magazine.
"I used to worry about only one economy," he said. "Now I have to worry about a whole bunch of them. Certainly, in Russia we launched less than a year ago and we came in late to a booming market."
Mr. Lafavore said that he was also concerned about the editions his company publishes in Peru, Colombia and Mexico. "And we were talking about starting up in Brazil, but things have taken a turn for the worse there," he said.
William F. Reilly, chairman and chief executive of Primedia, which is controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, the buyout firm, shocked some guests by saying in the conference's closing speech that he welcomed a recession because it might allow him to snatch up some new properties.
Reed Phillips 3d, an investment banker with Da Silva & Phillips, suggested another benefit of downturns. "A recession tends to lead to a shake-out," he said. "There are probably too many magazines, and after a recession you would have fewer magazines. In some markets, you might have eight competitors where you should only have four or five." When those extra magazines close, he said, they stop diluting the ad market for the survivors.
Perhaps Michael Kelly, the editor of National Journal, summed up the conference's surreality most eloquently, if half-jokingly. Mr. Kelly said that holding the publishers' conference at Disney World was "akin to that sensation you get when you're standing at the edge of a vast ocean, and people always say that kind of moment puts your life in perspective. You realize you're one small mortal.
"There's a Disney effect like that," he continued. "All these people are going to panels and earnestly discussing the magazine industry and brilliant launches and how to conduct research, but at the same time you're surrounded by this endless Disney world that goes on forever all around you. And you begin to get this feeling. What does all of this matter? In five years, Disney will just own us anyway. We'll all just be another subsidiary."

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Confronts Foreign Phone Giants

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Anxiety has been running high in this former British colony, which has seen its economy buckle, tourism dry up and free-market reputation tatter in the 15 months since it reverted to Chinese rule.
Now, a United States telephone company is warning Hong Kong that it could miss out on the information age if it does not quickly open its telecommunications market. "Hong Kong's Back Is Against the Wall," said a Cassandra-like newspaper advertisement recently taken out here by the company, MCI Worldcom Inc. 
 "Hong Kong is teetering on the edge," asserted Steve Liddell, president of the MCI Worldcom Asia Pacific unit. "It will either embrace the brave new age of telecommunications or return to an age of protectionism."
Hong Kong officials, perhaps unsurprisingly, do not share the American company's alarm. "It is not our policy goal to be the most liberal telecommunications hub in Asia; that's a rather empty thing," said Geoffrey Woodhead, a senior adviser to K. C. Kwong, the Secretary for Information, Technology and Broadcasting.
At issue is whether the Hong Kong government will allow new competitors to offer local phone service in this territory of 6.8 million people. For the last three years, Hong Kong has licensed three local companies to provide service, in addition to its old monopoly, Hong Kong Telecom. A decision on whether to license further competitors is expected in the next few weeks.
MCI Worldcom, formed by the recent combination of the United States' second- and fourth-largest long-distance companies, is eager to wire Hong Kong's teeming business district, so it can offer a package of voice and data services to the many multinational corporations here. The company already offers international service to about 100 customers on lines leased from Hong Kong Telecom. But it wants to provide a complete menu of local and long-distance offerings to corporate customers. And it is dangling a bushel of carrots before the government.
Among other blandishments, MCI Worldcom has promised to make Hong Kong the hub for an Asian fiber optic network that would stretch in a vast crescent from Tokyo to Singapore.
Last Thursday, the government announced plans to open its international long-distance market to freewheeling competition. But several analysts said they expected Hong Kong not to issue any more local phone licenses.
MCI Worldcom contends that by refusing to let more competitors provide the actual direct network connections to local customers, the territory would cut off its nose to spite its face. Without sophisticated global competitors, Mr. Liddell argues, Hong Kong risks losing its status as a world financial center.
"If the competitors are limited to three local firms," he said, "it's our view that these services simply won't be available."
With its lofty talk and appeals to economic growth, MCI Worldcom's lobbying campaign bears little difference from campaigns waged by long-distance and local phone companies in the United States. But in Asia, at a time of recession, the company's message carries an edge: for those places that pursue it, a competitive telecommunications market can be the road to recovery; for those that do not, protectionism can lead to economic obscurity.
MCI Worldcom notes pointedly that Japan and Australia have fully liberalized local phone markets. The company is investing $350 million over 10 years to build a fiber optic network in Tokyo and $200 million to build one in Sydney. Though Mr. Liddell refused to discuss MCI Worldcom's potential investment in Hong Kong, it could easily run into hundred of millions of dollars.
Some analysts say Mr. Liddell makes a good case. "Hong Kong needs to jump on opportunities when they present themselves," said Lloyd Fischer, a telecommunications analyst with Salomon Smith Barney here. "They've got a good location geographically, but that's only worth so much."
Indeed, analysts noted, Asia these days can seem more terrifying than tempting to potential investors. The Bell Atlantic Corporation recently took charges of $545 million to write down the value of its investments in Thailand and Indonesia.
Yet, though Hong Kong has suffered along with its neighbors, it is not about to play the needy supplicant. Regulators here, who contend that it already has one of the more open markets in Asia, say they can preserve the territory's status as a financial center without handing out local phone licenses to any and all comers. "We see liberalization of telecommunications as a means to an end, rather than an end in itself," Mr. Woodhead said. "We hope our telecoms policy will attract people to set up their regional headquarters in Hong Kong."
Certainly, Hong Kong has taken further steps to open its markets than have some others in Asia. It has four local phone providers, compared with Singapore's two. And unlike Japan, Hong Kong has no restrictions on the foreign ownership of local telephone companies -- a much-contested provision in last year's World Trade Organization agreement.
In the accord, most countries agreed to let foreign companies acquire major stakes in domestic phone companies. Only Japan insisted on limiting foreigners to no more than 20 percent ownership of NTT and KDD, its main local and long-distance providers, respectively.
In its announcement Thursday, Hong Kong said it would grant licenses to all companies that want to provide international direct-dial service. After Jan. 1, 2000, the licensees can build their own international networks here.
"It's not a free-for-all, but there is no question that Hong Kong's market is liberalizing," said Victor Shvets, head of telecommunications research at Deutsche Securities here.
Having opened its local phone market before its long-distance market, Hong Kong presents something of an anomaly in regulatory circles -- a quirk that results from the government's having granted Hong Kong Telecom a long-term monopoly on international service. In February, it paid the company $864 million to terminate that franchise this year rather than letting the monopoly extend through the original date of 2006.
In contrast, Hong Kong broke open the local phone monopoly in 1995, when it granted licenses to three start-up companies: New T&T, New World Telephone and Hutchison Telecom. All three companies are owned by powerful property developers, a circumstance that has been no small help in stringing wires into buildings.
But though the gaggle of local providers has made for a clamorous market, it has barely dented Hong Kong Telecom's long-distance monopoly. Collectively, the three rivals have less than 2 percent of the market. That is largely because they have been slow to build networks in Hong Kong's densely populated neighborhoods and hilly terrain.
Predictably, the upstarts are lobbying with officials not to add to their struggles by granting additional local licenses. Given that these companies are owned by some of Hong Kong's politically best-connected tycoons, their arguments carry plenty of influence.
Hong Kong's government has not hesitated to make decisions that benefited the developers, even when those moves seemed at odds with the territory's free-market credentials. In June, it suspended sales of public land; in August, it intervened heavily to prop up the stock market.
Several analysts said the developers might have an ulterior motive in opposing additional local licenses. If Worldcom could not build its own network, it might feel pressed to buy out one of the tycoons.
But Mr. Liddell, who said Worldcom was not interested in such an acquisition, took an unsubtle swipe at the tycoons by suggesting that companies that put up apartment buildings and ran supermarkets were not as able to offer up-to-date communications services as one that focused on building such networks.
Hong Kong Telecom has adopted generally low visibility in this debate, perhaps because it has its own economic and political problems. To ready itself for the deregulation of the market, the company recently announced plans to cut the wages of its 13,800 workers by 10 percent. But it was forced to back down after Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, excoriated the move.
Hong Kong Telecom is controlled by Cable and Wireless P.L.C. of Britain; the Beijing-controlled China Telecom bought 5.5 percent of the company last year.
Worldcom is not the only foreign carrier active in Hong Kong. British Telecommunications has an alliance with Hutchison. And Global One, the joint venture owned by Sprint, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, offers international service on leased lines.
But only MCI Worldcom has ambitions to build a soup-to-nuts local network. Perhaps that is why the company has chosen to make its case so fervently and publicly. Besides, Hong Kong may represent the company's best remaining chance to make its local telecommunications mark in Asia.
Certainly, Worldcom hit its share of snags breaking into the local phone business elsewhere in the region. Last year, before teaming up with MCI, the company bid aggressively for a license to offer local phone service in Singapore. But it lost to a consortium that included British Telecom and NTT. Before that setback, Mr. Woodhead said Worldcom had suggested that it might move its Asian headquarters from Hong Kong to Singapore.
Today, though, there is no talk of moving. It may be that MCI Worldcom needs Hong Kong as much as Hong Kong needs MCI Worldcom.

The status of telecommunications laws in some big Asian markets.
 
China -- Has a ban on foreign ownership of telephone companies. Some shares in the Government-controlled cellular carrier, China Telecom, are publicly traded.
 
Hong Kong -- Has licensed three local phone providers, in addition to Hong Kong Telecom. Will soon decide whether to issue additional licenses for local service. Lifted Hong Kong Telecom's monopoly on international service last February.
 
Japan -- Opened most local and long-distance markets. Retained foreign ownership restrictions on NTT and KDD, largest local and long-distance providers, respectively.
 
South Korea -- Local phone business still dominated by Korea Telecom. Will allow some competition in local service next year and lift foreign ownership restrictions in 2001.
 
Singapore -- Issued one additional license for domestic and international services, to a group including British Telecom, NTT and Singaporean companies, to take effect in 2000.
 
Malaysia -- Issued multiple licenses for cellular and international services. Agreed to allow 30 percent foreign ownership of domestic carriers. Analysts say regulations still heavily favor the incumbent Telekom Malaysia.

Microsoft's Trial Thesis: Big, Yes, but Not a Bully
The Microsoft Corporation's defense in the antitrust trial that began last week boils down to one question: Where's the harm?
John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, posed the question in hundreds of ways as he cross-examined the Government's lead witness, James Barksdale, the president and chief executive of Netscape Communications. Mr. Warden sought to establish that while Microsoft is assuredly aggressive and powerful, there is scant evidence that its behavior raises prices or restricts output so that consumers suffer.

HEADLINE: Patents;
The Commissioner quits, after focusing attention on intellectual property and making enemies.

BYLINE: By Teresa Riordan 

 BODY:
BRUCE A. LEHMAN, who announced Friday that he would step down as Commissioner of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, is not a man many people feel lukewarm about. His loyalists defend him as a visionary who has served the public admirably. His critics dismiss him as an intemperate despot who does the bidding of big business.
But defenders and detractors tend to agree on one point: That Mr. Lehman has raised the visibility of intellectual property by transforming what was formerly a bench-warming position into a prominent perch. 
 "He has been savvy about making important people understand why patents matter," said Robert Merges, professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley. "He essentially has made Washington understand that patent issues are important to overall economic strategy."
Mr. Lehman, who was appointed in 1993 by President Clinton, said he would resign by the end of the year because he had accomplished his goals as Commissioner. But there has been speculation for nearly a year that Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley, who is Mr. Lehman's boss, was pushing him to leave, after Mr. Lehman became embroiled in a bitter feud with his assistant commissioners.
"Good riddance," said Jamie Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology, which is based in Washington. "He was terrible on the issue of making patents accessible to everyone on the Internet. And whatever Hollywood or the biotechnology industry wanted, he would do. His responsibility should have been to the public."
Mr. Lehman, whose background was in copyrights rather than patents, fashioned himself an intellectual-property czar.
And clearly, he would most like to be remembered for his contributions in the copyright arena. He helped, for example, to negotiate the World Intellectual Property Organization copyright agreements, which were recently approved by Congress.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the agreements were Mr. Lehman's main achievements. "He foresaw the need to adapt copyright law to the needs of the digital age," Mr. Hatch said.
Some others agreed. "From a software industry perspective, the legacy he leaves goes well into the new millennium," said Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance, a trade association. "I couldn't overemphasize the importance of that treaty, which he was so instrumental in negotiating."
Mr. Lehman championed a broad array of copyright changes, in what he hoped would be a precedent-setting White Paper on Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure. But most of those proposals have been rejected, according to James Boyle, now a visiting professor at Yale University law school.
Among the ideas, since abandoned, that were set forth in the 1995 white paper: a proposal that Internet providers be responsible for the copyright violations of subscribers.
Professor Boyle helped persuade 100 law professors to sign a letter criticizing the white paper. "You couldn't get 100 law professors to sign a letter agreeing that the sun will rise tomorrow," he said. "But they signed this letter."
Mr. Lehman was instrumental in trying to harmonize American patent laws with those of other countries. He was a driving force behind a 1995 law -- long sought by industry and other countries -- which changed the term of a patent.
Before the new law, the life of a patent extended 17 years from the date it was issued. Now, a patent lasts for 20 years from the date of the application -- regardless of how quickly or slowly it was granted.
The purpose of the change was to discourage so-called submarine patents, which popped up after having been submerged at the Patent Office for years or decades, often because of delaying tactics by inventors who wanted to wait for a particular technology to become widespread so as to receive maximum royalties.
But Mr. Lehman's efforts drew the ire of independent inventors, whose cause was taken up by such unlikely allies as Phyllis Schlafly, the right-wing opponent of abortion rights; Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire and sometime Presidential candidate, and Francis Modigliani, a Nobel Prize-winning economist.
The organized resistance of independent inventors is the main reason that other so-called harmonization legislation that was favored by Mr. Lehman has lingered on Capitol Hill for several years without becoming law.
As the first openly gay man to be confirmed by the Senate for a Presidential appointment, Mr. Lehman entered his post with the stated goal of transforming the Patent Office into an agency that celebrated diversity.
Indeed, two of his top officials were black men, Lawrence J. Goffney and Philip G. Hampton. But at some point, Mr. Lehman's relationship with his lieutenants went awry. Last fall, the three met with Secretary Daley in an effort to settle their differences.
By March of this year, Mr. Goffney and Mr. Lehman had become embroiled in a bitter, public dispute. Mr. Lehman accused Mr. Goffney of incompetence, while Mr. Goffney accused Mr. Lehman of cronyism and racism. Both Mr. Hampton and Mr. Goffney have subsequently left the Patent Office for private business.
Mr. Lehman's departure means that soon, four of the top five positions in the agency will be vacant.
Staff members representing Vice President Al Gore have privately sought out potential nominees to succeed Mr. Lehman. An obvious candidate is Q. Todd Dickinson, a Philadelphia patent lawyer who earlier this year was appointed Deputy Commissioner.
But the real question is not so much who will be on the Clinton Administration's short list but rather will anyone really want the job.
The new commissioner will have little time to focus on grand policy initiatives. Instead, his time will be consumed by the mundane logistics of moving a 5,500-person agency into new office space and in shoring up the agency's trouble-ridden, billion-dollar effort to update its technological structure.
And there is no assurance that the new commissioner would have a great deal of time to take care of even this business: if a Republican wins the Presidency in 2000, a Democratic-appointed commissioner would probably be replaced.
Mr. Lehman "is a very smart guy, a very aggressive guy, and he couldn't get past some of these issues," Professor Merges said. "It's bound to scare off the next person.
"In Silicon Valley, there's a term for this," he said. "It's called an insurmountable opportunity."
 Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

HEADLINE: MARATHON;
Running His Own Race

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
The morning of the 1997 New York City Marathon, Jerod Neas jumped in a car with his parents in Princeton, N.J., drove to Staten Island and hopped out at the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge for a 26.2-mile commute through the city's five boroughs.
At 5 feet 9 inches and 130 pounds, Neas could not muscle his way up toward the elite runners on the bridge. It seemed as if he were fighting to get on a crowded subway train. So he started 15 or 20 rows back and found himself sprinting to cover the first mile in 5 minutes 40 seconds. After two miles, he was already fading into the rearview mirror of the lead pack. 
 "I was running as fast as I could," the 27-year-old Neas recalled. "It's a tough thing to deal with."
The best he could hope for was to find someone else running the same pace and willing to work together. Neas kept at it, and between Miles 23 and 24, when the race entered the hills of Central Park, he passed the favored American, Mark Coogan, who had been an Olympian a year earlier in Atlanta but was now drained and fading.
Reaching the finish line in 2 hours 19 minutes 7 seconds, Neas finished 15th over all and first among the Americans. But there are few things as obscure as being first among the Americans in an international marathon. Neas finished nearly 11 minutes behind the winner, John Kagwe of Kenya. He was so little known that there was even confusion about his nationality. Was he American or French? By the time reporters caught up to him, Neas had already returned home to Princeton.
"The field wasn't packed with Americans," Neas said. "I was more pleased with where I finished than being the first American."
On Sunday, he will return for a fourth shot at New York, hoping to lower his time and raise his place in the standing. Neas knows he cannot win, but hopes that incremental improvement now might lead to a breakthrough later. He is following a solitary, unorthodox plan toward making the United States team for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
Even in the American running community, Neas remains in the shadows, a virtual unknown. He ranks in the second half of the second tier of American marathoners, with a personal best of 2:16:20. That is 10 minutes off the world record of 2:06:05 held by Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil and nearly eight minutes short of the American record of 2:08:47 set by Bob Kempainen.
Neas largely avoids the road-racing circuit, has no coach and does no track work. He is committed to marathons, six or seven a year, when most elite runners compete in only two. In 1996, Neas ran nine marathons because he needed the prize money to make ends meet.
On Oct. 4, he ran the Twin Cities Marathon in Minneapolis (he finished sixth). New York will follow four weeks later. If he is going to put in all this mileage, about 120 miles a week, if he is going to run this hard and this fast, he figures it might as well be in a race.
But this kind of racing regimen is likely to leave him watching the Olympics on television instead of in person. So Neas plans to reduce his races next year as he aims toward the Olympic trials in 2000. Eight months ago, a vitamin company began endorsing him, picking up his expenses. And for a year now, he has lived in the Denver suburbs, training in the mile-high altitude, hoping to increase his oxygen-carrying capacity. His wife, Julie, a controller for a building company, has moved to the Rockies with him, willing to make adjustments in her career for his.
His Olympic chances are remote but not impossible. American marathoning is in a deep funk. Kempainen has retired to become a doctor, and his successors, Coogan, Keith Brantly and Jerry Lawson, have not converted potential into achievement. If Neas can pare his time to 2:13 or 2:12, then who knows? Maybe it is time for new blood in a sclerotic event. "I think 10 guys have a legitimate shot if they can bring down their times and run more consistently," Neas said.
In New York, Neas will receive no special treatment, except a chance to start nearer the front and a shot to win $5,000 as the first local runner. The race offers $100,000 to an American winner, double the prize money, but officials are reluctant to pay appearance fees for what has become repeated failure. An American man has not won in New York since Alberto Salazar in 1982.
"We welcome Americans, but we're not going to pay someone $10,000 in appearance money to run 2:20," said Allan Steinfeld, the race director.
Neas said he understood. One year, he went to the starting line in a taxi.
"I don't think we've earned very much respect," Neas said. "It's got to be earned."
He began running as a high school junior, when his family moved to Princeton from Clearwater, Fla. He ran in college at Penn and then at North Carolina, where Neas received an economics degree in 1994. After school, he bunked at home, lived race to race, getting by on meager prize money and determined to live the lonely life of the long-distance runner.
"I just love getting out in nature and running," Neas said. "If you don't do well, you don't have anyone to blame but yourself. It has nothing to do with luck. Usually, the best runner wins. What makes it great is that it's so difficult."
In 1995, he ran his first marathon, in Atlantic City. He had planned to run a half-marathon, but prize money was offered only for first place, and Kagwe was entered in the shorter race, so Neas decided he had better run a full marathon. He did, and won in 2:19. Four weeks later, he entered New York, emboldened with victory, but he hit the wall at Mile 15 and struggled home in 2:27.
"That taught me never to be cocky going into a marathon," Neas said.
His sister, Kiele, an investment banker, and his father, Harold, a certified public accountant, have run marathons, inspired by his own running. But his mother, Donna, said she thought it was crazy and feared her son would "fall into a shamble of bones" by the age of 32.
Still, he runs, chasing an Olympic dream.
"New York is an opportunity to run with the best in the world, to compare where you really are," Neas said. "It's like an Olympic race. Everyone who is anyone runs New York eventually. It brings me back to reality, keeps me honest."

HEADLINE: European Law Aims to Protect Privacy of Data

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 25

 BODY:
The European Union put into effect a law today prohibiting American-style buying and selling of personal data, a move that could interrupt electronic commerce with the United States if the two sides fail to resolve deep philosophical and legal differences over protecting privacy.
The goal of the European law is to prohibit companies from using information about their customers in ways the customers never intended -- for example, selling it to other companies for use as a marketing tool. 
 The new law affects an enormous range of information that companies collect about people in the course of daily business, from credit card transactions to magazine subscriptions to telephone records, as well as the electronic footprints that people leave when they visit sites on the World Wide Web.
The law was adopted three years ago by the European Union after a majority of its 15 member nations agreed to issue what is known as a directive. Under European law, each member nation is required to implement the directive by enacting its own law. Six nations have drafted or passed such laws so far.
Beyond its impact on Europe, the directive has the potential to disrupt electronic commerce with the United States. A key provision of the new measure would prohibit any company doing business in the European Union from transmitting personal data to any country that does not guarantee comparable privacy protection -- foremost among them, at this point, the United States.
American direct-marketing companies, which make money buying, selling and developing business strategies based on huge data banks of personal information about consumers, have lobbied hard against Government regulation of their industry. As a result, the Clinton Administration has adopted a more laissez-faire approach under which data industries would be allowed to police themselves through self-regulatory organizations.
American officials say they agree with Europe on the basic principle that privacy should be protected but have big differences about the best way to carry it out.
"They have privacy czars and bureaucracies, and that kind of top-down approach would probably be regarded as a violation of privacy rights by many people in the U.S.," David Aaron, Under Secretary of Commerce, said of European nations.
Mr. Aaron, who held talks on the issue with European officials in Brussels earlier this month, added, "We say, 'Let's create a situation where, if companies agree to follow certain data practices, they can be held harmless under the new directive.' "
If the issue, which neither side paid much attention to until a few months ago, is not resolved, European officials could theoretically soon begin to block trans-Atlantic data transfers by multinational corporations and the growing number of Internet companies.
European officials say they have no plans for any blockades soon, and are hopeful about reaching a peaceful resolution. Officials from the United States and Europe both say they held constructive discussions earlier this month. The European Commission has scheduled a meeting on the issue for Monday, and it is expected to seek some kind of temporary solution while the two sides negotiate.
Underlying the debate is a deeper political issue that is fraught with cultural baggage. For years, European nations have been far tougher than the United States about protecting privacy. Many countries essentially ban telephone marketing to people's homes, and that prohibition is now being applied to unsolicited sales approaches by fax and E-mail.
Several nations, including Germany and the Netherlands, have government agencies devoted exclusively to protecting personal data.
Acting as ombudsmen, these agencies investigate complaints from individuals who believe that companies have mishandled information about them. Companies that are accused of violating privacy laws can be prosecuted under criminal laws.
"There is a great difference in attitudes about privacy protection between Europe and the United States," said Ulrich Sieber, a law professor at the University of Wurtzburg in Germany.
American privacy laws are far more lax and consist of a hodgepodge of statutes and regulations enforced by various state and Federal agencies charged with oversight of other industries, like, for instance, those that regulate banks.
In sharp contrast with Europe, an entire industry has arisen in the United States that specializes in trolling public and private sources for vast quantities of personal information, like birth records, drivers' license numbers and torrents of data accumulated by retailers about customers' individual purchases.
The new European directive embraces several basic principles that national governments must now translate into their own laws. It requires that companies tell people when they collect information about them and disclose how it will be used. In addition, customers must provide informed consent before any company can legally use that data.
The law also requires companies to give people access to information about themselves.
American officials say they agree with those requirements in principle, but disagree with giving people unconditional access to information about themselves, saying access should be allowed only if it is reasonable or practical to do so.
The more difficult issues are enforcement and policing. Mr. Aaron says the United States wants to give companies a variety of "safe harbors" to satisfy privacy protection. One idea is to create independent self-regulatory organizations that would monitor a company's data practices and would give well-behaved companies what amounts to a stamp of approval.
Another option, they say, should be for companies to deal directly with European officials and demonstrate that their systems and practices are appropriate.
But legal experts say the new law could easily take on a life of its own, because it gives individuals and private organizations the right to sue companies that they say fail to provide adequate privacy protections.
Industry and government officials worry that independent privacy advocates in Europe will simply invoke the letter of the law and begin taking American companies to court.
"I'm not sure the idea of creating safe harbors will be practical, because people can still go ahead and sue a company regardless of whether the governments reach an agreement among themselves," said Christopher Kuner, a lawyer in Frankfurt who specializes in European information law.
In the short term, government and industry officials predict that nothing much will happen. Most countries have yet to implement their own laws to carry out the directive. And several countries, including Germany, have had tough laws in place for years, and companies have found ways to deal with the requirements.
One of the pioneering cases in Germany involved Citibank, which ran afoul of German data protection authorities in 1995. But since Citibank demonstrated to government officials there how its system protected data in the United States, it has operated without conflicts.
Executives of the American Express Company said they had reached similar agreements in many countries and that they believed they could live with the new directive. "It is a crucial issue for us, but it has not been a burden so far," said James Tobin, an American Express spokesman in London.
John Borking, vice president of the Data Protection Authority of the Netherlands, said, "We are not information police, and I expect that in the whole of Europe nothing will happen."
But, added Mr. Borking, European governments will always take privacy protection seriously.
"We are at the beginning of a new information society, and no one really knows the outcome," he said. "But privacy and trust are important parts of this society."

HEADLINE: Trying to Resurrect A Palace of Junk;
City Longs for Folk Art of Depression That It Tore Down Long Ago

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER 

DATELINE: VINELAND, N.J.

 BODY:
Picture, if indeed you can, the kind of castle Dr. Seuss might have built had he moonlighted on a Chevrolet assembly line.
Cartoonish spires of hand-packed muck rise ludicrously over prim New England gables while iron bedsteads stand as gates in front of auto-fender archways. Doors are made from baby cribs, walls from bricks and bottle caps. In every corner, the scraps of industry are pressed into the service of its maker's dream. 
 The dreamer was George Daynor, a former gold prospector from the Klondike, and his unusual vision was a mansion of junk called the Palace of Depression. With just $4 in his pocket, Mr. Daynor left Alaska in 1929, hitchhiked to Vineland and bought an auto dump. From the scrap parts, he built a home of struts and rubber bumpers with his own two hands and named it after the economic calamity that beset the nation.
More than 300,000 people came to visit Mr. Daynor's temple of trash before the city razed it after his death in 1964. But if the axle bits and lug nuts that made up the place have long since disappeared, the plucky spirit that it represents remains. And now, in a starry-eyed but serious effort to put this sprawling farm community on the tourist map again, city officials here have begun a plan to rebuild the Palace of Depression.
Today, all that remains of the once proud monument of junk is a crumbling exterior wall and a lonely gazebo of stone and mud that served for years as a ticket booth. But at its height, the Palace's fame was so widespread that Universal Pictures made a short film about it, "The Fantastic Castle," and the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey included it on its Esso continental road maps.
From New York City to southern Pennsylvania, headlines blared. "Builds Palace Out of Old Junk" and "Transforms Swamp Tract Into Paradise," they read.
"In its heyday, it was a huge tourist attraction, nationally known," said Kevin Kirchner, Vineland's director of licenses and inspections, who has undertaken the restoration effort. "I'm hoping that once we rebuild the place, it'll actually bring more people into town."
To that end, Mr. Kirchner has set in motion a plan to build a detailed replica of the original, reconstructing each and every goofy ornament, from the chimney made of mud flaps to the wagon-axle hearth. He plans to bring back Mr. Daynor's Knockout Room, a chamber where its builder jokingly offered to help those still suffering from their own depressions by dropping a 10-pound weight on their heads to batter them back to their senses.
He plans to restore the seashell mosaics and recreate the original interior well. He even plans to build a visitors' center, where tourists will be able to view a time line of the Palace's original construction and gaze on artifacts salvaged from the dig.
Since this summer, Mr. Kirchner has retained an architect, an engineer and several archeologists to help plan for the restoration. Now he is trying to raise the $400,000 he estimates it will cost to bring the Palace back to life.
Aside from money, however, the biggest obstacle confronting Mr. Kirchner's team is where to find the perfect junk. But like Mr. Daynor himself, he plans to use whatever materials are close at hand.
"I have body and fender guys standing by," he said. "And I have welders, too, if we can't find the stuff in a junkyard and have to make it ourselves. I figure the Cub Scouts can go out searching for tortoise shells and seashells, and the rest of the community will pitch in, too."
Amid the cornfields and tomato patches about 30 miles south of Philadelphia, Vineland is the sort of close-knit city where parking regulations are routinely ignored and everyone knows your name. On a weekday afternoon in October, a few cars formed a neighborly pontoon bridge in the middle of Landis Avenue while their drivers chatted leisurely. Later, in Mr. Kirchner's office, a crowd of people stood in line, offering unsolicited advice to a fellow resident who was trying to repair his roof.
In the midst of such small-town sociability, the Palace of Depression maintains an almost mythic grip on the minds of local residents, many of whom remember touring it as children.
"I was about 5 years old when my parents first took me through it," Mr. Kirchner said. "I had nightmares for weeks. But later, as a building inspector, I was always curious how the man managed to build that thing."
In "The Fantastic Castle," Mr. Daynor comes across as a gnomish man, bearded and burly, who is more than pleased to lead visitors through his prized possession. He is eccentric, voluble and charming, and obviously loves to lecture to the movie cameras.
In fact, Mr. Daynor was a notorious publicity hound, several residents who knew him said, the sort of man who mailed personalized greeting cards to scores of newspaper reporters every Christmas with a picture of the Palace and its builder.
In one of his stranger public moments, in 1952, he accused two agents of the Cuban Government of ambushing him in a taxi outside the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and stealing back a suitcase filled with the one million Cuban pesos he said he had just won in the Cuban National Lottery. Though Mr. Daynor tried to wrest the money from the Cuban Government, he failed when New York City detectives later said they had no record of his presence in the city on the night he claimed the theft occurred.
Five years later, he was convicted of obstruction of justice and jailed for a year for lying to Federal agents investigating the abduction of a 4-month-old Long Island boy, Peter Weinberger. In a brazen publicity stunt, Mr. Daynor had told the agents that the kidnappers had been to the Palace of Depression four days after the baby disappeared, an utter lie. He had simply been following the case in the newspaper and wanted to generate headlines.
Mr. Kirchner said he would drive past the weedy clearing where the Palace once stood and stop to meditate on the genuine chutzpah of Mr. Daynor's ambition. Alone in his car, he said, he would think to himself, "Now here's a guy who had to build something with his own bare hands." But it was not until the town was poised to auction the site in 1997 that Mr. Kirchner went into action.
Like the Palace's original builder, Mr. Kirchner said he initially suffered the ridicule of city officials. But in a recent interview, Mayor Anthony Campanella said he was thrilled that the Palace of Depression might come back to life.
"We're largely a farming community down here, with a fairly thriving glass industry," Mayor Campanella said, "but outside that there's really nothing for the tourists. The Palace of Depression would really be something for tourists to see because a lot pass through on their way to Atlantic City or the Jersey Shore."
Mr. Kirchner said community support for his efforts had been tremendous. Bits and pieces of the Palace, long hidden in local basements or displayed on mantels, have been coming out of the woodwork: statues made from bottle caps and crushed glass, for instance. And dozens of residents have volunteered to help with the excavation.
"Every little piece we've already recovered is a bit of Americana," said Robert Blough, Vineland's zoning officer, who works with Mr. Kirchner. "This guy's story is the story of America. It shows real ingenuity and craftiness, and what kind of people we really are."
Delbert J. Brant, a retired newspaper reporter who now serves as Vineland's informal municipal historian, said that there had been another effort to rebuild the Palace in the early 1970's but that it failed from a lack of money.
"This is the first serious attempt since then," he said. "It's going to be tough. There's not as much standing now as there was back then. But I think it'll be very interesting to see what they come up with."
Other small towns around the nation have managed to ignite their own tourist industries with off-kilter attractions. Vineland is hoping that the Palace of Depression can attain the same sort of wacky acclaim achieved by Cadillac Ranch, a set piece of a half-dozen or so rusting Cadillacs plunged hood deep in the scrub grass off Interstate 40 in Amarillo, Tex., or Carhenge, a life-size replica of Stonehenge made from junkers, which lies in a field off Federal Highway 385 two miles north of Alliance, Neb.
And plenty of other people here share Mr. Kirchner's confidence that the plan will succeed.
"It'll rejuvenate our city and put us back on the map internationally," said James Forcinito, the Sheriff of Cumberland County, who was born and raised in Vineland.
"I went through the Depression era, and you've got to admire what this man did," he added.

HEADLINE: Student Jailed After Instructor Is Threatened

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
A University of Maryland senior remained in a county jail today after the campus police said he threatened a teaching assistant in an attempt to receive an A on a test he had not taken.
University of Maryland police officers arrested Stephen Clancy Hill, a 22-year-old economics major, near his home in Riverdale, Md., on Oct. 14. He was charged with first-degree assault, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony, carrying a concealed deadly weapon and possessing a deadly weapon on school grounds. 
 Mr. Hill had requested a private meeting in the mathematics building with a teaching assistant, Alvaro Alvarez-Parrilla, on Oct. 9, two days after missing the test, the police said.
On Oct. 12, they said, Mr. Hill met with Mr. Alvarez-Parrilla in his office, lifting his jacket to reveal a handgun he carried in a shoulder holster and threatening to "make him disappear" if Mr. Alvarez-Parrilla did not give Mr. Hill an A on the test. When Mr. Alvarez-Parrilla said he would not comply, Mr. Hill left the office without hurting him, the police said. The teaching assistant reported the incident to the police that day.
"It was a real threat that we had to investigate," said Capt. Mary Brock of the University of Maryland police.
The police obtained a search warrant for Mr. Hill's home and car, and officers arrested Mr. Hill in his car at a traffic intersection. A loaded 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun and three loaded magazines were found in Mr. Hill's car and a shoulder holster was recovered at his home, the officers said.
Mr. Hill is being held on $15,000 bond at Prince George's County Detention Center. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Nov. 10.
The incident caused concern on the campus in College Park, Md. But James Bentley, a sophomore, said he was not surprised by the arrest. "I had seen him carrying around the weapon with bullets in his pocket," Mr. Bentley said of Mr. Hill. "When I asked him why he carried the gun, he said it was for people who get on his bad side."
Mr. Hill's lawyer, Rosalyn E. Pugh, said: "When the facts are out, I'm sure Mr. Hill will be vindicated. There's more to this story than meets the eye."

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: WASHINGTON;
Democrat or Republican, Woman Will Be Winner

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: BELLEVUE, Wash., Oct. 23

 BODY:
Patty Murray swept into the United States Senate in 1992's "Year of the Woman" in the wake of national outrage over the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee's handling of sexual harassment accusations against a Supreme Court nominee. Six years later, in Ms. Murray's campaign, a woman is once again standing up for feminist values on the campaign trail -- "fighting against leches in the workplace who hit on young women," as she puts it.
But the candidate saying these things is not Senator Murray, a Democrat, who says she must remain an "impartial juror" in case President Clinton is impeached. Instead, it is her conservative Republican opponent, Representative Linda Smith, whose ire is on high alert. "The feminist movement," Ms. Smith says, "needs to stand up against any man who would use women like pieces of meat like our President has." 
 For just the third time in the nation's history, two women are running against each other for the Senate. In California and Illinois, other women elected to the Senate with Ms. Murray are in serious danger of losing to men this year. But Washington State, which boasts the highest percentage of women in the Legislature of any state, is certain to send a woman back to the Senate. It is just that voters here are facing a choice between two very different women.
In some ways, the race between Senator Murray and Representative Smith, both 48, is a vivid illustration of the increasing political prominence of women, whose numbers are at a record high in both the United States House (54) and Senate (9), though many feminist leaders regret that no woman has yet emerged as a dominant national political figure.
But even as Ms. Murray and Ms. Smith cite their experience as working mothers and talk about the importance of having a woman's perspective in the Senate, it is also clear that they have wide differences over what it means to have that perspective.
Ms. Smith's challenge shows that even as Democratic women in office or as candidates still outnumber their Republican counterparts, the gap has been closing, according to statistics compiled by the Center for the American Woman and Politics at Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute. (In House and Senate elections on Nov. 3, 82 Democrats and 49 Republicans on the ballot are women, an overall number that ties a record set in 1996.)
In short, the politics of women circa 1998 looks much more complicated and ideologically diverse than it did six years ago. Just having more women elected to office does not guarantee that any particular policies will be favored in Congress.
Senator Murray, for instance, is one of the most reliable abortion-rights supporters in the Senate, while Representative Smith is staunchly anti-abortion, and they have clashed strongly over the issue in this campaign, especially on whether to outlaw the procedure that critics call partial-birth abortion.
In a recent debate in Seattle, Ms. Murray said that no woman wants to find out late in her pregnancy that continuing it could threaten her life or health, and she said that criminalizing a decision for abortion at that point would be totally unwarranted.
"We, the Congress, shouldn't be the ones telling her she should go to jail," Ms. Murray said. "That decision should be made between her, her doctor and her faith."
But Ms. Smith castigated Ms. Murray as one of the "radical senators" who favored the "barbaric practice" of late-term abortion. And she has consistently expressed her own opposition to all abortions, including in cases of rape or incest.
Then there is the matter of President Clinton's relationship with a White House intern, one that Ms. Smith, has sought to cast as an albatross around Ms. Murray's neck.
"She said of Clarence Thomas stronger things, that he should not serve, and she said of Packwood very strong things, that he should step down," Ms. Smith said in an interview, speaking of Ms. Murray's reactions to earlier cases involving a Supreme Court nominee and a United States Senator, Bob Packwood of Oregon, facing accusations of harassing women. "You treat this issue equally, and if you've got a man abusing the power, taking advantage of younger women who are subordinates, then you speak out consistently."
Still, there is not much evidence that Ms. Murray has been seriously damaged by Ms. Smith's attacks on the issue. Ms. Murray has said several times that she is "disappointed" in the President's behavior but, unlike Ms. Smith, who has both suggested that the President resign and supported his impeachment, Ms. Murray argues that it is inappropriate for someone who may cast a Senate vote in an impeachment trial to be so adamant on the issue.
Most analysts continue to see much evidence that Senator Murray has the upper hand. The most recent statewide poll, conducted by Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research , shows Ms. Murray leading Ms. Smith by 51 percent to 38 percent. Ms. Smith, who has never lost an election and has toppled seemingly entrenched Democratic opponents, says she is undaunted by the polls.
Ms. Murray has more money, for several reasons, at least one of which reflects just how much partisan stereotypes have been turned topsy-turvy in this race.
While Republicans are often seen as the favored candidates of corporate interests, the reverse is true here, in no small part because Ms. Smith remains a bitter foe of some of the biggest free-trade pacts negotiated by Congress in recent years, a position that riles many business leaders here in one of the nation's most trade-dependent states.
Ms. Smith is a caustic critic of China, which she accuses of flooding the American market with "slave-labor camp goods," and she is the only member of the state's Congressional delegation to vote against continuing normal trade status.
That is a position that her supporters cast as one of tremendous courage, and for which some human rights groups have praised her, but it is also one that Ms. Murray describes as both naive and harmful to the state's economic interests.
"We aren't going to have our wheat or apples in China if we stop trading with them, as Linda has voted to do," Ms. Murray said in the Seattle debate.
Ms. Smith's ability to raise campaign money is also severely hampered by another stand she says she has taken on principle. She is a proponent of overhauling campaign finance laws, and her criticism of Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican of Kentucky who is a chief opponent of such legislation, has hurt her in the campaign pocketbook.
Mr. McConnell, who heads the National Republican Senatorial Committee, could give as much as $540,000 to Ms. Smith's campaign, which is well behind Ms. Murray's in campaign commercials. But even as it has poured more than $1 million into the campaign of Treasurer Matt Fong of California to unseat Senator Barbara Boxer, the Democratic incumbent, the national Republicans have given only a little more than $100,000 to Ms. Smith.
For all their ideological differences, Ms. Murray and Ms. Smith, who served together in the Washington State Senate, share many similarities in their careers. Both come from working-class backgrounds and took an interest in a local issue -- schools, in Ms. Murray's case, and high taxes, in Ms. Smith's -- and turned it into a signature cause that helped propel them into office. And both have stunned incumbents in making it there.
Representative Smith, a grandmother of six whose husband, Vern, is a locomotive engineer, waged a successful write-in campaign in 1994 to become the Republican candidate in the Third Congressional District, encompassing Vancouver, where she lives, and the southwestern part of the state. Ms. Smith has relied on an extensive, intensely dedicated cadre of volunteers, which she calls "Linda's Army" and whose members tend to share her conservative, Christian beliefs.
Senator Murray, on the other hand, rode her experience as a school-board member in suburban Seattle to the State Legislature, and, virtually unknown in most of the state, she sailed to a remarkable victory in the 1992 Senate race after the incumbent Democrat vacated the seat when he stumbled over sexual-harassment accusations.
In that campaign, Ms. Murray had been dismissed by a male politician as "just a Mom in tennis shoes" who could not get anything major accomplished, and she turned that tag line on its head, embracing the shoes and turning them into perhaps the most memorable political image of the "Year of the Woman."
While Senator Murray is known for her low-key style, Ms. Smith is a bombastic speaker and she revels in her maverick image. One of a handful of Republicans who voted against Newt Gingrich's re-election as House Speaker, she once likened the Speaker to a fat child who gobbles up everybody else's food (she later apologized).
As the challenger, Ms. Smith has almost surely been hurt by the amount of time she has had to spend back in Washington, D.C., this fall as Congress labored to come up with a budget agreement. It is time she could have used to campaign more and to raise money to get her commercials on the air, but she said that she had no regrets.
"You just have to keep priorities right," Ms. Smith said. "And my job is to try to keep track of what was going on back there.
"I couldn't come home and do that," she added. "So I decided that I would make that choice. It would be a sacrifice but I would rather lose than not do what I am supposed to be doing."

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN -- GEORGIA;
Republicans Looking to End 126 Years of One-Party Rule

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Oct. 25

 BODY:
For the last eight years, Georgia has boomed, and it has done so under Democratic rule. The state has created jobs faster than any state east of the Mississippi. Its population has exploded by 16 percent, the highest growth in the South. It has eliminated the state tax on groceries. Its five-year-old lottery has provided college scholarships for 319,000 college students and pre-kindergarten classes for 246,000 others.
But deep problems have gone unaddressed under Democratic rule as well. The state's educational system remains troubled; Georgia students ranked 49th this year on the S.A.T.'s. Atlanta, which has driven the state's economic growth, has become clogged with traffic and soiled by pollution. 
 And so this year's race for governor has centered on whether Georgia's glass is half full or half empty. Have the Democrats earned the right to add to their 126 years of uninterrupted rule, or has this state, like much of the South, become so Republican that party labels will obscure considerations of experience?
The race between Roy E. Barnes, a longtime Democratic legislator, and his Republican opponent, Guy W. Millner, an entrepreneur, is significant because Georgia is the only state that has not elected a Republican governor since Reconstruction.
Mr. Barnes, 50, represents Cobb County, a heavily Republican Atlanta suburb. He presents himself as a qualified steward of the state's recent progress. Mr. Millner, 62, who lives in Atlanta's toniest neighborhood, offers himself as an agent of change who will protect the most successful Democratic programs while shaking up the government.
"This is a campaign going against a Democratic monopoly that's been in our state for a long time," Mr. Millner said today in a debate televised by Atlanta's WSB.
Mr. Barnes counters that Democrats have made Georgia the magnet it is today. "I don't see all those negative things that Guy Millner sees," Mr. Barnes told Democrats at a fund-raiser in Atlanta last week. "I see a Georgia that prospers."
Mr. Millner, a founder of the Norrell Corporation, a temporary services firm, has narrowly lost runs for governor and United States senator in the last four years.
Mr. Barnes lost to Georgia Gov. Zell Miller in the 1990 gubernatorial primary. A lawyer and businessman, he has spent 22 years in the General Assembly, developing a conservative record. He voted against a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, a vote he says he regrets. He also initially opposed the state lottery.
The race has been expensive and hard fought, with accusations of racism and lying and a barrage of negative advertisements. Both campaigns expect to spend close to $10 million. Mr. Millner, whose wealth was estimated at $167 million, is likely to provide at least half of his campaign's financing, while Mr. Barnes has contributed about $850,000 of his own money. The most recent independent polling gave Mr. Millner a lead of 45 percent to 42 percent, a statistical dead heat.
Strategists on both sides report that the numbers have gone essentially unchanged for weeks, with party loyalists already committed and few issues seeming to move voters.
This weekend, Mr. Millner began running television advertisements accusing Mr. Barnes of supporting racial quotas. Mr. Barnes said he opposed quotas, though he voted against a bill this year to end affirmative action in Georgia.
The new advertisement, and Mr. Millner's constant criticism of Atlanta, which has a black mayor, have prompted Mr. Barnes to say his opponent plays "the race card" in a state that has prospered largely because it has avoided racial conflicts.
Mr. Millner has proposed eliminating Georgia's tax on automobile tags and reducing class sizes in schools by hiring 7,500 new teachers. To pay for them, Mr. Millner maintains that he can use a businessman's approach to cut 7 percent from the state budget.
Mr. Barnes's core proposals involve lower residential property taxes and greater choice of doctors for managed-care consumers. He scoffs at Mr. Millner's contention that he can find enough waste in the state budget to pay for his proposals.
"He doesn't understand that these things actually cost money," Mr. Barnes said today. "It's experience in running the state that makes us prosperous."
To reinforce that point, Mr. Barnes asked Mr. Millner today to explain how state revenue estimates were made, a question that gave Mr. Millner some trouble. Recently, Mr. Millner has fumbled when asked to explain important bills.
Mr. Millner said Mr. Barnes "can tell you every bill number line by line." But, he said, "is that what is needed?" He said Georgia needs a leader who will ask why new things cannot be tried. "Yes, I'm Pollyanna," he said. "I'm not willing to say we can't do it."

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE SENATE;
D'Amato and Schumer Focus on Issues in a Feisty Debate

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and Representative Charles E. Schumer laid out sharply different views on tax cuts, gun control and abortion rights yesterday, during a free-flowing, if clamorous, debate in which each Senate candidate struggled to set the agenda for the final week of his campaign.
In a debate marked by sarcastic retorts and repeated instances in which each man tried to talk over the other -- "Gentlemen, gentlemen, this is getting out of hand!" the moderator, Gabe Pressman, implored at one point in an effort to restore order -- Mr. Schumer and Mr. D'Amato spent much of their time trying to discredit each other's credentials. Mr. D'Amato once again asserted that Mr. Schumer had neglected his duties in Washington this year in order to campaign, while Mr. Schumer described Mr. D'Amato as untrustworthy and extreme. 
 But unlike the first debate, which took place 17 hours earlier in Schenectady, this one showed the two candidates, nudged by the moderator, in an exchange of views on issues that has largely been absent through much of this campaign.
Mr. Schumer assailed Mr. D'Amato for repeatedly voting against abortion rights and gun control and for supporting much of Speaker Newt Gingrich's Contract With America. Mr. D'Amato assailed Mr. Schumer for supporting a series of tax increases in Congress, opposing the 1996 welfare bill and voting against authorizing President George Bush to use force against Saddam Hussein in the Persian Gulf.
These exchanges of views were made, though, in anything but an orderly manner. Mr. Pressman is known for staging debates without rules, and both Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Schumer, two of the more combative politicians that New York has produced in the last 10 years, sought to make the most of that televised opportunity. They almost stumbled over each other grabbing for the questions, cutting each other off and talking over each other.
"Please let me finish, sir," Mr. Schumer said, as Mr. D'Amato challenged his assertions about his support for tax cuts. "I didn't interrupt you. So don't interrupt me."
At another point, Mr. D'Amato said, "You're being rude," and glared at Mr. Schumer as the Congressman badgered the Senator to account for his votes against abortion rights.
At one point, Mr. D'Amato wrinkled his face in exasperation as Mr. Schumer assailed his credibility. "Oh my God," he muttered, with a loud sigh.
"May I finish?" Mr. Schumer asked Mr. Pressman.
"Well, you never finish," Mr. D'Amato responded.
The two men, meeting in the second of the only two debates Mr. D'Amato would agree to, sat in gray armchairs at WNBC studios at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan. Mr. D'Amato was stern and mostly unsmiling, pointing his fingers and extending his arms to make his point. Mr. Schumer was more relaxed, staring straight into the camera as he spoke, slipping on a pair of black-rimmed reading glasses as he read portions of an editorial endorsing him in Newsday, as he tried to rebut Mr. D'Amato's criticism about his attendance record.
On crime, both men invoked different bills on which they differed in order to put themselves in the strongest light. Mr. D'Amato pointed to legislation that would, among other things, provide for extra penalties for crimes that were committed with a gun, and a bill that would require mandatory sentences for repeat felons.
Mr. Schumer heralded his crime bill, which included money for local police officers, a broadening of the Federal death penalty and tougher penalties for multiple offenders.
The two men demonstrated one clear difference on fighting crime: gun control. Mr. Schumer challenged Mr. D'Amato for opposing his bills to restrict the number of assault weapons and to license some handguns, setting off a tangled exchange between them.
"Senator, why are you opposed to them when so many New Yorkers want them?" Mr. Schumer asked, referring to the bills. "Can you answer the question?"
Mr. D'Amato responded by noting his efforts to pass legislation increasing penalties for crimes committed with guns. "Congressman, the difference in our approach is -- "
"Are you going to answer the question?" Mr. Schumer said.
Mr. D'Amato continued, "I'm for going after the criminal, as opposed to attempting to pass more laws."
On taxes, Mr. D'Amato repeatedly assailed Mr. Schumer for consistently voting in favor of Democratic tax bills over the years. Mr. D'Amato said that by his count, they added up to $1 trillion, "so when we call you a tax-and-spend liberal, it's there."
"I voted against raising those taxes on middle-class families, on farmers," Mr. D'Amato said. "The Congressman voted to tax everything that's alive, and even people who have died."
Referring to 1993 legislation pushed by Democrats to balance the budget -- with a combination of spending cuts and tax increases -- Mr. D'Amato added, "Yours was the deciding vote to have the greatest tax increase in the history of the country."
Mr. Schumer seized on Mr. D'Amato's opening to align himself with President Clinton, who remains extremely popular in New York. Mr. Clinton has argued that that bill laid the groundwork for the nation's current economic prosperity, including the elimination of the Federal deficit.
"The 1993 vote that President Clinton put together is a vote that turned America around." Mr. Schumer said. "It helped account for our present prosperity. It helped create hundreds of thousands of jobs. It helped do all kinds of things that the Republican Party had been unable to do and help balance the budget."
The two clashed as well on abortion rights. Mr. D'Amato, without ever noting outright that he opposes abortion rights, argued that there should be tolerance of different views on the issue.
"It's a matter of conscience," said Mr. D'Amato, who is running with the support of the Right to Life Party. "And it's a contentious issue. And I can't change on it. And people know where I stand. But I have voted for these exceptions 18 times. And here's the record. And the Congressman would try to becloud that."
Mr. D'Amato was referring to legislation that allowed for abortion in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life was in danger. But Mr. Schumer noted that Mr. D'Amato had voted just as often for bills that included no such exemptions.
"How can New Yorkers trust a man like Al D'Amato on this issue?" Mr. Schumer said. "You know, I do respect your view, Senator. And there is tolerance. I have lots of friends who have the same view as you. But have the decency, the honor and the courage to come clean and say that you are strongly pro-life and you believe in it. And I will say I'm pro-choice and I believe in it. And we'll let the chips fall where they may."

HEADLINE: ON PRO FOOTBALL;
For DeBerg, One Battle That He Lost

BYLINE: By Mike Freeman 

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.

 BODY:
Steve DeBerg is 44 years old and trying to play in a sport where old guys are swallowed up like raw meat in a zoo. That creaking noise you heard yesterday was DeBerg's knees when he walked onto the field as the starting quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons.
Don't get too caught up in the comeback story of DeBerg, who replaced the injured Chris Chandler. It turned out to be an ugly fable as DeBerg was overmatched in the Jets' 28-3 victory over the Falcons. He became the oldest starting quarterback in the National Football League, and looked every day of it. 
 The most impressive part of DeBerg's story is not that he is playing, but the journey he took to get to this point. Though DeBerg has been in football since the 1970's, his rebirth really began in 1996, when Falcons Coach Dan Reeves and his assistants, including DeBerg, were fired by the Giants. Every one of those coaches got other jobs -- except DeBerg. No team wanted him, so in a span of only a few years DeBerg went from unemployed to Falcons quarterbacks coach to the old man in the sea of bodies. It has been both a glorious and painful trip.
Reeves hired DeBerg as the Giants' quarterbacks coach in 1995, a move that shocked many. DeBerg had wanted to get into coaching for several years, but the worst-kept secret in the league was that no team would hire him because of a belief that he had a drinking problem. In fact, when the Giants hired him, several executives from other teams called to warn the Giants.
For the most part, DeBerg was able to keep the fight with his personal demons from spilling into the public eye. At least until an embarrassing episode in January 1996, when he was stopped by the police while driving in Manhattan at 1:50 A.M., traveling eastbound on a westbound street, according to a police report. DeBerg, who told the police he had had five beers that night, was charged with driving while intoxicated, driving while impaired and driving the wrong way on a one-way street. His license was automatically revoked because he refused a Breathalyzer test, the report said. The charges were later dropped, and DeBerg received alcohol counseling as a result of the incident.
Many in the Giants organization, from players and assistant coaches to front-office executives, weren't surprised by the arrest. They knew about DeBerg's drinking problem, and were well aware of other instances of alcohol abuse.
With DeBerg also showing up late and missing staff meetings, Reeves eventually tired of the incidents and gave him a stern warning to straighten up or face being fired. DeBerg apologized to the staff.
That was almost two years ago. This past off season, after being out of football for more than a year, DeBerg reunited with Reeves as the Falcons' quarterbacks coach. DeBerg said in interviews this summer that he now drinks only in moderation.
There are athletes who fall into the pit and never crawl out. DeBerg apparently has. Now comes another tough battle: playing in an N.F.L. that is so fast and brutal that no one DeBerg's age has any chance of excelling. DeBerg's mobility is terrible and since the Jets know his arm strength is weak, they blitzed him relentlessly. In just under three quarters, he was 9 for 20 for 117 yards with an interception. Often, because of the continual pressure, DeBerg lobbed the ball harmlessly in the air.
DeBerg was sacked three times, and his fumble in the second quarter was returned for a touchdown. And what may not endear DeBerg to teammates is that after the game, he seemed to blame everyone but himself for what turned out to be a miserable day for the Falcons.
"From top to bottom it seemed we were outperformed, from the playing side of it, to the coaching side of it, pretty much the whole deal," he said.
DeBerg has what he wants -- another chance to play in the N.F.L. But that died on the field today. He was so bad that he will not start another game unless all the quarterbacks on the Falcons' roster come down with the bubonic plague. Where DeBerg's success has come is off the field.
If it is true he has controlled his drinking, that is something more impressive than anything he has ever done on the field, or will ever do.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
When Millionaires are Laid Off

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
Two months after the National Basketball Association's lockout came and his paycheck went, Kenny Anderson began contemplating the unthinkable. It had nothing to do with asking his mother in Queens for his old room back or taking a part-time security job; he figured there were only so many indignities young millionaires should have to face.
But with his penchant for buying what he wanted and his accountant having to borrow against his stocks to keep investing, Anderson realized it might be time to do without. Sort of. 
 "I was thinking about selling one of my cars," he said recently, laughing. "I don't need all of them. You know, just get rid of the Mercedes."
After all, he can always fall back on the Porsche Carrera, the customized Range Rover or the Lexus sedan. When you have eight vehicles registered in your name or your wife's, there are choices.
Insurance and maintenance on the cars and sport utility vehicles have been costing Anderson about $75,000 a year. Throw in a mortgage in New York, rent in Los Angeles, four daughters, one marketing company, an agent's cut and legal fees, and a rough portfolio of the veteran N.B.A. player begins to emerge.
He is often fabulously wealthy, but sometimes the opulent life style collides with a monstrous tax bracket. Tremendous financial obligations mount quickly, which can sometimes lead to economic insecurity for even some of the game's highest-paid players.
"A lot of people can't understand why the owners and players are fighting over money and how it might hurt the season," said Anderson, referring to the league's growing labor chasm. "I'd be upset too if I was a fan, paying our salaries. But it's like they say: the more you make, the more you spend. And right now, without my check, I have to start getting tight."
Anderson, the 28-year-old point guard of the Boston Celtics, was due his entire $5.8 million salary for the 1998-99 season on July 1 -- the day N.B.A. owners declared a lockout after the collective bargaining agreement expired.
He is one of more than 20 players who were supposed to get paid during the summer but did not, and one of 226 players with guaranteed contracts who will not be paid for the first two weeks of the season, which were canceled on Oct. 13.
More cancellations may follow, and if more than 30 games are cut from the 82-game schedule, the league will strongly consider not playing the season. The N.B.A. hopes that the financial pressure this will place on the players will eventually divide them and prompt the union to sign an agreement that slows the growth of salaries and puts a ceiling on how much one player can earn.
As a measure of how severely the players' resolve will be tested, Anderson is losing $76,000 a game.
"I wouldn't want to miss the season, not just for financial reasons but losing a year of my playing career," said Anderson, a seven-year veteran. "But if I had to, I can. I've been without before.
"The guy I feel bad for is the one with the two- or three-year deal and now their contract is up. In that case, I think people will have their own agendas. It's going to be sticky. There might be some guys branching off, saying, 'I can't do this.' Not being in their situation, I can't blame them. When that happens, everyone will go, 'Oh, he's selling out.' But, hey, you got to live."
Scott Bercu, Anderson's Manhattan-based accountant, said, "These guys have got to concede for a very simple reason: they're losing money every time they don't play a game."
In addition to players like Anderson, who at least are under contract even if they are not being paid, there are nearly 200 registered free agents who have some of the same bills that Anderson has. Having signed a seven-year deal worth $49 million with the Portland Trail Blazers two years ago, Anderson is in a much better position than many of his peers. His contract average of $7 million a year does not compare with Michael Jordan's $33 million deal, but his annual income dwarfs the league's average salary of $2.6 million. But for now, the cash-flow problem is the same.
"I've had to sell some mutual funds and borrow against stocks to keep investing," Anderson said. "I've got enough to hold me over. And I definitely don't want anyone feeling sorry for me. I mean, when you make money like we do, it's pretty hard to get public sympathy. But it's all relative to your life style and obligations."
In his midtown Manhattan office, Bercu punches up Anderson's finances on a computer screen. In a blink, you learn that playing basketball for a living does not only guarantee you celebrity and wealth; there are mounds of checks to sign, too.
Anderson, his wife, Tami Akbar, and their two daughters, Lyric, 4, and Kenni, 2, live in a five-bedroom home in Beverly Hills. The pastel peach house has large pillars, a four-car garage and a gazebo in the backyard. Two stories below are a pool and tennis and basketball courts. The monthly rent is $12,500.
Anderson pays $7,200 in monthly child support for Danielle, 8, and Kristinise, 5, who were born to different women. He has been involved in each child's life as much as he can be during the season.
"They can burn a hole in your pocket real quick," he said. "I'm not saying it in a funny way, but you've got your schooling, day care, nanny. It just goes on and on."
Anderson also pays $3,000 a month on mortgage, property taxes and maintenance for his mother's home on Long Island. Of the $5.8 million he is supposed to receive this year, the agent David Falk, who negotiated the contract, is entitled to 4 percent -- $232,000. Bercu said Anderson's legal and accounting fees run about $175,000 annually.
And then there is Kenny the Kid Enterprises, Anderson's fledgling marketing company, based in Century City, Calif., which at this point does not bring in as much money as it spends. Run by his longtime friend Rodney Henry, the company exists essentially to handle all of Anderson's day-to-day operations and appearances. A clothing line is in its infant stages. The company also books musical talent for outlets like BET (Black Entertainment Television) and helps further the acting career of Anderson's wife, who has done commercials was once a regular on MTV's "Real World."
With teams unable to provide daily public-relations assistance to every player, and with agents like Falk too burdened with other prominent clients to concentrate on promotion, many players are hiring or developing their own marketing firms. The cost for five employees, office space, supplies and telephone for Kenny the Kid runs $250,000 a year.
"Kenny doesn't live a life of Riley; he doesn't have unlimited money," Bercu said. "Without many shelters and at such a high tax rate, he's literally a partner with the Government. Of the $5.8 million, I'd say he probably sees about $3 million."
Anderson said he used to give family members and friends loans of $3,000 to $5,000, but he has stopped doing that since the lockout began.
"I've got to get tight," he said. "I've cut back on certain things I usually do. You got to watch your money when it comes to family. I have to say no now even though I don't want to say no."
Bercu said: "He calls them loans, but I call them gifts. He's too generous and sweet sometimes for his own good. Especially when it's family. But then, when you come from where he came from. . . ."
A New York schoolboy legend at Archbishop Molloy High School in Queens, Anderson has played for four teams the last three seasons. Once regarded as an heir apparent to the N.B.A. career assist leader John Stockton, Anderson has weathered injury and expectation while settling into a role of a solid playmaker the last several seasons. If his career lasts more than 10 years, he will be among the fortunate players.
"His life is really a short-lived life from a financial point of view," Bercu said. "One of the things I do for Kenny is invest for him, so I rely on money coming in to set aside long-term savings. Before the lockout began, we started borrowing against his stocks. We're talking a substantial loan. And then with the losses in the market. You know they're going to rebound. Still, for a lot of these guys without their salary checks, it's a bit of a nightmare situation."
Anderson is not clipping coupons yet. A rough estimate of his total financial obligations, not including personal expenses, runs $1 million annually, leaving him with $2 million in reserve. Anderson is allotted $10,000 a month by Bercu, "hanging-out money," as he likes to call it. Tami gets $3,500 from a special household account.
His favorite car is his 1995 Mercedes SL500 metallic red sedan -- one of eight vehicles in a price range from $50,000 to $120,000.
"Those cars are extremely hard to insure," Bercu said. "Because of a couple of speeding tickets, we've had lots of difficulties. But what can you do? Ballplayers are into cars and jewelry. It's what they like. You can't help it."
Extravagant and expensive tastes have been a hallmark of young millionaire athletes. But without games and paychecks, N.B.A. players are about to learn the frugal side of living large. How long many of them can cope without a biweekly salary may mean the difference in their economic game of chicken with the owners.
"I just look at it as when this thing finally gets done, I get my money," Anderson said.

Evanescent Season In a Timeless Place

BYLINE: By Nelson Bryant 

DATELINE: ENFIELD, N.H.

 BODY:
Rarely, over a period of more than 40 years, have I enjoyed brilliant success when fishing for Cole Pond's brook trout, but I keep trying.
Each fall, the tug of Cole Pond becomes almost irresistible. Atop a forested hill at an elevation of 1,376 feet, this 17-acre body of water, more than 50 feet deep in the middle, is surrounded by the reds and yellows of maples, birch and beech in October, and often during the hike up to it, one hears the throbbing wings of departing ruffed grouse. The only man-made structure on the pond shore is the fireplace of a cabin that burned down decades ago. A now-deceased friend of mine, Vic Pomiecko of Claremont, N.H., and I occasionally waited out storms in that cabin, and for many seasons we stashed a raft -- made of nylon cord and saplings -- in the woods on the east side of the pond, lashing inner tubes beneath it for flotation.
 Most of Cole Pond's shoreline does not permit fly-fishing, there being no room for a back cast. It does, however, offer a few locations for the land-based fly rod devotee, and if one is willing to pack waders there is a cove with a hard, sandy bottom just east of where the trail reaches the pond. From the mouth of that cove, a wading angler can cover a 30-yard stretch with a long line. Nonetheless, those truly serious about catching trout would do well to bring an inflatable raft or a float tube. 
 Unlike many anglers, I favor waters I know and quarry I encountered in my New England boyhood. New England has been my home for more than seven decades. I revel in the familiar and at the same time am bedeviled by it. On the island of Martha's Vineyard, where I have spent most of my life, the lanes and roads, beaches, salt ponds and marshes are redolent with memories, some pleasant, some searing. And so it is with the hills, streams, ponds and lakes of New Hampshire where for nearly 20 years I sought economic sustenance as a journalist and fled to the woods for spiritual nourishment, renewing acquaintances with mountainside homesteads abandoned a century before, stone walls wandering through the woods, once-prized apple trees thrusting up through stands of encroaching conifers or a never-failing spring emerging from the base of a granite ledge.
When my companion Ruth Kirchmeier and I visited Cole Pond early this October, I observed that the moderately stiff mile-long uphill hike had taken 45 minutes, 15 minutes more than it did 40 years ago when I was a lad of 35.
"Don't fret, you made it yet another time," she replied, and set forth for a walk about the pond to see if the high-bush blueberries she had found up there at the same time last year were available. They were not. There would be no Cole Pond blueberry pie when we got home.
Three other fishermen, all young, visited the pond in the two days we were there. The first had no waders or boots. He stood on the shore skillfully directing his back cast into a narrow opening behind him and had taken one trout about a foot long before we arrived. The second angler arrived with an inflated float tube strapped to his pack, which contained a pair of waders. On the second day, the third arrived, waders in his pack and a float tube in a satchel, accompanied by a golden retriever. All three listened politely to a gray-bearded old man puffing on a pipe intent on telling what he had learned about a pond he had fished before they were born.
In 1946, Cole Pond was reclaimed; existing populations of suckers, chain pickerel, sunfish and horned pout were removed and brook trout were introduced. Since that time, it has been managed for trout. Over the years it has yielded quite a few brook trout of more than 2 pounds and at least one of about 5 pounds has been taken from it. Only fly-fishing is allowed on Cole Pond. As of this year, all trout between 12 and 16 inches had to be released and only two fish could be kept daily, both less than 12 inches or one less than 12 and one more than 16. The intent of this so-called slot limit is to provide a quality fishery for large trout. The fishing season on Cole Pond closed Oct. 15.
Ruth filled her sketch pad and poked about the pond while I fished, finding an otter slide, where the scat was laden with indigestible bits of crayfish, a species stocked in the pond in 1954. Last year when Ruth and I were there, I had been startled by three otters rising from the water less than 50 feet in front of me.
This year, I caught only one trout each day, both a little less than a foot long, although once, late on the first day, a trout of 2 pounds or more made a pass at my Muddler Minnow as I was lifting it from the water. A bit more action would have been pleasing, but I was not dissatisfied, even though I consider myself reasonably adept at the esoteric art of still-water fly-fishing for trout.
We had, after all, begun our fall sojourn at the century-old Meccawe Trout Club in Reading, Vt., as guests of John J. Houlihan, a Claremont, N.H., dentist. There, using advice given to me by the club's caretaker, John Paiva, I had caught 11 brook trout in one day on the club's 10-acre man-made pond, keeping four that Ruth and I savored while seated before the blazing fireplace in the cavernous lodge where the interior adornments include a tattered fishing hat worn by President Calvin Coolidge, who was, I was told, a frequent club guest. The mainstay of another evening meal was four woodcock given to us by Houlihan, who had gone bird hunting that morning.
We took the brace of Cole Pond trout back to the Vineyard, drank a toast to the pond and to my departed buddy Vic, then enjoyed the fish with an almond-butter sauce, brown rice, a salad made from our cold frame lettuce and a pie made with apples plucked from an abandoned homestead tree.

HEADLINE: Election of Rivals in Brazil Hurts Cardoso Reform Plans

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Rivals of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso won important victories in gubernatorial races today, handing the recently re-elected President a complex landscape for pushing through long-delayed government and economic reforms.
In Sao Paulo, however, Brazil's most populous and wealthiest state, Mario Covas appeared likely to win re-election as Governor, defeating Sao Paulo's former Mayor, Paulo Maluf. Although Mr. Maluf's party forms part of the President's governing coalition, Mr. Cardoso had endorsed Mr. Covas. Mr. Maluf is known as a big spender with presidential ambitions of his own. His victory could have complicated President Cardoso's efforts to control state spending and win congressional approval for reforms. 
 Despite considerable foreign pressure on Brazil to demonstrate how it will restructure its government to reduce deficits, Mr. Cardoso has put off announcing his plans, fearing that doing so could damage the chances of his allies in the elections today. The delay costs Brazil heavily; each day, the country loses hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign reserves, and the longer it maintains interest rates over 40 percent, the deeper its recession and debt are growing.
With Brazil's solvency seen as crucial to maintaining the economic stability of Latin America and protecting the United States from recession, the United States and the International Monetary Fund are preparing to chip in toward a Brazilian aid package of at least $30 billion.
Mr. Cardoso won re-election on the first round of voting earlier this month, but partial results tonight showed left-of-center candidates leading in some of the most developed states.
Senator Pedro Piva of the President's Brazilian Social Democracy Party called today's elections "a warning sign for the Government," adding, "I think we're going to have difficulties ahead to approve this package."
The Governors are important because they control a considerable share of the national budget and act as natural leaders of their parties in Congress. States will be called upon to cut their budgets by as much as 20 to 30 percent, which will mean laying off civil servants. Current laws allow the states to dismiss workers if the payroll exceeds 60 percent of the state budget; under a new law the administration is proposing, layoffs would become mandatory once that ceiling is reached.
In Rio de Janeiro, Anthony Garotinho, a former Mayor of the city of Campos who belongs to the leftist Democratic Workers' Party, was leading over Cesar Maia, a conservative former Mayor of Rio.
In Rio Grande do Sul in the south, Olivio Dutra of the Workers' Party was also leading over the incumbent, Antonio Britto, an ally of President Cardoso.
In Minas Gerais, former President Itamar Franco had a wide lead over the incumbent, Eduardo Azeredo, also of Mr. Cardoso's centrist Brazilian Social Democracy Party. Though Mr. Franco's party belongs to the governing coalition, he has been critical of President Cardoso's economic policies and personally stung by the President's re-election.
In 1993, President Franco appointed Mr. Cardoso Finance Minister, and began the economic plan that would make Mr. Cardoso a hero to a people weary of hyperinflation. But Mr. Franco was humiliated at his party's convention this year, when he sought to run for President against Mr. Cardoso. He was not only turned down, but laughed at.
Tonight, Senator Maguito Vilela, of Mr. Franco's Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, said backing for Mr. Cardoso's reforms would not be automatic. The party would not support tax increases, he said, noting that one tax slated for increase, on financial transfers, was initially approved as a temporary measure to finance hospitals, but ended up going to offset the deficit. "It just burdened people and didn't do anything to improve health care," he said.
Asked on television which measures his party would endorse, Senator Vilela said, "If it means more sacrifice for the people," his party "will not support it."

HEADLINE: Market Puts Price Tags on the Priceless

SERIES: IN SEARCH OF A CHILD: The Baby Bazaar -- Second of three articles.

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

 BODY:
The first commandment for couples wanting to adopt babies is: Put yourselves across. And they do, in spunky performances on videotapes, in lush scrapbooks and in professional portraiture smiling on the Internet.
Many speak on the Web pages that crowd electronic registries of "waiting families." Gloyd and Penny, for example, say, "We pray daily for our birth mother and baby -- whoever and wherever they are." David and Paula promise, "This child will be overwhelmed by love and affection." Rex and Carol wait, after 14 years of marriage, with a spaniel named Brittney and a vacation home four miles from Disney World. 
 This is the essence of demand -- unhappily infertile couples -- competing for a smaller and smaller supply of white American-born infants. It is an imbalance that professionals in the adoption world are calling a crisis, allowing money to play a defining role in determining who will succeed in this desperate quest for that which cannot be legally bought or sold.
"In this marketplace, it's a sad reality," said Graham Wright, president of the California Association of Adoption Agencies. "Luck enters into it, but it's like anything else in life: If you have enough money, you'll get what you think you want."
Many couples in search of a child are already depleted, emotionally and financially, by drawn-out fertility treatments. Still, they will pay $15,000 to $20,000 on average, even if they have to mortgage their futures, to find their babies. Some will spend much more before the day they appear in court to take legal custody of their children. And a few, people who have the money for intermediaries to do the work, pay up to $100,000 to bring home a newborn.
Adoption is, in a rough analogy to organ transplants, a legal transfer not subject to purchase or bidding. Nowhere in the United States is it legal to sell a child, and few say it should be. Nor can anyone sell the right to be an adoptive parent: that is conferred by the state, based on home studies conducted by social workers.
But scarcity has created a cast of thousands of intermediaries, who can and do sell access to the young women who might relinquish babies.
Access can be sold indirectly, by an Internet service that sells advertising space to couples, for example, or directly, by lawyers or unlicensed brokers known as "facilitators," who will either shop couples to pregnant women or recruit those who agree to let adoptive families be chosen for them.
This has left only the thinnest line between buying a child and buying adoption services that lead to a child. "The effect is the same," said Mr. Wright, whose agency, Future Families of Monterey Bay, places older children for adoption and foster care.
"Everywhere the baby boomers set their feet, a cottage industry springs up," said Bernie Riff, an adoptive father. Mr. Riff and his wife, Vicki Young, adopted their daughter, Jessi, 2, with the help of a facilitator after waiting a long time with an agency that gave them, in Ms. Young's words, "nothing but a binder."
"There are consultants and facilitators," Mr. Riff said. "There are photographers, there are all these little marketing things. People do videos. There's no limit to what you can spend on these things if you're inclined to and have the resources."
State-licensed adoption agencies, once strictly controlled charitable and paternalistic institutions, may be pained by the intrusion of commerce, but now they, too, advertise on bus shelters and billboards, and collect scrapbooks and videos from would-be parents to show to birth mothers. They mine connections with foreign orphanages. They do what they can do to increase their supply of children. It is just one measure of growth within this fragmented industry that the number of licensed child placement agencies has increased by several hundred in just three years, to 1,764, according to the National Adoption Information Clearinghouse.
The states impose standards on child-placement agencies requiring certified social workers to evaluate prospective parents, counsel birth mothers and get relinquishment papers signed. They limit payments that can go to birth mothers, who, above all, are not supposed to profit from adoption, and they require reports to the courts of all payments made by the adopting family.
But the laws differ from state to state, creating a tangle that itself keeps lawyers busy and would-be parents confounded. A few states, like Massachusetts and Connecticut, prohibit independent adoptions altogether; some that do allow it, like New York, hew to the traditional model and limit lawyers' roles; California, the most hospitable to the new entrepreneurialism, allows lawyers and facilitators to recruit prospective birth mothers on clients' behalf. Louisiana, known for its laxity, allows nonresidents to adopt and to pay extensive living expenses for pregnant women.
The process, while hardly simple, is basically the same everywhere. Every adopting couple typically begins with a home study. If parents adopt independently, they will probably advertise, although about a dozen states prohibit it. Pregnant women who respond or are referred to them are screened, and adoptive and biological parents exchange basic biographies. If all goes well, the adoptive parents pay modest pregnancy-related expenses for the birth mother and, shortly after birth, she legally relinquishes the child. (If the biological mother decides not to place the child, or, worse, tries to revoke her consent later, the adoptive parents have gambled and lost.) Six months to a year later, a court finalizes the adoption.
The costs for domestic infant adoptions range widely. Some people adopt infants, joyously and quickly, for $5,000 or $10,000 by locating a woman in their own state who has minimal expenses and is certain she wants to place her child. Placements by state agencies often cost nothing.
Then there are couples who pay sums approaching $100,000 for a closed adoption of a white newborn. These gray-market placements, which usually involve questionable payments to birth mothers and the brokers who find them, have prompted much legislation and public attention; still, they are a tiny percentage of adoptions.
Finally, the stamp of the marketplace is apparent in one troubling fact: In the baby bazaar, with children of varying colors, cultures and conditions, something resembling a price schedule has emerged.
At many agencies, race determines fees, said William Pierce, president of the National Council for Adoption, an advocacy group for agencies. "If you have 40 white couples chasing every white newborn, you don't need a lesson in economics," Mr. Pierce said.
 
The Product
Not Enough Babies To Meet the Demand
If adoption is a growth industry, it is not because of a major increase in adoptions.
No one keeps nationwide statistics on adoptions. The most reliable and recent data come from 1992, when researchers gathered statistics from state agencies for a report on adoptions published by the National Center for State Courts. The number of adoptions reported was 127,441, a figure that demographers believe has not changed appreciably. The authors of the report estimated that two-thirds were adopted by stepparents or relatives, or were older children placed from foster-care programs.
The other third, or about 43,000, constitute the heart of the industry: children, domestic and foreign, placed with nonrelatives. The National Council for Adoption estimates that infants, which it defines as children under age 2, account for 48 percent of all unrelated domestic adoptions or about 24,000 a year. At the same time, according to a rough estimate by the adoption council, about 1 million families are seeking to adopt.
"Adoption from a domestic standpoint is in a period of crisis," said Paige McCoy Smith, marketing coordinator for the Gladney Center in Fort Worth, one of the nation's biggest and oldest adoption agencies. Because less than 2 percent of unmarried pregnant women are placing their babies for adoption, they now have "the option to be very, very selective," she said.
Elizabeth Bartholet, a Harvard University law professor and adoption specialist with two adopted children, agrees. Among young pregnant women, she said, "most of the pressure they are subjected to is to either abort or keep."
A generation ago, unmarried, pregnant women did not have many options. Some went to places like Gladney or the Salvation Army's Booth homes, where they awaited birth while social workers chose adoptive parents.
Before 1973, the year that abortion was legalized, about 9 percent of births to unmarried women in the United States resulted in adoptions. By 1981 that percentage dropped to 4 percent, and by 1988 to 2 percent. While the number of unmarried women giving birth has risen each year at least since 1965, the net result is a slight decline in the number of American-born infants available for adoption.
The old-line agencies tried to adapt by letting birth mothers choose adoptive parents. But in the late 1970's, would-be parents began defecting to lawyers who could help them adopt independently if they -- or the lawyers -- could find a birth mother directly. The scramble also invited a new type of adoption agency, promising some edge.
American Adoptions of Overland Park, Kan., for example, has a "traditional program" in which pregnant women choose from an array of profiles of families, but it advises many clients to sign up instead for another program in which parents pay directly for advertisements, and young women who respond are shown the profile of that family first. In its letter to applicants, the agency says: "Most traditional adoption programs provide the birth parents with the opportunity to select their 'ideal' family. Where does that leave you?"
 
The Marketing
Advertising on Buses, Benches and Beyond
Marketing came naturally to Arty Elgart, who started a facilitation service after he adopted his son (from Gladney) 20 years ago. It was a matter of enthusiasm and altruism: Working out of his auto-parts warehouse in Philadelphia, he made matches as a favor for couples he knew, or friends of friends. By most accounts, including his own, no one had seen anything quite like it before. Mr. Elgart placed a small newspaper ad that asked, "PREGNANT? Young couple wishes to adopt baby. Call Mary, 289-2229."
In the view of the sedate nonprofit agencies that dominated the adoption community, this crossed a line of propriety. Mr. Elgart's matchmaking was legal, since he charged no fee and advertising was not prohibited in Pennsylvania. But his marketing, which progressed to benches, buses and Burger King tray liners, was called everything from unusual to appalling.
Mr. Elgart has long since turned his mission into a full-service licensed adoption agency, named Golden Cradle, now in Cherry Hill, N.J. But Mr. Elgart no longer has the field to himself.
"Golden Cradle started something," said Maxine Chalker, a social worker by training who is executive director of Adoptions from the Heart, said during an interview in her office in Wynnewood, Pa. When she started her agency in 1984, she said, "in the phone book there were maybe three ads under Adoption Services. Now there must be 40."
A modest display ad for Adoptions From the Heart is among them. The agency also advertises on bus shelters and in malls, and has tried radio and television, though the response was disappointing. "We're always trying to find new things," Ms. Chalker said. "It gets harder every year because of the competition."
Some of the competition comes from lawyers who handle independent adoptions: "Now everybody thinks adoption is easy money, especially the attorneys," Ms. Chalker said. "Now they're hiring counselors to work in their offices, and setting up as agencies without being licensed."
Adoptions From the Heart has 33 staff members and seven offices in five states. The agency has an advertising budget of $371,000 this year, accounting for 16 percent of its total expenses.
"The ad budget," Ms. Chalker mused. "It's so embarrassing. It's so much money, and that's just to stay in business."
To stay in business, Adoptions From the Heart has also extended its connections in China and Vietnam; it has placed 114 babies from China and 16 from Vietnam this year, compared with 47 American-born infants. The agency charges a fee of $14,700 for placement of a white American infant or toddler; legal fees are an additional $2,000 to $3,000, and parents pay any medical costs not covered by insurance. The cost of adopting from China is $17,235 and adopting from Vietnam is $22,100.
"Our facilitator in Vietnam charges $10,000 per baby," Ms. Chalker said. "Can you imagine how rich she must be?"
 
The Sales Agents
Matchmakers Make Money in the Process
The frontier state for the adoption business is California. The state has long permitted lawyers to recruit pregnant women. Now, facilitation services, which are unlicensed, are also recruiting and screening birth parents, as well as coaching prospective parents and finding them professional help.
Facilitators operate in many states. While their activities often come close to legal definitions of child placement, they are too new or too few to prompt regulation.
But in California, legislation enacted last year to clarify their role ended up legitimizing a whole new class of entrepreneurs. Lil Snee, a facilitator in Los Gatos who co-founded an informal trade organization, estimates that 40 to 50 are operating in the state.
"California decided that the market will dictate costs and the market will dictate who stays in business," said Diane Michelsen, an adoption lawyer in Lafayette, Calif. The competition from facilitators, Ms. Michelsen said, simply means that pregnant women can shop around more.
"It's the same pool of birth mothers that's being divided differently," she said.
For Ellen Roseman, a facilitator in San Anselmo, the main job is coaching prospective parents. "I make them read everything," she said. "It's like taking a college course." Then she helps them piece together deals with pregnant women, lawyers and agencies, often in other states. She charges a flat fee of $3,450.
At a recent support-group meeting at Ms. Roseman's house on a winding lane in Marin County, casually dressed current and former clients, many with babies in hand, exchanged stories of false starts and disappointments.
"I think it will get easier with time as people know what to expect, but for now, it's a free-for-all," Mr. Riff, of Berkeley, said over the potluck dinner that followed.
For Ms. Roseman, a former flight attendant and representative in union negotiations, the enterprise is more like putting together a business deal. "You sit down and move around the pieces to do two things," she said, "to make sure it's legal and to save money."
She does not recruit pregnant women, but she gets referrals and interviews candidates. "To really get the birth parents ready," she said, "you do what's called shaking them out of the trees. You say, 'If you have a little feeling down here telling you to keep your baby, we've got to talk about that.' "
Ms. Roseman hounds prospective parents, too. With one, she said, "I insisted that she hit a therapist's office two or three times a week, get into meditation and get a massage to relieve her anxieties."
Lil Snee, the Los Gatos facilitator, also does what she calls "hand-holding," charging $2,900 for an 18-month contract. Occasionally, clients pay her $95 a hour to interview a birth mother.
"It just feels wrong" for prospective parents to ask questions "about sexual partners, about how many men might be the father of this baby," Ms. Snee said, so she asks the questions instead.
"I bring the clients and the birth parents the kinds of families they're looking for," she said.
That, Ms. Snee said, is her metier. "Let's say you have a Hispanic-black baby and you have 20 waiting families," she said. "This birth mother is committed, intelligent, clean, but every single waiting family wants an Anglo baby with blond hair. Or I probably have about six cases where the babies are white, but maybe the mother wanted a certain religion, or a home with no children in the family. Maybe she did a little drugs and people are afraid of that."
In some states, matchmaking for a fee is illegal except by licensed agencies. Among them is New York, where lawyers can handle independent adoptions and advise their clients on finding pregnant women, but not make such an introduction themselves. In New Jersey, an individual -- say, a lawyer or social worker -- may make a match, but may not charge for it.
California's new law does restrict facilitators' practices. They must identify themselves as such in their advertising and must tell prospective parents that they are not licensed adoption agencies. They must obtain a $10,000 insurance bond to cover claims. But the state does not register nor license them, and it does not limit their fees.
Randall B. Hicks, an adoption lawyer in Riverside, Calif., and the author of "Adopting in America" (Wordslinger Press, 1995) calls facilitators "a garage industry." Mr. Hicks said they are "not licensed nor trained to do anything."
He also finds their fees, which can exceed $12,000, out of line. "They find a baby for you," Mr. Hicks said, "then they have to turn it over to a lawyer or an agency."
Ms. Snee, who lobbied for a licensing system to give facilitators credibility, accepts that that only lawyers can transact the actual adoption. But she argues: "We get so bashed. We provide a service, and just because it involves adoption doesn't mean we should be the saviors of the world and do everything for free."
Ms. Roseman contends that California's competitive marketplace keeps fees down and that expenses for birth mothers are fairly limited by the state courts. In the adoptions she handles, she said, "very little money changes hands."
Louisiana, on the other hand, "is wide open," Ms. Roseman said. "I always joke, when I want to make a million dollars, I'm going to open an agency in Louisiana and I'll be charging $30,000, $40,000, $50,000. I'm going to get fat eating bonbons in Louisiana."
 
The Factory
The Draw of a State With Lax Regulations
Louisiana is where Misty and Donnie Smoot ended up two years ago, when an agency installed them in a slightly down-at-the-heels apartment complex in Baton Rouge. "I was down there the second weekend after I found out I was pregnant," said Mrs. Smoot, who lives in Nashville. Her husband added: "They try to get you down there and get you stuck."
It is possible to find a birth mother anywhere in the country, send her to live in Louisiana, pay her expenses and fees to intermediaries, have her relinquish the child in Louisiana and finalize the adoption there, all while living elsewhere. And some couples who can afford it, most of them in the Northeast, do just that.
Most states limit payments to medical, legal and strictly defined living expenses. Louisiana does not, though all expenses must be reported to the court that finalizes the adoption. The state does not prohibit payments to intermediaries, and its Department of Social Services, which regulates adoption, receives no information on agencies' fees.
The Smoots were recruited as birth parents for a couple whose names they never knew. They were living in Tennessee and having marital problems, Mrs. Smoot said, when she became pregnant. Responding to a newspaper classified ad, they said, they spoke to a man named Richard in Florida who explained that he had clients interesting in adopting, and who referred them to an agency outside Baton Rouge.
They were given first-class plane tickets for themselves and their two young sons and moved into an apartment rented by the agency, Beacon House. The agency paid rent and utilities, gave them $150 a week for groceries and ferried Mrs. Smoot to doctor's appointments and group meetings. Mrs. Smoot estimated that Beacon House had 12 to 20 birth mothers in Baton Rouge while she was there.
The Smoots were never told much about the adoptive parents assigned to them; they said they were given a copy of the couple's home study and brief profile, without pictures. They spoke to the couple once, by telephone. "The father was the C.E.O. of his company, and their net worth was some ungodly number," Mr. Smoot said. "The whole home study was about money, money, money."
The arrangement unraveled when Mrs. Smoot was found to be carrying twins. Beacon House assured them that both babies would be adopted by the chosen parents, but the Smoots heard through the birth-mother grapevine that, in the past, the agency had separated twins without telling the birth parents.
The Smoots switched agencies and went through with a semi-open adoption, then returned to Tennessee. A month later, Beacon House sued them for breach of a contract that obligated them to pay back expenses if they placed their child through an agency or lawyer other than Beacon House.
The lawsuit, which sought $24,774, was dropped. Beacon House and its director, Anne R. Hughes, who also acts as the agency's lawyer, declined to be interviewed.
As the Smoots explained it, some women they met were drug users who sought a means of support. Some never had any intention of placing their children, Mr. Smoot said, "but there was one girl there who was giving up her sixth baby to Beacon House. There's several who do that. It's like an employer-employee relationship."
"This is something the adopting parents need to know," he continued. He said he and his wife were barely screened, either by Beacon House or by the intermediary named Richard. "They should investigate the birth parents a whole lot more than they do," he said.
One source of referrals to Louisiana, according to lawyers and investigators, was Richard Gitelman, whose facilitation service in Florida was investigated in the 1980's after complaints were made. The Smoots said that the "Richard" they talked to never gave his last name, but several adoption professionals, who asked not to be named, said he has referred birth parents to Beacon House.
Mr. Gitelman is said to be favored by older, moneyed couples who want quick, closed adoptions. Investigators have placed his fees at $50,000 and up; Mr. Pierce at the National Council for Adoption said he had seen a photocopy of a check written to Mr. Gitelman, with endorsement, "in the range of $75,000 to $90,000."
Mr. Gitelman, reached at his office number in Coral Springs, Fla., refused to discuss his fees or even to say whether he is still in business. (His National Adoption Counseling Service was declared inactive by the State of Florida in 1996 for failing to file its annual report with the state.)
Mr. Gitelman has never been convicted of anything, though he was indicted and he agreed to a $7,500 fine and a year's probation in Pennsylvania for interfering with the custody of a minor, a pregnant Pennsylvania teen-ager he briefly moved to Louisiana in 1987.
Fees paid in Louisiana are difficult to track. Adoption proceedings are sealed and courts do not submit records to state regulators. But James Best, a district court judge in West Baton Rouge Parish, where Beacon House is situated, said most infant adoptions he had reviewed were smooth and unremarkable. When asked if he had ever seen a $50,000 fee to a facilitator, Judge Best said, "If I ever did, I'd probably roll out of my chair and say I'm in the wrong business."
But Lucy McGough, a law professor at Louisiana State University and head of the legislature's advisory committee on adoption laws, said a few judges had told her that they had seen $50,000 fees and had not known how to handle them.
"One was infuriated," Ms. McGough said, "because they were reporting high charges and saying, 'So what's it to you, Mac? All the code says is we have to report it, and that's what we're doing.' "
Ms. McGough's committee is drawing up amendments to the adoption laws; in a memo to the committee, Ms. McGough voiced concern over "prime baby adoptions that can bring $75,000 to $100,000."
Meanwhile, she said, none of the parties are complaining: "The adoptive parents are happy as clams."
 
The Market Price
Children Are Children, But Some Cost More
For the old-line agencies in this marketplace, "there are Catch-22's everywhere," said Mr. Pierce of the National Council for Adoption. They are torn between the principle that children should not be discounted by race or disability and the reality that that is how one creates a larger pool of parents. They are torn between the principle that parenthood should not be charged for and the reality that social services are expensive.
The agencies, many of which receive donations or government subsidies, say that parents' fees could not cover their costs. Mr. Wright in California notes that when licensed agencies work with pregnant women, about 80 percent end up keeping their babies. And for most agencies, he said, "the cost of serving the 80 percent can't be paid for by the fees of the other 20 percent."
At the Gladney Center, fees do not come close to covering costs. Thanks to its endowment and its large campus, where about half its birth mothers live, Gladney can offer an array of services: three dormitories, a health clinic, chapel, dining hall, swimming pool and greenhouse, as well as high school and community college courses, vocational training, legal representation and counseling to be available for the rest of the birth mothers' lives.
All of this costs the agency, on average, $32,000 per resident. But Gladney's sliding scale adoption fees only go up to $30,000 and Ms. Smith, the marketing coordinator, said the average placement fee is $20,000.
Many agencies, including Gladney, use sliding scales to accommodate lower-income families. Still, Mr. Pierce said, "the economics of adoption is going to cause you to prefer the people who pay the higher fee."
High fees help subsidize the work necessary to find homes for hard-to-place children, at least in the agencies that undertake the job, he said, adding that, in some states, agencies receive "bounties" to recruit adoptive families for children in foster care or for disabled children who are costly to the state.
"Say you have a kid who's H.I.V.-positive in the hospital costing $1,000 a day," Mr. Pierce said. "To pay someone to find adoptive parents is entirely reasonable, but what does that look like to the public?"
It may also look terrible to charge less to place minority or special-needs children, but many agencies say they have little choice.
Gladney, for one, has a lower-cost program for African-American and biracial children. "Unfortunately, we had to create a separate program because adoptive parents were simply not coming forward," Ms. Smith said. Under that program, the agency charges $8,000.
Whoever handles them, adoptions in the over-$50,000 range almost always involve American-born white infants. While most are independent placements handled by lawyers, a few agencies market themselves by at least hinting at results. Easter House, a Chicago agency, notes in a letter to prospective parents that those approved this year have waited an average of 34 days to be offered a baby. The agency charges $45,000, "plus some incidentals."
But high-priced agencies, whether blue-ribbon or gray-market, have no shortage of customers. "I hate to say this, because it's going to sound crass," said Debra Harder, network director for Adoptive Families of America, a Minneapolis-based support organization. "But there are people who have the basic philosophy that the more I pay for something, the better it will be, not just in terms of the product but in terms of appearances. It says a lot about me if I drive a Lexus."
 
The Imports
Abroad, an Abundant Supply for Adoption
In international adoption, the scramble is entirely different: it is for parents. The Adoptive Families of America's current "Guide to Adoption" contains ads for 35 agencies, 33 of which advertise foreign programs.
"Your child is waiting for you," the headline on one announces. "We go with you to China!" Another says, "When you wish upon our stars, dreams do come true."
Most of the long-established agencies involved in international adoptions have "an altruistic, mission-driven sense that every child deserves a family," Ms. Harder said. "Now, with additional programs opening up in Russia and China in particular, folks are seeing it as an entrepreneurial venture."
Adoption experts say international adoptions have generated many new businesses, from charitable, church-affiliated agencies to walkup offices run by people who make money change hands in Bulgaria. Fees to foreign expediters, translators, lawyers and orphanages are usually beyond control of the U.S. agencies that make the placements.
Still, many prospective parents, not wanting the uncertainty of dealing with birth mothers, never even consider domestic adoption seriously. Adoptions from foreign countries are expected to approach 15,000 this year.
Even so, the supply in foreign countries now exceeds the demand here. Susan Soon-Keum Cox, director of public policy at Holt International Children's Services in Eugene, Ore., said the increase came largely from Eastern Europe and China. Russia, which had no program five years ago, placed more children last year than any other country, Ms. Cox said.
"As recently as five or ten years ago, there were many more parents waiting to adopt than there were children," said Ms. Cox, whose agency has placed more than 100,000 children. "Now that's entirely turned around. We're searching for families."
Barbara Irvin, state director of Family Adoption Consultants in Macedonia, Ohio, is uneasy about having more children than families waiting for placement. "There are some real tensions now between the child focus and the consumer orientation, the human services model and the market forces," she said. "Some families start looking for the cheapest, the fastest, the 'we promise you a child that meets your quote-unquote specifications in so many months.' Some of us who have been in the field for 20 years get worried about this shift."

Chart: "Is It Legal?"
A tangle of state laws has made adoption all but impossible to navigate without professional help. Disparate provisions govern, among other things, lawyers' roles, residency requirements and birth mothers' consent. Many state statutes do not directly address those issues; some leave them open to varying interpretations. Here is a sampling of state laws:

 BODY:
When the New York City Marathon sprouted from a modest event sequestered in Central Park to a celebration coursing through the streets, the word got out to the world.
And the world has kept coming. About 10,000 runners, roughly a third of Sunday's field, will be foreign visitors, with various reasons for traveling such a long way to run such a long distance. 
 Jose Canales, a 35-year-old civil engineer from the Dominican Republic, is hoping to break three hours. He has friends from the Santo Domingo Running Club to push him. "It is tough and it is world-famous," he said of the race. "Also, of course, I like New York City."
Jorg Grunhagen, a 29-year-old unemployed printer from Celle, Germany, also has breaking three hours in mind, with a grueling twist: He is attempting to finish his 10th marathon of the year in that time. He has missed his goal several times; the heat and humidity of a marathon in Siberia forced him to stop, and he missed his limit by 53 seconds in Stockholm. "My parents think I'm a nut, a big nut," he said.
Alfredo Aran of Madrid ran with his wife in the marathon two years ago, clocking 4 hours 53 minutes. "This marathon I run alone and hopefully more quickly," said Aran, a 38-year-old insurance executive who has a personal best of 3:22 and hopes to finish in 3:15.
Sue Hanscombe, 22, a recent graduate of Swansea University in Swansea, Wales, is running to raise money for diabetes. Hanscombe, who discovered she was diabetic five years ago, had been a competitive swimmer. "I just wanted something else, and I found that running didn't take so much time," she said. "With my finals and everything, I could just go out for a run." RON DICKER

Wolves in the wild are mostly phantoms that shy away from humans as if they were poison. Pronghorn antelopes are so nervous that if one looks at them the wrong way they are off like a shot. And short of tracking down a mountain lion with dogs, it is all but impossible to see one.
But a moose will often just stand there and let people look at it. 
 Not long ago, for instance, three people set out by canoe onto a small pond northeast of here. As paddles bit into the water's dead-calm surface, rings rippled across a mirror image of the reds, russets, oranges and yellows spangling the autumn mountains. In the middle of this panorama, up to his hocks in water, stood a creature that Ed Mathieu, a northwoods guide in the canoe's stern, has nicknamed the Goat Moose.
There are moose and then there are moose. Some stand tall and magnificent, proudly showing off six-foot-wide racks of antlers. Others are like the scrawny specimen that wandered through the streets of a small Alaskan town every week in the television show "Northern Exposure." This one, too young to sport full antlers, displayed only two small, curved spikes that together with his characteristic moose "beard," or bell, made him look, somewhat foolishly, like a big, stocky goat.
Far from spooking when the canoe approached to within about 25 feet, this moose regarded his visitors placidly. "Oh, O.K.," he seemed to say, "you're not wolves." Then he resumed chomping vegetation from the pond bottom, as weeds streamed from his adolescent antlers and water poured off his head, neck and sad-sack face.
Moose and people in North America have become bound together in a new ecological dynamic, a relationship unknown since both species migrated to the continent from Siberia some time in the last ice age, which ended about 10,000 years ago.
At the turn of this century, moose had been all but wiped out in much of their range by hunting and by conversion of their forest habitat to farms. Now hunting is tightly controlled and many of the farms have reverted to forest.
Natural predators like wolves have been eliminated from much of the north woods. And perhaps most important, especially hereabouts, industrial-scale logging has converted great stretches of the woods to young second-growth forest, whose abundance of tender leaves and twigs at just the right height for a moose to eat has created a vast smorgasbord. Almost within sight of the Goat Moose, for instance, recovering cookie-cutter clear-cuts had set a bounteous table.
The result has been a population explosion among moose. Today probably a million of the big hoofed animals inhabit the northern tier of North America, roughly triple the population at the end of World War II. In the northeastern United States, the population has radiated out from its epicenter in northern Maine, where moose numbers have risen to an estimated 30,000 from about 2,000 a century ago, into central and southern New England. A lone bull has even been sighted near the Delaware Water Gap in Eastern Pennsylvania. Earlier this year, a moose was struck and killed by a vehicle on Interstate 95 near New Haven.
In fact, accidents involving cars and moose have become common in areas, like Maine, where lots of people live in and around the woods. The accidents are frequently catastrophic, more so than in a typical deer-car encounter. Because a moose is so tall and heavy, its body can easily crush a car when the legs are knocked from under it.
On the other hand, moose have become a major tourist attraction and economic asset. Like the Goat Moose, many moose are "incredibly cooperative about letting people watch them," said Karen Morris, a wildlife biologist for the state of Maine. Moose "safaris" have become highly popular in Maine, and Mr. Mathieu this year has guided more than a hundred parties of people eager to see this majestic yet ungainly creature.
"How could you not love an animal that looks like a moose?" said Dr. Charles C. Schwartz, a wildlife biologist who until recently studied moose in Alaska. Now director of the grizzly bear program at Yellowstone National Park, he is an editor of "Ecology and Management of the North American Moose," published last year by Smithsonian Institution Press.
The look of the moose derives from its evolutionary adaptation to its environment -- the cold boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere.
Its long legs enable it to fairly glide through the woods, stepping easily over downed trees while predators pursuing it must leap or go around.
Its long, bulbous nose, lined on the inside with a wealth of small blood vessels, is designed to warm sub-freezing air so that it will not damage the lungs.
Its coat is one of nature's most superb insulators. It has two layers: one a sort of underwool, the other made up of very long, hollow guard hairs. Like a thermal pane in a window, the hollow hairs block out cold air and conserve body heat. They also help the animal swim (it can do so at a clip of about 5 miles an hour and over distances of up to 9 miles).
Moose take to the water largely because they cannot stand heat (but also because aquatic vegetation is rich in minerals they require). Winter temperatures of 40 degrees below zero Fahrenheit seem to suit them just fine. Even in their lighter summer coats, though, they cannot abide temperatures above about 60 degrees. In their heavy winter coats they become heat-stressed, panting with discomfort, when the thermometer rises above about 23 degrees, and seek the shade of evergreens.
What a moose does for most of its life is eat -- a lot. A thousand-pound adult consumes 25 pounds or even 50 pounds of vegetation a day in the summer and 10 or 12 pounds of evergreen branches or twigs in the winter. (Moose are partial to Christmas trees, i.e., balsam fir.) One year, Dr. Schwartz said, it took a crew of 10 people all summer to collect enough vegetation to feed four moose for two weeks in a research project on moose digestion.
In its constant search for food and security from predators, a moose is served by only so-so eyesight. But its senses of smell and hearing are acute. Its long ears move in an almost 360-degree arc, helping the animal detect sounds far off. Moose "are capable of hearing sounds humans would be oblivious to," Dr. Schwartz said. He has seen them perk up their ears and turn in a common direction, he said, while he has heard nothing. "Five minutes later, a vehicle comes driving in."
Yet moose do not always flee at the approach of danger. One reason, experts say, is that -- at up to six feet at the shoulder and 1,500 pounds -- they are just bigger than most other objects in their world. They have few natural enemies, and even against predators like wolves they frequently stand their ground; moving might prompt the predator to attack, and in any case moose are formidable fighters. Unfortunately, they also sometimes stand their ground against oncoming cars.
In general, moose are considered the most docile of the deer family, and the most tolerant of people's presence. But there are exceptions. Douglas Kane, the state's regional biologist here, says, for instance, that mature bull moose hereabouts have become more skittish and harder to see. "When they smell a human, they're gone," he said. It may be, he speculates, that bulls are shyer because they are the primary quarry in Maine's short, one-week moose hunting season in October.
Moreover, any given moose can be dangerous, and all should be approached cautiously and in some cases not at all, experts say. Two situations are especially perilous: When a human comes between a cow and its calf, during the rut, or mating season, from about mid-September to mid-October. That is when bulls establish dominance, with intimidating displays and sometimes clashes of antlers, and cows signal with moans and wails that they are in the mood, a condition that normally lasts less than a day.
Anything or anyone invading a moose's turf then risks injury or even death. More people are killed by moose, in fact, than by grizzly bears, said Dr. Joel Berger, a biologist at the University of Nevada at Reno.
Otherwise, though, moose have become so comfortable with people that, like deer, they have started raiding gardens and crops. "A few of them in northern Maine are beginning to understand the concept of broccoli," Ms. Morris said.
When a moose calf is a year old, its mother drives it away (to make way for the next year's calf) and it must find a new territory of its own. Moose are now so numerous in northern New England that the youngsters are being forced southward.
Two years ago, a young moose cow apparently got lost while searching out new territory and wound up in Boston. She led police and state biologists on a frantic chase, at one point crashing through the yards of row houses near Boston College. "You could hear the chain-link fences going down," said Dr. John McDonald, a wildlife biologist for the state. Eventually the moose was tranquilized and taken to a zoo, where she died; although moose have sometimes been used as draft animals, they generally do not do well in captivity.
With a breeding population estimated at 200, moose are no longer a novelty in Massachusetts. "As they become more common," Dr. McDonald said, "people report them less frequently. Once you've seen your third or fourth moose, it's not a big deal any more."
In northern New England, and especially in Maine, moose-car accidents have become epidemic. Besides being unintimidated by vehicles, some moose are drawn to roads because they love to lick up the salt left over from deposits made by snow-clearance crews. Sometimes they lie down in the roadway to do this, presenting an unexpected traffic hazard. Another problem is that moose are dark, sometimes almost black, and they are so tall that their eyes do not shine in car lights. So at night, motorists often do not see them until it is too late.
Ms. Morris, the state biologist, said Maine averages more than 600 moose-car accidents a year. About 15 percent of the motorists involved require medical treatment. And while Ms. Morris could not cite human death statistics for Maine, she said the state's mortality rate in moose-car accidents was probably about the same as the rate measured in Sweden: about 1 in 400 accidents.
The moose dies much more often.
Some wildlife specialists in Maine favor loosening restrictions on hunting to reduce the numbers of both moose and accidents. Permits for the one-week October hunt are rationed; this year's cap was 2,000. But other interests, mainly the tourist industry, want to keep the number of moose high.
New logging practices that rely less on clear-cutting and more on selective removal of trees may well shrink the area of prime moose habitat in future years, and as today's second-growth forests grow out of the reach of moose their population may decline, Mr. Kane said. "It may be close to a stable herd now," he said, "stable or low growth."
But for the foreseeable future, the evolving new relationship between people and moose seems likely to continue.

Graph/Map: By the late 1800's, deforestation and hunting had shrunk the range of moose in North America. Today, reforestation, curbs on hunting and elimination of natural predators have encouraged expansion. Maps show the moose range in the 1870's and in the 1990's. Graph tracks moose populations in Maine, Minnesota, Wyoming, Idaho and New Hampshire, from 1960 through 1990.
 
This expansion and migration has meant a surge in moose populations in the northern United States.

Movado Group hires an outside agency to reset the luxury face of its Concord watch.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
A LEADING maker, distributor and retailer of watches is naming an outside agency to handle one of its top brands.
Movado Group Inc., which sells watches under such names as Movado, ESQ, Corum, Piaget and Coach, has selected Arnell Group Brand Consulting in New York as the agency for its Concord line of luxury watches. Since 1972, that brand had been handled primarily by an in-house creative team. 
 The Swiss-made Concord watches, priced at $2,000 to $15,000 each, compete against the likes of Baume & Mercier, Cartier and Rolex. Arnell Group will advise Movado Group on tasks that include establishing a position for the Concord brand in the luxury watch market; developing advertising, with billings estimated at $8 million; creating a logo and devising packaging.
Arnell Group is known for campaigns for such fashion brands as Tommy Hilfiger and Donna Karan as well as imparting more stylish images to such products as Casio G-Shock watches, Hanes hosiery, Ray-Ban sunglasses and Samsung appliances. The choice of Arnell Group as the Concord agency, to be formally announced today, is an example of how marketers of premium-priced products are stepping up efforts to peddle their wares to consumers.
"There's an opportunity in the luxury segment and the watch category in general," said Scott Woodward, senior vice president for global marketing and chief marketing officer at Movado Group in Lyndhurst, N.J., "a huge opportunity to expand what we were doing with Concord." Mr. Woodward, who also has an office in New York, joined the company in early September after working for a year at Calvin Klein Inc. as vice president for marketing.
When asked whether the recent gyrations of the global equity markets would adversely affect the demand for higher-priced watches, Mr. Woodward replied: "In the luxury category, you do have to look at what's going on externally, such as the shift from the flashy 80's to the conservative 90's. We want to explore what a timepiece means to, and does for, an individual both rationally and emotionally."
"Watch advertising is pretty much standard across the board, very product focused and very rational," Mr. Woodward said. "We're looking at something above and beyond traditional advertising, an integrated marketing program that is more emotional."
Peter Arnell, chairman at Arnell Group, said he thought that concerns about the direction of the economy might even stimulate demand for jewelry and other luxury products that many consumers consider long-term investments. His agency has gained experience in the luxury market by working on such pricey brands as Bergdorf Goodman, Chanel, Christian Dior, Christian Lacroix and Loewe.
"The real opportunity is to bring a new cachet, a new emotion to a category where there hasn't been very much," said Mr. Arnell, who described himself as "an avid watch collector for the last 10 years."
Most watch pitches, he added, take predictable approaches like "up-close still life, sports and dancers flying in the air to symbolize performance and movement."
"There's a chance to get people to look at watches differently," Mr. Arnell said, "as I've done with Samsung, the boy with the chest." His reference was to the Arnell Group's print and outdoor campaign for Samsung appliances, which features the striking image of a fit, bare-chested young man toting a microwave oven under his muscular arm.
Mr. Woodward said: "For Samsung, Peter took what was traditionally a very dry category and did something interesting. And he knows how to integrate a message across every level in a creative way. You walk into Kmart to buy a Samsung microwave and the ad is on the box."
Arnell Group was chosen for Concord after a review conducted by AAR North America in New York.
"AAR identified a host of agencies, large and small," Mr. Woodward said. "We looked closely at 10 of them and came to the conclusion that Arnell Group was the appropriate selection." He declined to identify the contenders, saying Movado had met only with Arnell Group and none of the other agencies.
Mr. Woodward and Mr. Arnell have worked together before, when Mr. Woodward was a top advertising executive at Ray-Ban, a unit of Bausch & Lomb. Did that preordain the selection of Arnell Group?
"It wasn't exclusively his decision by any means," said Dana Glazer Gers, vice president at Movado Group, referring to Mr. Woodward. "It was a senior management decision." The first Concord campaign from Arnell Group is due next spring.
Movado Group reported net sales for the fiscal year that ended last Jan. 31 at a record $237 million, up 10.2 percent from $215.1 million in the previous fiscal year. The company's annual report described the Concord brand, along with Movado, as "standout performers" that "generated strong sales growth in both our North American and international markets."
Concord will be one of only two Movado Group watch brands handled by an outside agency. The other is Coach, which was introduced in April under an agreement with the Coach leather goods company owned by the Sara Lee Corporation. Those ads are created by Toth Brand Imaging in New York and Concord, Mass.
That's right, the Coach agency is in Concord but not vice versa.

Big Spending Can Make Fiscal Sense

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
THE headline writer's job is to capture the essence of the story, and such was the case for the author of yesterday's Mets press release. "Mets sign Mike Piazza to a record seven-year $91 million contract," the enlarged, bold print announced, with organizational pride and unrestrained glee.
The Mets, in fact, broke from team policy to shout, look at us, we're big spenders. "We've never done that," admitted Steve Phillips, the general manager. "But everyone seemed to know the figure already, and it also showed a commitment to winning and a willingness to invest. That image hasn't been there in a while." 
 When you add negotiated amenities such as the mandatory hotel suite and use of a Shea Stadium luxury box to the $91 million in bonuses and salary, what Piazza is getting, roughly, is a $100 million value pack. And, as the Mets chirped in the first paragraph of their press release, "the most lucrative player-contract in the history of major-league baseball."
This is what happens when the system works in a way that is more prudent than panicked -- sports economics as it oughta be -- and a 30-year-old future Hall of Famer cashes in on production, not potential. Are you locked-out pro basketball rank-and-filers paying attention? The Mets drew up the paperwork, didn't blink, and no one booed. No one responded to the magnitude of the deal by questioning Piazza's worth or by forecasting financial Armageddon. Able to quantify what Piazza meant to them at the gate and in the standing, the Mets locked up their franchise-defining player for the coming years when they will be competing with Mayor Steinbrenner's team for civic bragging rights and taxpayer dollars to build new ball parks.
Yes, Phillips indicated, those ticket price increases are undoubtedly coming but the telephones in the office, he said, were "ringing off the hook." In other words, the overnight consensus is that Piazza is worth every penny the Mets and their fans will have to pay.
A year ago at this time, the radio talk lines were filled with demands for the Mets to produce someone, anyone, to improve the profile of what Phillips called "good little players on a good little team." Phillips would never admit to this but he probably had one good at-bat to win himself an extended term running the Mets. Fair or not, mistakes in excess of $10 million a year are not easily explained to one's boss. Had Phillips succumbed to last year's public pressure and sold Nelson Doubleday and Fred Wilpon on say, Gary Sheffield, the Mets would be spent as playoff contenders, stumbling on in the forgettable tradition of George Foster and Bobby Bonilla.
"People say the toughest thing to do is pull the trigger," Phillips said. "But the toughest thing is to walk away when people are clamoring for you to do it."
In the Piazza deal last summer, the Mets surrendered prospects, no phenoms, but ran the risk of a public relations fiasco. When Piazza was greeted by the fans like the unproductive stranger he was, there was too much concern of how the rude reception would play on his long-term decision, not enough attention given to Piazza having to prove he could thrive in a city where some very talented players have not dealt with the money and the accompanying pressure to perform.
"I saw the growing pains," Phillips said. By the end of the season, Piazza was the hottest hitter in baseball, Howard Stern knew his phone number and Piazza went home to California to realize he missed the tumult and the tabloids. "I knew," he said, "the page had turned."
It was apparent yesterday that neither party had jumped into this seven-year marriage. The Mets' long-awaited splash was not into an ocean with scary undertow. Instead of water wings, they are wearing Piazza's record and, Phillips said, Piazza has even "guaranteed that he wouldn't get hurt."
Everyone laughed, including Doubleday and Wilpon. If only sports owners could take out performance insurance. David Stern says this dirty little basketball war is over "cost certainty" for owners. What he really needs -- and what I suspect he will end up with -- is some system that prevents inflationary contracts for players who have done little, or nothing. When the veteran star and a proven commodity makes out, critics and fans do not start pondering his relative contribution to the betterment of mankind. Owners do not feel as if they have held up at gunpoint.
They happily consider it what Phillips called this Piazza deal, "a smart investment." A $91 million-plus badge of honor.

HEADLINE: Net Income Declines 58% At Carbide

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: DANBURY, Conn., Oct. 26

 BODY:
The Union Carbide Corporation reported today that earnings plunged 58 percent in the third quarter mainly because of weak Asian markets. The company warned that its troubles would continue in the fourth quarter.
The chemical maker earned $76 million in the quarter, or 55 cents a diluted share, compared with $181 million, or $1.18 a share, in the period a year ago. Revenue fell nearly 20 percent, to $1.35 billion from $1.66 billion. 
 The earnings fell short of Wall Street estimates, which had already been diminished by a warning from Union Carbide that lower prices for its products would hurt third-quarter results.
Shares of Union Carbide fell 62.5 cents today, to $39.1875, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company's earnings were affected by about $24 million of additional costs related to delays at a factory in Taft, La., that is undergoing expansion. The figures also reflect a $6 million charge related to disruption of the company's joint venture in Kuwait caused by transformer breakdowns at the Government-owned electric utility.
Union Carbide's chairman, William H. Joyce, blamed the economic turmoil in Japan and other Asian nations for the earnings decline. Continued weak demand in Asia and related cuts in selling prices, slightly higher raw materials costs and normal seasonal weaknesses in several businesses all point to lower fourth-quarter earnings, Mr. Joyce said.

HEADLINE: Death Rate on U.S. Roads Reported at a Record Low

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
The death rate on the nation's roads fell to a record low last year, the Government said today after re-calculating travel statistics. The total number of deaths changed hardly at all, but the death rate fell because of the relentless increase in traffic.
But transportation experts said the traffic-death rate for the elderly was rising rapidly. A person older than 74 is more than twice as likely to die in a motor vehicle crash than a younger person, according to the National Safety Council, a nonprofit group sponsored mostly by the insurance industry. 
 For most people, though, the risk of death or serious injury is falling.
"There's a downward trend in all the categories," said Charles A. Hurley, a spokesman for the safety council. "Fatal injuries become nonfatal, serious injuries become nonserious."
Mr. Hurley said that accident rates usually rose during periods of economic expansion because prosperity stimulated more driving but that the death rate per 100,000 people had been falling for the last three years because other factors were moving faster: an increase in seat belt use, a decline in drunken driving and an improvement in cars.
Dr. Ricardo Martinez, the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the improvement came despite an increase in elderly drivers, who are more likely to be frail and to have trouble coping with traffic, and in teen-age drivers, who have high accident rates.
Dr. Martinez's agency, part of the Department of Transportation, said there were 1.6 deaths per 100 million miles traveled, based on a higher estimate of total miles driven in 1997 than the agency had used this summer, when it said the death rate had not changed. The rate was 1.7 deaths per 100 million miles traveled the year before. The 1997 figure is the lowest since the agency began keeping records 30 years ago. And the National Safety Council said today that 16.1 traffic fatalities per 100,000 people was also at a historic low, tying a record set in 1991.
Even so, 41,967 people were killed by motor vehicles last year, including 5,700 pedestrians and 700 bicycle riders. An additional 3.4 million people were injured in 2.2 million crashes. There were no injuries in 4.6 million crashes reported to police.
The decline in deaths comes despite the loosening of the 55-mile-per-hour national speed limit 11 years ago, and its elimination in 1995.
Traffic congestion and total miles driven have gone up too, but that helps. Mr. Hurley said, "Congestion has a positive effect on highway safety, because it drives speeds down."
He said, though, that there would be more highway repair in the next few years, leading to new safety problems.
According to the safety council, the number of motor-vehicle deaths per 100,000 people is declining for all age groups except the elderly. The death rate for the elderly last year, measured against miles traveled, was just over double the rate for the population as a whole, 32.7 per 100,000 population vs. 16.1 for all age groups. The rate for people 75 and older is the highest since 1973.
Dr. Martinez said elderly people were more mobile than they used to be but were much more fragile than other drivers.
"A side impact, with forces straight to pelvis and chest, can be devastating," said Dr. Martinez, a former emergency room physician. "In a younger person wearing restraints in a serious crash, they may have some broken ribs, but with an elderly person, the chest being much more delicate, those same rib fractures can lead to problems with lungs, and eventually, a fatality."
Rodney E. Slater, the Transportation Secretary, said in a telephone interview that his department was looking into a number of remedies, including signs that are easier for older people to see.
Asked whether states should be encouraged to retest older drivers, Mr. Slater said, "There is probably the need for all of us to have refresher courses in some way."
"If that occurs, I think it would be much better to do it across the board rather than to single out older drivers," he said.
Mr. Slater added that the budget Congress passed last week had a 10 percent increase for highway safety programs.
Dr. Martinez said that the issue of screening older drivers to test their road competence was extremely sensitive but that safety officials should frame the question differently.
"Screening for fit-to-drive is no different from screening for cancers or heart disease," he said. "We have to make sure it's safe."

HEADLINE: Back Peace, U.S. Urges Arab Allies

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: ASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
Now that the Wye conference has broken the deadlock between the Israelis and the Palestinians after 19 months, the Clinton Administration is urging moderate Arab nations to recommit themselves to actively aiding the peace effort.
In particular, Administration officials are saying that moderate Arab states like Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Qatar and Saudi Arabia should move quickly to support the Palestinian Authority. They suggest building projects and job creation, as well as new efforts to bring Israel into the region and involvement in groups looking into regional problems like the water supply. 
 Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat signed a deal on Friday that would return another 13 percent of the West Bank to at least partial Palestinian control in exchange for specific Palestinian steps to fight terrorism.
James P. Rubin, spokesman for Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, said today, "Secretary Albright does believe that with the Middle East peace process now invigorated, Arab states should do more to normalize relations with Israel, assist the Palestinians economically where possible and participate in the multilateral tracks of the peace process."
The United States is annoyed that Arab leaders are now reluctant to fully endorse the deal squeezed out of the parties in nine long days at Wye. The annoyance is particularly acute given that Arab countries earlier criticized Washington for not pressing Mr. Netanyahu enough, and dropped out of regional economic initiatives like a conference last year in Doha, Qatar.
"They want to wait and see if the deal is implemented," a senior Administration official said.
Official reaction from these nations has been cautious, and the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Amr Moussa, has repeated the wait-and-see stance directly to Ms. Albright, officials said. There was a similar response today when the Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs, Martin Indyk, met with some 20 Arab envoys, officials said.
Referring to Arab states, one official said, "Prime Minister Netanyahu made some hard decisions in the last week, and they have to stop blaming him and start thinking about what their responsibilities are."
Both ordinary Palestinians and ordinary Israelis need to see the benefits of peace, the official emphasized, and that means jobs in the first case and normalization and security in the second.
Ms. Albright has also been concerned about the deterioration of American influence on moderate Arab states stemming from their anger over the peace stalemate. Specifically, the United States has had a hard time getting these states to support its policies toward Iran and Iraq. Now that Washington has unblocked the peace process, officials say, it is time for a bit of payback.
Also today, officials from the Central Intelligence Agency, including the station chief in Israel, briefed the House and Senate intelligence committees on the role the C.I.A. will play under the accord. Some lawmakers had expressed alarm at reports coming out of the Wye negotiations on C.I.A. involvement.
Under the pact, the C.I.A.'s tasks will include refereeing disputes on the handling of terrorist suspects, and monitoring those arrested by Israeli and Palestinian authorities.
In a series of closed briefings before the House and Senate panels, C.I.A. officials played down any new responsibilities, and emphasized that the agreement outlines a continuation of peacekeeping duties performed by the agency over the last three years.
 In an Op-Ed page article in Tuesday's New York Times, the Director of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet, writes that the duties of the C.I.A. in Israeli and Palestinian areas have not changed, but have merely been made public.
After the briefings, aides expressed relief. "There was very, very little new here," said one Congressional participant. "What's new is all the publicity surrounding it."

HEADLINE: Home Resales Fell Last Month

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
Home resales fell in September for a second straight month, suggesting that low mortgage rates are not enough to overcome an overall slowing of the United States economy.
Resales unexpectedly fell 1.1 percent last month, to an annual rate of 4.68 million, the National Association of Realtors said. Analysts had forecast a rise of four-tenths of a percent, to a 4.75 million rate. Sales fell in the Midwest and the South, were flat in the Northeast and rose in the West. 
 In August, resales fell 3.7 percent, to an annual rate of 4.73 million, down from a record 4.91 million pace in July.
The median price of a home fell 1.2 percent, to $131,300 in September from $132,900 in August.
The real estate statistics, based on closing contracts, are considered an important gauge of growth because sales of previously owned homes account for 85 percent of all homes on the market and home buyers are big consumers of furniture, appliances and other household goods.
Low mortgage rates, along with low unemployment and strong consumer confidence, have provided support for the housing industry. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.73 percent last week, close to the 6.49 percent figure for the week ended on Oct. 9, which was the lowest since January 1968.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: RACIAL ISSUES;
Black Loyalty to Clinton Hinders G.O.P. Outreach

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., Oct. 24

 BODY:
At this point in her race for the House two years ago, polls showed Anne Northup with the support of about 8 percent of her district's African-American vote. And though she squeaked out a victory, Ms. Northup, a Republican, fared so poorly in Louisville's black neighborhoods that in one precinct she received only 5 out of 600 votes.
"In cases like that you figure that five people must have voted for me by mistake," she says now with a rueful laugh. "It was devastating." 
 Despite the poor showing among black voters, Ms. Northup, who is white and has adopted two black children, worked to build bridges to the city's black residents. She formed a close association with two of the city's most powerful black ministers and directed nearly $3 million in Federal money to self-help projects they operated.
Her work seemed to be paying off. Recent polls show that her support among blacks who are considered likely to vote in this year's election has grown to 20 percent.
But having voted with the rest of the House Republicans to authorize an open-ended impeachment investigation of President Clinton, Ms. Northup is one of several lawmakers identified as targets of a new Democratic get-out-the-vote campaign in black areas.
She is facing the prospect that her efforts to woo black voters may be short-circuited by the continuing Washington inquiry and strong black support for the President.
"I've heard many people say that they like Anne Northup," said the Rev. Kevin Cosby, pastor of St. Stephen Baptist Church, the largest black church in the state, and an unabashed fan of Ms. Northup. "They're only concerned about the President and how she would vote with regards to the impeachment of the President."
Ms. Northup's problem is but one example of what Democratic strategists are hoping will be the pivotal role played by black voters in this year's election. The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonpartisan research organization, has identified 9 Senate races -- in Arkansas, California, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, New York, North Carolina, Ohio and South Carolina -- and 19 House contests where the black vote could be crucial.
Democratic strategists are hoping that the anger expressed by blacks toward Republicans that has been showing up in sizable numbers in public opinion surveys will translate into strong turnout at the polls. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has pinpointed at least 10 close House races with large numbers of black voters for special get-out-the-vote efforts.
On Thursday, the Congressional Black Caucus will begin a five-city bus tour to encourage blacks to go to the polls on Nov. 3. The first stop will be in this city along the Ohio River to urge blacks to come to vote for Chris Gorman, the former Kentucky Attorney General who is in a tight race with Ms. Northup.
"We intend to energize the black vote, which generally is just as low, if not lower, than others in an off-year election," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, a New York Democrat who organized the bus tour. "There is no question that the African-American community strongly supports the President and strongly opposes anything that could be perceived as an effort to drive him out of office."
Kentucky's Third Congressional district, which encompasses Louisville and parts of its suburbs, is a classic swing district. It has shifted from Republican to Democrat to Republican in the last three elections. In 1996, Ms. Northup won by barely 1,299 votes, less than 1 percent of the nearly 251,000 cast. Mr. Clinton carried the district overwhelmingly.
With blacks making up 16.3 percent of its population that has reached voting age, strategists hope that a significant turnout will lead to an upset victory for Mr. Gorman.
Unlike other Democratic candidates in Kentucky, Mr. Gorman is not shy about trumpeting his support for Mr. Clinton and castigating the Republicans for the impeachment investigation. This week he will start broadcasting a commercial on black radio stations in which the Rev. Jesse Jackson criticizes Ms. Northup on several issues, including her vote in favor of the inquiry.
"They support President Clinton and they support candidates like myself who have indicated that while what the President did was wrong and he should be punished, he should not be impeached," Mr. Gorman said of black voters. "I've read the Starr report and there is nothing impeachable in there. So he needs to be punished very quickly, and we need to move on with it and talk about other issues. I can guarantee you that's the feeling of well over 95 percent of the black community in this area."
For her part, Ms. Northup has tried to walk a fine line on the impeachment matter. She voted with the Republican majority for an open-ended inquiry, fearing that if an investigation was limited in scope and time, Mr. Clinton would "run out the clock." But she has not, in her words, "gotten out and railed against" the President on the campaign trail.
"To be honest, when it comes to the impeachment question, that's one area where I feel a tremendous responsibility to at least understand how they feel about it and be very sensitive to it," Ms. Northup said of black voters in her district.
The open question is how much her party's stand on impeachment has undercut her efforts to forge relationships with blacks. Those efforts began shortly after her election when she met first with the Rev. Walter Malone, of New Canaan Baptist Church, and with Mr. Cosby. Both ministers represent a new breed of black clergy and black leadership. They emphasize a self-help philosophy and are not shy to embrace Republican help.
Mr. Cosby, whose church attracted 1,500 people to Bible study last Wednesday evening, said, "African-Americans have a lot of local concerns and Anne Northup has been very accessible to the community."
And while he declines to say that he endorses her re-election, Mr. Cosby makes clear that he would not be dismayed if she is returned to the House. "I heard Jesse Jackson say something I agree with -- good political works result in good political consequences," Mr. Cosby said. "In my opinion, Anne Northup has produced for our community some good political works."

HEADLINE: Panel Studying Iraq Missiles Is of 2 Minds on Nerve Gas

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: NITED NATIONS, Oct. 26

 BODY:
An international panel of arms experts announced today that they had accepted American scientific evidence indicating that Iraq had loaded some of its missiles with a deadly nerve gas known as VX.
But their report, which was given to the Security Council, was inconclusive because it also left unchallenged French and Swiss tests that had far different conclusions. The Swiss, who examined samples of Iraqi weapons in the summer, said they had found no evidence of poison gas. French scientists asserted that their tests of other samples showed only the possibility that poison gas was present in some Iraqi missiles. 
 What the three countries agreed on was that at some point the Iraqis used detergents to wash missile fragments retrieved from Iraqi desert dumps, leading to the suspicion that Baghdad had something to hide.
Because the report is indecisive, it is doubtful that it will determine policy decisions on Iraq, particularly considering the heavily political atmosphere at the United Nations surrounding Iraqi sanctions.
The document highlights the dispute between French and American scientists on the methods and interpretation of the findings. French scientists said they had found what could be traces of VX or two other deadly gases, Sarin and Soman. But they said those traces could also have come from detergents used to clean the missiles.
The United States said its scientists proved beyond any doubt the existence of traces of the VX nerve gas in the first samples, which were examined in May. The United States also conducted a second set of tests later, but they did not find VX. The second tests were ordered after Iraq challenged the first opne, conducted in a military laboratory in Aberdeen, Md.
Iraq charged that the United States -- which led the gulf war to evict Iraqi troops from Kuwait in 1991 -- was biased. That charge led to the tests in France and Switzerland.
The 21 scientists drawn from 7 countries who met here last Thursday and Friday sidestepped the issue of which tests were to be taken into account, asserting in today's report that "all analytical data provided by the three laboratories were again considered as conclusive and valid."
The report was commissioned by the United Nations Special Commission, which is charged with insuring the destruction of Baghdad's weapons.
Iraq has admitted making a variety of chemical and biological weapons, but says it did not fire them during the gulf war and continues to insist that it did not load the odorless VX nerve gas onto missiles. Unscom is interested to know whether Iraq has hidden any missiles that may be loaded with VX, stressing that Iraq has still a great of explaining to do before it can be given a clean bill of health.
One remaining question is why detergents were used at all in the missiles, which were then dismantled and buried by Iraq until they were unearthed by inspectors.
"The existence of VX degradation products conflicts with Iraq's declarations that the unilaterally destroyed special warheads had never been filled with any Chemical Weapons agents," the report said.
Although most members of the organization doubt that Iraq has ever told the truth about its weapons of mass destruction, many here believe that it has gone a long way toward destroying them and that some of the sanctions against Iraq should be lifted or eased in recognition of this effort.
In a vote highlighting opposition to the United States and its frequent use of sanctions against countries like Iraq, Cuba and Libya, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the repeal of unilateral laws affecting the economies and businesses of individual countries.
The resolution is nonbinding, but it echoes a similar vote that called for an end to sanctions against Cuba two weeks ago. Today's appeal was endorsed by 80 nations. Only the United States and Israel voted against it outright.
Some Western diplomats here who spoke on condition of anonymity have suggested that France may have held back on some of its findings in order not to fan the flames for continued sanctions against Iraq, although French officials categorically deny doing so.
Diplomats here said it was not in dispute that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, nor that it lied about this to the world community. Iraq suspended armed inspections by United Nations inspectors in August.

HEADLINE: Earnings Rise 9.5% at American Express

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The American Express Company reported yesterday that third-quarter earnings rose 9.5 percent as strength in its travel and financial advisory operations offset Asia-related weakness in its banking and traveler's check businesses.
American Express said it had earned $574 million, or $1.25 a diluted share, for the quarter, up from $524 million, or $1.10 a diluted share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. 
 The earnings were a penny higher than analysts' expectations, according to the First Call Corporation, which tracks such estimates.
Revenue increased 6.4 percent, to $4.79 billion from $4.50 billion.
Shares of American Express rose 50 cents, to $88.125, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Earnings from travel-related services rose 17 percent, to $362 million. The gains came despite a slowdown in corporate travel spending, American Express said.
Earnings from the company's financial advisory unit climbed 15 percent, to $211 million.
The increased earnings from the company's two major businesses offset a decline in its banking and traveler's check operations, where earnings fell 36 percent, to $43 million, as a result of Asia's economic problems.

HEADLINE: Time Warner Is Sued by U.S. In Employee Benefits Case

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
The Department of Labor sued Time Warner Inc. and officials of nine corporate pension and health plans today, saying they wrongly denied health and retirement coverage to hundreds of employees.
The workers were mistakenly classified as independent contractors or temporary workers rather than official employees entitled to the benefits, the suit says, adding that the company violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. 
 "We were hopeful we could settle this issue with Time Warner without suing," said Alexis M. Herman, the Secretary of Labor. "However, employers must deliver promised benefits to all eligible employees, and we believe some misclassified Time Inc. employees did not receive benefits they were entitled to."
Richard D. Parsons, the president of Time Warner, said, "The Department of Labor's action has no basis in law or in fact and is beyond the scope of its authority." He said the company "will move quickly" to dismiss the suit and expects "to be fully vindicated."
Time Warner said the allegations contradicted the conclusions of three other Federal and state agencies, which found nothing amiss in the company's classifications of employees.
The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, contends that Time Warner and the administrative committee that manages its benefits plan did not identify or include eligible employees or inform them of their right to receive health and retirement benefits.
Questions about when a worker is considered a formal employee are becoming increasingly important at a time when more companies are turning over jobs to freelance, independent or so-called contingent workers. This case is one of several lawsuits nationwide pitting companies against workers who are seeking access to valuable benefit packages.

When George Pataki delivered his first address to the State Legislature nearly four years ago, New Yorkers who had grown used to the wide-ranging agenda and verbal pyrotechnics of Mario Cuomo were startled by their new Governor's pedestrian oratory and narrow set of priorities. Now, almost four years later, we know there is another difference. Mr. Pataki promised only a few things, but he has done what he promised.
We have disagreed with many of his priorities, particularly his reinstitution of the death penalty. We also believe that the Governor's risky practice of enacting big tax cuts that grow in size each year will not be sustainable if the economy sags. But we have been impressed by his approach on other areas, and that has tilted us toward Mr. Pataki over his worthy Democratic opponent, Peter Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker. 
 Since Mr. Pataki became Governor, the state has become more business-friendly, with targeted tax relief and eased regulations. On the environment, which unexpectedly became one of Mr. Pataki's signature issues, his administration has been aggressive in expanding parks and state forests. He has been a forceful advocate for stronger clean air standards. After a rough start in which he attempted to cut welfare benefits and reduce payments to hospitals, nursing homes and home health care services, Mr. Pataki accepted a less punitive approach, preserving these vital services for the poor in cooperation with the Democratic-controlled Assembly. There is now in place a system of vouchers for families that run out of benefits after five years, for example.
When it comes to social issues, Mr. Pataki's brand of moderate Republicanism has been a welcome change from the strident tone of his party's national leadership. He supports gay rights and freedom of choice on abortion. His quick and forthright condemnation of the shooting of a doctor who performed abortions in western New York was typical of his pro-choice credentials. We wish that he would do more to persuade the Republican majority in the State Senate to adopt a similarly progressive and inclusive attitude.
After the 1994 gubernatorial campaign, which was characterized by a destructive city-versus-upstate tone, New York City had reason to be concerned about how it would be treated under the Pataki administration. The Governor's first austerity budget proposal seemed to reinforce those worries. But since then we have been heartened by Mr. Pataki's work to make the state's formula for school construction aid fairer to the city. He has also pledged to rectify the imbalance in basic school aid that has robbed the city of its just share of assistance. Mr. Pataki forced large increases in tuition at the State University system, but he has also embarked on a major expansion and offered some creative ideas for instilling local control at its different campuses. We appreciate his part in cleaning up the operation of the Javits Center, creating the new Hudson River Park and forging the still-fragile agreements to protect New York City's upstate watershed lands.
Our endorsement is based on Mr. Pataki's progress on this limited but critical agenda, particularly his work on the environment and improving the business climate. But there is another set of political issues where the record is troubling. These issues touch on leadership style and also on the substance of government reform and campaign finance. Mr. Pataki sometimes displays an almost Reaganesque attitude to his job in which difficult problems are ignored, dismissed or delegated to others. We appreciate the political skill with which he follows this course, but we urge him toward greater engagement in his second term.
Mr. Pataki has contended, as his predecessors did, that he could not fix some of the state's problems because the State Legislature is irresponsible and undisciplined. That is true, but blaming is not leading. The state's political system has broken down. The legislative process has become a fight to secure the good will of the big money donors. That will not change until New York's regulations on campaign finance -- among the most lax in the nation -- are reformed.
Mr. Pataki has done absolutely nothing about this problem, and he has set an unwholesome example by raising almost half his campaign treasury from individuals and companies with vested interests. He says the present system is terrible and in the course of this campaign called for systemic reform. Yet he admits he has no plan for fixing things. Therefore this endorsement comes with a major reservation about his financial record and a promise to pester him relentlessly to become a force for legislative and campaign reform.
We dwell on campaign money because there is no aspect of Mr. Pataki's record that is more troubling or that represents a greater threat to his national aspirations. As an article in today's Times by Clifford Levy indicates, there have been far too many occasions over the past few years in which a sudden big donation to the Republican cause has been followed by a state contract. Mr. Pataki seems to prefer not to know about any of this, just as he said he had no idea who gave money for his last inauguration -- a list of names his aides insisted on keeping secret. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Mr. Pataki said he expected to stage a less expensive inaugural. If re-elected, he ought to set up a transparent inaugural committee that refuses large donations from parties doing business with the state.
Mr. Vallone, the Democratic nominee, is an honorable public servant who has had a solid record on campaign finance legislation. We endorsed Mr. Vallone in the Democratic primary as the candidate who might best be able to turn the gubernatorial race into a competitive, issue-driven contest. That has not happened. Mr. Vallone complains rightly that Mr. Pataki has dodged debating him, and Mr. Pataki's attempt to throw up his hands and leave it to unnamed campaign aides to work out a debate is pure evasion. But many of Mr. Vallone's failings have been his own fault. His economic development program is based almost entirely on a questionable plan for reallocating state contracts to New York companies, an idea that can only work on the margins and runs the risk of retaliation from other states. Some of the other ideas Mr. Vallone has proposed are interesting, but the candidate himself has failed to articulate them in a clear manner.
We believe that a majority of voters will conclude, as we have, that absent a more compelling challenge than this campaign has produced, Mr. Pataki's overall record has been solid enough to warrant a second term. We applaud in particular his work in bringing the new Hudson River Park on the West Side of Manhattan to reality. The plain fact is that this park, so essential to the cityscape of the future, would not exist without Mr. Pataki's work and his evenhanded treatment of New York City.
There is a danger that the lure of national office may drive Mr. Pataki to the right, and to his original mode of balancing the budget on the backs of the poor. But if he wants to distinguish himself from the rest of the crowd of potential Vice-Presidential candidates, he must do it by wiping away the dark spots on his record and leading the state into an era of clean government and politics free of special interest domination. Given the intelligence and determination with which he has pursued the goals he set for himself during his first term, we believe George Pataki is capable of making these things happen, and we endorse him for re-election.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE CHALLENGER;
Despite Early Expectations, Kennelly Faces Gap of Historic Dimensions

BYLINE: By JULIAN E. BARNES 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 26

 BODY:
As Representative Barbara B. Kennelly's car headed back toward this capital city after a recent campaign event, she turned to glimpse the red maple and golden beech trees on the hills.
"Doesn't that look beautiful?" she said. "That's the only good thing about campaigns: you can see the leaves." It was a unusual admission for a candidate for governor and someone who has spent more than two decades in public office. 
 A moment later, she added emphatically: "I like serving."
Mrs. Kennelly speaks with great enthusiasm about the achievements of her 17 years as a Democratic Congresswoman. And many of her allies believe she would bring to the Connecticut State House the same attributes she took to Congress: an ability to compromise, a civil demeanor, and a set of liberal principles about the responsibility of government to help those in need.
But at the same time, those supporters acknowledge that she has little stomach for what it takes to get there.
With a week left until the election, polls show Mrs. Kennelly so far behind her highly popular opponent, Gov. John G. Rowland -- 48 percentage points at last count -- that some here wonder whether she is heading for one of the biggest political humiliations since John S. Peters, a National Republican, defeated Calvin Willey, a Democrat, by 44 percentage points in 1832.
"I think, quite honestly, that it would have been difficult for any Democrat to knock out the Governor," said James A. McBrayar, an assistant professor of American politics at the University of Hartford. "That said, I think this was a largely invisible campaign."
Many of Mrs. Kennelly's missteps have been well documented. Although polls showed her running even with the incumbent when she announced her candidacy a year ago, she waited many months before beginning a television advertising campaign and failed to build a strong campaign organization. It is also likely that the early polls were skewed by her high name recognition, and therefore gave a misleading indication of her strength.
But much of her campaign problems seem traceable to her political style. She clearly loves the business of governing and talks passionately about the deal-making that goes on out of the public eye, the collegiality of Washington and the intense, late-night work of getting bills passed.
But just as clearly, Mrs. Kennelly, 62, does not have a taste for the more public, retail aspects of politics. She says she enjoys meeting people on the campaign trail, but she recoils from publicity stunts and negative campaigning, two techniques that are usually effective. As a Congresswoman she achieved a quiet style partly by doing without a press secretary to promote her and by avoiding outspoken comments, preferring to use her reputation as a team player to get legislation passed. And when she ran for re-election every two years, it was usually against lackluster opposition.
Working most effectively out of the limelight seems to be a family trait. Mrs. Kennelly's father, John M. Bailey, was chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1961 until 1969, and ran the state Democratic Party from 1946 until his death in 1975. As the party boss, Mr. Bailey was known as a consummate backroom deal-maker.
Although some critics contend that she is too rooted in the politics of the past, Mrs. Kennelly argues forcefully that she is "not an old-style politician." But her stump style seems to reflect an ambivalent attitude toward modern campaigning. It can be forceful at one point, then turn quickly uncomfortable the next.
At a recent Democratic town committee meeting in Rocky Hill she warmed up what had been a largely silent audience with a rousing speech. Explaining her decision to run, she said: "I was looking back at Connecticut and I could see we were not what we had been. Not first any longer in education, or preserving our environment. Not first in protecting our kids. So I decided to run for governor and you all supported me. Well, let me tell you: if I thought I was right then, I know I am right now!"
But 15 minutes later she gave a somewhat disjointed speech at a meeting of a N.A.A.C.P. chapter, shifting awkwardly between her campaign theme of "two Connecticuts," praise for the hiring record of the Federal Government and a call for equal wages for minorities.
 
More Compelling Style Is the Incumbent's
Even her ardent supporters acknowledge that her campaign style suffers by comparison with that of her opponent, Governor Rowland, a first-term Republican who is 21 years her junior. He tends to be smooth, quick on his feet and quick to utter sound-bites, while Mrs. Kennelly is more halting and deferential than Mr. Rowland, who tends to be more aggressive.
Any Democrat, no matter how good a campaigner, would have a tough time this year against Mr. Rowland, whose term has been a period of economic gains and budget surpluses. A poll conducted by Quinnipiac College found that 83 percent of the state's registered voters are satisfied "with the way things are going" in Connecticut.
Mr. Rowland has also made Mrs. Kennelly's run more difficult, according to many politicians here, by moderating some of his positions. Last year, for example, he successfully reached compromises with the Democratic Legislature on tax cuts and health care.
Since Mrs. Kennelly's first race for Congress in a special election in January 1982, she has faced no serious contenders in her largely Democratic district around Hartford. As a result she had no need to undertake big media efforts, debate an opponent or respond to serious criticism.
In a belated recognition of the importance of professional strategists, she hired both a new manager and a new spokesman in the middle of the race.
Mrs. Kennelly also failed in the early stages to pick a single theme to shape her campaign. In recent weeks a friend of Mrs. Kennelly's, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland, has been urging her to hammer away at a single message and to promote herself. "Barbara Mikulski told me, 'The problem with you, Barbara, is that you are not shameless,' " she said.
Mrs. Kennelly still seems astonished by the ease and energy that some of her friends in Washington bring to campaigning. In an interview, she recalled a trip she took to Israel with Ms. Mikulski and former Representative Geraldine Ferraro, when all three women were in the House and the other two were planning races for the Senate. "They never stopped talking about their Senate races," Mrs. Kennelly said. "They were shaking everyone's hand, they would never quit."
 
Early Supporters Are Rarely Around
In addition, few of Mrs. Kennelly's allies have seemed eager to attack the Governor very hard, fearful perhaps of alienating voters who support a popular incumbent.
When early polls showed her running even with Mr. Rowland, several prominent Democrats were urging her to make the race, but now that her campaign has turned sour, they have not been on the trail with her. Indeed, at the Rocky Hill rally, three of the statewide candidates who share the Democratic ticket with her -- Comptroller Nancy Wyman, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, and Susan Bysiewicz, a candidate for Secretary of State -- did not mention her.
"Democrats and Republicans are both campaigning on the idea that there is nothing wrong," said Bill Curry, who lost to Mr. Rowland in 1994 and was hoping for a rematch but bowed out after Mrs. Kennelly entered. "Barbara's challenge is to show what really is wrong and how you would fix that. And it is hard to do that alone."
She has steadfastly refused to make her criticism of Mr. Rowland personal, although she has criticized him on his administration's efforts on foster care, environmental cleanup and higher education financing. "If I had to go personal I just never would have run," Mrs. Kennelly said.
Howard Reiter, a University of Connecticut political science professor, said Mrs. Kennelly has chosen safe issues to push during the campaign. "When you have a well-regarded incumbent," Dr. Reiter said, "you have to throw the rule book out the window. And she is not one to do that."
Mrs. Kennelly resists analyzing her campaign. "I do not want to do an obituary on the campaign," she snapped in a recent interview. "There will be plenty of time for that."
Mrs. Kennelly's campaign aides admit privately that they have no miracle strategy she can use to close the gap between her and Mr. Rowland. Over the weekend, the next to last before the election, she spent most of Sunday at home, attended only four minor events, attended no rallies of her own and gave no major speeches. Today, she visited a high school in Windham, where few of those listening to her stump speech were even eligible to vote. Her schedule over the final days will be busier, but the campaign will concentrate only on traditional Democratic constituencies.
A native of Hartford, Mrs. Kennelly attended parochial schools here and Trinity College, a Catholic women's college in Washington. Then she began volunteering for Catholic Family Services, providing aid to poor Hartford families.
She ran for a City Council seat in Hartford in 1975 and won. After her husband lost his speakership in the state House of Representatives, she successfully ran for Secretary of the State in 1978. Then in 1982 she ran for the United States House of Representatives.
A year later, she won a coveted place on the Ways and Means Committee. In 1991, she was appointed to a leadership post as deputy whip, and then in 1994 became the highest-ranking woman in the House when she was elected vice chairwoman of the House Democratic Caucus.
Mr. Rowland's campaign has attacked Mrs. Kennelly for voting for higher taxes, for failing to introduce legislation to help the Hartford schools and for coming late to the issue of reforming health maintenance organizations.
In response, Mrs. Kennelly said that although she has voted to raise taxes, she also voted for $275 billion in tax cuts last year. She said that because she did not sit on the education committee, she had little chance to introduce education bills, and that when she contacted the Federal Education Department on behalf of Hartford, Mr. Rowland's office spurned the help. And she said she had fought for better health care throughout her career.
Supporters say that she has a record of getting things done. "The tragic thing is Barbara has a lot to offer," said Carl J. Schiessl, a Democratic state representative who is retiring. "She is a tough, thoughtful, classy politician."
Mr. Rowland has also criticized Mrs. Kennelly for casting votes against welfare reform. She did vote against some reform provisions in committee, but Congressional records show that she also voted in favor of the final bill signed by President Clinton. She also points to a law she pushed helping low-income families buy homes. And Mrs. Kennelly also drafted the bill that became the basis for the 1993 expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is intended to help lift poor working families out of poverty.
"I knew long before reform became popular that our welfare system was awful, that it locked women and children into a terrible life," she said.
 
A Winning Evening With a Grateful Audience
Although her influence declined when the Republicans took over Congress, she helped draft a law during the 1997-98 Congressional term to allow people receiving Federal disability money to keep some of their financial benefits and their medical coverage when they start working.
That law was what brought her to Torrington last week to receive an award at Prime Time House, a nonprofit program that helps prepare mentally ill adults for work. The event produced one of those moments where the awkwardness disappears.
"I love the sense of freedom here," she said as she came to the end of her prepared remarks. "You can feel it." To illustrate her point, she told of an encounter a few minutes before with a woman named Karen, a member of Prime Time House.
"Karen said: 'I hate politicians,' " she recounted, as the audience laughed. "I said, 'Oh, no, no. You can hate politics, but don't hate politicians.' She said, 'I hate politicians,' " Mrs. Kennelly said as the audience, most of whom seemed to know Karen well, laughed.
"I said, 'Does that make you feel better?' She said, 'Yes!' I said, 'Good, go right ahead and hate politicians.' " At that, the audience gave Mrs. Kennelly a standing ovation.

HEADLINE: Dow Jones Presents Three-Year Plan to Bolste r Earnings

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER and GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
Less than a year after swallowing a $1 billion loss from its unsuccessful venture into financial information services, Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, announced a three-year financial plan yesterday that is intended to increase earnings 10 percent a year.
In a presentation to securities analysts, top Dow Jones executives emphasized the growth potential of the company's electronic businesses and signaled efficiency measures at The Journal and other publications. Still, while analysts have been lukewarm about the company's stock, and some dissident shareholders have called for a a more sweeping shake-up, the Dow Jones plan is a cautious one, some analysts said. It appears to be aimed more at assuring investors with evidence of self-discipline and less at inspiring them with a corporate vision. 
 "There's a lot of slow and steady building there," said Steven N. Barlow, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, after the meeting in lower Manhattan. "You've got a big organization that had been somewhat complacent in its budgeting processes -- never looking out all that far into the future. Just to institute thinking in that direction is something."
At yesterday's presentation, Dow Jones's chief financial officer, Jerry Bailey, said that the print publishing segment of Dow Jones, which includes The Journal, Barron's and several smaller publications, was expected to produce operating cash flow margins of 25 percent, down from 27 percent last year. He suggested there would be a more cost-conscious approach at The Journal, which had the most profitable year in its history last year, but which has experienced a sharp drop in advertising revenue in the last two months from a year ago. The company plans to invest more than $230 million over the next three years to expand The Journal's page and color capacity.
Dow Jones shares rose 75 cents yesterday, to $44.5625, but were still near their 52-week low of $41.5625, which was reached on Oct. 14.
"It's like a first date with someone," said David J. Winters, an analyst for Franklin Mutual Advisers. "You don't want to over-promise."
Mr. Winters, whose firm owns 3.8 million shares, or about a 4 percent stake, added, "Bailey is focused on doing the right things for the long term, which is what it is all about."
Another analyst was less impressed. "The long-term earnings-per-share targets don't seem that aggressive," said Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. "The target goals are just the averages of where they have been."
Still, many analysts see Mr. Bailey, 46, as a rising star at Dow Jones, which he joined in April after having been chief financial officer at Salomon Inc. from 1993 to 1997. He was recruited with the support of the descendants of the Bancroft family, who control the voting shares of the company, as well as that of the outside board members, who include Harvey Golub, the chief executive of American Express.
During a quarterly meeting of Bancroft family members on Oct. 6 at the Boston law firm of Hemenway & Barnes, the discussion revolved around the three-year plan prepared by Mr. Bailey, according to a person who was present but spoke on the condition of anonymity.
But Mr. Bailey's track record at Salomon was mixed, according to two former Salomon executives. When Mr. Bailey was named chief financial officer at Salomon, the firm had already begun an accounting review that eventually led Salomon to announce a loss of $364 million for 1994, roughly a third of which was a charge taken for "unreconciled balances" at its London operations.
Three weeks later, however, the firm announced $35 million more in losses because of a bookkeeping blunder. Salomon's chairman and chief executive at the time, Robert E. Denham, who is now a partner at the Los Angeles law firm of Munger, Tolles & Olson, said last week that the problem was not Mr. Bailey's fault.
But the second round of losses apparently upset top level executives. One, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said: "There is no question that some members of senior management felt it was Bailey's problem because he was the C.F.O. and all accounting reported to him. He had signed off on it."
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Bailey said, "Given the nature of anything that size, there are always changes in estimates." As to any lessons he learned from the experience, he said, "Do your homework on a company before you join."
Last week's management changes at Dow Jones included the coming retirement of the president, Kenneth L. Burenga, 54, and the elevation of Mr. Bailey and Peter G. Skinner, 54, the company's general counsel, to executive vice presidents. L. Gordon Crovitz, 40, a former editor and publisher of The Far Eastern Economic Review, was named senior vice president.
Mr. Crovitz's portfolio includes the electronic businesses from which the company hopes to get much of its earnings growth. The most visible of these endeavors, The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition, has been a success, attracting 256,000 paying subscribers by Sept. 30. It is expected to show a profit in 1999. The electronic products include the Dow Jones news wires.
The appointment of Mr. Crovitz has raised expectations that he may become a candidate for chief executive, succeeding Peter R. Kann, who has confounded dissident stockholders' predictions that the costly miscalculations on the former financial services unit, Dow Jones Markets, once known as Telerate, would cost him his job.
Indeed, the career path of Mr. Crovitz, a former editorial writer at The Journal, mirrors those of most Dow Jones chief executives who, as did Mr. Kann, began as journalists.
Asked if the new management changes gave clues to his eventual successor, Mr. Kann, 55, said, "I intend to be around for a while." He added, "I do think that, in a content company, whoever holds the top job should have a deep understanding about the editorial product and editorial integrity." But, he said, "There's no inevitability that a reporter always holds my title."

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE GOVERNOR;
Many Donors To Pataki Do State Business

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
In his quest for another term, Gov. George E. Pataki and his fellow Republicans have mounted the most successful fund-raising operation in New York history, drawing support from thousands of donors, many of whom share a common trait: they do business with the state.
Mr. Pataki and the Republican State Committee have collected more than $33 million since 1995, helping him ward off some formidable challengers and allowing him to spend well over $1 million a week in the final stretch of the campaign. 
 Millions of dollars came from donors with specific interests in action by the sprawling state government, from regulatory changes on issues like rent laws and utility rates, to consulting contracts and construction projects worth as much as tens of millions of dollars each.
In many cases, the Pataki campaign or the party solicited donations around the same time that contributors had matters before the Pataki administration, according to interviews and records.
While some of these donors have done business with the state for years and have contributed to whoever is in power, Mr. Pataki has attracted more money from a wider spectrum of businesses. And many began giving large amounts only when the state was making decisions important to their bottom lines.
Bell Atlantic donated $45,000 just as it sought approval to expand. Developers gave more than $400,000 while they were competing to buy the site of the New York Coliseum in Manhattan. And a consulting firm that won a $15 million state contract sent three donations totaling $50,000.
One example is a Long Island insurance conglomerate called the Robert Plan, which in July 1997 became one of the biggest backers of the Republican State Committee in recent years, giving $100,900.
Less then two months later, the State Insurance Department agreed to transfer control of most of the assets of two nearly bankrupt insurance companies in Binghamton, N.Y., to the Robert Plan, giving it 23,000 new policies and an outpost in upstate New York. The department and the company said the donations, the only ones it has made to the campaign or party in Mr. Pataki's term, had no link to the arrangement.
But that set of transactions, and others like it, shows how the Republicans have benefited from the powers of incumbency and the state's fairly weak campaign finance laws.
Compared with many other states, New York has high contribution limits and no constraints on who can give to candidates. The disclosure rules are lax -- the Pataki campaign has often released lists of contributors in tiny type and alphabetized by first name -- and the loopholes are easily exploited. There is little enforcement of the laws.
Earlier this month, Mr. Pataki described the state's campaign finance system as "dreadful," but he did not offer any proposal to change it.
He and his campaign aides declined to be interviewed for this article. In response to questions, a spokesman for the campaign, Michael Marr, read a one-sentence statement: "These reckless insinuations are the product of an overactive imagination."
Mr. Pataki's aides have previously defended his fund-raising, saying no one contributes because they are pressured or receive favors. The aides say donors are motivated by their support for his policies on issues like crime, welfare and the economy. They also point out that people with no interests before the state have given millions of dollars.
Federal prosecutors are investigating whether contributions connected to a construction company influenced the state's selection of it last year for a $97 million project at the Queens Midtown Tunnel. Pataki aides deny any wrongdoing.
In the 1994 election campaign, the most expensive in the state's history, Mr. Pataki raised nearly $15 million, about $3 million more than the Democratic incumbent, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. Mr. Pataki has collected more than $20 million for his current campaign. His Democratic opponent, Peter F. Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker, has taken in less than $6 million, most of which he spent in the primary campaign.
Mr. Pataki's only rival in campaign spending is the Independence Party candidate, B. Thomas Golisano, a businessman from Rochester who has vowed to pour $20 million of his own money into the race.
The contribution total of more than $33 million since 1995 includes money raised by the campaign and the party through its main state accounts. The Governor and the party have harvested millions of dollars more through other committees.
It is legal for Mr. Pataki and other candidates to accept money from these donors as long as there is not a specific trading of government actions for contributions. But the practice, while widespread, has stirred criticism in recent years from advocacy groups, which say the timing of these donations is often questionable.
In the case of the Robert Plan, the party received a $69,900 donation from its president, Robert Wallach, on July 3, 1997, the same day it got $31,000 from the Robert Plan. Two months later, after long negotiations, Mr. Pataki announced the transfer of business to the Robert Plan.
The State Insurance Superintendent, Neil D. Levin, said in an interview that the department did not know about the contributions. "That in no way was discussed," he said. He said a consultant helped manage the deal, which a judge approved. He said no one else expressed interest in the two companies.
Under the deal, the Robert Plan assumed most of the policies held by two nearly bankrupt companies, Home Mutual and New York Merchant Bakers, after the state determined that their collapse would harm policyholders and took control of the companies.
In return for getting the new policies, the Robert Plan, based in Bethpage, N.Y., promised to pay some of the companies' debts and keep most premiums level for a year.
John Reiersen, president of Eagle Insurance, the subsidiary of the Robert Plan that absorbed the other companies, said the contributions did not play a role. "There was not any particular quid pro quo here," he said.
For companies that are heavily regulated, gaining a favorable ruling from the state administration can have a sharp effect on revenues.
Last year, two of the region's largest communications companies, Bell Atlantic and Cablevision Systems, asked the State Public Service Commission to approve important expansion plans. In both instances, the companies applied around the time that they or their executives donated large amounts for the first time to the Pataki campaign or the party, according to records.
One plan involved the sale of cable systems. On June 9, 1997, Cablevision announced that it was acquiring several cable systems in New York from Tele-Communications Inc., which in turn received 33 percent of Cablevision. Some consumer advocates charged that TCI and Cablevision were forming an illegal alliance. Nine days later, the state party received a total of $45,000 from three members of the Dolan family, which controls Cablevision. The plan was approved in November 1997.
The Dolans had not donated before during Mr. Pataki's term and Cablevision previously had given a total of $2,600 to his campaign and the party.
Charles Schueler, a spokesman for Cablevision, said the Dolans had contributed at a long-scheduled fund-raising event. "Their participation was not related to any business matter, but an expression of support for Governor Pataki and his economic policies," he said.
In a statement, David Flanagan, a spokesman for the Public Service Commission, said approval of the Cablevision plan was routine. "The application was subject to full public scrutiny before it reached the commission for a decision," he said.
Bell Atlantic went to the state seeking permission to offer long-distance service in New York, a move that it said would offer consumers more choices. Long-distance companies objected.
A few weeks after Bell Atlantic filed with the commission in November, the Pataki campaign, while not mentioning the pending state decision, asked for a donation, said Paul A. Crotty, a group president at Bell Atlantic. On Dec. 12, 1997, the campaign received $25,000 from the company and $20,000 from Ivan G. Seidenberg, its chief executive.
"We didn't do it before because we hadn't been asked before," Mr. Crotty said. He denied a link between the donations and the commission, saying "Governor Pataki has been pretty good to any company that is like Bell Atlantic."
Mr. Flanagan emphasized that the commission set rigorous conditions for Bell Atlantic to offer long-distance service, which the company is now trying to meet.
Developers have been another major source of contributions, as they have been for politicians of both major parties.
One of the largest development projects handled by Pataki administration was the sale of the New York Coliseum, perhaps the most coveted development site in Manhattan.
By the time the state awarded the project this summer to a partnership of the Related Companies and Time Warner, the nine development teams that had bid, as well as their principals, had contributed a total of more than $400,000 to the Pataki campaign and the party, records show.
An executive on one of the losing development teams said officials of the Pataki campaign and the party often solicited all nine teams, particularly the five finalists. The Coliseum was not mentioned in these requests for money, but the context was understood, the executive said.
"There was such a huge amount of pressure on all of these guys," said the executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "The unsaid dictum was that if you do business with the government, you had better support your government."
The state picked the Related Companies and Time Warner in July 1998. On May 18, the Republican State Committee received $10,000 from Related. On June 9, it received $50,000 from the Time Warner parent corporation, the first time it had given to the Governor or the party.
Edward Adler, a spokesman for Time Warner, said, "The notion that we gave the money in exchange for anything to do with the Coliseum project is ridiculous." State officials denied that there was any link.
But the Coliseum bidders were not the biggest supporters in the real estate industry. Landlords lobbying to end rent regulations were.
Since 1995, the Rent Stabilization Association, the landlords' group, and its officers have given a total of nearly $1 million. Mr. Pataki has been more open to changing the rent rules than his predecessors, though he fell short of fulfilling the hopes of landlord groups last year when he brokered a compromise with the Democrats that left the system of rent regulations largely in place.
The pattern of state action and political contributions is highlighted in a consulting contract awarded to the firm of Deloitte & Touche.
In 1996 and 1997, Deloitte & Touche was one of three consulting firms seeking a $15 million contract to improve a state health care and nutrition program. During the bidding, it donated $25,000 to the party. In the two months after the firm won in February 1998, it contributed $15,000 more to the party and $10,000 to the Pataki campaign. Before the bidding, the firm had given a total of $4,000. The two other firms made no contributions, records show.
Robert Hinckley, a spokesman for the State Health Department, said Deloitte & Touche received the project because it had the lowest bid and the best application. Deloitte & Touche said its donations were "unrelated to the work."

HEADLINE: A Scruffy Old Tavern Is Now Luxury Apartments

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
Manhattan's oldest building is a venerable Georgian chapel, its second oldest, a graceful country estate. Its third oldest building was one of the foulest grog shops within staggering distance of the East River wharves.
And that was in the 19th century, before it got a really bad reputation. 
 Since 1976, the abandoned, four-story, city-owned structure at 273 Water Street, just south of the Brooklyn Bridge, had resisted every effort to rehabilitate it, defying one housing commissioner after another, crumbling all the while into an ever less salvageable eyesore.
But tomorrow, the little building -- looking better than it has since the Washington Administration -- will be officially reopened as a four-unit luxury apartment house. The key to the turnaround was a $1 sale price, a 14-year tax exemption and a private developer, Frank J. Sciame Jr., who was willing to spend $1.1 million on the property.
That is a big investment for a small yield. Four apartments, after all, don't go too far to solve the city's housing shortage.
But the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which sold the structure to Mr. Sciame last year for $1, believes the effort was worthwhile.
"It's well beyond the four units and the million dollars," said Hector Batista, the chief of staff and deputy commissioner in the housing agency. "It's stabilizing the community. I think this building, as small as it is, has that significance."
"One building can have a tremendous impact from a negative standpoint," Mr. Batista said, "but also from a positive standpoint."
Five years ago, Mr. Sciame, the principal of Sciame Development Inc., restored 247 Water Street, another wreck of a structure in the South Street Seaport Historic District. So he was game for the challenge of rebuilding 273 Water Street.
"How often do you get the opportunity to restore and attempt to recreate the third oldest building in Manhattan?" he asked.
Actually, historical purists take issue with that characterization, since 273 Water Street, between Dover Street and Peck Slip, was substantially altered over time and had been reduced in recent decades to a pile of rubble with a brick facade.
It appears, however, that the original house was standing by 1781, making it younger only than St. Paul's Chapel on lower Broadway and the Morris-Jumel Mansion in upper Manhattan.
The first occupant was Capt. Joseph Rose, a mahogany trader who kept his brig moored out the back door. It was Christopher (Kit) Burns who put No. 273 on the map in the 1860's by offering dog and rat fights as entertainment to the patrons of his tavern.
"It is simply sickening," Edward Winslow Martin declared in "The Secrets of the Great City," an 1868 tract. "Most of our readers have witnessed a dog fight in the streets. Let them imagine the animals surrounded by a crowd of brutal wretches whose conduct stamps them as beneath the struggling beasts, and they will have a fair idea of the scene at Kit Burns's."
Happily for posterity, the notoriety of the dog pits led to an article in Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper. An engraving from the issue of Dec. 8, 1866, furnished the only reliable visual clues available to the architect Oliver Lundquist, who restored the facade within the last year.
The sign for Burns's "Sports' Man's Hall" was not repainted. But the building did get a real slate roof with dormer windows. Original bricks and lintels were salvaged and reused. Central air-conditioning was installed to avoid the need for window-mounted units.
The apartments are for sale but will probably be rented in the near future, for $3,600 to $4,750 a month. A dog pit is no longer included.

HEADLINE: Asian Economic Crisis Hits Home, and Silicon Valley Is Targe

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
For several years, Mattson Technology Inc. in Fremont, Calif., embodied the Silicon Valley dream. Sales tripled from one year to the next. When the company's stock was first sold to the public in 1994, about a dozen executives became millionaires. One year the company took all employees and their families to Lake Tahoe for a Christmas vacation.
But this year, the Christmas party will probably be pot luck. Mattson's sales have dropped in half from their peak last year. One round of layoffs at the 400-employee company has occurred and another is in the works. And the company's stock, which traded above $16 in July 1997, has fallen to $5.375, making employee stock options worthless. 
 Mattson's travails come from across the sea. Two-thirds of its sales -- it makes million-dollar machines used in manufacturing computer chips -- are to semiconductor factories in Asia, which have cut back sharply on their spending in the face of Asia's economic crisis. "It's like a faucet," said Brad Mattson, the company's president. "They just turned off the spigot."
Mattson is perhaps an extreme case but it is not alone. Silicon Valley, the nation's cauldron of innovation, has suddenly been hit by a one-two punch from forces originating thousands of miles away.
The Asian economic crisis, which began in July 1997, has slowed exports, causing a cascade of layoffs. And the stock market volatility has battered technology company shares, making it harder for young companies to raise money and crimping the spending of workers whose sense of wealth is tied to the stock options that are considered a birthright in Silicon Valley.
The double blow has tempered the exuberance of a region that has witnessed an explosion of growth, prosperity and extravagance in the last few years, a region in which 20-something Internet millionaires routinely plunked down cash for fancy cars and close to $1 million even for a relatively plain three-bedroom house.
"Panic has not yet set in, but reality has," said Paul Saffo, an analyst at the Institute for the Future, a Silicon Valley research center.
The same forces are at work elsewhere, of course, but few parts of the country are as tied to both Asia and the stock market as is this area is. And fewer are more important to the nation's competitiveness.
So far, the damage has been slight. The unemployment rate in Santa Clara County, which encompasses San Jose and much of Silicon Valley, has climbed in recent months but was still an enviable 3.7 percent in September, well below the 6.9 percent rate in 1992 after cutbacks by military contractors. The expensive restaurants that have sprung up amid the burger joints near Stanford University are still bustling.
But million-dollar homes are no longer selling at the same frenzied pace and vacancies are starting to grow in the office real estate market. The electronics and computer industries ranked first and second nationwide in terms of the number of job cuts announced this year, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago-based outplacement firm.
"There is this noticeable crispness in the air, and not just because it's fall," said Betsy Collard, director of strategic development at the Career Action Center in Cupertino, Calif., which counsels those seeking new jobs. The Milken Institute, a nonprofit economic research organization in Santa Monica, Calif., forecasts that the San Jose area could experience a recession if the Asian crisis worsens.
San Jose surged ahead of New York and Detroit in the last few years to become the largest exporter among metropolitan areas, and nearly half of those exports go to East Asia, according to the Milken report. No American city is as dependent on Asian exports for income as is San Jose. But the impacts of the Asian crisis vary greatly. The biggest has been on companies that like Mattson, make the machinery used to manufacture chips. Applied Materials, the giant of this business, has cut about one quarter of its work force, or 4,000 jobs, this year.
Companies that make the chips themselves are also ailing, not only because of Asia's slump but because of its previous boom, when companies there built so many factories they caused a glut that depressed semiconductor prices.
The semiconductor business is known for its steep up and down cycles. But, "I've been in the business since 1957 and this is the worst one," said Alfred J. Stein, chief executive of VLSI Technology in San Jose. Though some chip companies and analysts see signs of an upturn, the pain is not over yet. The LSI Logic Corporation, in Milpitas, Calif., recently announced a 17 percent reduction in its work force.
Still, some economists say the impact of the Asian crisis has not been as big as expected. For California as a whole, increased exports to Canada, Mexico and Europe have helped offset a decline in shipments to Asia. Another tempering factor is that the biggest job growth now comes not from silicon chip manufacturing, the business that gave the region its nickname, but from smaller companies in newer fields like the Internet and computer software, which have less exposure to Asia.
"I don't feel we've been affected one bit by the economic turmoil," said Alex Kaplinsky, 26, managing partner of the local office of USWeb, a company that designs Internet software for corporate clients. Mr. Kaplinsky, who recently paid cash for a Porsche, a Lexus and a house, said his office has 27 job openings.
But jobs in the Internet economy are not always available to those from the silicon economy. "I know so little about their industry that it's a difficult transfer," said Art Hall, 50, who was laid off in June from Novellus Systems, a semiconductor equipment manufacturer in San Jose. Even if small companies escape the direct effects of the Asian crisis, however, they are still being hit by the stock market downturn, which makes it harder to raise capital.
Despite a strong rally in the last two weeks, an index of 275 technology stocks maintained by Hambrecht & Quist, a San Francisco investment bank, is down 14.2 percent from its high in July, compared with a 9.7 percent fall for the Dow Jones industrial average. USWeb's stock has fallen to $14.50, from a high of more than $38 in April.
The flow of initial public stock offerings has ground to a halt, with dozens either postponed or canceled. In September, only one high-technology company went public, versus about 10 a month in June and July, said Jim Davidson, manager of technology investment banking at Hambrecht & Quist. There has been none so far in October, though the recent market rally might change that.
Initial offerings provide the rewards to venture capitalists and other early investors in companies -- and to employees, who put in back-breaking hours in hopes their stock will be worth a lot when the company goes public. If that outlet is closed for long, the money flow can back up because lower rates of return can discourage future investing in initial offerings and thus less money for venture capitalists.
So far, the breakfast tables at restaurants favored by the venture capital crowd, like the rustic Buck's in Woodside and the upscale Il Fornaio in Palo Alto, are still buzzing. One morning recently, Ben Rosen, a New York venture capitalist, was having four back-to-back breakfast meetings at Il Fornaio with companies seeking investment.
Venture capitalists are now flush with cash and have a long time frame for their investments. Still, they acknowledge, a slumping market has a psychological effect, making them less willing to finance marginal ventures. Even solid companies will get less money than they would have a few months ago.
"Anyone with an Internet idea could get funding, and I think that's going to start to change," said Vinod Khosla, a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.
Some empty office buildings are starting to appear in a region that has had one of the lowest vacancy rates in the nation, about 4 percent by one estimate. Take the four-building Baytech business park in San Jose, built last year. It was first leased by Cisco Systems, a telecommunications equipment supplier, which turned out not to need the space. Then Applied Materials leased it, but ran into the Asian crisis. Now Applied is trying to sublease the never-occupied buildings.
Several retailers of cars and jewelry said they had seen no softening of sales so far. But at Mattson Technology and elsewhere, employees who now cannot count on stock options to increase their incomes are postponing purchases of big items.
Barak Kassar, 31, marketing director for Wink Communications, was shopping for a home he hoped to buy partly with proceeds from his company's initial public stock offering. But Wink, which makes interactive television technology, has put off its offering, and Mr. Kassar has stopped his house-hunting for now. "It just may be a few months longer," he said.
Six months ago, the housing market was manic. "Even for houses up to $5 million, there were sometimes two or three offers -- unbelievable," said Wendy McPherson, manager of the Menlo Park office of Coldwell Banker, a real estate brokerage firm. Homes often sold for tens of thousands of dollars more than the asking price. Lower-paid workers had to move as far as two hours away from their workplaces to find affordable housing.
Now, "we're not getting 10 offers on a house anymore," Ms. McPherson said, tooling her Mercedes past a three-bedroom ranch home with a narrow yard that is listed for $939,000 and had not sold in three weeks. Her office sold only two or three million-dollar homes in the last month, down from 10 or 12 a month earlier this year.
The median home price in Santa Clara County dropped 1.8 percent from August to September, to $366,550, according to the California Association of Realtors. Still, home prices are up a whopping 11.8 percent from a year ago. "This is heaven still," Ms. McPherson said. "We've lost our perspective over the last 20 months."
For now then, Silicon Valley's slowdown is only in comparison to the frenetic -- and unsustainable -- pace of the last few years. Many people here maintain an abiding faith in technology and their future prosperity. At a recent meeting on the region's future held by the Churchill Club, a public affairs forum, the theme was "Buy, Sell or Hold?" In a show of hands, only a smattering of people in the audience chose "Sell."

HEADLINE: A Hole in the Insurance Umbrella;
Storms Expose Thin Coverage of Puerto Rico Homeowners

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R.

 BODY:
In many ways, the capital of Puerto Rico does not look strikingly different from cities in the 50 states like Miami, Houston and parts of New York. There are plenty of modern office buildings, condominiums and fast-food places. And just as in those other cities there are lots of modest neighborhoods, away from the modern facades, with people who are just getting by.
But Hurricane Georges, which hit the island last month and caused several billion dollars of damages, has brought out one big difference: while nearly every home in the 50 states is insured, insurance executives and government officials estimate that only about 30 or 40 percent of those here are covered. 
 The result is that much of the cost of Hurricane Georges in Puerto Rico will not be shouldered by insurance companies. Instead, it will be borne mostly by the people of the island and the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington, using tax dollars collected everywhere but here, because Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the United States and its citizens do not pay Federal taxes.
"There's a different kind of insurance here," said Lemuel Toledo, a broker and consultant who has been in the insurance business for nearly 30 years. "It's called Federal aid."
While insurers in the 50 states are expected to spend six times what the Federal Government does for damage from Hurricane Georges in the Gulf Coast states, the Government will spend just as much in Puerto Rico as the insurers do: about $1.7 billion each.
"Unfortunately, every time a storm hits an area that is uninsured, or underinsured, taxpayers have to come in and foot much of the bill," said Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group in New York.
And something else is increasing Federal costs from hurricanes both here and along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Insurers, reeling from heavy losses from previous hurricanes, have raised their deductibles to 2 percent of the amount of coverage, up from the old standards of $250 or $500. For a $100,000 policy the deductible is now $2,000. One condominium complex on the beach here with $25 million in coverage has a deductible of $500,000.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency says people with big deductibles who need emergency repairs to live in their homes can get Government help and many homeowners and condo associations may be eligible for federally subsidized loans.
The reason many people in Puerto Rico do not have insurance on their homes, officials and insurers here say, is mostly a matter of dollars and cents. While there are plenty of mansions and limousines on the island, most people have little money. Annual income averages $8,500, less than half the average in Mississippi, the poorest state. But in Mississippi the majority of homeowners have mortgages and are required by banks to buy insurance. Here, people often build modest homes without mortgages -- sometimes worth less than $20,000, and they frequently go without insurance. Moreover, when people here buy insurance they most often buy bare-bones policies that do not cover furniture or theft.
But other reasons also account for the difference. Not only do most poorer Puerto Ricans count on Federal aid to bail them out of disasters, they also are victims, consumer advocates say, of insurers here who essentially ignore lower-income homeowners to concentrate on wealthier clients whose homes are sturdier and who buy policies with higher premiums. That, they say, is a form of discrimination often referred to as redlining, a term that grew out of the practice -- now outlawed -- by insurance companies and banks in places like Philadelphia, Detroit and New York of drawing red lines on maps around neighborhoods they decided to exclude.
Indeed, in the poor neighborhoods on the outskirts of San Juan, people say insurance salesmen never come calling. Residents say they do not really understand insurance and they assume they cannot afford it.
In the town of Toa Baja, Tanya Davila sat in a kitchen chair in the shade of her concrete-and-wood three-bedroom house, waiting for a representative of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Hurricane Georges ripped off most of her house's tin roofing and most of her belongings were ruined. The house, she said, is worth about $50,000.
"It never occurred to me to buy insurance," said Ms. Davila, 42. "Nobody ever came to talk to us about insurance."
She said she did not know anyone who had homeowner's insurance. "People don't buy disaster insurance because they know the Government is going to take care of them," she said. " 'If I can get something for free, why pay for it?' That's not my opinion. But that's the way a lot of people think."
In a section of neatly kept homes in the nearby town of Catano, Petra Gonzalez, 78, said she was hoping FEMA would repair the roof on her $25,000 wood-and-tin house.
"I didn't build this house thinking the Government would take care of me if something happened," she said. "I never imagined anything like this could happen. That's the truth. I'm a poor person. I'm an elderly person. My husband is gone. If the Government doesn't help me, there's nothing I can do."
Some insurers and brokers acknowledged that it was difficult, if not impossible, to get insurance on the many inexpensive wooden houses in Puerto Rico. Nor do insurers regard poor sections as prime markets.
"You'd rather deal with the upper- middle-class guy with a $250,000 home and four cars than the guy with a $30,000 home and one car," said Mr. Toledo, who now concentrates on commercial insurance. "It takes the same amount of time, but there is so much more premium and so much more commission."
This is not redlining, Mr. Toledo contended. "Redlining means somebody asks for insurance and you don't sell it," he said. "But if nobody asks, you're not redlining."
Juan Antonio Garcia, the insurance commissioner of Puerto Rico, also sees no discrimination. "This is a free-competition market," Mr. Garcia said. "The companies are at liberty to write whatever risks they want to write. People either buy it or they don't. I can't force them."
In the United States, J. Robert Hunter, the director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, said insurers have never publicly acknowledged redlining. Yet several big companies have paid millions to settle suits accusing them of redlining and have agreed to open offices in places where there has been no insurance sales force for decades.
"What's going on in Puerto Rico has all the characteristics of red-lining," said Mr. Hunter, who has made several trips here to work as an adviser to the Puerto Rican government.
Jose J. Villamil, a Wharton-educated economist who heads a consulting company, Estudios Tecnicos, which works with the government and private industry, said he did not believe insurers were deliberately discriminating against the poor. But he said that some of the remedies imposed in redlining suits should be applied in Puerto Rico anyway.
"The government has a role to play in terms of putting pressure on the companies," Mr. Villamil said. "The companies should be more pro-active in educating people about insurance and in providing access to insurance. Maybe they should develop products more in line with people's capacity to buy insurance."
About a dozen companies, mostly Puerto Rican, sell insurance on the island. Royal Group, a British insurer with more than 100 years of experience in the Caribbean, is among the leaders. Only two big United States companies -- Nationwide and American International Group -- sell homeowners' coverage in Puerto Rico, though the Allstate Corporation, is preparing to start selling here.
The difficulties of handicapping the risks on an island that lies in the path of hurricanes and in an earthquake zone, combined with the relatively small size of the Puerto Rico market at 3.8 million people, have kept the other big American players away, Mr. Goldstein said. "If insurers felt they could add to their bottom line," he said, "they'd be in there."
The insurance companies began imposing higher deductibles after Hurricane Andrew walloped southern Florida with $15.5 billion in insured losses in 1992. To get regulatory approval for the change, insurers in the United States threatened to cut back on the number of policies they wrote. In Puerto Rico, the insurers said that without the 2 percent deductible, the cost of reinsurance would force them to raise premiums beyond the reach of many.
Mr. Hunter, a former Texas insurance commissioner, said the high deductibles "may have been a necessary stopgap" immediately after Hurricane Andrew. But, he said, the insurance companies could reduce the deductible now without harm to their profit margins. "Reinsurance prices have come way down in the last two or three years," he said.
In any case, Mr. Hunter said, consumers should be given the choice, as they are in some states, of accepting either the high deductible or paying higher premiums.
Jose E. de la Cruz Skerrett, a plaintiff's lawyer who has often opposed insurance companies in court, estimates that with the 2 percent deductible, 80 percent of the losses from Hurricane Georges in Puerto Rico will turn out to be uninsured.
For some condo owners, the high deductible means significant costs. At the 13-story Solemar condominium on the beach in San Juan, Ivan Tort, the president of the board, estimates damages at $60,000 -- well below the $100,000 deductible on the condo's $5 million policy. So all the repairs are going to have to be paid by owners of the condo's 30 apartments. "If you live on an island," he said, "it comes with the turf."
At the 403-apartment Condado del Mar condominium nearby, Luis S. del Valle is not so sanguine. Mr. del Valle estimates damage at $1.5 million. But he says much of the building was unharmed and that the deductible -- now figured at $500,000 -- should not be based on the total value of the complex but only on the affected areas.
"We don't think this is fair," Mr. del Valle said. "Yes, we have a contract, but we believe there are some ambiguities. We're going to court. We're talking about a lot of money here."

Hurricane Georges is the third costliest hurricane to hit the United States. In Puerto Rico, only 30 to 40 percent of homes are insured, and most of those have only minimal coverage. That leaves the cost of rebuilding largely to the residents themselves and the Federal Government. Graph shows the worst insured losses from hurricanes.

HEADLINE: The Pride of Texas on a Bun

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
IN Texas, the long, winding road that leads to the ultimate hamburger ends in Amarillo, at a place called Arnold Burgers. There, in the state where beef is king and the hamburger its most perfect culinary expression, Arnold's delivers the goods in spectacular fashion.
The restaurant's standard-issue hamburger, the Arnold Double Burger, requires two slices of cheese to cover a five-and-a-half-inch, three-quarter-pound patty. Multiplied by two, that adds up to a pound and a half of meat per burger. "We have a triple-meat, too," Gayla Arnold, the owner, said. That's a full faceful of beef. But for the total burger experience, the ground-beef equivalent of surround-sound, Arnold's makes a burger that feeds 12 to 18. More than this, a hamburger cannot do. 
 What the croissant is to France, what goulash is to Hungary, what pickled herring is to Sweden, the hamburger is to Texas. It's a symbol, a necessity and a triumph, a part of the cultural patrimony so tightly woven into the fabric of Texas life that Texans themselves do not even remark on it until they are presented with the gray-tinged, underfurnished, suspiciously geometric hamburger that the rest of America lives with.
"The biggest shock of my life was in New York, where they served me a hamburger with no lettuce and tomato," said Ann Criswell, the longtime food editor of The Houston Chronicle and a third-generation Texan. "I thought that was so" -- she searched for the right word and settled on "primitive."
Texans love beef, and when they order a hamburger, they expect to see a lot of it on their plate -- freshly ground, cooked right and tasting like meat, not soybeans. Cooked right -- and this is the key to the Texas burger -- means seared on a grill until it gets crisp on the outside while remaining juicy inside, even if the patty is extra thin, a popular Texas style. Thick or thin, the burger must be served on a bun that's toasted until the perimeter gets a nice crunch to it, and then piled high with lettuce, sliced tomatoes, pickles and raw onions. Mustard and mayonnaise go on the bun, but never ketchup.
Texas, of course, claims that it invented the hamburger, sometime back in the 1880's. A historical marker in the town of Athens, about 60 miles southeast of Dallas, marks the spot where Fletcher Davis, the owner of a local cafe, first served fried patties between two slices of bread, garnished with a slice of Bermuda onion, pickles, mustard and mayonnaise. Local lore has it that Old Dave, as Mr. Davis was known, backed by a consortium of local businessmen, took his sandwich to the 1904 world's fair in St. Louis, where he set up a concession on the midway, called Old Dave's Hamburger Stand, and presented America with one of its most enduring culinary classics. It should not be confused with the Hamburg steak served in fancy restaurants in the mid-19th century, which was a kind of Swedish meatball doused in sauce.
The legend may be fact. A photograph of the stand exists, and a reporter from The New York Tribune wrote enthusiastically about the new sandwich, although he neglected to mention Old Dave. Making matters worse, he misinterpreted Old Dave's explanation of the fried potatoes that came with the burger. Mr. Davis said that he had learned to cook the fries from a friend in Paris, meaning Paris, Tex. The reporter filed a story saying that the hamburgers were being served with "French fried potatoes."
Originator or not, Texas took the ball and ran with it. "My theory is that before oil, cattle was the economic machine of Texas," said Robb Walsh, a Texan who writes a food column for Natural History magazine. "The culture came out of the cattle, but the cattle were tough. Hamburger and chicken-fried steak became the way to eat Texas beef." Tender steaks came from Midwestern cattle, fattened on feed lots. The restless grazing cattle that roamed the range demanded radical grinding or pounding to make their meat edible.
The hamburger put down deep roots all across the state, so deep that even the forces of modernization can't quite pull them up. Texans probably eat as many fast-food hamburgers as anyone else, just as Parisians (the French ones) put up with substandard baguettes, but there is a strong residual prejudice in favor of joints over chains. "You're in trouble if the place looks too clean and nice and there's a mom with her kids," said Michael R. Levy, the publisher of Texas Monthly magazine.
This is not purely a matter of nostalgia. Texans know that a ramshackle shed off the side of some forsaken stretch of country road could very well be turning out a succulent beef burger tweaked with some roasted chili peppers, or smeared with a fiery salsa, or -- well, who knows? In Texas, the house of the hamburger has many mansions.
At Kitok's, a 16-table establishment in Waco, customers come from as far as Dallas or Austin for the double-meat Liplocker with cheese, a no-nonsense production that features two thinnish, but not ultra-thin, hand-shaped patties seared to a nice crunch and dressed with just enough tomato, pickle, onion and lettuce to let the full meat flavor come through. Most customers order their Liplockers with Oriental fries, an imposing haystack of matchstick-thin vegetables dipped in tempura batter and deep-fried. The fries are an invention of the owner, a Korean woman named Kitok Moore.
Tookie's Restaurant in Seabrook, near Houston, serves several idiosyncratic hamburgers, all of them memorable. Stomp's Ice House Special comes with a topping of picante sauce, chopped jalapeno peppers, chopped grilled onions, lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise. It is a glorious mess of a burger, but it is rivaled by the Squealer, which incorporates hickory-smoked bacon in the ground beef, and the 99, made with ground beef that has been sitting for a couple of days in a spicy wine marinade.
Up the road, at the Goode Company Hamburgers and Taqueria in Houston, the truly superior burgers get a distinctive tang from cooking over mesquite and charcoal instead of the usual gas.
In San Antonio, local pride coalesces around the beanburger, a standard Texas burger that has been jazzed up with refried pinto beans, melted cheese and crushed Fritos. It's a 1950's innovation that has generated its own variations, like beanburgers with refried black beans, or beanburgers with guacamole topping.
Stoneleigh P, in Dallas, has taken the Texas hamburger about as up-market as it can go without looking like a dude. The house's signature burger, the Stoneleigh P, is a six-ounce patty served on a dome-shaped pumpernickel roll with lettuce, tomato, red onion, garlic mayonnaise and creole mustard. The patty comes from the B3R Ranch in the Texas Panhandle. The restaurant also sells a Rancho Deluxe, a full eight ounces of meat presented on an Italian rustica bun and coated with chipotle mayonnaise.
Most places like to surround their burgers with an air of mystery, and some chefs seem honestly bemused at their own creations. "I used to think it was the cook," said Paul Grubbs, the bartender at Adair's Saloon in Dallas. "But the cook left, and the burgers still taste the same. I think it's just because we've got a good old grill -- that, and we cook them slow. It takes 20 minutes to cook a hamburger here."
The Adair's burger is a serious candidate for the best burger in Texas. It is thick, pink in the center, juicy and flavorful. Aggressively seasoned with salt and pepper, it is served with a plump, shiny jalapeno pepper on top.
The cult of the grill reaches an extreme at Al's Hamburgers in Arlington, near Fort Worth. Back in 1957, Al Matthews opened his first restaurant, a drive-in, where the thin-patty burgers were cooked on a 1947 vintage cast-iron grill. When the lease ran out on Al's in the early 1980's and a shopping-mall developer took over the sacred space that Al's had become (4,000 people attended Al's farewell party), Mr. Matthews took his grill with him, stored it and brought it out again when he opened a new place in 1987. It performed valiantly until it developed a serious crack a few years ago and had to be retired, whereupon Mr. Matthews hunted up some old replacements.
"Al will not cook on a new grill," his wife, Thelma, said. "He wants it seasoned." A seasoned grill, most chefs agree, accumulates subtle flavors that the burgers pick up while they sizzle. Mr. Matthews, therefore, rubs his grill down gently, with steel wool and a little oil. "I don't ever scrape it," he said. "You see some people using a brick to clean one, but I don't do that."
Mrs. Matthews, however, says the grill is overrated as a factor. Fresh ingredients count for a lot more. "We use fresh ground chuck that is delivered every day, and we cook it well done and fast, searing it the way you would a sirloin."
Al's used to serve burgers with a meat-to-fat ratio of 80-20 but, in a concession to health consciousness, it reluctantly switched to chuck that is 89 to 92 percent lean. The Matthewses do not use newfangled bun-toasting machines, preferring to put the buns on the grill and then transferring the bun tops to the patties in the final stages of cooking, so that they pick up the fragrant steam from the burgers.
"What you might think is grease from the burger is actually condensation," Mrs. Matthews said. Mr. Matthews, eyeing a customer's single-meat cheeseburger, shook his head and said: "You ordered the wrong one. The double cheeseburger is juicier and better flavored, although I can't tell you why." He speculated that it may have something to do with the juices dripping from the top patty and being absorbed by the second one.
Gayla Arnold, of Arnold's, says she knows exactly why her hamburgers are good, but she can't quite bring herself to surrender the details. "The meat has a certain grind on it that a local market does for us, and a local bakery does our big buns," she said. "I don't like to say too much because a lot of local restaurants would like to copy our burgers."
In any case, analysis can take you only so far in getting to the heart of the Texas hamburger. "This is complex, like asking what makes Clinton tick," Mr. Levy, of Texas Monthly, said. "It's about the variations in the bread, the accumulation of grease on the grill, the level of grime in the restaurant. It should be cooked in grease to the extent that when you get within 25 yards of the hamburger stand itself, your heart is getting angry."
That kind of burger, artisanal and irregular, still thrives in Texas, and it can be found in all sorts of unexpected places, from gas stations to bowling alleys, like the Palace Lanes in southwest Houston or Showplace Lanes in north Austin, where the featured burger is a Double Striker.
Kincaid's, in Fort Worth, which routinely turns up at the top of the state's best-burger lists, started out in 1946 as a grocery store. As a way to use up his leftover beef, Charles Kincaid, the owner, began grilling hamburgers. Before long, hamburger operations had prevailed. Patrons now step up and place their orders at what used to be the meat counter. The store's shelves were shortened and converted into stand-up eating counters.
The same transformation may be taking place at Forget Me Nots, an antique store in Timpson, not far from the Louisiana border in east-central Texas. At the back of the store, Brenda MacKey, the owner, has wedged four tables and a counter into what used to be a back porch and now bears the name Back Porch Deli. There's nothing deli about it; it's pure Texas. When customers step up to the counter and order a cheeseburger, Ms. MacKey asks, "You want that all the way?" Something in her tone suggests that all the way is the only possible way to go, and that's how it turns out.
Ten minutes later, after the outdoor grill has given forth a cloud of smoke and a ball of fire, the $3.89, all-the-way burger hits the plate, and it's a beauty: eight ounces of fresh beef sitting on an extra-wide toasted bun and fully loaded with lettuce, tomato, dill-pickle slices, raw onion rings, mustard and mayonnaise. Anywhere else in America, Ms. MacKey's all-the-way production would cause a sensation. In Texas, it's exactly what people expect.
 
TEXAS BURGERS WITH CHIPOTLE MAYONNAISE
Adapted from Stoneleigh P, Dallas
Time: 30 minutes
 
2 1/2 pounds ground Black Angus or other high-quality sirloin
6 large crusty buns, preferably Italian rustica buns, split horizontally
12 romaine lettuce leaves
6 slices ripe beefsteak tomato
6 slices purple onion
Chipotle Mayonnaise (see recipe).
 1. Preheat grill, or place large well-seasoned skillet over medium-high heat. Preheat broiler. Divide ground beef into 6 equal portions, and shape into slightly flattened ovals. Sear burgers over high heat to brown, and crisp the exteriors while leaving interiors moist, about 2 1/2 minutes a side for medium.
 2. Put split buns on baking sheet. Place under broiler just long enough for surfaces to begin to color and have a slight crunch, about 15 seconds. Remove immediately, and place a split bun on each of six plates.
 3. Top a side of each bun with a grilled burger. On each plate place 2 lettuce leaves, 1 slice tomato and 1 slice onion. Top each burger with 1 spoonful Chipotle Mayonnaise, and pass additional mayonnaise separately.
 Yield: 6 servings.
 
CHIPOTLE MAYONNAISE
Time: 20 minutes
For pico de gallo sauce:
 
1 large ripe tomato
1 teaspoon chopped jalapeno pepper
2 teaspoons chopped cilantro
1 tablespoon finely chopped onion
1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce
For creole mayonnaise:
 
1 large egg
Salt
 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 garlic clove, minced
1 teaspoon Zatarain's or other creole mustard
 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 cup canola oil.
 1. Prepare pico de gallo sauce: In container of blender, combine tomato, jalapeno, cilantro, onion and chipotle pepper. Process until finely chopped. Transfer to bowl, and set aside.
 2. Prepare creole mayonnaise: Rinse and dry container of blender. Combine egg, pinch of salt, cayenne, lemon juice, garlic and mustard. Process briefly to mix well. With the blender at medium-low speed, remove small cap in lid, and very slowly add olive oil in a thin stream. Add canola oil in same way. When all oil is added and mixture has thickened, transfer mayonnaise to medium bowl.
 3. To creole mayonnaise, add pico de gallo sauce to taste. The Chipotle Mayonnaise should have the piquant, smoky flavor of chipotle pepper; it may not be necessary to use all the sauce. Mix well, and adjust salt to taste. Refrigerate until serving.
 Yield: 3 cups.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Bonds Gain AmidBig Sale of Corporate Debt

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Bond prices rose for a second day as the Associates Corporation of North America sold $4.8 billion of debt in the second-largest corporate sale ever, a sign that the concerns that have gripped financial markets are ebbing.
"The psychology in the market changed for the better" since the Federal Reserve unexpectedly cut interest rates on Oct. 15, for the second time in less than three weeks, said Leonard Lovito, who helps manage $30 billion at Chase Asset Management. He said Chase was buying some of the new Associates debt. 
 Treasury bonds gained after a report showing a drop in consumer confidence bolstered expectations for slower economic growth and further interest rate cuts. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 14/32, to 106 13/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.08 percent from 5.11 percent.
Companies are borrowing at least $7 billion in coming days to take advantage of low interest rates and rising demand for corporate securities. Associates, a unit of the Associates First Capital Corporation, the biggest publicly traded consumer finance company, raised its sale to $4.8 billion from $2 billion. That was topped only by a $6.1 billion offering by MCI Worldcom in August.
"The issuance side of the equation is starting to show a pulse," reflecting renewed demand for corporate and other debt, said Todd Barre, who helps manage about $10 billion at Harris Bank in Chicago.
After an 11-week lull, sales are happening more frequently as low interest rates and improving demand lure higher-rated companies -- and even some with below-investment-grade ratings -- into the market. Demand dried up after Russia devalued its currency and defaulted on some debt, sending investors rushing to safe investments. Investors are now returning to the corporate bond market after the Fed rate cuts and recent stock gains.
Treasuries received a lift yesterday after the Conference Board said consumer confidence fell to the lowest level in almost two years in October as stocks languished during the first part of the month and the employment outlook deteriorated.
The report "reinforces the market's feelings that the global turmoil would upend the consumer," said Anthony Crescenzi, head of government trading at Miller Tabak Hirsch.

HEADLINE: Bailed-Out Hedge Fund Cutting 18% Of Its Staff

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Long-Term Capital Management Inc., the hedge fund that a group of banks and brokerage firms rescued last month, laid off 33 people, or about 18 percent of its 178 employees, yesterday, according to people close to the firm.
The layoffs mostly involved people in the fund's offices in Greenwich, Conn., and London and affected several senior researchers and traders. They were concentrated in businesses that the fund is seeking to wind down, like investments in developing countries, and in the firm's equity trading, according to the people close to the firm. These people spoke on condition of anonymity. 
 There are also a few layoffs in Long-Term's Tokyo office, they said. No partners lost their jobs.
Late last month, a group of big banks and brokerage firms -- including Merrill Lynch & Company; Goldman, Sachs & Company; Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company and J. P. Morgan -- invested $3.6 billion to shore up the Greenwich hedge fund as it came close to running out of money after falling under pressure from huge borrowings.
That rescue, which resulted in the investing companies' acquisition of 90 percent of Long-Term's capital, was organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, although it involved no public money. The Fed and the rescuing institutions were particularly concerned that at a time of great fragility in many financial markets, a failure of Long-Term Capital might have had severe market consequences that might have even threatened the integrity of the financial system itself.
Long-Term Capital, which is now overseen by a committee made up of its new shareholders, is believed to be trying to reduce its risks and improve its returns. It is operating in a more favorable climate since the financial markets have recently calmed.
Those laid off by Long-Term Capital were paid through the end of the year, and they will also receive additional severance payments, according to an executive involved with the fund's business who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The layoffs are expected to result in a charge for the management company estimated at $1 million or $2 million. They were approved at a meeting of Long-Term Capital's oversight committee on Monday night.
Long-Term Capital was set up in 1993 by John W. Meriwether, a former vice chairman of Salomon Brothers Inc., along with several other senior Salomon executives.
The hedge fund, a lightly regulated pool of capital, began trading in 1994 and produced big returns in 1995 and 1996. This year it stumbled badly, particularly after Russia defaulted on its debt in mid-August, causing steep losses in markets around the world.

An international arrivals hall at Kennedy will soon be replaced by a temporary structure.

BYLINE: By Jane L. Levere 

 BODY:
ONE of the landmark sights at Kennedy International Airport, the parabolic arch at the entrance of the Terminal Four arrivals hall, will soon be demolished, along with the hall. Both structures will be replaced by a temporary arrivals area that opens Nov. 15.
Terminal Four, the former International Arrivals Building, is undergoing a $1.2 billion reconstruction, jointly developed by Schipol USA, the United States unit of Amsterdam Airport Schipol; LCOR Inc., a privately held developer based in New York, and Lehman Brothers, the investment bank. 
 The new terminal is being built around the old one, which, except for the original arrivals hall, will continue in use until the project is completed in 2001. Construction of the new terminal -- which at 1.5 million square feet will be Kennedy's largest, accommodating some 50 airlines -- began in May 1997.
The temporary arrivals hall, which air travelers must pass through to find ground transportation, will house a meeting area as well as a fast food restaurant, a newsstand, a flower kiosk and a hotel reservations center. It will remain open until the rest of Terminal Four is finished.
United States Customs and Immigration will remain in its existing place in Terminal Four until the new terminal is finished.

Airline Update
Cathay Pacific will begin daily nonstop Airbus A340 service between San Francisco and Hong Kong on Dec. 1.
Air New Zealand is giving passengers who buy a full-fare first- or business-class ticket from Los Angeles to Sydney, Auckland or London a 3Com Palm III organizer. Travel must begin before Nov. 15.
Virgin Group's Virgin Atlantic has opened a 2,200-square-foot lounge for first-class passengers in the south terminal of Gatwick Airport in London. Designed to accommodate 180 people, the lounge has a bar, a beauty salon, showers, a business center, a study, an observation room with four telescopes, a game room and a movie theater that can be reserved for private meetings.
AMR's American Airlines and US Airways are giving passengers on the US Airways Shuttle 500 miles in each carrier's frequent-flier program for every segment flown between New York and Boston or Washington. To qualify, travelers must be registered in each carrier's plan; the offer expires on Sept. 30, 1999. American and US Airways signed a marketing agreement earlier this year.
 
Rating the Airlines
Egon Ronay, the London-based hotel and restaurant critic, recently surveyed the trans-Atlantic economy-class service of 10 United States and overseas airlines and, not surprisingly, found it sorely lacking.
Mr. Ronay and his staff flew each airline at least twice between August and October, during the day and at night, and rated each for check-in procedures and efficiency; comfort and size of seats; friendliness and efficiency of staff; quality of food, in-flight entertainment and pilots' in-flight comments, and the condition of lavatories.
In a complicated ratings procedure, Virgin Atlantic came out on top over all with a score of 66 percent, followed by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (64 percent), Continental Airlines (59 percent), Air France and U S Airways (58 percent), Delta Air Lines (57 percent), UAL's United Airlines (55 percent), British Airways (51 percent), American Airlines (48 percent) and Northwest Airlines (47 percent).
In the food rating, Air France scored highest, with 54 percent, followed by Delta, KLM and Virgin Atlantic (50 percent); US Airways (43 percent); American Airlines (38 percent); British Airways (34 percent); Continental and United (29 percent), and Northwest (25 percent).
Mr. Ronay chastised all airlines for their "lamentable attitude toward passengers' convenience and comfort" and called the seats "corset-like and knee-crunching," the food "disgusting" and the lavatories "inadequate."
"We were surprised at the poor conditions and discomfort, redeemed only by the friendliness of the majority of in-flight staff and the sometimes good in-flight entertainment," he said.

RUSSIA: U.S. IS ASKED FOR FOOD AID
 Russia has formally asked the United States for food aid for the winter, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said, as indications grew that financial help from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank will not be turned on again this year. The I.M.F., which sent $4.8 billion to Russia in July, has suspended its $17 billion financial bailout package because the Government has not yet published a budget and is printing money to pay its debts, sending inflation soaring.

RUSSIA: YELTSIN IN SANITARIUM
 A day after he canceled a trip to Vienna, pleading exhaustion, President Boris N. Yeltsin checked into a sanitarium outside Moscow for an indeterminate period of rest. Mr. Yeltstin's office insists the 67-year-old President is suffering from general weakness as a result of a crippling attack of bronchitis. Michael Wines (NYT) 

RUSSIA: OIL EXPORTS SURGING
 Russia expects record exports this year of crude oil, its top foreign-currency earner, despite earlier pledges to cut its sales to help stop the slide in world prices, Energy Minister Sergei Generalov said. He added that there was a lack of any other source of cash. (AP)
 
BRITAIN: PINOCHET RULING DUE
 The High Court said it would rule Wednesday on Gen. Augusto Pinochet's bid to be set free and avoid extradition to Spain, where a judge wants him to face charges of murder, torture and kidnapping. The onetime Chilean dictator, 82, remained under police guard at a London clinic. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
GERMANY: BAVARIAN ABORTION RULING
 Germany's highest court ordered Bavaria to fall in line with the rest of the country and allow abortion clinics. The Constitutional Court ruled that a Bavarian law prohibiting such clinics was detrimental to women's health by forcing them to travel to get an abortion. (NYT)
 
TURKEY: CASPIAN OIL INCENTIVES
 Turkey is offering oil companies new incentives to build a pipeline from the Caspian Sea that the United States considers strategically vital. According to diplomats in Istanbul, Turkey's package of concessions for oil companies is likely to include tax exemptions, reduced transit fees and other incentives. Stephen Kinzer (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
RUSSIA: KURILE ISLAND FOR RENT
 Residents of one of the disputed Kurile islands are threatening to rent their island to Japanese businessmen unless the Russians repair the plant that supplies them with electricity. The Interfax news agency said signatures from Shikotan's 3,800 inhabitants were being collected to be sent to Moscow. The status of the islands has been at issue since Russia occupied the four southern islands in the chain in World War II. (Agence France-Presse)
 
INDIA: PAKISTANI RAID REPORTED
 Indian military officials said their troops repulsed a new attack by Pakistani soldiers on Monday intended to capture an Indian military post on the disputed Kashmir border. Pakistani military authorities rejected the report as "rubbish." (Reuters)
 
NORTH KOREA: FOOD SITUATION IMPROVES
 After visiting North Korea, the head of the United Nations Development Program called the food situation there "much improved" compared with two years ago. But James Gustave Speth said in Beijing that undernourishment was still common in North Korea, particularly among older children. Aid has focused on children under 7. Elisabeth Rosenthal (NYT)

ARGENTINA: MENEM IN LONDON
 President Carlos Saul Menem, left, arrived in London for an official visit aimed at increasing trade between Argentina and Britain and putting their 1982 Falkland War behind them. During the visit, the first by an Argentine leader since 1960, he will visit the memorial to Britain's Falkland dead at St. Paul's Cathedral, but there will be no talks over the islands' sovereignty. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
CHILE: LATIN SELLOFFS INCREASE
 Despite a looming economic slowdown, Latin American governments have increased the rate at which they are selling off their public enterprises to foreign companies, according to the Chamber of Commerce of Santiago. Its study reported that the region's privatizations between January and September totalled $31 billion, a 6 percent increase over the same period last year. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
MEXICO: BLEAKER ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
 Mexican economic growth in 1998 will be no higher than 3.7 percent, compared with the 4.5 percent the Government had forecast, according to two studies commissioned by business groups. Inflation, which the Government had hoped to hold to no more than 12 percent, is likely to run closer to 16 percent. Sam Dillon (NYT)

HEADLINE: Mexico's Wanted Poster Exchanges Black Hat for White Collar

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 27

 BODY:
The halls of Mexico's Congress are adorned these days with wanted posters that show a man whom many opposition lawmakers consider to be an unrepentant white-collar outlaw.
He is Guillermo Ortiz Martinez, the former Finance Minister who heads the central bank and is one of the Mexican officials who command the most respect on Wall Street and among policy makers in Washington. 
 After months of tempestuous debate that has dominated Mexican politics the parties in Congress have not agreed on much about financing a $62 billion bailout of the country's banks. But one point of accord among the opposition groups is that they want Mr. Ortiz to be impeached.
In separate initiatives on Monday the left-of-center Party of the Democratic Revolution and the conservative National Action Party presented formal petitions in Congress to begin impeachment proceedings. The opposition holds a majority in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, where the process started.
The proposals for a political trial of Mr. Ortiz are largely symbolic, because they are virtually certain to be blocked in the Senate, where the governing party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, remains in control.
But the challenge to Mr. Ortiz shows how bitterly the dispute has polarized the discussion over the financial system as the slide in world markets brings uncertainty and a slowdown to an essentially robust economy that Mr. Ortiz did much to build.
Mr. Ortiz is the opposition's target because as Finance Minister after a catastrophic devaluation of the peso he stitched together the emergency program in 1995 that subsidized overwhelmed debtors and bought bad loans from failing banks.
In exchange for the relief the banks' shareholders were required to make new injections of capital. The bailout has been widely credited with saving the wobbling banks from collapse.
In March the Government sought permission from Congress to refinance the bailout by including it in Mexico's overall public debt. The opposition balked, accusing the Government of seeking to rescue high-living bankers at the expense of overburdened taxpayers.
In general opposition legislators are not accusing Mr. Ortiz of corruption. Rather they argue that he violated the Constitution by contracting billions of dollars of Government debt to shore up the banks without having consulted the Congress.
"This is not a personal attack on Ortiz," said Santiago Creel Miranda of the National Action Party, head of the Chamber of Deputies subcommittee that would start an impeachment. "But he was the one in charge at the time. Up to now accountability has always been a theory in Mexico. For the first time we want someone to be held responsible for a violation of the Constitution."
The Government has responded that the bailout was fully legal, based on a statute that allows certain types of Government debt without legislative consent.
"I respect Congress's prerogative to take this action, but I am convinced that I acted fully within the law," Mr. Ortiz said in an interview.
As a measure of Wall Street confidence in Mr. Ortiz, who also managed the successful $12.5 billion emergency loans that the Clinton Administration made to Mexico, the Mexican stock market plummeted 2 percent in a few hours this summer when a rumor circulated that he was resigning from the central bank.

HEADLINE: On Eve of Election, Mostly Apathy

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: MORENO VALLEY, Calif., Oct. 24

 BODY:
Four years ago, people interviewed in this bedroom community of stucco houses, strip malls and independent-minded voters expressed deep disappointment with President Clinton and complained vehemently about declining wages, rising taxes and worsening crime.
Two years ago, the bitterness about Mr. Clinton had receded as voters raised concerns about the Republican Presidential nominee, Bob Dole, and said his party was too extreme. 
 Now, dozens of random interviews on the eve of another election show that the outlook of voters here had shifted yet again: They do not seem exercised about anything.
In a startling contrast to past years, voter after voter could not name a single issue that weighed heavily on them. They could not muster enthusiasm for any candidate. They were sick of hearing about Monica S. Lewinsky, and the talk of impeachment exasperated them even more. The only political matters on their minds, if any, were the most local of issues, like school board elections.
"There's nothing that affects me so much that I've got to vote on it," said Cathy Scharwark, a 35-year-old math teacher who is an independent. "My life on Nov. 4 is going to be the same as on Nov. 3. I don't see how voting one way will change it."
It is voters like those in this fast-growing region, 75 miles east of Los Angeles, where many people have no deep political roots or traditions, who are confounding, and even causing alarm, among Democratic and Republican strategists alike. This close to the elections, candidates say they are still struggling to identify issues that engage the public. As a result, they are aiming their appeals at a narrow, and not particularly representative, slice of the electorate that is considered most likely to vote.
That is why Rich Neimand, a Democratic consultant, has likened this campaign season to the "Seinfeld" television program. It is, he says, about nothing in particular.
This middle-class sprawl of seemingly endless suburbs, called the Inland Empire, is not usually a haven of apathy. In fact, it is a pivotal area that pollsters watch closely for hints of possible mood swings in the American electorate. In interviews in past years, voters here were rarely at a loss for words about their personal agenda, or politicians they supported or reviled.
But not this week.
As she watched over her two little girls at a pumpkin patch here, Cindy Taylor, a 31-year-old homemaker who is a Republican, was asked what she considered the big issues this year. "Refresh my memory -- tell me a couple," she pleaded gently. "There's nothing that pops straight in my head."
Asked the same question, Brian van den Burg, a 20-year-old business student who is an independent, said, "Gee, nothing in particular."
David Waltemeyer, 34, a fire captain who is a Republican, did come up with a ready answer. But it was not about weighty issues. "Safe and sane fireworks," he said, explaining that he was rankled by a measure that would legalize fireworks.
Mr. Waltemeyer, who was cheering his son at soccer practice, said he was stumped on coming up with any bigger issues, saying his usual fears about the economy had been calmed. "Things here have really turned around in the last 12 months," he said.
Only a few years ago this area, once blanketed by orange groves, was sprinkled with foreclosed homes, the outgrowth of the economic downturn and large military cutbacks. Now, the economy has rebounded somewhat and people are more content and not particularly moved by anything that is happening in Washington.
"I'm pretty happy with the way things are going," said Andy Stetkevich, 39, a Democrat who is a staff development official for the local school district. "I realize there's a lot that's going on in Washington. But if we looked at all of Washington and dug into all of the scandals, there might not be anybody to vote for."
Almost no one mentioned the White House scandal. When asked about it, virtually everyone offered similar answers: They had heard enough -- in many cases, too much -- about Mr. Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Though they condemned Mr. Clinton's conduct, they did not think the President should resign or be impeached.
"They need to leave him alone," said Carol Simpson, 31, a cosmetics saleswoman who votes Democratic. "If Hillary can handle it, if she's happy with it, that's her husband."
Ms. Simpson's husband, Pierre, 35, a Republican, agreed: "He's only got two more years in there anyway."
Voter after voter said the scandal would have no impact on how they voted.
"It doesn't affect how I feel about Democrats," said Diane Rowley, 43, a homemaker who is a Republican. "What he did is what he did."
Ella Ramirez, 49, an unemployed electronics worker who is a Democrat, said, "You can't blame it on anyone else but him. He's his own person."
Of the dozens of people interviewed, only Eric Nielsen, 41, a Democrat who said he had voted twice for Mr. Clinton, said the President's conduct would affect how he voted for every candidate on the ballot. Mr. Nielsen, who is the kind of voter that many commentators expected to see more of, said he intended to vote "across the board for non-Democrats," not because he is enamored of Republicans, but because he is so enraged at Mr. Clinton.
"What he did is his own personal business," said Mr. Nielsen, a construction designer. "But he told a stupid, silly lie. How can you believe anything he says? It's impossible at this point." But even Mr. Nielsen's indignation goes only so far. "Impeachment seems silly," he said.
Another Democrat, Greg Davis, said the scandal would cause him to oppose Senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat being challenged by Matt Fong, the State Treasurer. While Mr. Davis said he was not particularly bothered by Mr. Clinton's personal behavior, he said Ms. Boxer had aggressively opposed Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court because of accusations of sexual harassment but has been relatively quiet about the President.
"She was so tough on Clarence Thomas," said Mr. Davis, 37, who designs air-conditioning systems. "That's hypocritical."
Mr. Davis was one of the few people who even mentioned a particular candidate. Most admitted not knowing much, if anything, about the Senate candidates or the candidates for governor, Lieut. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, and Attorney General Dan Lungren, a Republican.
The issue that drew a trace of passion was a state ballot measure that would allow broad expansion of casino-style gaming on Indian lands throughout the state.
"Leave the Indians alone," Randy Jones, 46, a Republican who was having a slow day selling pumpkins, said in a refrain that came up in several interviews. "Let them have their casinos."
Asked if he planned to go to the polls, Mr. Jones said, "If they catch me."

HEADLINE: Not Just Leaving the Light On;
Motel 6 Is Still a Cheap Sleep, but With New Strategies

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
Motel 6, a stubbornly utilitarian chain for most of its 36 years, has been making some fancy moves lately.
Already the biggest chain of company-owned and -operated budget motels in the United States, Motel 6 is now aggressively selling franchises. And it is spending $600 million to overhaul all 85,000 rooms at its 781 existing motels. 
 Moreover, Motel 6 is considering entering the extended-stay market, a fast-growing niche that offers low-priced rooms with separate sleeping, working and cooking areas for penny-pinching corporate nomads, consultants and others who need rooms for a week to several months.
The changes have come as a surprise to some in the hotel industry, given Motel 6's reputation for steadfastly resisting change or innovation for most of its 36 years. After all, the company has stuck with the same folksy advertising line -- "We'll leave the light on for you" -- since 1986.
But is Motel 6 choosing the wrong moment to strike out in new directions? It's possible, according to some analysts. "It will be a difficult time for Motel 6, especially if there's a slowdown in the economy in 1999," said John J. Rohs, the hotel analyst for Schroder & Company.
Fortunately for Motel 6, the expansion comes after a turnaround in its fortunes.
The chain, based in Dallas, was on the ropes soon after being acquired by Accor S.A. of France in 1990 from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, the leveraged buyout firm, for $2.3 billion. In 1993, Motel 6 lost $40 million, hurt by accusations that its guests were easy prey for criminals and by a downturn in the hotel industry. But after breaking even in 1995, the company turned a modest profit in 1996 and earned $75 million before taxes last year. It expects to earn $100 million this year.
"The turnaround of Motel 6 has been more difficult than we expected," said Georges Le Mener, the chain's French-born chief executive, who before the purchase of Motel 6 headed much smaller North American and Pacific hotel operations for Accor from an office in New York. "But we're here for the long term."
The United States is clearly an important market for Accor, the world's fourth-biggest hotel company and owner of more upscale European-based chains including Sofitel and Novotel. So important that from 1991 through 1993, a time when Motel 6 had 525 motels and was losing money, Accor spent $700 million for 200 more properties.
Last year, Motel 6 accounted for only 13 percent of Accor's $5.5 billion in revenue but 30 percent of its earnings before interest and taxes.
Mr. Le Mener says that Motel 6's management philosophy is blending European concern for people and quality with American skill at marketing, operations and finance. The most significant change for Motel 6 has been franchising, which it began in earnest about a year ago. Its strategy is to use franchising to expand quickly, primarily throughout the Eastern United States, which has only about one-third of Motel 6 properties.
For allowing the Motel 6 name and red-white-and-blue logo on franchised properties, the company receives 4 percent of revenue for Motel 6 operations and another 3 percent for marketing and reservations.
While that is a fraction of the return possible from company-owned properties, Motel 6 executives say franchising is a quick and low-cost way to maximize name recognition and invade new markets. That strategy, widely adopted in the 1960's and 1970's by more upscale chains, fueled the expansion of Holiday Inn, Sheraton, Hilton, Hyatt, Ramada Inn and other hotel companies, big and small.
Today, 64 percent of America's 3.7 million hotel rooms are affiliated with hotel chains, according to Smith Travel Research, two-thirds of them through franchise arrangements.
Franchising also complements the company's strategy by putting smaller hotels in smaller communities, cities and towns that Motel 6 formerly ceded to other chains. Unlike company-owned properties, which average 115 rooms, franchised Motel 6's will average 60 to 80 rooms.
At the same time, the chain is nearly finished with a $600 million overhaul of all its 85,000 rooms. And in what passes for a radical departure from its Spartan one-type-fits-all style, Motel 6 now offers a new prototype at 27 properties that features central heating and air-conditioning, bathtubs as well as showers and an emphasis on landscaping.
Of course, no one is likely to mistake a Motel 6 for the Ritz. Even the new style echoes the look and feel of the original hotels. The chain is firmly anchored in the budget market, with an average room rate of $37 a night, still a few dollars below what competitors charge for a comparable room.
But with a telephone and desktop color television set in each room, a fax machine available 24 hours a day and other amenities, Motel 6 has come a long way since it started in 1962, charging just $6 a room. When Tom Bodett, the humorist, promises "We'll leave the light on for you," the light is one it is actually possible to read by.
And change may have been long overdue at Motel 6.
"For the first 20 years, Motel 6 didn't change anything, because as the Interstate highway system expanded it expanded along with it," Mr. Le Mener, Motel 6's chief, said. "But even when your price is very low, there comes a point where if you are not perceived as giving value, nobody will buy."
But one possible change that has raised questions is the proposed move into the extended-stay business. Mr. Le Mener said no decision was expected before spring but noted that traditional budget motels were losing customers to extended-stay properties -- an acknowledgment that seems to suggest that the company is leaning toward getting into the business.
Some analysts think it is already too late to become an important player in that market, where the economy segment ($200 to $350 a week) is dominated by Extended Stay America, a chain created by H. Wayne Huizenga, the founder of Blockbuster Entertainment and Waste Management Inc.
Still, there may be room for new competitors: Bear, Stearns recently forecast a shortage of extended-stay properties in about a year in "hundreds of lodging markets." Mr. Rohs, the Schroder analyst, noted that the growing acceptance of the extended-stay concept could make it easier for Motel 6 to enter the market -- unless the new business came at the expense of its traditional motels.
Mr. Le Mener expresses caution. "With our $1.1 billion, we could already have gotten into extended stay, but we're moving slowly," he said, adding that Motel 6 was well positioned to buy an existing brand at a favorable price during the lodging industry's expected downturn.
The $1.1 billion is the amount raised from the sale of 288 properties last year to such companies as Philip Morris and U.S. Realty. Motel 6 retains management control of the properties for 20 years, with renewable options.
Motel 6 raised an additional $325 million in 1996 as part of a consortium with financial companies, including Chase Manhattan Bank and Merrill Lynch. The consortium created a holding company specifically for purchasing 65 California motels, which Motel 6 promptly agreed to lease for about $270 million and convert to its brand. The remaining funds will be spent buying additional properties.
"That allowed us to grow our balance sheet and revenues without adding to our real estate inventory and liabilities," said Armand Sebban, Motel 6's chief financial officer.
While many changes are aimed at attracting new guests, Motel 6's strategy is also directed at retaining the loyalty of its 33 million annual customers, few of whom are on expense accounts. Many of them are retirees, members of the military, families with young children or students. A growing number are foreign visitors.
"Their motels are always clean and comfortable, the price is very good and the people are pleasant," said Gail Eidukonis, a retired bookkeeper from Wallingford, Conn., who with her husband, Edward, is a Motel 6 enthusiast.
During a recent seven-week trip to California, the Eidukonises stayed exclusively at Motel 6's, except for three nights when they found no vacancies in them.
"When we were in Oklahoma City there was a tornado scare about 4 in the morning," Mrs. Eidukonis said, "so the manager invited us to wait it out in an inside room behind the office, and had coffee for us."
Until a few years ago, some Motel 6 guests might have chosen to brave the tornado's wrath rather than venture from their room before sunup. Concerns about security were heightened in 1992 after a $10 million settlement of a negligence suit brought by a woman who was repeatedly raped by two ex-convicts who forced their way into her room at a Motel 6 in Fort Worth.
The rape occurred before Accor acquired the chain, but the new management suffered the fallout. After the settlement, a front-page article in The Wall Street Journal highlighted the issue of lax security at budget motels.
"We didn't know about the lawsuit, and we clearly underestimated the problem," Mr. Le Mener said. "In Europe, the level of crime is way, way below what we found here."
Motel 6 sold about 100 properties it deemed unsafe and beefed up security elsewhere. It installed electronic door locks and deadbolts as well as high-intensity outdoor lights and closed-circuit television cameras, and it put security guards at almost half its properties. Its newest properties also have interior corridors, which especially appeal to the growing number of women travelers.
Motel 6 has also put emphasis on cleanliness, the condition of its properties, attention to complaints and employee attitudes toward guests. Training and improved benefits, as well as cash incentives and weeklong cruises to the Caribbean for top producers, have encouraged employees to make improvements, Motel 6 executives say.
Yet for all the activity, Motel 6 remains unchanged in many ways. It still has only a single brand. Its motels do not have meeting rooms, suites or floors for business travelers. They do not give frequent-flier miles or free room nights even to their most loyal guests. The only discount is 10 percent off for members of the American Association of Retired Persons. And the chain's 12-year-old ad campaign with Mr. Bodett is also virtually unchanged, except for having expanded to television in 1996.
Which is still the way Motel 6 likes to operate. "The tag line about leaving the light on, which Tom ad- libbed, conveys a sense of warmth and caring," said Carol Kirby, the head of marketing for Motel 6. "My claim to fame," she added, "is that I had the sense not to change it."

HEADLINE: About New York;
Mr. Earth Day Has New Goal: Star of Hope

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
WHEN John Glenn returns to space tomorrow he will behold a humbling view of Earth that few have savored. John McConnell can appreciate the old astronaut's perspective, and he doesn't even have to leave his apartment in Ridgewood, Queens. In a corner of his kitchen is a flag emblazoned with the Big Blue Marble. Next to it lies the instrument panel that guides him through his favorite space: cyberspace.
The computer lets Mr. McConnell circle the globe before the space shuttle reaches orbit. His mission? To urge others to save the planet by becoming Earth Trustees, individuals whose choices about life and ethics will usher in an era of global peace and cooperation. This is not a stretch for him, since Mr. McConnell, 83, was also the brains behind Earth Day, the eco-fest first celebrated in San Francisco on March 21, 1970. This year it was celebrated on the Mir Space Station, among other places. 
 Despite the popular misconception, Earth Day was not intended to be some hippie-dippy hazy holiday. Mr. McConnell, the son of a traveling preacher, is spiritual and serious about its implications. He thinks society has the technology to bring people together, even if only virtually at first.
"We keep trying to move in the direction of those goals," said Mr. McConnell, whose Web site is www.earthsite.org. "Actions, good or bad, begin in the mind. If we want to resolve conflict and rejuvenate our planet, we need people to be enthralled and have a sense of wonder of our amazing world."
All this started while he was gazing into space many years ago. As a child, Mr. McConnell was awed by the stars that shimmered in the night. His religious upbringing helped pique his curiosity about essential questions of humanity. Those varied impulses converged in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik. "In the context of the cold war, that was terrifying," said Mr. McConnell, who published a newspaper in North Carolina at the time. "Everybody had the jitters with that Sputnik up there."
He wrote an editorial proposing a peaceful satellite, a Star of Hope that would be visible from Earth as it flashed at the rate of a baby's heartbeat. The idea was published in other newspapers and led to a meeting with President Eisenhower.
The satellite was never launched, but he was now on a new trajectory. He devised "A Minute for Peace," public service television announcements that urged people to set aside a moment each day to ponder how they could improve the world. But why stop there? By the late 1960's, he had moved to New York and embraced the world itself when he came up with Earth Day.
"What brings people together is their local holidays," he said. "Every country has holidays. What we needed was a holiday for the whole planet."
The goals he set for Earth Day live on in the Earth Magna Charta, in which he outlines his current campaign for Earth Trustees. It requires no change from your pocket, only a change of heart.
"Simply stated, every individual and institution on our planet should join in choosing what will eliminate pollution, poverty and violence," he said. "To do this, we have to address the issues in ecology, economics and ethics."
WHILE he and his wife, Anna, would prefer to be living among the redwoods of California, they do what they can east of Eden, in Queens. They keep in touch with like-minded people through their computer and have amassed an impressive archive of documents, videotapes and other records of their decades in environmental work. While their apartment is tucked among a row of brick houses that face an asphalt playground, they grow herbs and vegetables in a small garden behind the kitchen.
"Everyone has to make compromises," he said. "If you want your efforts to count, though, you must make contact with other individuals."
That explains his other compromise: living in Queens.
"This is the last place I would live," he admitted. "The only reason I'm here is because of my greater opportunity to influence the United Nations."
He often visits representatives of international organizations to promote his ideas. Now if he could persuade someone with big bucks to launch the Star of Hope.
"It would have progress reports from around the world on the progress they're making as Earth Trustees," he said. "It would be a great way to usher in the new millennium: an outrider of planet Earth."

HEADLINE: Confidence Index Drops Further

BYLINE: ByThe Associated Press 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence tumbled to its lowest level in nearly two years earlier this month amid increasing concerns about global economic and political troubles.
The Conference Board reported yesterday that its index of consumer confidence fell 9.1 points, to 117.3, from a revised 126.4 in September. The last time the index was lower was in December 1996. 
 The decline in the survey, which ran from Oct. 1 to Oct. 15, was the fourth consecutive month of retreat and much larger than expected. The index is now down 20.9 points, or 15 percent, from its 29-year high in June.
"Growing anxiety about the financial markets, combined with political concerns and recent layoff announcements, have given consumers the jitters," said Lynn Franco, associate director at the board, a private research group.
Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
The report comes amid evidence that the United States economy is slowing as a result of the financial crises in Asia and Russia. Stocks slumped sharply in early October, before beginning to rebound.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Trying to Test How False The Positives Might Be

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Is the bear market over? Or is the recent rise in stock prices just a seductive rally intended to suck investors in before the market slides once more?
That's what seasoned investors and traders wondered yesterday as they watched the Dow Jones industrial average spurt up 101 points in the first hour of trading, then lose it all and more by the end of the day. The average closed yesterday at 8,366.04, down 66.17 points, or 0.78 percent. 
 The move was a reversal of fortune for investors who were beginning to regain confidence that American stocks could ride out the rest of the world's economic storms. Indeed, in the last two months or so, the Dow has risen about 1,000 points, or 13 percent, from its Aug. 31 low of 7,539.07.
Blue-chip stocks were not the only ones to see an early rally fizzle. The Russell 2000, the small-capitalization stock index which has risen for two consecutive weeks, jumped 1.2 percent in the morning, only to close down 0.57 point. Investors in bigger Nasdaq stocks, happy to see technology companies reporting positive earnings, could not sustain their push either.
So where are we now? At a bull market rest stop -- or waltzing into a bear market trap?
The question may be particularly timely now because many investors are relative newcomers to stocks and have not yet experienced the trauma of a bear trap. During the two bear moves before this year's turmoil -- the decline in 1990 that took stocks down 21 percent and the 1987 crash -- there were no intermittent bear-market rallies to sucker investors. As a result, those who have been in stocks for only 10 years or so may not realize that bear markets can have deceptively sharp rallies that only serve to lure investors in, then take them down.
"The last couple of bear markets we've seen haven't lasted long enough to test people's psyches," said Charles White, president of Avatar Associates, a money management firm in New York with $3.5 billion in assets.
And while he noted that the market's breadth has improved -- the number of stocks going up has risen considerably from a month ago -- Mr. White added, "It still seems as though we're challenged to break out of some levels, which indicates that this is nothing more than a rally in a bear market."
Bear market rallies are particularly vicious because they last just long enough to lull investors back into a bullish mood. In the 1973-74 bear market, for example, when stocks fell 45 percent over 22 months, there were three meaningful rallies that -- erroneously -- led investors to believe the worst was over. And in the 36 percent decline that began in December 1968 and lasted until May 1970, investors were also treated to three such rallies.
But the biggest "gotcha" of all was in 1930 -- when stocks recovered from the brutal decline of 1929 that took the Dow average down almost 48 percent. In early 1930, stocks rose almost 50 percent, then crashed, losing 83 percent of their value in the next two years.
As in most downturns, investors today are hoping that the pain they have been through this year is all they will have to endure. Sometimes markets do go straight down and then rebound. In 1962, stocks fell 27.1 percent in six months, then bounced back into a four-year bull market that produced compound average returns of 19 percent annually.
But Alan W. Kral, a portfolio manager at Trevor, Stewart, Burton & Jacobsen in New York, is arguing against such a recovery now. "Nothing that's happened over the past four weeks has changed the longer-term outlook for the economy which will drive the market," he said.
"Over the past year we've seen enough of the props of the economy -- exports and profits -- start to be chipped away so that growth is now threatened," Mr. Kral said.
The final, and most important, prop is the consumer, who accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic growth. Yesterday, the Conference Board said consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in nearly two years earlier this month. If consumers pull back on their purchases, the economy will slow significantly.
To be sure, investors have had reason to be optimistic. The biggest lift has come from the Federal Reserve, which has cut rates twice since the end of September. Lower interest rates are always a positive since lower borrowing costs can mean higher corporate profits.
And concentrated rate cuts are extra-bullish. Market historians note that in three of four cases when the Fed has cut rates twice in a row, stocks rise an average of 19 percent in the ensuing three months. Since the Fed last cut rates on Oct. 15, stocks are up almost 5 percent.
More support for stocks has come from a raft of upbeat earnings announcements. Companies as diverse as I.B.M., Estee Lauder, Amgen and Northern Telecom have posted better-than-expected numbers recently.
But with most third-quarter earnings announcements completed, the bounce from positive surprises is probably already built into stock prices. As a result, Mr. Kral believes that the market is at a danger point.
He believes that the nation's employment cost index, out Thursday morning, will once again focus investors on rising labor costs and declining corporate profit margins.
"G.D.P. growth slowing and labor costs going up are not good from a profit standpoint," he said. "There's a lot of risk in the market here."

HEADLINE: Music Industry Loses a Bid To Stop Internet Recording

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 27

 BODY:
A Federal judge has refused the recording industry's request to halt production of a hand-held device that can record and play back digital music found, often illegally, on the Internet.
Within hours of the court's announcement late Monday, Diamond Multimedia Systems, the San Jose company that makes the device, known as the Rio, began producing it. 
 The Recording Industry Association of America, the powerful trade group that had sued to prevent Diamond from shipping the Rio, vowed today to appeal.
The Rio, which sells for $199, can store up to 60 minutes of music, functioning as a sort of a personal stereo, much like portable CD and tape players. But given the near-CD fidelity of the digital recordings, the record industry sees the Rio as far more dangerous than cassette tapes. The industry fears that by enabling users to grab unlicensed digital music off the Internet with the click of a mouse, the device will encourage widespread music piracy.
Earlier this month, the trade group asked Federal District Judge Audrey B. Collins of Los Angeles for a preliminary injunction preventing Diamond from shipping the Rio. Her denial of the injunction effectively enables Diamond to manufacture and ship the Rio for the holiday season.
The case underscores the formidable challenge facing the music industry as it tries to protect the rights of musicians and distributors at a time when illegal music can be distributed freely, anonymously and widely over the Internet.
The trade group, which represents 90 percent of the creators, manufacturers and distributors of commercial recordings, said it had found dozens of sites that in all offered tens of thousands of unlicensed recordings free.
Forrester Research Inc., a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass., estimates that 10 million people already have software that enables them to get and listen to MP3 files, the audio format the Rio supports. Even the Microsoft Corporation's media player for Windows is capable of playing MP3 files.
The Rio weighs less than 2.4 ounces. After being attached to a computer with a cable, it finds music on the Internet and stores it. Eric Schmitt, a research associate at Forrester, said it was the first of several similar devices expected to hit the market in coming months.
Diamond Multimedia says it does not condone piracy and that it is not fair to blame the company if some people use its product illegally.
"If the recording industry wants to go after piracy, it should go upstream to the pirates themselves," said Ken Wirt, Diamond's vice president for corporate marketing.
The request for a preliminary injunction hinged primarily on whether the Rio met the definition of a digital audio recording device under the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992. That law requires makers of digital audio recording devices to pay artist organizations royalties of 2 percent of the wholesale price of the device.
Although Judge Collins said the court was ultimately very likely to find that the Rio met the definition, she refused a key request of the trade group -- that Diamond be forced to install a technology that would prevent the device from copying unlicensed music files.
Cary H. Sherman, general counsel for the industry association, said that since it was logistically impossible to go after all the people who offer pirated music on the Internet, the association thought it made more sense to regulate the technology used to "receive" the music. Manufacturers of such devices "have a moral obligation to protect creative works," he said.
Andrew P. Bridges, a partner with Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in Palo Alto, Calif., which is representing Diamond, argues that the association is not entitled to derail new technology while it determines how to protect its members.
"Are they saying no one can develop a new technology without their permission?" Mr. Bridges asked.

HEADLINE: Just Blunt, or a Bully? Canada Divided on Leader

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 27

 BODY:
Even for a tough political competitor like Jean Chretien, question period in the House of Commons can be a grind.
Every day, for an hour, Prime Minister Chretien has to answer questions, in English and French, from his parliamentary foes. The opposition constantly tries to bait him, and sometimes succeeds, as in a recent session when Mr. Chretien stood to defend himself against accusations that he and his staff had ordered the police to use pepper spray on demonstrators before a visit by a foreign dignitary last year. 
 He retorted that it was better to get hit with pepper spray than a baseball bat.
Later Mr. Chretien shrugged and said he was only being honest. It didn't matter. "Pepper Spray Beats Baseball Bats" led newscasts and newspapers across Canada.
Whether it is candor, or insensitivity, Mr. Chretien's five years in office have been marked by a directness uncommon among world leaders. At a time of roundabout diplomacy and executive legalisms, he can be outspoken and blunt to a degree that frightens and frustrates his handlers.
He likes to be called "the little guy from Shawinigan," the mill town in Quebec where he was born 64 years ago, but recent incidents have critics accusing him of being a street tough and a tyrant.
His missteps are already legend. He once boasted before what he thought was a closed microphone that Canada's Cuba policy scored points at home because it made the United States squirm. When Canadians speak of the "Shawinigan handshake," they are referring to the time he literally wrung the neck of a protester who got too close to him at a Flag Day rally in Ottawa.
And when he was first asked about the pepper spray incident, Mr. Chretien told reporters, "Pepper, for me I put it on my plate."
"This whole affair is affording Canadians a rare glimpse into the inner soul of this Prime Minister," said Rick Anderson, an opposition strategist. "People are getting to see him as a bully."
Reaction to Mr. Chretien's wisecracks and roughhousing has always been split. Everything about him is open to criticism except the paralysis that causes the left part of his face to contract so that he looks as if he is talking out of the side of his mouth. An opponent once tried poking fun during a campaign and paid dearly for it in lost votes.
French-speakers delight in saying that this Prime Minister has trouble expressing himself in both of Canada's official languages. They make fun of his bumbling, and at the same time they accuse him of hiding behind the everyman persona to deflect criticism. Louis Duclos, head of Quebec's delegation in Toronto, points out that Mr. Chretien is a lawyer and has for most of his adult life been a member of the government elite, something far from common on the streets of Shawinigan.
But the average Canadian identifies with Mr. Chretien's humble beginnings and his unassuming ways. "I don't think Canadians are expecting perfection," said Edward R. Zussman, a political analyst who once worked for Mr. Chretien. Despite miscues, the Prime Minister's personal approval ratings have always been well above 50 percent.
Mr. Chretien's current popularity rides on Canada's economy. Unemployment, though at 8 percent about double that in the United States, has been steadily dropping, inflation has practically vanished and there is a budget surplus for the first time in a quarter-century.
"It's very rare when the press writes 'That's a damn good government,' " Mr. Chretien said in an interview in his office in the center block of Canada's prim parliamentary complex in Ottawa. "I've never seen that title in the world."
He has shown an uncanny talent for shaking off controversy. Even badly fumbled explanations for major policy reversals -- he campaigned against a free-trade agreement, then warmly embraced it -- frustrate voters but do not entirely alienate them.
And his support sometimes comes from unlikely corners. The pepper-spraying incident took place last November, but it surfaced in newspapers and newscasts only after the Starr report on President Clinton was issued in early September. That left many Canadians, including some Ottawa reporters, asking old questions about the character of Canada.
"Perhaps the doings in Washington set it off, but the Canadian political and media elites appear to be suffering a dose of scandal envy," wrote Jeffrey Simpson, a columnist with The Globe and Mail of Toronto.
What Mr. Chretien is accused of is directly, or indirectly, interfering with security arrangements at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in Vancouver and making it clear that he did not want the visiting President Suharto of Indonesia to be embarrassed by protesters.
Mr. Chretien's jokes and heavy-handed responses have raised questions about his judgment.
"They're going after Chretien for insensitivity, but that is not an indictable offense," said Robert Bothwell, a professor of history at the University of Toronto.
The big concern now is that the Prime Minister's controversial remarks and actions could influence the outcome of the coming election in Quebec, where separatist and federalist parties are fighting for control of the provincial government.
Some analysts are speculating that Mr. Chretien will resign if the separatist party is re-elected. The separatists have vowed to hold a third referendum on Quebec independence, and even within Mr. Chretien's own party, the Liberals, not everyone thinks he can lead another campaign to hold Canada together. He was widely seen as having mishandled the 1995 referendum, which federalists won by less than 1 percent. "Chretien," wrote Rosemary Speirs, a Toronto Star columnist, "would have to face the fact that many federalists believe he'd be a liability, not an asset, in the ultimate fight to keep the country together."
The old warrior smiles crookedly at suggestions that he is not up to another fight, and challenges anyone who doubts his stamina to race him up the stairs at Parliament. He takes pride in a recent photograph that shows him bounding over a wall while President Clinton, with whom he has a cordial relationship, struggles to catch up.
"I have to tell you that some days I feel that perhaps I should go," said Mr. Chretien. "Then the day after I am saying, 'Gee, I'm staying.' And I love it."
One thing is clear. After fighting Quebec separatists for 35 years, he has no intention of overseeing the dismemberment of his country.
"I'm telling you, if they were to vote two-thirds or 75 percent for separation, I would probably resign the day after and go home and let them bring in somebody else," Mr. Chretien said. He acknowledged that a recent judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada made it clear that under such circumstances the federal Government would be obliged to negotiate the separation of Quebec.
"But the problem is that the Supreme Court said too that the borders of Quebec are not secure," he said. "Now you fall into the problem of partition of Quebec, because if you can break Canada why the people who are not happy to stay in Quebec cannot break Quebec?"
Cree Indians in the wild northern part of Quebec have threatened to break away from the province if it leaves Canada.
Mr. Chretien's unbending opposition to separation makes him more popular throughout Canada but in Quebec he is seen as a traitor, and he doesn't apologize.
"The separatists don't like Chretien at all, and I'm very proud of that," the Prime Minister said. "I've always been very clearly a Canadian whose province is Quebec, whose language is French, whose religion is Catholic, who's coming from the St. Maurice Valley. I've always been very consistent with my policy, my view of myself and of my country and those who want to split Canada always see me in their path."
But the pressure from Quebec will always be there, he said, because the province can use it to force Ottawa to grant programs and constitutional changes that strengthen the province at the expense of the federal Government.
"But discussing the Constitution in Canada, it's part of the national -- what's the right word here -- sport. We have hockey and the Constitution. When hockey is not doing too well, we start to talk about the Constitution."
There are signs that the recent disputes have taken a toll on him. In what seemed to betray unusual anger, his press office filed a complaint against the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for slanted coverage of the pepper spray incident.
Last week, Mr. Chretien's wife, Aline, his closest adviser, attended the question period. At one point he looked up at her and smiled, then took the opposition's best shots. When the hourlong period ended, he was one of the first members to leave the House.
He returned energetically to his third-floor office, where one window frames the United States Embassy across Wellington Street. With the Stars and Stripes snapping over his shoulder, he said that simply surviving was his ultimate political goal.
"At the end of the day you say 'I've survived one more day,' " he said. "In order to survive you have to learn to walk with your back to the wall, with your elbows held very high, and a smile on your face."

HEADLINE: At Parade, Immigrants Bask in El Duque's Glory

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

DATELINE: UNION CITY, N.J., Oct. 27

 BODY:
It was a day for pride, more than for politics, when Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez, the Yankee pitcher, paraded down Bergenline Avenue here today, in the heart of Cuban and Hispanic New Jersey.
But for many of those lining the bustling commercial strip, waving Yankee banners and Cuban flags, El Duque's story, his escape from Cuba on a raft and his success as a World Series pitcher 10 months later, represented a bigger-than-life version of their own immigrant experiences. 
 "The Yankees play in the House That Ruth Built," said Rudy Garcia, Union City's Mayor, who is also a Cuban immigrant. "But today he is coming to the Street That Immigrants Built, Bergenline Avenue."
Union City and the surrounding towns across the Hudson River from New York City have the largest concentration of Cubans outside of Miami, as the Mayor likes to point out, and they have become a magnet for immigrants from other Latin American countries like Mexico, Ecuador, El Salvador and Nicaragua. An estimated 70 percent of the population of Union City and West New York is Hispanic, and along Bergenline Avenue, businesses with names like Gonzalez H.S. Fabrics and Mi Bandera Restaurant, owned by Hispanic immigrants, have produced an economic boom in the area.
Mr. Garcia said he was originally going to offer Mr. Hernandez the keys to the city, but somehow that didn't seem enough in an area where people felt he was one of their own.
"Obviously, we feel a great deal of pride in El Duque," Mr. Garcia said. So he and Mayor Albio Sires of West New York, also from Cuba, decided to give Mr. Hernandez a parade.
"He exemplifies two virtues important to the Cuban community," Mr. Garcia said. "One is his love of freedom. He risked his life to get out of Cuba on a raft. Two is his love of family. A lot of Cubans are separated from their families and it is a result of Fidel Castro's tyranny."
Mr. Garcia was referring to El Duque's two daughters, his mother and his former wife, who were allowed to leave Cuba by Mr. Castro after the intercession of John Cardinal O'Connor and others. The family has a 30-day visa, but officials are working to extend their stay.
Some who lined the 30-block route along Bergenline Avenue -- the police estimated that the crowd, which was packed several deep at some points, grew to 5,000 -- waited more than two hours in the gray afternoon. When Mr. Hernandez finally came by, in a float decorated in white with Yankee blue trim that practically flew down the street, they barely caught a glimpse of him and his family. But no matter. They beamed and cheered nonetheless.
"He's a Hispanic who is trying to move the community forward," said Lorena Fuentes, who is from Guatemala. "It's nice to have someone represent us. He's a man everyone admires because he brought his family here." As Mr. Hernandez's float passed, followed by limousines full of dignitaries, cheering people crowded around and ran after it.
The parade drew teen-agers, grade-school children and older people. Many knew that El Duque's half-brother, Livan Hernandez, also defected from Cuba and joined the Florida Marlins in time to help them win the World Series last year.
But like many heroes, El Duque has already been mythologized to the point where some versions of his story were not backed by facts.
"He came here to play for the Yankees to get enough money to get his brother out of jail," said Mrs. Fuentes's son, Carlos, 10, who wore a Yankee hat and shirt.
Yasser Warrad, 14, pedaled several blocks on his Dino racing bicycle from his home to Bergenline Avenue, carrying his half-brother, Carlos Pico, 12. Both of them are from Puerto Rico, they said.
"It's illegal to go on a boat from Cuba," said Carlos, awed by El Duque's story. "I'm glad they let his family come."
A sign atop a blue Chevrolet station wagon spoke for many in the crowd. It said, in English and in Spanish, "To El Duque: God Bless You, Your Family, the Yankees, and God Bless America."
"I am a grand fanatic when it comes to the Yankees," said Leonardo Gutierrez, 53, from Puerto Rico, a Hudson County employee who made the sign. "I am a fan of El Duque because he brought his family over. That is a beautiful thing."
Aymara Watson, who came to North Bergen from Cuba in 1995, said she remembered seeing Mr. Hernandez pitch at Latin American Stadium in Havana before she left the country.
"He was a real loss to Cuba," she said. "But for us it is such a thing of pride, and in such a short time."
In Cuba, she said, everyone suffered economically, even champion athletes like Mr. Hernandez. "He probably earned enough to buy his girls one pair of nice shoes each, but he probably still had to stand in line for the bodegas like everyone else."
As Mr. Hernandez flew by on his float, Enio Martinez, 67, watched quietly, a Yankee cap on his head and his hands in his pockets. Mr. Martinez said that when he was a restaurant owner in Cuba in the 50's, he traveled to New York just to watch a Yankees game. After Mr. Castro took over, Mr. Martinez became disillusioned "with the new regime," as he called it, and worked in the sugar cane fields for two years to earn permission to leave the country.
"I lost everything in Cuba," he said. The government had taken over his business and expropriated his home. He was allowed to leave with his wife and two children. But he never saw his mother again.
Mr. Martinez reflected on Mr. Hernandez's quick success in the United States, and he and his daughter, Mercedes Blanco, laughed when they could not remember whether the Yankee pitcher made $6 million or $9 million.
"By coming here, he won something even bigger," Mr. Martinez said. "His liberty."

European Investors Don't Flee Stocks

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME, Oct. 27

 BODY:
A fresh crop of European stock owners, the result of Government privatizations of industry and a general trend toward equity investment, has been battered by recent global market turmoil. Yet experts say it has survived to bear fruit another day.
In recent years, soaring stock markets, low returns on Government bonds and European policies that required people to take a greater hand in shaping their pension plans prompted millions of Europeans who had never before ventured near the stock market to pour record amounts of money into individual equities and mutual funds. 
 Thus, when stock market indexes fell sharply last summer, economists and Government planners in European nations wondered how this freshly minted generation of share owners would react. The answer, said Claudio Fermi, a senior investment officer at Credito Italiano, one of Italy's biggest banks, has been, "generally, pretty well."
No evidence has emerged, he and other experts said in recent interviews, that these first-time investors have been permanently frightened away. And indeed, though net flows of capital into stocks and mutual funds have plummeted since August, much of the resulting liquidity went into short-term money market funds, apparently in anticipation of an eventual market revival.
The reason for such a reaction, experts say, is clear: with interest rates at all-time lows, European investors, like their American counterparts, have few alternatives to the stock market. "There is a willingness to go back in if any change occurs," said Andrea Fischer, a retail investment officer at Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank in Munich.
Others are more cautious. Recent experience, they say, shows that Europe has far to go before stocks become the investment of choice for the middle class, as they have among many in the United States. Forty-three percent of American adults own stocks, either directly or through mutual funds, compared with 25 percent of Britons and 16 percent of the French.
In recent years, the European march toward a single currency, and the tight monetary policies and low inflation that went with it, pushed interest rates lower and lower. Those rate cuts, coupled with the increased availability of stocks, as European governments sold shares in formerly nationalized industries, prompted Europeans to shift savings from bonds, insurance policies and bank accounts into individual stocks and, even more often, mutual funds.
By March, net monthly payments into mutual funds, one of the best gauges of investor behavior, had soared above $13 billion, compared with less than $1 billion a month in 1995.
Suddenly, the funds emerged as a significant force on stock markets. Yet, in August, when global markets slumped, net payments plunged to $2.5 billion, less than a quarter of the more than $10 billion recorded in July. In September, this trend apparently continued, though final figures are not yet available, said Caroline Meroz, who follows mutual fund flows at Salomon Smith Barney in London. Italy, for instance, recorded net outflows of $1.3 billion, she said, though she described this as "not too unsettling."
"It shows," she said, "that the Italians have become more sophisticated, that there is more switching in and out."
In part, at least, the Italian outflows were a result of investors' diversifying out of Italian funds into European funds, Ms. Meroz said, a process that is expected to accelerate across Europe in coming months as the introduction in January of the single currency, the euro, approaches and investors spread their assets beyond national boundaries.
Investors proved resilient in other countries, too. In France, mutual fund contributions have continued to slow, but the net flow has remained positive. Similarly in Spain, which is closely watched because of the economy's dependence on battered emerging markets, like those in Latin America, net positive flows continued despite a slowdown.
European financial professionals are still in the early stages of educating retail investors not to flee stocks at the first sign of a market downturn. Thus, in 1987 and again in 1994, when European markets slumped, many investors fled in panic to fixed-income investments. This time, bankers and investment managers say they are encouraged that the reaction has not been as severe and attribute this to several factors.
For one thing, while Europeans have turned to mutual funds, the funds on the whole continue to be extremely conservative. Mr. Fermi of Credito Italiano said that only about 25 percent of assets in Italy were invested in stocks; the rest are in fixed-income instruments.
Moreover, while many European investors still prefer bonds, bankers in several countries said they had seen a greater inclination this time around, as in the United States, to park assets in money market funds and await a stock market upswing. And some investors have even been scouring the lists, pushing to invest as prices dip. "There is a desire to purchase," Mr. Fermi said, "though it is not yet widespread."
Still, some experts cautioned that mutual fund flows in Europe would continue to be more volatile than in the United States, not least because of the absence as yet of tax-based incentives to stock ownership, that assure regular monthly flows into funds.
With the exception of Britain, Ms. Meroz of Salomon Smith Barney said, "in Europe, you still don't have 401(k)'s, I.R.A.'s, tax breaks -- so it's not going to be as smooth as that."
But, she added, the absence of alternatives for investors insures that the trend will continue. "I don't think it will stop long term, but it will slow down," she said, adding: "It's the wave of the future. You have to put your money somewhere."

HEADLINE: With Taxes Up, Nassau Searches for Someone to Blame

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, N.Y., Oct. 27

 BODY:
An unexpected increase in school property taxes that is costing many homeowners in Nassau County an estimated $100 more this year is causing a lot of finger pointing among Republicans, Democrats and local school board officials.
It's all the result of an antiquated county formula for figuring out tax rates that was compounded by a possible computer glitch in Albany, according to county and school board officials. 
 "It would take an Albert Einstein to figure it all out," said Bruce Nyman, leader of the Democratic minority in the Nassau County Legislature. "Everyone is blaming everyone else."
Charles O'Shea, a Republican who assumed his duties as chairman of the Nassau County Board of Assessors 11 months ago, insists it is all much ado about nothing and part of an election-year conspiracy to embarrass Republicans in a county where residents are sensitive to any kind of tax increase.
"If there has been any school tax increases, nine times out of ten it's due to a school budget increase approved by voters last spring," Mr. O'Shea said. "The amount of increase due to any change in the equalization rate is negligible."
It all started last March when the Board of Assessors challenged the rates set by the State Office of Real Property Services in Albany for four classes of property in Nassau County -- Class One for detached homes, Class Two for apartments and condominiums, Class Three for utility company properties and Class Four for factories, offices and stores.
Believing that the state's rate for both Class Two and Class Four were too low, the county filed an appeal with the state agency and convinced it to change the apportionment formula. The state then evened out the pie and shifted the tax burden to homeowners and utilities.
In recent years, taxpayers have become used to small tax increases to account for inflation. But when the year's tax bills arrived in mailboxes last week, homeowners in school districts with a large percentage of commercial properties found that their bill jumped a lot more than they were expecting -- for the average homeowner about $100 more than the $2,766 he paid in school taxes last year. (Those taxpayers who have the bills sent directly to their mortgage lenders will see the increase the next time they receive a report on the escrow accounts from which their taxes are paid.)
School board officials said they did not find out about the shift in the equalization formula until it was too late to tell voters in their districts.
"We were off this year because the county never told us," said Steven B. Witt, president of the Nassau-Suffolk School Boards Association. To prevent this situation in the future, the Nassau County Legislature approved legislation in June requiring the Board of Assessors to notify school districts of future challenges filed with the state.
"That will be definitely help," said Richard Hirt, assistant superintendent for finances in the Locust Valley Central School District. "The percentage of taxes that each group pays is based on an extraordinarily complex formula, but there is no doubt that this time around Nassau County erred by putting a higher percentage on the homeowner."
He said that while voters in his district approved a 4 percent budget increase in April, it was difficult to determine how much of the new tax bill was due to the changes caused by the county and the state. "We determine how much we need to run the schools, but the rates come directly from the county," he said, noting that 87 percent of the tax base in Locust Valley was homeowners, about 10 percent commercial and 2 percent utility company properties, with no multiple family dwellings.
The state's real property office said it may have contributed to the problem when it attempted to feed data provided by Nassau into its own computer format resulting in a delay in setting the new rates.
The delay meant that homeowners were given no advance warning of the new calculations. And because Mr. O'Shea failed to warn school districts that the tax rates might be changing due to his appeal, there was no way for most taxpayers to find out until their bills came.
But Mr. O'Shea insisted that no matter what happened in Albany or in his own office, that most of the tax increase was due to budget increases at the local school district level.
He said that not every school district in the county got a tax increase and that no one was certain how much of any increase was due to the change in the state and county formula.
"This is much ado about nothing and if it weren't for Election Day, I doubt anyone would be talking about this," he said. As for the possibility of refunds because of the mix-up, everyone agreed there would be none.
"Nothing retroactively can be done to change what has been done. The cake is sort of baked for this year," said Chuck Cutolo, counsel to the Democratic minority in the County Legislature. "We've gotten over the sticker shock and can only hope things will be better next year."

Hardly The Boys Next Door

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

 BODY:
PRO basketball players seem puzzled over the public's failure to embrace their "struggle" against National Basketball Association owners. They seem to ask, "Where's the outpouring of sympathy for fellow workers?"
They might try to give the public a different look. A few weeks ago, LaPhonso Ellis spoke about the economic confrontation, one in which the two sides argue over how escalating league profits will be apportioned in coming seasons. Ellis spoke with ease and grace about the hazards of being locked out, but what you noticed was that he seemed to be speaking from poolside at some resort. 
 Last week the players gathered in Las Vegas, Nev., of all places, to plan a strategy session. Amid slot machines they voted not to accept a hard salary cap. Earlier this week, an article in The New York Times quoted Kenny Anderson, the Boston Celtics point guard and New York City high school legend, about the impact this lockout was having on his cash flow. He spoke of possibly having to sell one of his eight luxury cars; he spoke of how paying child support for two children he fathered with two different women "really burns a hole in your pocket."
Sympathy?
The two sides met in New York on Monday, and the union couldn't seem to decide whether there was progress or regress. Danny Schayes, a member of the union's executive committee, saw some progress. Jim McIlvaine of Seattle growled: "Danny Schayes didn't stay for the entire meeting." Billy Hunter, executive director of the union, said: "I guess Danny has a different interpretation. Maybe I was looking for a lot more than Danny did."
Some players have expressed concern that the league's high concentration of African-American athletes will cause a more severe reaction to the lockout than either baseball or hockey experienced. A sports talk show in Philadelphia recently gave voice to a similar idea. A poignant moment in the show occurred when the station's general manager called in and said the racial angle, with this particular group of African-Americans, was not relevant, because, he felt, the issue was purely economic. The general manger was African-American.
My reaction to the concern about racial backlash was: they must be joking. All of a sudden they've discovered a collective awareness of being black? They sold that to NBA Properties a long time ago.
The current players aren't sympathetic figures simply because they never wanted to be and never worked to be. The owners aren't sympathetic figures, either, because they were silly enough to create the monster -- and keep feeding it -- in the first place.
In 1987, striking football players picketed, tossed eggs at strike-breakers and wore their hearts on their sleeves. Basketball players, it seems, sip mint juleps under honeysuckle trees and sing "Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen." They are stylish in their incongruity.
I hate phrases like "the American people," and I don't know who the average United States citizen is, but my sense is that the mass of workers are feeling more alienated from professional athletes with each successive season. Most see sports labor as a contradiction in terms. Clearly this lockout is not a life-or-death, knockdown, drag-out war. We're not talking about closing down factories, laying off workers, shipping jobs to overseas plants. This is a skirmish between the rich fighting the wealthy for a greater portion of huge profits.
As for some kind of sustained backlash directed at the league: it'll never happen. Watch what happens when the doors reopen: people will come briskly walking in because basketball, like it or not, is in our blood.
People rejoiced that baseball came back this year; for a while the nation was thrown into a fit of longing for the "good ol' days," when the grass was real. There have been all sorts of rumblings that people don't care about the N.B.A. anymore. These are the delirious ramblings of patients recovering from a severe bout of baseball fever. The patient will get over it.
Knick City Dancers, Laker Girls, Keith Van Horn and -- who knows? -- Michael Jordan will draw them back. Baseball is a classic drama; basketball is steamy, fast-paced soap opera. Money? The beautiful people sitting courtside know about money. They can relate at some level to Kenny Anderson's situation. After all, everything is relative.
At any rate, if some players end up going to the poorhouse, there's comfort in knowing they'll have plenty of cars to take them.
Don't you love this game?

New Sense Of Urgency In N.B.A. Negotiating

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
The meetings have not been billed emergency sessions, but with the National Basketball Association scheduled to announce the cancellation of more games today, negotiations between owners and players may go a long way toward settling the nearly four-month-old labor impasse and salvaging the season.
Commissioner David Stern and representatives from all 29 teams will meet with Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing and as many as 200 of their peers today at a midtown Manhattan hotel. The meeting represents the best hope for the two sides to try to work out a revenue-sharing plan. 
 With three bargaining sessions in the past four days, there are clear signs that both sides are beginning to compromise. As the financial losses mount -- player losses in salary may reach $200 million if cancellations are announced today -- much of the rhetoric and posturing has begun to subside.
The perception among many players is that the owners were merely waiting for the players to lose paychecks before genuinely exploring a deal. With an estimated 200 players standing firm for the moment, the question now is whether the two sides can agree on numbers in time to avert losing the season.
The owners have pulled back on their insistence on a hard salary cap, while the players have offered alternatives to help the owners bring salaries in line with the league's revenue growth.
Stern and his deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, have indicated that an agreement needs to be in hand by early December to prevent losing the entire season. The league lost its first two weeks on Oct. 13, the first time games were canceled in the N.B.A.'s 52-year history. Barring a settlement, the rest of the November schedule -- and probably some December games -- will most likely be canceled today.
Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, Ewing, its president, and other players met with N.B.A. legal representatives yesterday at a Manhattan law firm. The two sides discussed non-economic issues relating to player conduct, including discipline and adding marijuana and performance-enhancing drugs to the list of banned substances.
"We're trying to salvage as much of the season as possible," Hunter said. "I'm optimistic we're going to get a deal. I can't say it's going to happen this week."
Meanwhile, the owners' labor relations committee held its own meetings and was apprised of developments from Monday night's marathon bargaining session in New York.
Like two armies massing and moving toward the front, the two parties fortified their positions yesterday.
"The good news is we're talking and we seem to be talking about the same thing," said Danny Schayes, a member of the union's executive committee. "The most important economic things are the things we're farthest away on. But there is some hope."
Schayes was one of 13 players who took part in Monday night's talks, a session that several participants said was the most productive since the lockout began July 1.
The key development seemed to be an agreement on an economic framework that could be used to divide revenue and could lead to the signing of a new collective bargaining agreement, a precursor for starting the season.
If approved, it would entail a hybrid from proposals on both sides. For the first two years of the deal, a luxury tax would be employed to bring salaries in line with revenue growth. The next two years would involve the league's plan for an escrow fund.
"We need a system that eventually gets to where there's a set percentage for the players and a set percentage for the owners," Granik said. "I don't think it has to be a hard cap, and in fact some of the things we're talking about now are not hard caps."
The owners want a system in which the percentage of basketball-related income devoted to player salaries is reduced from 57 percent to 48 percent by the 2002-03 season. Their insistence on an eventual 48 percent payout is the biggest stumbling block to a settlement, Hunter said. The players have countered proposals that would give them 63 percent of the total revenue.
There are reservations on both sides over whether the system would work, but the fact that the owners and players seem to be closing in on a concept represented initial hope that the season could begin before next year.
The owners have also asked for other economic concessions, including establishing a maximum salary, reducing performance bonuses and reducing the maximum length of contract from seven years to five or six.
After the league's board of governors convenes at 8:30 A.M. today, nearly half the league's 400-plus players are expected to file into a midtown hotel for their own meetings. Both sides plan to face off sometime in the afternoon.
Aside from the executive committee, most players will observe the talks rather than participating directly in the bargaining.
Yesterday's meeting on player-conduct issues was the first time both sides talked at length about issues other than economics since late last spring.
The players, as concerned as the league about the image problems of some of their peers, have made several concessions on behavioral matters. Few specifics were agreed on, however.
"We talked about a lot of issues, but I can't say we made a lot of progress," said Jeffrey Mishkin, the league's chief legal counsel.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: MARYLAND;
A Governor Finds Himself In a Struggle for Survival

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

DATELINE: BETHESDA, Md., Oct. 27

 BODY:
By most ordinary reckoning, Parris N. Glendening should be a shoo-in as he seeks re-election as Governor of Maryland.
He is a moderate-to-liberal Democrat in one of the nation's most reliably Democratic states. He has presided over a state that has prospered more than most in the strong national economy. And he has been endorsed by the leading newspapers in the state. 
 But Mr. Glendening is in the race of his life, an election that seems even closer than the one in 1994, when he won by fewer than 6,000 votes, or four-tenths of 1 percent, over the Republican candidate, Ellen R. Sauerbrey, who is his opponent again this year.
With a week to go before the Nov. 3 election, Mr. Glendening is at a loss to explain why the race is so close, although some analysts suggest the reasons include a subtle shift in the state's once staunchly liberal leaning and the Governor's indecision over whether to embrace or shun President Clinton during the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
A Washington Post poll found that among people who say they are certain to vote, 50 percent favor Mrs. Sauerbrey and 49 percent Mr. Glendening, a statistical dead heat.
"We had the most bitter primary," the Governor said at a campaign stop here in vote-rich Montgomery County, just outside Washington, as he searched for an explanation for the closeness of the race. "We've taken on the tobacco lobby, the National Rifle Association, the casino and slot industry. Your enemies remember more than your friends do."
But the issues he offered as reasons for his poor poll showing have been used successfully by candidates in states considered less liberal and less Democratic than Maryland.
Mrs. Sauerbrey, on the other hand, has several possible explanations as to why she, a conservative Republican, is doing so well in the polls and has an excellent chance of being elected Maryland's first Republican governor in 32 years.
"The 1994 election showed that Maryland is not as liberal as everybody thought," Mrs. Sauerbrey said as she also campaigned in Montgomery County, which she does not expect to carry but where she hopes to reduce Mr. Glendening's majority. "There has been a net gain for the Republican Party."
Statistics at the Maryland Board of Elections confirm that. From August 1994 to last August, the Democrats increased their enrollment in the state to 1,459,760, a gain of 25,854. But the Republicans, starting with a smaller base, did better, rising to 767,391, an increase of 92,331. So the Republicans had a net gain of more than 66,000 over the Democrats.
Eric M. Uslaner, a professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland, said Mr. Glendening had failed to build on his popularity because of some early decisions that were not popular throughout the state.
One was state support for the construction of a new football stadium for the transplanted Cleveland Browns, now the Baltimore Ravens. It was partly financed by the state lottery and, Mr. Uslaner said: "People thought that some of that money should have gone into education. It was especially opposed in Montgomery County."
Mr. Uslaner was asked in an interview whether Mr. Glendening's seeming aloofness, verging on dullness, had contributed to his lack of a strengthened base. In its editorial endorsing the Governor for re-election, The Baltimore Sun said politely, "He is not charismatic." The Washington Post, which also endorsed him, said Mr. Glendening had a "plodding personality."
"It's more than just dull," Mr. Uslaner said. "He doesn't connect well with the voters. He was a professor. Some of us just don't make great political candidates, and being from a one-party area, he cut his teeth in an old-fashioned machine, where loyalty to a party can be more important than establishing a rapport with a large number of voters."
Mr. Glendening, 56, taught political science at the University of Maryland for 27 years before he was elected Governor. He was previously on the Prince George's County Council and served as the County Executive, working his way up through the ranks until being elected Governor.
Mrs. Sauerbrey, 61, lives in Baltimore County, the suburb outside the city, and taught biology in high school before being elected to the State Legislature.
In the 1994 election, Mr. Glendening carried only the three most populous areas in the state: Montgomery and Prince George's Counties, both Washington suburbs, and Baltimore. Mrs. Sauerbrey carried all other voting districts, but they did not provide enough votes to overcome Mr. Glendening's big margins in the areas he carried.
The Governor's campaign has not been a smooth one.
For a long time, the two leading elected black officials in the state -- the Prince George's County Executive, Wayne K. Curry, and the Mayor of Baltimore, Kurt L. Schmoke, both Democrats -- put off endorsing the Governor.
When they did, on Oct. 8, less than a month before the election, they did it without much enthusiasm and without even notifying Mr. Glendening that they were doing it. Mr. Glendening badly needs the black vote to carry the state, and both Prince George's and Baltimore are predominantly black.
Mr. Glendening's biggest problem involved President Clinton. Mr. Glendening sought in September to distance himself from the President over the Lewinsky scandal by canceling a fund-raising event with him and then did not show up at a visit by Mr. Clinton to a school in Montgomery County. But later Mr. Clinton campaigned for the Governor -- again in Montgomery County -- and the two were reconciled.
Asked about his reversal in an interview, Mr. Glendening said: "We did what we believed to be right. The President has done a great job. However, his actions were wrong and he should have apologized. Then he did apologize. He asked for forgiveness. Not one of us has not made mistakes."
Had he made a mistake as great as the President?
"No," Mr. Glendening said. "Not a doozy of a mistake."

Con Edison Earnings Slip in Third Quarter

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
Consolidated Edison, the utility that serves New York City and some surrounding areas, reported a slight decline in third-quarter earnings, a result of expenses at a nuclear plant and start-up costs from non-utility operations.
Profits fell to $347 million in the latest quarter from $350.4 million a year earlier. But a reduction in shares outstanding left earnings per share unchanged at $1.49. 
 The company said that warmer-than-normal weather and the improving New York City economy helped increase the revenues of its utility subsidiary, the Consolidated Edison Company of New York.
Total revenues increased to $2.06 billion from $2.03 billion in 1997's third quarter, as electric sales volume rose 5.3 percent and steam sales volume rose 5.8 percent, the company said.
The company said cost reduction programs and voluntary attrition in the labor force helped offset expenses resulting from a shutdown at the Indian Point 2 nuclear plant and start-up costs associated with non-utility subsidiaries.

Hiring of Disabled Is Strong

BYLINE: By KAREN DeMASTERS 

 BODY:
The casino industry in New Jersey hires a significantly higher percentage of disabled people than does the state or other employers in Atlantic City, a survey prompted by complaints from advocates for the disabled has found.
The survey, conducted by the Bureau of Economic Research at Rutgers University and commissioned by the State Casino Control Commission, found that 8.2 percent of the 35,000 casino workers who responded considered themselves disabled, compared with 4.9 percent of all workers in Atlantic City and 4.6 percent of workers throughout New Jersey, said Daniel Heneghan, a commission spokesman. 
 The commission decided to conduct the survey after it was sued by a nonprofit group, Handicapped Advocates for Independent Living, in 1991. The suit charged that disabled people should be covered by equal employment opportunity requirements the commission imposes on casinos for hiring members of other groups. The suit was dismissed in 1994.
David Esposito, a spokesman for Handicapped Advocates, said he is skeptical of the findings.
"It depends on whether there are programs for upward mobility for the disabled and whether the casinos are hiring the severely disabled, those people who need some kind of accommodation on the job," Mr. Esposito said, "or whether they are inflating their numbers by counting people who consider themselves disabled but who have a relatively easy time finding a job."

CARPENTER TECHNOLOGY TO EXPAND PLANT CAPACITY

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Carpenter Technology Corporation, a specialty steel company, said yesterday that it would invest $113.6 million to expand its Pennsylvania melt shop and add finishing capacity at its Talley Metals Inc. plant in South Carolina to reduce costs. Carpenter, which had sales of $1.18 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30, said expanding operations at its headquarters in Reading, Pa., and in Hartsville, S.C., would reduce its need to buy melting and finishing services from outside sources. Carpenter is grappling with ways to cut costs as aerospace companies are scaling back inventory and in the aftermath of the General Motors strike, which hurt earnings.

Chinese Investment Trust Defaults on Bond Payment, Stirring Fear

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Wednesday, Oct. 28

 BODY:
In a move that could intensify fears of a debt crisis in China, the country's second-largest investment-trust company has failed to make a bond payment, a bank official said today. It was the first time a Chinese company has defaulted on an international bond since the Chinese Communist authorities came to power in 1949.
The company, the Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corporation, failed to make an interest payment of $8.75 million on a $200 million bond, according to an official at the Chase Manhattan Corporation in New York. Chase acts as a payment agent for bonds issued by the company, which is known here as Gitic. 
 "I can confirm that the payment was not received by Chase," said the official, who insisted on anonymity. It was unclear to whom the payment was owed.
The Beijing Government shut down Gitic on Oct. 6, after it became clear that the company was sinking under hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. The action was seen as a sign of Beijing's resolve to crack down on companies affiliated with local and regional governments, which have borrowed large amounts from foreign creditors -- much of that in loans not authorized by the central Government.
While Beijing had already suspended Gitic's debt payments in order to determine the magnitude of its debts, the default on a bond payment could jolt foreign investors who had regarded China as a safe harbor amid Asia's turbulence. They also had generally assumed that the Chinese Government would stand behind the borrowing of companies with official ties.
"Investors tend to be reactive," said John Pinkel, head of China research at Merrill Lynch here. "But I think the Chinese Government warned people about this."
Gitic, which is incorporated in Hong Kong and is the main fund-raising arm of Guangdong province in the south, has a portfolio of businesses including trading, manufacturing, finance and property.
The nation's largest investment company, China International Trust and Investment, has not encountered financial difficulty yet, though today, Moody's Investors Service placed its debt on review for a possible downgrading.
Gitic's troubles have already caused anxiety among foreign investors, who fear there could be large hidden debts in other Chinese investment companies and in "red chips," companies that are incorporated and listed in Hong Kong but controlled by Beijing or by mainland province governments.
Another Guangdong-based investment company, Guangzhou International Trust and Investment, is seeking a capital infusion of $72 million from the Guangzhou city government in order to stay afloat, according to a report today in The South China Morning Post.
"I think the Chinese Government didn't do enough to clarify the liabilities of these companies," Mr. Pinkel said. "But equally, many banks were imprudent in their lending to offshore entities of Chinese organizations."
He estimated that China's total foreign borrowing -- by provincial and municipal governments and by their affiliated companies -- was $30 billion higher than Beijing's official figure of $130 billion.
Gitic alone may have total debts of more than $2 billion, according to analysts here. But the company's liquidators have been unable to determine exactly how much it owes to which foreign creditors -- including Japanese and European banks -- a situation that has led to confusion about the depth of the crisis.
And Chinese officials are sending mixed signals about their willingness to back up loans made to Hong Kong companies. The Mayor of Shenzhen, an industrial city across the border from Hong Kong, was quoted in The South China Morning Post as saying that Beijing would repay foreign loans to Gitic.
"The action is a closure, which is different from a bankruptcy," the Mayor, Li Zibin, reportedly said. "Closure is a Government action, for which the Government has taken full responsibility."
But in comments published earlier this week, Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng warned that Beijing would not guarantee repayment of loans that were not authorized by the central Government.
Such ambiguity has left international credit-rating agencies jittery. Moody's lowered the foreign debt of Gitic last Friday, saying the move reflected its concern over increased pressures on the company's resources in the face of maturing near-term debt payments.
On Monday, Moody's placed the debt of Cathay International Ltd., a Hong Kong-based company that builds power plants and expressways in Guangdong province, on watch for a possible downgrading, merely because it has close financial connections to Guangzhou International Trust and Investment.
The financial problems of Chinese corporations have commanded the attention of senior leaders. Last week, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji traveled to Guangdong to meet with province officials and top executives of red chip companies to assess the extent of the financial problems. 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 30, 1998, Friday

An article in Business Day on Wednesday about a Chinese company that defaulted on a bond payment misstated its place of incorporation in some editions. The Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corporation is incorporated in China, not in Hong Kong.

Whipping Up Martinis and Home Glamour

BYLINE: By Liz Seymour 

DATELINE: HIGH POINT, N.C.

 BODY:
BLENDERS whirred all day in the Rowe Furniture showroom at the International Home Furnishings Market, which opened here on Oct. 15 and ran through last Friday. Behind an antique bar, young assistants in white jackets whipped up fresh fruit smoothies for the buyers shopping Rowe's line of mid-priced furniture. Come 5 P.M., however, a glowing neon olive in an oversize cocktail glass signaled that Rowe was shaking up martinis.
It was that kind of market: plenty of sensible high-fiber furniture, but with a surprise serving of swank, expressed in silver-plated drawer pulls at Henredon, fake-fur upholstery at Fendi and an Art Moderne-style coffee table in polished goatskin at Ralph Lauren. "People are looking for better goods," Rob Pitt, head buyer for Crate and Barrel, said. "Or at least the perception of better goods." 
 Throughout the eight-million-square-foot market, the world's largest furniture exposition, "relaxed comfort" -- the mantra of recent years -- was dressed up and recast as self-indulgent luxury, inspired by everything from 1930's Hollywood to the new popularity of cashmere in apparel. "It's the times," the designer Larry Laslo said. "Glamour makes you feel desirable, successful and on top of the world." And with luck, cushioned against the economic storm clouds darkening other segments of the global economy.
But for now, furniture buyers and sellers had reason to feel on top of the world. Under nearly flawless autumn skies, the estimated 71,500 market visitors basked in what the trade newspaper Furniture Today calculated was the strongest business climate since the mid-80's, with furniture shipments 14 percent ahead of this time last year. With interest rates falling, housing starts and home sales strong, low unemployment, rising household income and a baby boom generation just coming into its inheritance, industry analysts were expecting the good times to roll well into 1999.
In fact, the new glamour looked a lot like the old cocoon, dressed in silkworm fantasies. Clubby leather chairs, recliners that didn't look like recliners and sleek Art Moderne armoires had a lot more to do with staying home than stepping out.
Glamour had its own practical logic. Mindful that an economic slowdown was only a matter of time, manufacturers sought to move furniture into the nearly recession-proof realm of luxury goods. "Luxury goods manufacturers are doing fabulously well right now," said Chris Plasman, president of Baker, who will bring out leather furniture in January licensed by Coach.
High-profile retailers like Crate and Barrel and Pottery Barn were also credited with accelerating the trend toward luxury goods, if only by reaction. Pushed by their success, many mid-priced furniture manufacturers have cleaned up their acts, adding Shaker-esque contemporary collections to their more traditional lineups. Even Sears is seeking to shed its dowdy image with contemporary leather upholstery from Natuzzi.
"Smooth and sleek isn't news anymore. People are beginning to look for a little more craftsmanship," said Diane Granda, design director for John Widdicomb, which introduced a collection of high-style Georgian and Regency furniture inspired by British museum pieces.
Some exhibitors tried to stir up a little excitement by hitching their products to well-known names. Thomasville Furniture executives in neatly pressed safari jackets conducted tours around the 96-piece collection of licensed Ernest Hemingway furniture (the most unlikely entry: an armchair upholstered in fabric printed with manuscript pages of "The Sun Also Rises"). Models flown in from Dallas vogued around the American Drew showroom, where the surprisingly sedate Bob Mackie collection of mid-priced rococo-style furniture was introduced.
But the real news was generated by some old market hands. Barbara Barry, whose first Art Deco-esque collection for Baker had its debut in 1996, added about 35 pieces, most prominently in a glossy off-white enamel finish. At John Widdicomb, Mr. Laslo added eight pieces to his Moderne Collection in mahogany, wenge and sycamore. Henredon, no stranger to excess, upped the glamour quotient with Circa 2000, a pastiche of Art Moderne and Hollywood fantasy in maple and silver leaf.
Manufacturers tried to distance themselves from the glitzy 80's opulence that Michael Delgaudio, vice president at Century, called "swag and gag." Quiet but tactile was the byword. Baker, for instance, showcased Ms. Barry's new pieces in a boudoir vignette, using a writing desk as a dressing table complete with silver tray, love note and Chanel No. 5.
Even Mitchell Gold, which has staked a solid claim in the middle of the market, introduced a new Platinum collection of plushy furniture cushioned in goose down and priced around $2,500 for an 88-inch sofa. "Furniture has to compete against all those other luxury goods for the consumer's dollar," said Bob Williams, Mitchell Gold's design director, "and it better be luxurious."
In upholstered furniture, luxury was widely interpreted as "soft modern" -- tight upholstery, tailored slipcovers and exposed legs. At Mitchell Gold, the reigning prince of squashy comfort, oversize slipcovers were banished to the back of the showroom. In many showrooms, chairs and sofas broke out of the rectangle into polymorphic, organic shapes. Vladimir Kagan designed a three-level sofa, Dot.com, for American Leather. At Dellarobbia, an amoeba-shaped ottoman was upholstered in a fabric inspired by old Spirograph designs. Karel McKinney, national sales and marketing director for Dellarobbia, said: "The Pottery Barn look? Been there, done that. Our customer wants more."

HEADLINE: LIBRARY/PERSONAL FINANCE CD-ROM'S;
Tapping Cyberbrains For Financial Advice

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT; Roy Furchgott, a writer in Baltimore, frequently reports on personal finance.

 BODY:
DESPITE recent stock market fluctuations -- or maybe because of them -- investments remain hot cocktail chatter as boomers fret about how to swing a comfy retirement. The money has to go somewhere, and under the mattress won't do.
So how much do you need, and what investments should you choose to be able to retire to that cottage on Martha's Vineyard? While a whole industry of investment firms and financial planners is ready to counsel you, often for a hefty fee, budget-minded do-it-yourselfers are turning to inexpensive software that assesses their investments, tells them how much money they will need in retirement and gives guidelines on investing to meet that goal. 
 At their best, these programs are simple, harvesting data from an electronic checkbook to give you an accurate thumbnail appraisal of saving and spending habits that will put you on track for that beach house. At their worst, they resemble an Internal Revenue Service audit. Your experience with them depends largely on your record keeping and financial acumen. If you already have a program like Quicken or Microsoft Money and keep detailed records, projecting your future is a snap. If you keep old bills in a shoebox, you are in for many hours of data entry. If you let your records pile up because you don't know how to organize your finances, however, you might consider using these programs to help you turn that pile of receipts into a sensible balance sheet.
I looked at the 20 best-selling financial-planning CD-ROM's and found three comprehensive planners. These programs prod you through a detailed questionnaire to determine your long-term financial status. They were Quicken Financial Planner, which can be purchased separately or as part of the popular Quicken Suite (Quicken products are the top-selling planners); Microsoft's Lifetime Planner, which is integrated in the MS Money Financial Suite, and Plan Retirement Quick & Easy from Individual Software, which also makes Retire Ready Deluxe, which has more features but was not a top 20 seller. And T. Rowe Price offers a planner you can get by mail on CD-ROM or download.
The plans all forecast and suggest investments based on several factors, like how fast you want your money to grow, how much risk you want to take and how various investments (stocks, bonds, funds) have performed over time. Their pie charts telling you how to divide your investments can be found in any personal finance book, and even in many financial firms' brochures. These cyberplanners will not replace a flesh-and-blood financial planner completely, and most offer a disclaimer saying so.
To test these programs, I asked Kevin Condon, a partner in Baltimore-Washington Financial Advisors Inc., which offers traditional financial planning services, to feed the real financial dossier of a family his company advises into these programs and compare the results. Mr. Condon renamed the family members John, Jane and Lisa Doe. John, 56, an engineer, earns $51,000 a year and plans to retire in seven years. Jane, 50, makes $65,000. She retires in eight years with a pension of $38,000 a year and no Social Security because she is a Federal employee. Lisa, 15, is in a private school that costs $16,500 a year and plans to attend a private college costing about $30,000 a year.
The Does are very good savers and have invested $360,000 in 401(k) plans and about $267,000 in mutual funds, individual stocks and bonds and a thrift savings plan. They would like to spend $50,000 next year on a wish list of items. Expenses are low, they carry little debt, and they put aside more than $10,000 a year.
Their planners say the Does will be able to pay for Lisa's education and manage a very comfortable retirement. Mr. Condon's calculations assume a assuming 3 percent inflation, an 8 percent return on investments before retirement and a 6 percent return after retirement, and adjust the tax each year as income changes (the overall average tax is 25 percent). When Ms. Doe dies, (statistics say that she will outlive her husband), she will leave Lisa an investment portfolio of $3.79 million. Ah, but what do the cyberplanners say?

HEADLINE: Quick! Name a Top Israeli Filmmaker;
Nation's Cinema Is a Well-Kept Secret

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
The dark-haired man in the slate-gray turtleneck sounded as if he were trying to explain the dynamics of the Middle East peace process, which was nearing a crescendo as he spoke on Friday.
"This is not a society that is outlined or completely established," said Amos Gitai."It's volcanic, abrupt, with a reality that's constantly destabilized. It's a place where the great events of history crawl into the bedroom and don't leave you a moment of silence, where you are constantly called to give an opinion, even if you just want to enjoy a moment of quiet. Everything you do is a testament to memory." 
 Rather than talking about the complications of making peace, Mr. Gitai, perhaps Israel's best-known film director, was talking about the challenge of creating cinema, a process that for Israeli filmmakers has often been as taxing, contentious and flawed as the currents of diplomacy.
Mr. Gitai was in New York as part of the Film Society of Lincoln Center's series "Creating a Nation: The Cinema of Israel," which opened on Saturday and runs through Nov. 11. The festival traces the evolution from the first films of the Zionist movement, like the two rare silents that are to be be shown on Sunday, or Helmar Lurski's "Avoda," a 1930's chronicle of early Jewish settlers in Palestine.
But while paying tribute to Israeli films during the 50th anniversary of the nation's birth, the series also reflects the limitations of a body of work that is surprisingly obscure, with no director widely known outside Israel's borders (and not too many known within them). Since its beginning in 1963, the New York Film Festival has never included an Israeli work.
Israelis have produced many thoughtful and challenging films, and there is enough interest in the United States to support an annual Israeli Film Festival, which has been showing new Israeli work in New York and Los Angeles for 15 years. But like the nation itself, Israeli films began as a statement of faith, as self-consciously propagandistic exemplars of the Zionist dream.
"The beginning of Israeli cinema is intertwined with the beginnings of Zionism," said Ella Shohat, a professor of film at the City University of New York and the author of "Israeli Cinema: East/West and the Politics of Representation" (University of Texas Press, 1989). "Zionists quite consciously used the cinema to promote their cause. Cinema from its earliest days was about trying to lure people to come to Palestine."
The notion of film as a single idealized vision of Israel began to crack in the 1960's as a new generation of Israelis began to question the orthodoxy of the original Jewish settlers and was more or less discredited by the 1970's. But building a cinematic tradition as rich as the contentious babble of voices that is Israel has been a slow process, as becomes evident in comparing the long list of familiar Israeli writers with the obscurity of Israeli filmmakers.
 
Still a Desire To Hide Differences
"Essentially, cinema needs two things at the same time, an industrial base and financial base on the one hand, and individual freedom of expression on the other," Mr. Gitai said. "Since both are rather missing in the early stages, it's taken a long time to develop Israeli film.
"We live in a very opinionated, pluralistic society. But in film, there's still an attitude that wants to hide the differences and produce, pathetically, a unified vision instead of exposing our internal debate."
Mr. Gitai, who began his career as an architect and started making documentaries for Israeli television in 1977, reflects how far Israeli films have come. His works cover a broad range from documentaries to fiction, many of them richly textured evocations of the interconnections between Palestinians and Israelis.
The series's opening night featured his newest film, "Yom Yom" ("Day After Day"), a comedy about the divided life of the son of a Jewish mother and Palestinian father living in Haifa. It is part of a trilogy based in Israel's three main cities, Haifa, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
His other films include a trilogy of documentaries on Jews and Palestinians; "Esther," a bold retelling of the biblical story; "Berlin Jerusalem," a drama about two women, an Expressionist poet from Berlin and a Russian revolutionary, whose paths bring them to Jerusalem; "Give Peace a Chance," a documentary about the peace effort, and "Kippur," in which Mr. Gitai brings together the people who were with him when his helicopter was shot down during the Yom Kippur war of 1973.
But he also had two films censored by the television authorities and has found life as a skeptical filmmaker in Israel so difficult that he lived in Paris from 1982 to 1993. Even now, he raises much of the money for his work abroad and says a lack of financial support, both the private and public, has made it difficult for other filmmakers to create a body of work.
"Basically, filmmakers invest a lot of energy producing one feature film, and the consequences are they have to sell their house or take major economic risks," he said. "There is not the institutional support you find in France, in Australia, in many other countries."
Israeli filmmakers face other obstacles as well.
With perhaps six million people in the world who speak Hebrew, the language barrier is enormous. And Jewish culture, from the biblical injunction against worshiping graven images, has always been more geared toward the word than the picture, so there is less of a visual memory bank for filmmakers to work from. Perhaps most important, Israeli films face the problems confronting all independent artists in an international film market that has almost no place for anything but Hollywood blockbusters. It takes some institutional heft to get films seen or directors known, the kind of attention that has put Australian films, and even those from places as unlikely as Iran, on the map.
"There are some terrific films, but there's very little support for them," said Richard Pena, director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center. "If we get a film from Iran, there will always be someone calling, 'When's the last deadline?' They're very active in promoting their films. My impression is that Israel has done less of that."
 
Conflict Is Local And Universal
That said, Israeli films have some enormous advantages as well. They cover perhaps the most resonant and familiar turf on the globe and subject matter having to do with borders, conflict, memory and reconciliation: a world of blood feuds between people so close they could be brothers, that is at once intensely local and blindingly universal.
"Cinema is a very strange medium," Mr. Gitai said. "With one powerful image, you can break through the barriers and stupidity and oversimplifications that are all around you. So we're still defining what the face of Israel will be at the beginning of the century. There's a reality to life in the Middle East that's so much more complex than the images you see on CNN. It's something we shouldn't be afraid to look for, and it's why this is one of the few places in the world where cinema still matters."
Some experts, like Ms. Shohat, argue that if there is a failing in Israeli films, it has been more of a constricted esthetic vision than a political one. The current festival includes two offbeat classics, "Hor Balevana" ("Hole in the Moon") and "Ha-Banana Hashehora" ("The Black Banana"), both of them wildly fanciful re-creations of Israeli culture and mythology. But such films remain rare. And Ms. Shohat says that genuinely opening up the Israeli film culture means getting more resources to artists who are not Ashkenazic men, those of Middle and Northern European descent, a group that includes Mr. Gitai.
Mr. Gitai, who said he found it odd to be cast suddenly as a poster boy for Israeli films after years of feeling like a pariah, noted that providing resources for an art form as expensive as film has always been an issue in a land fighting for survival. But he said the nature of Israeli society demanded finding a way to do it.
"Let's say you live in a battle zone, which the Middle East is," he said. "You have to confront two questions. One is you have to survive. Second, you have to ask yourself what you survive for. And the second question is no less important than the first one. The positive thing about Israel is that it's not a Spartan society. Israelis need to justify for themselves the sense of their collective existence."

That Wagging Finger

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
That 800-pound gorilla beckoning to you to join him in the voting booth is The Impeachment Issue.
I am alone in this view (though not in the anything-goes Clinton interpretation of "alone"). The best political reporters assure us that the American voter cares not a whit about where candidates stand on what to do about a President who is -- no matter how you extenuate it -- an unconfessed serial perjurer. 
 Even John Zogby, the only pollster who called the last election on the button, finds that by more than 2 to 1, respondents say impending impeachment will not be a factor in their vote.
How, in the face of all this objective reporting, and aware of the personalities that affect each local election, can I cling to the iconoclastic belief that impeachment is the gut issue in the 1998 campaign?
One reason is that normal, forthright people, not under oath, will happily mislead pollsters and journalists with the same equanimity that Clinton will half-truth grand jurors. Beyond that, even Zogby admits that "the nasty secret of this business" is that more than half the people approached by pollsters tell them to get lost.
These silent majoritarians who assert their privacy are my kind of guys. Many are afflicted with "pluralistic ignorance" -- that is, they do not realize that most other people feel the way they do -- and so refuse to tell strangers what they mistakenly think is a minority view, disapproved of by the elites.
The other reason that impeachment stalks this campaign so stealthily is that Republican politicians -- fooled by folks who fancy focus-groupies -- have been afraid to take too stern a position about repeated lying under oath by a Federal official sworn to uphold the law. The G.O.P. has been spooked by its fear of "energizing" the wrong "core."
As a result, throughout this campaign the Republican leaders have been playing not to lose. Such a cautious, run-out-the-clock game plan is unworthy of the contest. The way to win is to play to win.
Speaker Gingrich and Senator Lott decided this summer that good ends (electing more Republicans) justified the worst means: they abandoned the tax cuts needed to avert recession, and blew off spending caps with phony emergencies to accommodate liberal handouts.
These neo-Quiddist savants figured if they went along with the Clinton pandering to the teachers' lobby, and caved in to his doubletalk on "saving the surplus," the boat would not rock; voter lethargy and media boredom would carry them to veto-proof majorities. Then they could fix what they helped foul up.
But playing not to lose was a loser. The Gingrich-Lott "pree-vent dee-fense" led to legislating in the darkness to appease the liberals, and Clinton took them to the cleaners. Their Faustian budget deal broke faith with the voters who brung 'em and made G.O.P. incumbents seem lazy incompetents. Their campaign strategy looked shyly away from Topic A.
Now, in the final week, Gingrich and Lott realize that the focus is on infidelity, all right -- their infidelity to conservative principle.
 The consensus forecast has dropped to a G.O.P. single-digit seat gain in the House, two or three in the Senate. That's because Republicans have failed to join the paramount issue in this campaign:
In most cases, a Democratic vote this year helps protect Clinton no matter what new evidence an impeachment inquiry finds, thereby placing this and future Presidents high above the rule of law. Contrariwise, a Republican vote builds strength in Congress to show that a pattern of deceit and other abuses not limited to "lying about sex" should have the most serious consequences.
Even the claim to a sex exception from the oath is troubling: What about perjury to protect your child? Your lifelong business partner? A handicapped person? Where do exceptions end?
Belatedly, ever so tastefully, G.O.P. spots will touch on the scandal in the final days. We can at last see the impeachment issue raised in the slow-motion showing of the film clip that will dog Bill Clinton to the end of his days: looking us right in the eye and wagging his finger in our faces to make us listen to him lie in his teeth.
Watch for it. Then Americans can ask one another the question: Is it right for this country to let any President, of either party, get away with that?

Mastercard joins the growing crowd that believes what sells here will sell there, too.

BYLINE: By Greg Farrell 

 BODY:
THEODORE LEVITT may or may not pay for anything with a Mastercard, but he can certainly use the company to prove his theories of global marketing.
In 1983, Mr. Levitt, a marketing expert at the Harvard Business School, popularized the idea of the global village in marketing. He wrote that advances in technology and communications were shrinking the planet, encouraging consumers everywhere to develop similar tastes for the same products. With few notable exceptions, most people ignored his theories, continuing to believe that what sold in the United States would not necessarily sell in Japan, France or Latin America. 
 In the 1990's, that has changed. Advertisers have realized that their greatest asset is the value of their brands and that in an increasingly interdependent global economy, those brands should stand for the same things worldwide.
To that end, many global marketers have consolidated their advertising and marketing relationships at single agencies to help build consistent, globally recognizable personalities for brands, with Nike's "swoosh" the blueprint to follow. Among them are I.B.M., which in 1994 consolidated its advertising at the Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide unit of WPP Group P.L.C., and Citibank, which last year combined accounts at Young & Rubicam Advertising.
Now, Mastercard International is following suit.
A year ago, Mastercard selected McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York to handle its United States advertising. In recent months, Mastercard's regional partners in Europe and Latin America have agreed to shift their advertising to McCann, and the agency is continuing to pitch the business to local partners, country by country.
"Mastercard is a major global brand," said Debra Coughlin, senior vice president for global advertising and marketing services at Mastercard in Purchase, N.Y. "We began searching in the U.S. for a campaign, but we were looking for a global agency."
McCann-Erickson, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, came up with a campaign carrying the theme "Priceless," in which average people use Mastercard credit cards to pay for all the mundane things that add up to a special moment. In one commercial, for instance, two golfers pay for greens fees and lunch with the card; an announcer supplies the prices for each transaction. When one golfer gets a hole-in-one, the announcer describes the moment as "priceless" and concludes, "For everything else, there's Mastercard."
McCann-Erickson will use that commercial in the United States, Canada and Asia. Moreover, it is using the concept of the overall campaign and localized versions as a drawing card to compete for and win the Mastercard accounts in other major markets: Asia, Latin America and Europe.
Unlike most other worldwide account consolidations, Mastercard's has not been dictated from a chief executive's office; rather, it has been a gradual process of convincing the regional and local offices that there are merits to a single approach, and one agency, to build a unified brand.
Within that unity, however, there is room for customization. McCann-Erickson has shot extra footage so the commercials can be re-edited and made more appropriate in local markets. For example, one spot set at a baseball stadium could be changed to show a soccer stadium for Europe and Latin America.
What does Mastercard consider the advantages of consolidating its account? "You want to be a big player with a major agency that can help you manage your business around the world," said Ms. Coughlin, who joined Mastercard in 1996 after an advertising career at Y.& R. and the J. Walter Thompson unit of WPP.
"It's not just a communications partner," she added, "but a business partner" that "can look at your brand the way you look at your brand."
Ms. Coughlin emphasized the importance of cross-pollination: not just running American work overseas but also running overseas work in this country.
For those who have been preaching the gospel of globalization, moves like Mastercard's only confirm the truth of what they have been saying.
"After all these years of ballyhoo, globalization of ad accounts is finally a reality and here to stay," said Kelly O'Dea, president for client services at Ogilvy, who has helped the agency manage its worldwide relationships with I.B.M., Ford and Eastman Kodak.
"Companies are finding that old assumptions about how well brands travel had to be challenged," he added. "Brands can travel quite well across borders, and you need somebody to help you figure that out."
John J. Dooner Jr., chairman and chief executive of McCann-Erickson World Group, which established its global network decades ago to serve the Coca-Cola account, said: "The march toward globalization is inexorable. It's not just Lever, L'Oreal and General Motors. The second level of marketers are recognizing the importance of being global."
Reckitt & Colman, a maker of household cleaning products, consolidated its advertising at McCann-Erickson in 1996. After two years, Philip Darnton, group director for global marketing, said he was pleased with the results.
"If you spend your money in lots of little pieces, things don't happen," he said. "You can't command the best people on your account. With a global agency, there's a degree of consistency in brand position" because "the agency starts to be a custodian of the brand."
Edward H. Vick, chief operating officer at Y.& R. Inc., recalled that after the Colgate-Palmolive Company announced in late 1995 that it was consolidating its account at Y.& R. Advertising, his people put together a study called "The Big Game."
By its reckoning, there were about 40 worldwide marketers with ad budgets of more than $500 million a year. Now, Mr. Vick estimated, that number has grown to 50.
"As these companies go global," Mr. Vick said, "they begin to realize that as the world gets smaller, the need for a brand to stand for something is more and more important."
As for the future, Mr. Dooner said: "The bigger will get stronger. That's true not only in the advertising business, but on the client side."

HEADLINE: Arafat Gets a Scripted Welcome Back Home in Gaza

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG 

DATELINE: GAZA, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Cheered by throngs of schoolchildren but ignored by most Gazans who went about their daily routines, Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, returned here today to promote his accord with Israel to a wary public.
The reception for Mr. Arafat was orchestrated by his Al Fatah movement and the Palestinian Authority, and had none of the euphoric spontaneity of the mass celebrations that followed previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements. 
 Wearied by 19 months of bitter stalemate with Israel and by steadily worsening economic hardship, most people in Gaza seemed indifferent to Mr. Arafat's return, unwilling yet to set aside deep suspicions that the promise of the latest accord may also go unrealized.
"The accord is good, but the important thing is implementation," said Nasser al-Qassas, a truck driver, as he sat on a street corner far away from the festivities.
Immediately after signing the accord, Mr. Arafat toured some of the region's Arab capitals to drum up support for the agreement. Today, as Mr. Arafat arrived at his beach-front office, there were marching bands, hundreds of flag-waving pupils, and the obligatory red carpet, honor guard, and a long line of officials from the Palestinian Authority.
Banners strung over the road greeted Mr. Arafat as the "Maker of Victory and Peace," the "Faithful Guardian of the Palestinian Dream" who had brought "New Hope for the Masses of Our People."
Stepping out of his car and flashing his trademark V-sign -- for victory -- Mr. Arafat confidently predicted that the accord signed with the Israelis in Washington last Friday would proceed according to plan, despite a decision by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to postpone ratification of the accord by the Israeli Cabinet.
"What has been signed will be implemented accurately," Mr. Arafat told reporters. To his people, he repeated what has become a familiar mantra: "Onward together until we pray together in Jerusalem, the capital of the Palestinian state."
But Mr. Arafat has a difficult road ahead. He must persuade a deeply skeptical public that this time the agreement with Israel will yield tangible benefits. The campaign has already begun, with the Palestinian radio and press trumpeting gains of the accord: an airport, travel between the West Bank and Gaza, and prisoner releases.
Nabil Shaath, the irrepressibly optimistic minister of planning in the Palestinian cabinet, spoke glowingly of the prospects ahead in a recent interview on the Voice of Palestine radio. He described trips from the West Bank to eat fish by the Gaza sea, and travel from a Palestinian international airport where there is no visible Israeli presence.
"Patience, and slowly everything will fall into place," he assured his listeners.
On the security front, Mr. Arafat will have to move decisively against armed elements without provoking civil strife. Trouble is already brewing in the West Bank town of Ramallah, where Mr. Arafat's police officers killed a local youth this week during a demonstration against a weapons search in the local Al Fatah headquarters.
Angry Fatah leaders held demonstrations and strikes in several West Bank towns, prompting Mr. Arafat to move swiftly to defuse the crisis. The four officers who conducted the search were jailed after quick trials, an investigation of the shooting was begun, and the victim was given a state funeral today, attended by top officials and police officers.
In Gaza, where Palestinians are bottled up in an impoverished strip of land surrounded by an Israeli security fence and border checkpoints, there is great yearning for a measure of freedom that could result from the latest accord.
Mr. Qassas, the truck driver, said he was most eager for the opening of safe-passage routes between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
"It'll provide emotional relief, and material benefits, because I'll be able to make delivery runs to the West Bank," he said. "I'll get a breath of fresh air and see the mountains, relax and meet other people. I'll feel freer."
Khaled Shaghub, a laborer, said he had not seen relatives in the West Bank for five years because of Israeli border closures that have prevented him from leaving the Gaza Strip.
"We're in a big prison now," he said. "If the agreement is carried out it will change people's mentality. We will feel the beginnings of a real peace."

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
'I Was Busy Reading My Playbook, and . . .'

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON 

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Oct. 28

 BODY:
Malcolm Thomas was brought to the Giants last month to be the team's practice-squad running back, a thankless job that is pro football's version of the Hollywood stuntman.
Thomas, a former star at Syracuse, imitates the opposition's top running back in practice drills as the Giants' starting defensive players take turns hurling their bodies into him. Thomas, 24, accepts his role as a human tackling dummy because there is a remote chance it will lead to a full-time roster spot. 
 In the meantime, he is part of a pro football team, paid about $600 a day, and at night could rest his bruised body at the Econo-Lodge in Carlstadt, N.J. Or at least that's where he had been staying.
Early last Saturday morning, as Thomas watched television at the Econo-Lodge, his car was stolen, setting off a chain of events that included an accident with a tractor-trailer, a spectacular fire and a power outage that forced Thomas, his wife, Tanya, and their 21-month-old son -- along with about 100 other frightened motel guests -- out into the streets where they huddled on a cold October morning for an hour or more.
No one was hurt. The car thieves have not been caught. Thomas's car was totaled. He has since moved out of the Econo-Lodge. He returned to practice this week, amazing his teammates with an extraordinary "what I did during my bye weekend" story.
"It was just after midnight when I heard a big rumble and then a boom and all the lights went out in the room," Thomas said today at his Giants Stadium locker. "I looked out the window and saw smoke coming from over the top of the building.
"I went downstairs to see if I needed to move my car. But it wasn't there. I came up and told my wife. She said, 'You're lying.' I said, 'No, I'm not.' She told me to go look again."
Thomas checked the entire garage this time. His 1994 black Honda Civic was not there.
"By now there were firemen and police banging on the doors trying to get all the people out," Thomas said. "I wrapped my son, Brandon, in a blanket and we all went outside."
Police later said that Thomas's stolen car collided with a tractor-trailer as it fled the motel on Washington Avenue in Carlstadt. The car ended up on the side of the road. The truck hit a utility pole.
The truck driver narrowly escaped injury, pulling himself from his rig just before it burst into flames that rose 20 feet into the air, Thomas said. Motel windows were broken by the explosion, power lines were disrupted and nearby signs melted from the heat of the blaze.
"We went up to one of the police officers and told her our car was stolen," Thomas said. "She said they would get a report later. We later told another police officer about our car and he asked what color our car was.
"When I said black he said one of the cars in the accident was black. A little bit later, he took me over to identify the car. There it was. A total loss."
Thomas, an all-star in the National Football League's Europe League last summer, has been telling the story inside Giants Stadium for a few days.
"Guys stare at you and go, 'What?' " Thomas said. "Then they say, 'No.' Then, 'You're kidding?' I just keep going and eventually they laugh and say, 'Well, you'll get a new car.' "
This week, Thomas relocated to an apartment in Irvington, N.J., a move he had planned to make Saturday, the day his car was stolen, precipitating the accident, the fire, the outage, the motel evacuation.
"That's what I was going to do for the bye weekend," Thomas said. "I was going to move."
He ended up staying in the motel for a few more days.
"We hadn't slept all night and I had a bunch of insurance calls to make," he said, smiling. "Now I got a story to tell about my first year with the Giants."
 
EXTRA POINTS
Coach JIM FASSEL said quarterback DANNY KANELL was showing no effects of the surgery he had last week to remove a growth in his chest, but was ill with a stomach flu. Fassel said Kanell caught the virus from the third-string quarterback MIKE CHERRY. "I'm thinking about having the quarterbacks sit farther away from each other in meetings," Fassel said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries OffAs Stability Aids Markets

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Bond prices fell for the first time in three days as signs of stability in world financial markets decreased the demand for Treasuries, and the Government announced plans to sell $38 billion of notes and bonds next week.
The rally that drove long-term Treasury yields to the lowest levels in three decades lost steam recently, after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates twice and stocks gained. 
 Companies including the Associates Corporation of North America, a unit of the Associates First Capital Corporation, the biggest publicly traded consumer finance company, rushed to sell debt in recent days, a sign that investors were again willing to buy riskier securities that yield more than Treasuries.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 19/32, to 105 26/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.12 percent, from 5.08 percent.
Fannie Mae sold $3 billion in five-year benchmark notes yesterday. That follows about $9 billion in sales from companies and other borrowers yesterday, as concern the United States economy would fall into recession diminished.
The Treasury sold $16 billion of two-year notes yesterday and announced that it would auction $38 billion of 5-year and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds at next week's quarterly debt sales.
The two-year notes were sold at a yield of 4.025 percent, below traders' estimates before the sale.
The demand at the sale may bode well for next week's auctions, analysts said.
Beginning on Monday, the Treasury Department will switch to the single-price Dutch auction format for all its bill, note and bond auctions, the Government said yesterday. Until now, only the two- and five-year notes were sold using that technique. In a single-price auction, bidders pay a price set by the Treasury Department provided they have submitted a bid that is equal to or higher than that price.
In multiple-price auctions, which have applied to 10-year notes and 30-year bonds, bidders pay the amount they bid as long as the bid is above the set price.
Following are the results of the auction yesterday for two-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Price . . . 99.952
High Yield . . . 4.025%
Low Yield . . . 3.900%

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
The Dow Breaks Its Fall As Most Averages Advance

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stock prices resumed their advance yesterday in a relatively subdued session as investors appraised Brazil's fiscal package and awaited key Government reports on United States wage growth and output.
Most averages posted gains, though the Dow Jones industrial average retained only 5.93 points of what at one time was a gain of nearly 67 points. It did, however, break a run of three straight declines, closing at 8,371.97. The Nasdaq composite index had the day's best gain, rising 19.72 points, or 1.15 percent, to 1,737.35, as its technology stocks gathered strength in the afternoon. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.75 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 1,068.09. 
 "The market is having to deal with some crosscurrents," said John H. Shaughnessy, chief strategist at Advest Group. He said that Brazil, which announced an austerity plan, seemed to be "getting its act together" but that declining consumer confidence in the United States was a growing concern.
Nonetheless, most retail and department store shares rebounded, with Wal-Mart Stores rising 1 9/16, to 64 13/16, reversing the bulk of its loss on Tuesday when the Conference Board said consumer confidence slipped in October for the fourth month in a row.
Most bank and brokerage stocks also moved higher, paced by J. P. Morgan, up 1 1/2, to 91 1/8, and Charles Schwab, up 1 7/8, to 44 1/16.
The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks, which has had a run-up of nearly 20 percent in the last couple of weeks, made a strong comeback in the afternoon but still could not eke out a gain. It fell three-hundredths of a percent, with 890 components up and 874 down.
Clare W. Zempel, chief strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee, was among those regarding the general market advance of recent weeks as more likely to be a building block than a bear-market trap for the unwary. He pointed to the decline in short-term interest rates in the United States and signs of economic stability in the Far East that he said "strongly suggest that the worst" of this year's stock decline is past.
As for Brazil, Mr. Zempel said it would probably "muddle through."
Brazil's Bovespa stock index retreated six-tenths of a percent yesterday as investors evaluated its plan to cut its $60 billion budget deficit, the centerpiece of an effort to restore its credit and avoid devaluing its currency, the real.
Other overseas markets were mostly lower as well, with main stock indexes down 2.53 percent in Frankfurt, 1.61 percent in Paris, seven-tenths of a percent in London and 2.2 percent in Tokyo. Stocks rose 1.51 percent in Hong Kong.
Although foreign economic and financial turmoil has in the last 15 months supplanted Washington's economic reports as the dominant market influence, the Government's first estimate of gross domestic product for the third quarter, to be announced tomorrow, will be closely watched for signs that the economy's slowdown might be accelerating, said Rosanne M. Cahn, equity economist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
Many analysts already expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again, perhaps as early as mid-November.
A second focal point will be the Labor Department's release today of the employment cost index, a quarterly measure of wage pressure that, like the figures on gross domestic product, has implications for corporate profits.
Rising technology stocks yesterday included Sun Microsystems, up 3 1/16, to 56 11/16, Dell Computer and Cisco Systems, each up 2 1/8, to 64 5/8 and 62 7/8, respectively, and Sun Microsystems, up 3 1/16, to 56 11/16.
Oil stocks were mixed, with Mobil down 3/4 at $72 7/8 after reporting a 45 percent earnings decline, a bit less than expected. Drugs were mostly higher, paced by Warner-Lambert, up 2 13/16, to $76 3/4,and Schering-Plough, up 1 7/8, to 102 1/8.
DuPont was the Dow's biggest loser, slumping 2 11/16, to 56 7/8, apparently reflecting a negative discussion of the company's prospects in The Wall Street Journal.
On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by 1,535 to 1,456, with new highs exceeding new lows for the second consecutive session, 30 to 23. Volume was moderate.

HEADLINE: Luxury in Recession Land;
The Hermes of the World Find New Ways to Prosper In Japan's Weak Economy

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Perhaps nothing epitomizes the Wonderland-like quality of the Japanese recession like the giant orange Hermes box in the heart of Ginza, Tokyo's most exclusive shopping district.
For Hermes International, the building-sized box, complete with signature orange packaging and brown "ribbon," is not merely a marketing tool but a reflection of the company's confidence that even in bad times, there will be plenty of Japanese willing to pay hundreds of thousand of yen for one of its handbags. Such confidence is hardly misplaced. 
 Sure, unemployment is at record levels, corporate earnings are sinking, bankruptcies are at a record high, investment is down and the banking system is at the brink of disaster. But luxury goods retailers in Japan are thriving, even as overall consumer spending has continued to fall.
And while luxury sales in Hong Kong, Singapore and other Asian markets that were once promising engines of growth have stalled -- partly because of their own economic traumas and partly because of a decline in Japanese tourism -- many luxury goods companies continue to post solid gains in Japan.
"The economy is not so good, but still people want to buy nice things," said Hideko Isono, a 30-year-old manicurist who lives with her parents in a suburb north of Tokyo and runs her own business.
Indeed, it is young working women like Miss Isono, and even high school students, who live at home and have a penchant for expensive brand names, who are chiefly fueling the growth of luxury goods sales here. Sales have also been helped by lower prices, made possible by a slowing economy that has reduced business costs like rent and real estate. And, of course, a lot of the wealthy are immune to hard times.
Even in recession, Japan continues to be the most important market in Asia for luxury goods companies.
Just look at sales figures for Tiffany & Company. Sales in Japan rose 21 percent in the first half of the year in yen terms from a year earlier, while sales in the rest of Asia fell 16 percent in local currencies for the same period. And earlier this month, Tiffany said it expected to meet earnings estimates for the third quarter, in large part because robust sales in Japan would offset weak sales in the United States.
There are other measures of the staying power of luxury goods here. Gucci Group N.V., for instance, has opened seven stores in Japan since the beginning of the year and will open a flagship store in the chic Aoyama neighborhood next spring. "Japanese consumers are continuing to perceive great value in luxury brands," said Domenico De Sole, the president of Gucci.
Hermes has a three-year backlog of orders in Japan for Kelly bags, made famous by the actress Grace Kelly. The least expensive model sells for 430,000 yen, or about $3,645 at current exchange rates. The Hermes box in Ginza sits on property reportedly bought for $84 million. The company plans to open a flagship store on the site in 2000.
Louis Vuitton, a unit of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A., expects a 7 percent to 8 percent increase in sales this year.
Prada, however, is the luxury brand for Miss Isono, whose most recent purchase was a leather wallet. She carries the wallet in a nylon Prada handbag, which she bought at a "brand store" in Roppongi, a neighborhood popular with foreign residents and for its night life. "I like Prada because of its good quality and because it is attractive," she said, adding that she found the same characteristics in Gucci and Hermes -- although Hermes was a bit too expensive for her.
Brand stores specialize in selling luxury goods obtained outside authorized channels of distribution that are sold for prices similar to prices charged in luxury goods boutiques in the United States. That is a bargain here compared with Japanese department stores and the official branches of those same boutiques. The merchandise may not be the latest design, but in handbags, wallets and scarves, that hardly matters. As deregulation has eroded the rigid distribution system here, more and more brand-name goods have found their way to such shops, which are proliferating.
"Before, everything was really expensive: food, housing, clothes," Miss Isono said, providing a firsthand account of a deflationary cycle that many economists, rather than celebrating, actually fear is harming Japan. But consumers seem pleased. "Now everything is a very good price," Miss Isono added, "so it's easier to buy nice things even if people don't get a bonus or have a lower salary."
Because Miss Isono lives at home, she incurs none of the standard living expenses -- rent, food, utilities -- that eat into the incomes of most women like her in Europe or the United States. That is why Gucci's average customer in Japan is between 24 and 35, compared with 35 and 55 in Europe.
Luxury goods executives estimate that these young women's incomes range from 4 million yen to 6 million yen annually, or $33,900 to $50,800. At the low end of the range, that income would not go far enough to cover a Vuitton bag or Gucci loafers in the United States and pay for rent and groceries, too.
"The key difference between our business here and in other countries are these young women and the way they live," said Kyojiro Hata, the president of Louis Vuitton Japan K.K.
There are some signs that even those free-spending young women are becoming more cautious, however. A poll of consumers in August by the Nippon Research Institute showed that consumer confidence had wilted most among 20 to 29 year olds, the group that has thus far buoyed overall spending statistics.
But Mr. Hata sees women in their 20's as fairly impervious to the recession, at least in the short term. "Restructuring is taking place here, but at higher levels than these women work at," he said. "Current cuts are aimed at higher income, older workers."
It is not just young women, though, who are helping luxury goods makers weather the economic fallout here. The cost of business is also declining.
"Rents are lower and floor space is easier to obtain than ever before," said Michiko Shimizu, the president of SAI, a marketing consulting firm. "Their cost performance is much better, so why not open a few more shops?"
Mr. Hata, of Louis Vuitton, is interested in a parking lot in Aoyama. It is one of the holdings of Japan Leasing, a financing company that recently went bankrupt, and Mr. Hata has visions of a new store on the site.
He figures the parking lot, which has remained undeveloped despite its prime location because Japan Leasing was seeking an unrealistically high price, will soon come up for sale at a more reasonable price. "Real estate prices are still high, but they're being forced down," he said.
Lower real estate prices and distribution costs have enabled sellers of luxury goods to push prices lower in their Japanese outlets so that they are more in line with what Japanese shoppers find in Hawaii or Hong Kong. Prices that were once 50 percent higher here than in Hong Kong are now only 20 percent higher and falling.
As distribution has become more deregulated here, some brand-name merchandise is now showing up in mass merchandising stores like Ito-Yokado and Daiei, as well as the smaller brand stores, where they can sell for 60 percent of department store prices.
Prices may also be driven lower if a 16 percent import tax on luxury goods is reduced, which is expected as deregulation increases.
And over the last decade, luxury goods companies have developed strategies for coping with economic downturns, offering expanded product lines that include lower-priced products like key chains, scarves and wallets and the use of cheaper materials like vinyl and fabric instead of leather.
That does not mean they are ignoring the wealthy, of course. These bedrock customers for luxury goods makers usually are affected far less by an economic downturn than the aspiring upper middle class.
"We probably benefit less from a boom than some of other luxury companies, but we also don't feel the recession," said Mineaki Saito, president of the Hermes Japon Company, which gets less of a boost from younger women because its prices are somewhat higher than those of other luxury goods companies. "Recession, no recession, our sales have been going up every year since we opened."
Junko Kosuge is one of those customers who keeps Hermes' business growing whatever the economic climate. The wife of a doctor, she has a passion for expensive scarves, which she keeps in a glass-fronted antique chest so that she can look at them.
Mrs. Kosuge is awaiting the arrival of a pale pink crocodile skin bag from Italy to add to her collection of Chanel, Gucci and Hermes handbags. She said that she did not expect the bag to cost more than 500,000 yen, or about $4,237 at current exchange rates. (She likes Louis Vuitton bags as well but, she says, "many, many young women carry them, and at my age, I don't want to bump into them on the train with the same bag.")
She insists that she does feel the recession, although she could not really supply an example of its effect on her family. "People aren't spending money on things they think are wasteful," Mrs. Kosuge said. "I myself feel that way."
Isn't a pale pink crocodile bag wasteful? "No, I don't think so because I was overwhelmed by its attractiveness," she said. "So even if I can only buy one thing like it instead of several, I do because it makes my life fun."

Graph: "Sparkling in the Storm"
Despite an overall slump in consumer spending in Japan, sales of many luxury goods, including jewelry, are up sharply. By contrast, spending has collapsed across the board in the rest of Asia.

HEADLINE: GOLF: Golf Course At the Center Of a Community;
Developer's Dual Initiative Revives Atlanta Neighborhood

BYLINE: By CLIFTON BROWN 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Oct. 28

 BODY:
The neighborhood housing project was so violent, it was nicknamed Little Vietnam.
Drug dealers ruled. Many residents of the East Lake section of Atlanta lived in fear during the 1980's, particularly those in the East Lake Meadows housing project. The deteriorating East Lake Golf Club, where the legendary Bobby Jones learned to play, was just another casualty of the neighborhood. Surrounding it was an environment where premature death was part of the landscape. 
 "About six or seven years ago, the drug dealers started shooting out, and we started shooting in," said Carlos Banda, a 25-year veteran of the Atlanta police force, who works in the East Lake area. "A small child was killed. Even after that, it didn't get that much better."
That was the situation facing Tom Cousins, a local real estate developer and philanthropist, in 1993 when he bought the golf club -- a course in desperate need of restoration, and a community in desperate need of hope.
Amid the brush and dirt of East Lake, Cousins saw an opportunity to secure a legacy as the man who saved the golfing home of Bobby Jones and helped to revive a blighted neighborhood in the process. From his own charitable foundation, Cousins spun off the East Lake Community Foundation, and he used it as the linchpin for a complex marriage involving the golf course, the Federal Government, city officials and the private sector.
Together they raised $93.5 million, with the goal of reviving the golf course and the East Lake community -- through new housing, an after-school academic program, a community center, a golf academy and a caddie scholarship program that has sent some East Lake youths on to college.
While there have been many efforts to attract members of minority groups to golf, this plan was unique in its ambitious attempt to use the sport as a vehicle for urban restoration. The undertaking will gain national attention beginning Thursday when East Lake is host to the Tour Championship, one of professional golf's most prestigious events.
It is a somewhat odd partnership: golf, a sport with a history of exclusion, being used to revitalize a troubled, predominantly African-American neighborhood.
Initially, many corporate leaders were skeptical. Politicians disagreed on a course of action. Some within the community resisted, feeling they were given little voice in the effort; others were distrustful, having been betrayed in the past by numerous broken promises.
"Before, if people asked you where you lived, you better not say East Lake," said Geraldine Lowery, who moved with her two children, Meoshia and Rodriquez, into one of the new town houses last spring. "When they first started talking about doing this, I thought it was a joke. Then when they started building the new places, I said, 'They're not really going to let us live over here.'
"But I'm happy, very happy. I wanted something better for my children, and this is it. And this is how I knew things had changed: My mother never used to want to have any family get-togethers at my house. But one day when we were talking about getting together, my mom said, 'Let's do it at your house.' That made me happy."
Lowery said that when her children were toddlers, she taught them how to roll off the bed and onto the floor when they heard gunfire, and how to keep their heads low to avoid possible stray bullets coming through the window. Now, both children attend the golf academy.
"I think what they've done is absolutely phenomenal," said Tiger Woods, who will play at East Lake this week. "It says a lot for that community. It's just a matter of everyone coming together. And you don't find that very often. Somebody always has some kind of agenda, instead of everyone pulling together for a dream."
The initiative began earlier this decade when Federal money from the Department of Housing and Urban Development was secured. In 1993, Cousins's own charitable organization -- the CF Foundation -- bought the course, and two years later it focused on the East Lake area and formed the East Lake Community Foundation. Together with contributions from the Atlanta Housing Authority and private donations, the money to finance the plan was raised.
 
A Developer Hopes His Project Is a Model
What happens to the East Lake community over time will be a large part of Cousins's legacy. Now 66 years old, he played at East Lake as a child in the 1940's, and his respect for Jones and the course was embedded at a young age.
A wealthy developer who is well known in Atlanta, Cousins developed the downtown Omni complex and Nationsbank plaza. He could have simply renovated East Lake Golf Club and still have drawn rave reviews for restoring a part of golf history. But he chose not to ignore what was on the other side of East Lake's gates.
"People ask me all the time why am I doing this," Cousins said. "It's like they're waiting for the other shoe to drop. We need to do something about situations like this all over the country, or we're going to lose our future. If I had grown up the way a lot of kids had to grow up in East Lake, I would have gone bad a lot sooner than most of them did."
Beyond that, Cousins said he hopes the project will serve as a model for similar efforts elsewhere in the country, and is determined to make his case to investors nationwide. Of the 100 corporate memberships at East Lake, 90 have been reserved for corporations outside Atlanta. Those memberships cost $250,000, with $200,000 of that earmarked for the East Lake Foundation.
"We want to attract 100 of America's best and brightest corporations so that they see what we do, and take it back to their cities," Cousins said. "This has been a problem all across the country. Public housing has been very poorly done and conceived. In the past, our foundation has donated to hunger programs, school programs and housing programs, but we were never really satisfied with the result. This time, we decided to focus on one area, to see if we could come up with some solutions. We focused on East Lake Meadows."
To visit the East Lake community now is to see a rejuvenated neighborhood. The golf course, restored by the noted architect Rees Jones, is in immaculate condition, and the picturesque clubhouse includes personal artifacts belonging to Jones, who won 13 major championships from 1923 to 1930. The club seeks neighborhood youngsters and local college students for the caddie program, with all student caddies eligible for the foundation's college scholarship program.
But the most impressive restoration has occurred outside the golf course's black wrought-iron gates. Old housing projects have been demolished and replaced by new housing called the Villages of East Lake, where middle-income and low-income families are living side by side in 182 new units, including single-family homes, duplexes and apartments. An additional 318 new units are planned, for a total of 500, with construction to begin sometime next year on the opposite side of the course.
Working residents are responsible for the rent, which ranges up to $820 a month for a two-bedroom unit. Unemployed residents are required to pay what they had been paying at East Lake Meadows, but under the lease agreement they must also participate in a self-sufficiency program that focuses on education, job readiness and life skills training. If unemployed tenants get jobs, their rents will increase an amount relative to their salaries.
At the beginning of the project, East Lake residents were given the choice of moving into the new housing or relocating to other areas of Atlanta. Today, some residents who turned down the opportunity are trying to get into the new development.
"You can understand why some people would be leery about wanting to stay in this neighborhood, no matter how much we talked about what was going to happen," said Scarlet Pressley, the golf academy's director of community affairs. "There were so many bad memories here. People had lost family members to violence here. But now that they have seen the positive changes in the community, a lot of them want to come back."
According to city statistics, the neighborhood has seen a dramatic drop in crime rate, and a dramatic increase in property values. Now, instead of moving out, people are looking to move in, particularly since the area is only about a 10-minute drive from downtown Atlanta.
The Charlie Yates Golf Course, a new 18-hole public facility, has been built in the neighborhood; Woods attended the official opening last month. Financing is in place to build a Y.M.C.A. adjacent to the Yates course. And the East Lake Golf Academy, a golf and academic after-school program, provides tutoring for neighborhood youths and regular golf instruction to 115 children who otherwise might not have any exposure to the sport.
Sam Puryear, a former golf team captain at Tennessee State University and the director of junior golf at the academy, has seen first-hand the difference golf has made to the children in the neighborhood. Asked how many children in the academy had parents who played golf, Puryear said: "None of their parents play golf, not one. And now look at them."
Erick Poteat, a promising 13-year-old golfer, was about 20 yards in front of Puryear, painstakingly hitting a bucket of balls on the same driving range where a month before he had been introduced to Woods.
"This makes you want to study, because you want to be able to play golf," Poteat said. "I want to be a pro golfer, but if not, I want to be an architect."
 
Some Residents Seek More Say in the Plans
Yet, not everyone is content, which was probably unavoidable, considering the magnitude of the undertaking around East Lake.
Eva Davis, president of the East Lake Meadows Tenants Association, has lived in the community for almost 30 years, and she bristles at the way she feels the plan was pushed onto local residents. "Mr. Cousins and his group want to do things, but do it their way," she said.
She is also fighting for 28 more families whose apartments are scheduled to be demolished, asking that they be housed temporarily in the new village. Organizers have offered a compromise of 15 families, but that has not yet been accepted.
"If we could go back to the bargaining table and work some of these issues out, I would be the happiest 63-year-old woman in the world," said Davis, who has threatened legal action if some of her demands are not met. "I'm proud of what has happened here, and I had a lot of these same visions before anybody else even cared. But the residents deserve to have their say in everything, and that hasn't always happened."
Meanwhile, two former East Lake Golf Club employees, Andy Portilla and Richard Trent, sued the club in March, saying they were fired because of discrimination. Portilla is Hispanic, while Trent is African-American.
"I'm not going to say anything bad about Mr. Cousins, or what he's trying to do," said Portilla, a former assistant caddie master at East Lake, who caddied last week for Brandel Chamblee at the National Car Rental Golf Classic. "In fact, I came to East Lake because I believed in the program, and I still do. I'm just saying that not everyone who works for Mr. Cousins is like he is, and I wasn't treated fairly."
Officials at East Lake have vehemently denied Portilla's charges, and point to the club's strong record in hiring members of minority groups since Cousins arrived. Sedric Jackson, an African-American, was recently hired as the head golf professional for the Yates course.
But whenever Cousins grows weary of the many challenges and disputes that have accompanied this venture, he can look out the window at a changed golf course and a changed community to draw inspiration. To see 30 of golf's greatest players competing at East Lake this week will be the latest example of how much things have changed.
When the golfers and the fans depart after this weekend, the neighborhood and the golf course will be left behind, hoping to continue the progress that has been made. And golf may be viewed in a different light, as a vehicle for social change.
"I'm sure a lot of people thought this was a crazy idea," Puryear said. "Look around this place. This isn't crazy. This is beautiful."

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE MYSTERY;
Race for 3d Pits Golisano Against McCaughey Ross

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
Although nothing in politics is certain, least of all predictions, polls suggest that George E. Pataki will most likely win the race for Governor next Tuesday, and that Peter F. Vallone, the Democratic nominee, will finish a distant second.
The real mystery is who will come in third. 
 Among the minor-party candidates jostling for that dubious honor are Thomas K. Leighton of the Marijuana Reform Party, which advocates a system of legal distribution of marijuana; the Green Party's Al Lewis, also known as Grandpa Munster, and Michael J. Reynolds of the Right to Life Party. In addition to carrying the Republican Party standard, Mr. Pataki is the candidate of the Conservative Party and Mr. Vallone counts on the support of the Working Families Party.
But the two leading contenders for also-ran are a millionaire -- B. Thomas Golisano, a Rochester businessman who ran for governor on the newly formed Independence Party ballot line in 1994 and is doing so again -- and a millionaire's wife: Betsy McCaughey Ross, the formerly Republican Lieutenant Governor whose try for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination failed resoundingly after her husband, Wilbur L. Ross Jr., a financier, withdrew much of his financial support. Ms. McCaughey Ross is now on the Liberal Party line.
The most recent New York Times/ CBS News Poll shows Mr. Golisano with 9 percent of 1,235 registered voters polled, and Ms. McCaughey Ross with 5 percent, to Mr. Vallone's 21 percent. Mr. Pataki is in front with 56 percent. Nine percent is undecided.
Given Mr. Pataki's sizable lead from the start, neither Mr. Golisano nor Ms. McCaughey Ross has exactly shaken up the race. But not constrained by hope or expectations, they have persisted with their quixotic campaigns, Mr. Golisano with considerably more enthusiasm. For both candidates, more than mere ego is at stake. Unless they win 50,000 votes, their parties will lose their official lines on the ballot in the next election.
Mr. Golisano's campaign strategy is simple: a few news conferences assailing Mr. Pataki's "borrow-and-spend" policies, and lots of money. His most recent financial disclosure form, filed Oct. 20, showed that he had lent his campaign just over $20 million, and that it had spent close to $12 million. He estimates that his spending will total $13 to $15 million.
With paid media doing the work for him, Mr. Golisano is free to continue tending his payroll processing company, Paychex Inc., which he founded in Rochester in 1971. He and the political consultants and media concerns he has hired have papered the state's buses, trains and billboards with his slightly smiling visage and blitzed its television stations with witty political commercials.
Most of the ads needle Mr. Pataki about the state's growing debt. In 1994, Mr. Golisano ran on a range of issues, including massive tax cuts, and won 4 percent of the vote, but this year, he has made debt reduction the centerpiece of his campaign, saying that the Governor has irresponsibly increased state spending and ballooned its debt, particularly through "back-door borrowing" that is not approved by the voters. "He's trying to create a false sense of euphoria about our state's economy," Mr. Golisano says of the Governor.
The candidate's focus appears to be paying off. In an attempt to ride Mr. Golisano's financial coattails, aides say, Mr. Vallone has begun hammering the theme of debt reduction much harder. And on Sunday, The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, which endorsed Mario Cuomo in 1994, endorsed Mr. Golisano, whom it described as "beating the drums of fiscal responsibility."
Given the withdrawal of her husband's financial support, Ms. McCaughey Ross has had no choice but to keep a lower profile. She devotes most of her time to banging out Op-Ed articles and policy papers at her Manhattan office. "She's spending a lot of time behind her laptop," said Cristina Page, an aide at the Lieutenant Governor's office. "She usually spends her day with me in the office."
As Ms. McCaughey Ross, who was plucked from political obscurity by Mr. Pataki in 1994 after writing several highly critical articles about President Clinton's health care plan, put it, "I'm not a typical career street politician."
Her demeanor is not that of a desperate campaigner but of a beatific crusader. She, too, has adopted only a few issues: reproductive rights; the expansion of the state's prescription drug program for the elderly, and explaining to Congress, the public and anyone who will listen why the Republican Congress should not impeach Mr. Clinton. ("I'm a constitutional scholar," she says in explaining the issue's relevance to her.)
When Ms. McCaughey Ross does venture out, it is often unclear -- even to her own aides -- whether her appearances are as Lieutenant Governor or as a candidate. Last week, for instance, she visited a Chinese-American health care clinic, debated Dick Morris, a former presidential adviser, on the President's travails and showed up on a Saturday morning at 8:30 in a black suit and pearls to support a Brooklyn abortion clinic regularly visited by anti-abortion protesters.
In part, the blurring of lines is a practical matter. As her campaign spokesman, Kevin Davitt, put it, "Frankly, she has a little more oomph as Lieutenant Governor" on the issues. "Our problem is we're not as -- how shall we put it -- desirable as we were during the primary," Mr. Davitt said.
While Ms. McCaughey Ross was one of the political dignitaries in last week's Yankee parade -- riding alone in a convertible -- she did not share the dais with the Governor and Mr. Vallone, the Speaker of the City Council. (The Governor and the Lieutenant Governor essentially stopped speaking several years ago.)
Her campaign has fallen to the Liberal Party and its chairman, Raymond B. Harding. His party cast its lot with Ms. McCaughey Ross in part because her husband had pledged several million dollars to her campaign. When he withdrew the bulk of that support less than two weeks before the primary, all bets were off, and the pressure was on Mr. Harding to raise enough cash to run something of a campaign.
"It is the first time the Liberal Party has had the 'privilege' of having to not only run the campaign but worry about the fund-raising angle of it," Mr. Harding said. Mr. Harding is a close mayoral ally and a partner in the lobbying firm of Fischbein Badillo Wagner Harding and among the friends and clients he has tapped are some, like Donald Trump and David C. Walentas, the developers, whose real estate concerns are likely to be affected by the city.
Mr. Harding has raised enough money to get some television ads featuring Ms. McCaughey Ross on the air, and he says he is confident that the Liberal Party will win enough votes to secure its future.
Ms. McCaughey Ross said she was uncertain about her future past election day, but she said that another gubernatorial campaign was possible although she did not specify a party. Many politicians and analysts believe it is unlikely, after the events of this year, that she will ever again be a major party candidate for either party.
The future of Mr. Golisano's party, which he founded about four years ago, seems assured as well, which he says is partly the reason he ran. The Independence Party now has 122,172 registered members. (The Liberal Party has 92,498 members, and the Conservative Party, 166,985.)
"We're creating permanent competition with the Independence Party," Mr. Golisano said. "With competition, the consumer wins."
Consciously or not, Mr. Golisano is also building his business: while he has spent millions of his own money, he and Paychex have also earned millions in free publicity. But Mr. Golisano said that the attention in New York State would not have a significant impact on his nationwide business.
Will he run again? "I'm certainly going to keep an open mind to it," Mr. Golisano said, "and I'm going to be very active in the next four years. There are some issues I still want to work on."
Chief among them, he said, is campaign finance reform. If he had another way of reaching voters, he said, like debates or free air time or public financing, he would have preferred to give the $13 million or so to charity.
"I wish we could take the money out of the campaigns," Mr. Golisano said. "Peter Vallone might have had a better chance."

Brazil Plans $80 Billion In Cuts and Tax Increases
The Brazilian Government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso detailed a three-year, $80 billion package of spending cuts and tax increases in a bid to restore the nation's flagging credibility in world markets and prepare the way for a rescue program led by the International Monetary Fund.
United States officials reacted cautiously, and international investors warned that the measures could easily stall in the Brazilian Congress. The blueprint calls for $23.5 billion in savings for 1999, with about $11 billion of that amount coming from tax increases and $7 billion from Federal spending cuts. Page A1.

HEADLINE: THE BIG CITY;
Vacco's Ticket For a 2d Term: Jail a Scalper

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
JERRY NAHAY always figured that he, like many of his fellow ticket scalpers, might one day play a role in the re-election campaign of a New York State attorney general. But it never occurred to him that he could be the first to go to prison in the process.
Mr. Nahay, 41, spent more than a decade running a company on West 33d Street called Tickets on Request. He and his wife, Janet Rosenblatt, sold tickets to concerts, Broadway shows and sports events. They got in trouble for charging whatever the market would bear, which makes them, depending on your viewpoint, either greedy outlaws or capitalist martyrs. 
 Unlike most states, which permit consenting adults to buy tickets the same way they buy anything else, New York prohibits brokers from charging more than 10 percent above a ticket's face value. The law appalls many economists, who say the price controls hurt consumers. But it appeals to New Yorkers who blame scalpers for profiting from inflated prices. And since scalping is one of the few crimes under the jurisdiction of the Attorney General that attracts press attraction, it has long appealed to holders of that office campaigning for re-election.
The last two Attorneys General, Robert Abrams and G. Oliver Koppell, issued a torrent of press releases heralding their crusades against scalpers, and the current officeholder, Dennis C. Vacco, went them one better. Besides fining Mr. Nahay and other ticket brokers for the misdemeanor of overcharging, Mr. Vacco singled out Mr. Nahay for the first felony prosecution.
The Attorney General used a legal strategy that could be described, depending on your viewpoint, either as creative or Kafkaesque. He charged Mr. Nahay with a crime no one knew existed.
The "crime" was failing to collect the sales tax on the surcharges Mr. Nahay added, which in some cases, as with Knicks tickets, was as much as 500 percent. This tax has never been collected even by law-abiding brokers -- who limit markups to 10 percent -- because the surcharge was considered a service charge exempt from tax.
The Attorney General, however, persuaded a judge to apply a different standard to Mr. Nahay. Acting Justice Carol Berkman of State Supreme Court ruled that a surcharge below 10 percent was exempt, but a surcharge above that was taxable. Her opinion did not elucidate how she came to this distinction, or how anyone else could have been expected to divine it.
In August, Mr. Nahay and his wife were convicted on two felony counts of tax evasion, which carry a maximum sentence of four years in prison. So far they are still at large -- the prosecution's request that they be jailed immediately upon conviction was denied -- while they await sentencing and proceed with appeals.
THEIR conviction mystified state legislators, who have been considering a bill to impose sales taxes on ticket surcharges. Assemblyman Steven Sanders wrote in support of the Nahays. "Frankly," he wrote, "I was amazed to learn of their conviction of an offense which has not yet been enacted into law."
The Attorney General says his novel approach is necessary because mere fines aren't enough to deter criminals like Mr. Nahay. "The resounding verdict in this case," he said in a press release announcing Mr. Nahay's conviction, "signals our increasing success in pursuing felony charges against ticket chiselers."
As a result of Mr. Vacco's crusade, Mr. Nahay now commutes from his Upper East Side home to his company's new office in New Jersey, where dozens of brokers have fled to escape New York's price controls. Mr. Nahay's move to North Bergen, aside from making it more convenient for New Jerseyans to buy tickets to Broadway shows and Knicks games, has cost New York six jobs and the corporate taxes that he formerly paid in the city.
"I would have been happy to pay sales taxes in New York, too, if anybody had told me to," Mr. Nahay said. "I knew Vacco was looking for ink, but I never imagined he'd invent a felony charge to throw us in jail. In any other industry I'd be considered a good businessman, but instead I get my life turned upside down by the government."
Mr. Nahay, who says the case has cost him $250,000, had been looking forward to revenge next Tuesday: voting against Mr. Vacco. But this week he gave that up. "My lawyer just told me that I can't legally vote," he said yesterday. "I'm now a convicted felon."

HEADLINE: Space Aging

 BODY:
It is hard to recapture, so long after the event, what a galvanizing effect John Glenn's first ride into orbit had on an apprehensive nation. In the years before that triumph, Americans had been plunged into self-doubt by the Soviet Union's success in orbiting an unmanned Sputnik satellite and then two Russian cosmonauts while a succession of American rockets exploded or misfired. Then, on Feb. 20, 1962, the freckle-faced, square-jawed Marine flier got America back in the space race with the nation's first manned orbital flight. A delirious public honored him with a tumultuous ticker-tape parade and canonized him as a genuine American hero whose exploits owed much to his unswerving patriotism, his enduring marriage, his deep roots in Presbyterianism and small-town America.
Now Mr. Glenn, retiring from the Senate at the age of 77, is poised to mount again into the heavens, this time as a lowly payload specialist on today's scheduled flight of the space shuttle Discovery. Instead of piloting the spaceship, he will serve as a guinea pig for medical tests to determine the effects of weightlessness on an aging body. But neither his duties nor his low crew ranking will have much to do with how anyone views a flight that long ago became known as The John Glenn Flight, a testament more to past eminence than present value. 
 There is something a little sad -- even desperate -- about all the hoopla surrounding this otherwise unremarkable flight. It is as if a nation that no longer has Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa to cheer on seems determined to wallow in nostalgia while Mr. Glenn and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration try to rekindle past glories. But this is a flight that will not probe much further into the unknown than Mr. Glenn did the first time around 36 years ago. The spacecraft he will ride in is bigger and a lot more complex technologically. But it will still be flying in low Earth orbit, the cheaper arena to which the space agency repaired after the successful Moon landings vanquished the Soviet space program once and for all.
Most conspicuously missing this time around will be that galvanizing sense of mission. NASA's truly riveting explorations these days are its unmanned probes of other planets. But its troubled manned space program is now remembered less for the image of American astronauts planting a flag on the Moon than for a teacher and her fellow crew members perishing in the Challenger explosion. The centerpiece of today's manned program, the international space station, is behind schedule and over budget, its progress threatened by Russia's economic troubles. Meanwhile, the space shuttles have flown intermittently, raising concerns that safety margins are eroding.
No wonder the space agency, and presumably the White House as well, were willing to let Mr. Glenn cap his career with one last victory lap. To be sure, officials have clapped a veneer of scientific justification on his participation, but that veneer is looking even thinner now that he has failed to qualify for what was billed as one of the more important tests to be performed on him.
The greater meaning of this flight has nothing to do with research or even with space. Rather it is the dramatic symbolism of a robust, healthy senior citizen shaping his own destiny. This old space warrior refused to exit quietly. Instead he kept nagging and nagging until he bent the space bureaucracy, and his own family, to acquiesce in his dream for one more flight. Few senior citizens can exert the political clout of a John Glenn to achieve their goals, but the relaunching of this space-age icon is being taken -- indeed, seized upon -- as a symbol of what a growing cohort of energetic seniors can achieve if their aspirations and capabilities are honored. The irony of this much-ballyhooed flight is that it may do more to combat ageism on the ground than to register new triumphs in space.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE RECORD;
Two Patakis: In 4 Years, Governor Has Pushed Issues Both Conservative and Moderate

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
When asked to assess George E. Pataki's record as Governor, Tom Carroll, president of the conservative group Change-NY, asked: "Which one? The Pataki of the first two years or the Pataki of the second two years?"
On a host of issues, like state spending, education and health care, there is a sharp difference between the conservative Republican Governor who took office promising to shrink government, and the moderate Mr. Pataki now running for re-election. But on what his aides say are his core issues, like tax cuts and crime, the Governor has been fairly consistent. 
 Here is a look at Mr. Pataki's record on key issues.
 
Taxes, Spending and the Economy
The signal claim of this administration is, as Mr. Pataki puts it, that "we have led the nation in cutting taxes every single year." In this respect, the Governor has been a striking success.
He cut the state income tax 25 percent, though his original plan favored the wealthy much more than the one eventually agreed to by Democrats in the Legislature. He won a 27 percent reduction by 2002 in property taxes charged by local school districts. Again, Democrats forced changes in his plan, which did not benefit New York City, securing a 10 percent cut in the city income tax.
In the last two years, the Governor signed into law cuts including those in estate taxes, business taxes and the sales tax on clothing. All told, he has enacted $12 billion a year in tax cuts. But despite the cuts and Mr. Pataki's reputation as a fiscal conservative, he has increased state spending at double the rate of inflation.
In his first two years, he held spending nearly flat, eliminating 20,000 state jobs, to close a $5 billion projected deficit, and to pay for the income tax cuts. But state revenues soared, thanks to the booming financial markets, and over the ensuing two years the Governor increased spending. The current $71.4 billion budget is 15 percent larger than the $62 billion one he inherited.
The state's debts have grown rapidly, continuing a trend that began in the mid-1980's. Debt repaid out of the budget rose from $28 billion to $35 billion under Mr. Pataki, and debts incurred by the state's public authorities climbed even faster.
Independent monitors have expressed alarm, saying that rising spending and debt, plus promised tax cuts, are bound to produce a crisis within a few years.
The Governor has done a great deal to improve conditions for business -- including cutting business taxes, granting tax breaks and cutting unemployment and workers' compensation premiums more than 30 percent. But it is not clear what effect that has had on the state's economy.
 
Crime
Mr. Pataki has been more consistent -- and consistently conservative -- on crime than on any other major issue.
In 1995, he signed a law reinstating the death penalty and creating a sentence of life in prison without parole. He won longer sentences and strict limits on parole for violent felons, and construction of a maximum-security prison. The only major change he sought without success was tougher penalties for juveniles.
The Governor ended college-level classes for prison inmates and curtailed work-release programs. And his administration began housing inmates two to a cell. Prison reform groups contend such changes make prisons more dangerous and leave inmates less prepared for release.
Mr. Pataki has made treatment available as an alternative to prison for some drug crimes, though the program is small in scope. But while he has talked about easing the state's harsh drug-possession laws, he has not made a proposal.
He claims some of the credit for the steep drop in crime, though it began before he took office and is concentrated in New York City, where most experts credit changes in police strategy.
 
Welfare
On welfare, Mr. Pataki has moved from the political fringe to the center, without changing his basic views.
For two years, he tried unsuccessfully to force dramatic changes in the system, and Democrats attacked him as a right-wing ideologue. But the new Federal welfare law enacted many of the changes he had sought, like time limits and work requirements for benefits.
At the same time, Mr. Pataki retreated from the more draconian aspects of his plan. Instead of simply abolishing Home Relief, the welfare program for childless adults, he replaced it with a less-generous Safety Net program. He also changed the law to allow recipients to earn some money without losing benefits.
But Mr. Pataki saw to it that unlike many states, New York does not apply college or job-training classes toward work requirements.
Since Mr. Pataki took office, New York's welfare rolls have shrunk by 570,000 people. Much of the drop has occurred because local governments, armed with changes the Governor made in state policy, have become more aggressive about cutting off benefits and denying new benefits.
 
Education
No area offers a sharper contrast between the two halves of Mr. Pataki's term.
In 1995 and 1996, he attempted to cut state aid to schools, but in the last two years, following the Legislature's lead, he agreed to increases. He also agreed to Democrats' plans to sharply increase spending on school construction, expand kindergarten and pre-kindergarten programs, and reduce elementary class sizes.
At the college level, Mr. Pataki raised tuition at the State and City Universities by 30 percent in 1995, and lowered financial aid. He proposed further tuition increases in 1996 and 1997, which were beaten back by the Legislature. And he sharply cut aid to public colleges, forcing them to cut teaching staffs.
But this year, the Governor embarked on a $3 billion, six-year capital program for public colleges. He also played a major role in the City University's decision this year to end open admissions.
 
Health Care
Mr. Pataki's term began with pitched battles with health care advocates, but he has won over many of them as his policies have evolved.
In his first three years, he proposed sharp reductions in Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, cuts that health care advocates said would bankrupt hospitals. He also tried, without success, to eliminate the state's AIDS research institute.
The Legislature refused most of the cuts, but there were significant reductions in Medicaid. This year, for the first time, Mr. Pataki did not propose serious cuts in health care.
The Governor says his proudest achievement in health care was ending state regulation of hospital prices, which he says will promote competition and innovation.
Again, opponents in the hospital industry predicted chaos from his original plan. So Mr. Pataki agreed to maintain financing for medical schools and care for the poor, and to include money for retraining thousands of laid-off hospital workers.
Advocates who criticize some of the Governor's moves praise others, like the enactment of one of the nation's most comprehensive "bills of rights" for patients of health maintenance organizations. In 1996, Mr. Pataki greatly expanded the state's health care program for poor children. This year, with more Federal money forthcoming, he initially proposed a bare-bones package of benefits, but eventually agreed to a program that children's advocates called the most generous in the nation.
 
Environment
More than any other group of issue advocates, environmentalists are torn over Mr. Pataki's record. Some praise him, others berate him and others do both, often in the same breath.
The Governor is committed to preserving wild lands, and much of his $1.75 billion environmental bond act in 1996 went to buy wilderness acreage.
Mr. Pataki has fought for some clean-air causes, as well. He has pushed a recalcitrant Metropolitan Transportation Authority into buying natural gas-powered buses. And this year he signed a law making heavy trucks subject to annual inspections and maintenance. He has done significant work on preserving water quality, with money from the bond act going to clean lakes and rivers and improve sewage treatment.
But critics say that when environmental goals run up against corporate interests, Mr. Pataki goes soft.
In policing corporate polluters, the Department of Environmental Conservation has cut enforcement actions, clean-up orders and fines by about half in the last four years. In 1995 and 1996, the Environmental Protection Agency repeatedly criticized the department's enforcement of clean-air laws on smokestack industry.
The administration sharply reduced the much-lauded energy conservation program after industries protested helping pay for it. And while Mr. Pataki has taken steps to develop parks along the Hudson River, environmentalists complain that he has not tried to force General Electric to remove PCB's it dumped there.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
BRAZIL INTRODUCES $80 BILLION PLAN FOR ECONOMIC ILLS

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Oct. 28

 BODY:
The Brazilian Government introduced a three-year, $80 billion package of spending cuts and tax increases today in an effort to restore the country's flagging credibility in world markets and prepare the way for a rescue program led by the International Monetary Fund.
The plan calls for $23.5 billion in savings in 1999, with about $11 billion coming from tax increases and $7 billion from spending cuts. The rest is to come from pension and fundamental financial changes. Part of the plan sets up controversial mechanisms to force states and municipalities to limit spending. 
 "The time has come for us to make government live within its limits -- with clarity, conscience and determination," Finance Minister Pedro Malan said, elaborating on themes that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso raised in a televised speech Tuesday night, bracing Brazilians for the austerity measures. "The time for gradualism is over."
The blueprint was anxiously awaited by investors and United States policy makers who fear that the collapse of the country's financial system could set off defaults and devaluations across Latin America, worsening a broader crisis and threatening stronger economies.
Washington's response to Brazil's action today was congratulatory but also cautionary, reflecting concerns that the program could flounder when it reaches the Brazilian Congress.
Some economists said the austerity plan and the I.M.F. bailout package might not be sufficient to pull Brazil out of its financial crisis. Economic Scene, page C2.
Investors reacted warily, and said the measures did not go as far as they hoped in making structural changes to permanently reduce Brazil's burgeoning budget deficit, which is now running at 7 percent of the gross national product. In Sao Paulo, Brazil's financial center, the benchmark stock index fell 42.63 points, or five-eighths of a percent today, to 6,826.51.
Jorge Mariscal, chief investment strategist for Latin America of Goldman, Sachs & Company, said, "It's a step in the right direction, but if you think of Brazil climbing a wall of disbelief, this is just a few inches up."
The giant of South America, with half the continent's population and the world's ninth-largest economy, Brazil has been the focus of world attention since the collapse in Russian finances two months ago. Interest rates for Brazilian debt doubled, and the country began using up roughly $30 billion of its foreign-currency reserves.
The International Monetary Fund, along with other lending agencies, and officials in Washington have been preparing a safety net for Brazil of at least $30 billion, with President Clinton prepared to commit American taxpayer dollars as part of a package of direct aid from the Group of Seven industrial nations.
In a statement after the plan was detailed today, Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin said, "It is essential that Brazil implement its program promptly and convincingly."
That message was reinforced, a White House official said, in a brief conversation between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Cardoso. Mr. Clinton, the official said, was returning a call Mr. Cardoso placed several days ago to congratulate the American President on the Middle East agreement, But Mr. Clinton's underlying message was that Brazil had to act quickly.
United States officials have made no secret of their exasperation at Brazil's slowness to act, leaving the country vulnerable, in their view, to another market upheaval.
Mr. Clinton, though, reportedly made no reference to an American contribution to an I.M.F.-led rescue package. Brazilian officials said they would travel to Washington to discuss the plan with I.M.F. officials by next week. Today, a spokesman for the fund said the plan represented "important progress in the implementation of Brazil's stabilization and reform program, which will be supported by the I.M.F. and other members of the international community."
Party leaders of President Cardoso's governing coalition, who learned details of the plan over breakfast with Mr. Cardoso and Finance Minister Malan today, did not rule out tinkering with some of its more controversial elements, but pledged to maintain the savings targets the Government would promise to the I.M.F.
"The measures are bitter measures, but in our view they're extremely necessary," said Aecio Neves, leader in the lower house of Congress of the President's Brazilian Social Democracy Party, which relies on five allied parties to form its majority. "The governing coalition has an enormous responsibility to overcome this moment of instability," he said.
With this sudden sense of urgency and national mission, few in the President's governing coalition were willing to openly challenge the austerity package. But many raised objections to specific elements, and said there could be alternatives offered for debate in coming weeks.
Among the most difficult items to pass, congressional leaders said, would be a requirement that retired public workers contribute to the Social Security coffers, with contributions of 11 percent to 20 percent of their benefits. The austerity package also increases the contribution of public workers to Social Security, and would introduce a minimum age for retirement of civil servants, which does not currently exist.
The Social Security system for public workers in Brazil is far more generous than that in the United States. Civil servants here retire with full salaries, according to time served, without regard to their age.
"Reduction of expenses and the increase of tax collection, it's an indigestible cocktail for any congress in the world," said Geddel Vieira Lima, leader of a Government-allied party. "But we know the moment we're living through, and that we have to show the world we're capable of doing what's necessary to address our problems."
The package also calls for the extension of several taxes that were originally passed as temporary measures several years ago. Under one, the emergency stabilization fund, the national Government impounds 20 percent of all taxes destined for state and local governments. The package proposes doubling the amount impounded to 40 percent and extending the life of the fund, which was to have expired in 1999, to 2006.
It will also double a tax on financial transfers.
Senator Fernando Bezerra, president of Brazil's National Confederation of Industry, said today that the tax increases would have "a very negative impact on national production."
But the Government justified the measures as necessary to relieve a credit squeeze and bring down interest rates, which are now running above 40 percent.
The austerity package also calls on Congress to require states to limit spending on active and retired employees to 60 percent of their budgets, at the same time cutting the resources available by impounding some tax revenue.
It is by no means sure, however, that fiscal discipline can successfully be imposed on state and city governments by fiat. Anthony Garotinho, who was elected governor of Rio de Janeiro state on Sunday, said today, "Does the Government expect us to make miracles?" He noted that Rio, which is seeking a $300 million loan from the national Government, is responsible like other states for providing basic services including education, health and security.
"I was elected to be a governor, not a magician," Mr. Garotinho said.
Mr. Mariscal of Goldman, Sachs also called the impoundment fund's extension "another negative," and said: "Brazil is in the mess it's in because it has too much debt, too many employees and too high a Social Security deficit. It's an issue of spending too much and lowering the debt, and everything else is peripheral."
Lawrence Goodman, chief economist at Santander Investment Securities, called the package "mildly favorable regarding the potential for an ongoing 'muddling through' scenario."
This week marks the year anniversary of the last package Mr. Cardoso announced, with much fanfare. That plan, intended to raise $18 billion and hailed then as a great show of decisiveness, was substantially passed by Congress. But the only measures that were carried out involved raising taxes, not cutting cutting costs.
"Brazil will remain captive to a $300 billion domestic debt that is extraordinarily short term in nature, which is one of the paramount issues coming out of the Asia crisis," Mr. Goodman said.
On Thursday, Mr. Malan and other officials are to testify on the austerity package before Congress, which is to begin action, starting with Social Security changes, next week.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE INCUMBENT;
Pataki Defies Expectations And Becomes Quiet Force

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
It was the most indelible image of the 1994 gubernatorial campaign: a newspaper photograph of George E. Pataki being led, literally by the hand, through a crowded fund-raising dinner by his political patron, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
Mr. Pataki's opponent, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, seized on the picture, using it in television ads, as Democrats derided the Republican candidate as "an empty suit," the puppet on Mr. D'Amato's string. Mr. Pataki contributed to the image of himself as a cipher, running on a rail-thin platform of cutting taxes and restoring the death penalty, assiduously avoiding saying what else he would do if elected. Critics in both parties predicted that he would not amount to much. 
 They were wrong. The candidate may have seemed like little more than the anti-Cuomo, but he was being quintessentially himself. Mr. Pataki has made a career of being underestimated, and a habit of defying expectations. And in the four years since that day, he has done just that, with considerable success.
Helped substantially by a cooperating economy, he has emerged as a shrewd political operator. He grappled successfully with the Legislature on issues like crime and spending, and now is expected to win re-election easily -- no small feat for a Republican in a heavily Democratic state. He is even mentioned as a possible candidate for national office in 2000.
"He is a far, far better politician than people expected," said Gerald Benjamin, dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the State University of New York at New Paltz, who closely studies state government.
In large measure, the Governor has surprised people by giving them very little idea of what he aims to do, beyond one or two themes of his choosing. Keeping expectations at a minimum consistently allows him to defy or exceed them. And as with another Republican, Ronald Reagan, the fuzziness in Mr. Pataki's public positions, once seen as a great weakness, has made him adept at getting his way on some issues, while continually repositioning himself to his advantage on others.
Four years ago, Mr. Pataki was widely painted as an arch-conservative -- a view that helped prompt his fellow Republican, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, to endorse Mr. Cuomo. But he has since crafted a more moderate image, especially in the second half of his term. He healed the political wounds he suffered from his early budget cuts with later spending increases. His 1996 environmental bond act seized the initiative on an issue that Democrats had long thought of as theirs alone. And he has cultivated at least a tenuous alliance with the mercurial Mr. Giuliani.
To his allies, that adaptability is the Governor's wily way of getting what he wants. To Democrats, it proves that he lacks any real convictions beyond his own political advancement. But these days, even those Democrats will admit with frustration that there is something, however opaque, inside that gray flannel suit.
"People badly underestimated him all around," said State Senator Martin Connor of Brooklyn, leader of the Senate's Democratic minority. "But I don't think anyone does still."
 
Consistent Strategy: Saying Less Is Better
By 1994, New Yorkers had wearied of Mr. Cuomo, the protean figure with the mile-wide agenda. Mr. Pataki made the shrewd calculation that not being Mario Cuomo was enough to get elected, and that the less he signaled of his views the better. That strategy of sticking to a few simple themes is a trademark of Mr. Pataki's campaign consultant, Arthur Finkelstein, and the candidate was seen as following someone else's script. But he has governed in much the same way. He has taken positions on a wide range of issues, but often quietly, and often only when he had to. He changes positions and adopts his adversaries' ideas as his own. And he has made a virtue of evading questions and issues, sticking to his chosen answers -- or non-answers -- with the discipline of a monk. It seems as if he sees any strong stance as a threat to distract and entangle him.
Even as he campaigns for re-election, he says almost nothing about his plans for a second term.
"It's conscious in the sense that I want to be free to look at those issues that are critical in January of 1999, as opposed to saying, in October of '98, that X, Y or Z is going to happen, because I'm very, very committed to doing what I said," Mr. Pataki said.
His evasions are often inelegant, and if that hurts his standing with reporters, he clearly does not care, confident that voters will not, either.
In February, Mr. Pataki had an audition of sorts with the national press corps, a breakfast with reporters in Washington, and said he knew nothing about the McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill that was consuming much of the capital's energy. His performance was widely derided by newspaper columnists and his fellow politicians as disingenuous, amateurish, or both. How could a Governor be so ignorant of a major, much publicized piece of legislation on a critical issue? Turns out he was not: He had discussed the issue with reporters just a few weeks earlier. But he clearly did not want to be drawn into a discussion of it with Washington journalists.
In the last month, with Democrats promoting similar campaign finance bills for New York State, Mr. Pataki was asked about the subject several times more. He said he had some thoughts that he did not want to make public, that his views remained uncertain, and as to the Federal bill, "I still don't know the details." When he was needled about the abuse he took for such responses in February, his only reply was a lopsided grin.
It is his history of elusive adaptability that leads Mr. Pataki's detractors to say he makes his decisions based primarily on political gain.
"He sees the future very well in political terms, which is why he's been all over the lot, from moderate to hard-right-winger," said Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat. "What was it Gertrude Stein said? 'There's no there there.' "
 
Stubborn Ferocity On Some Core Issues
When the people closest to him are asked what matters most to the Governor, though, they give remarkably similar answers.
"There is a core group of issues," said Zenia Mucha, Mr. Pataki's campaign manager. "Reducing taxes, preserving the environment, fighting crime, allowing business to flourish. And he knows that if you focus on a few things, you can get them done."
Even his adversaries concede that the Governor has been singularly effective in those areas. He lacks the soaring rhetoric of Mr. Cuomo, or the empathic touch of Bill Clinton, but makes up for it with a stubborn ferocity that has surprised those who took his laconic style as the key to the real man.
In 1995, he pushed through a 25 percent income tax cut he had promised as a candidate, despite a $5 billion deficit that would have provided ample cover for delay. To balance the budget, he cut spending on health care, mass transit and education, over fierce protests. When the economy rebounded, the Governor was able to reverse many of his earlier budget cuts, even as he basked in the popularity of the tax cuts.
In 1996, to the astonishment of Republicans and Democrats in the Legislature, Mr. Pataki held up the state budget for three months in a pitched fight over the arcane issue of worker's compensation insurance. He won changes that lowered employers' premiums more than 30 percent.
The Governor has also shown a talent for casting issues to his advantage. This year, he seized on the case of a young woman who was murdered, Jenna Grieshaber, to give emotional resonance to his call to end parole for violent felons. He used the pulpit of the State of the State message to promote the idea, and enlisted Ms. Grieshaber's parents as allies. He kept up a relentless drumbeat until the Assembly Democrats succumbed and passed it in July.
 
Using Flexibility To His Advantage
If Mr. Pataki's tenacity on issues like crime and taxes has been striking, so has his flexibility on nearly everything else.
Four years ago, he attacked Mr. Cuomo for proposing a state takeover of the troubled Long Island Lighting Company. This year, Mr. Pataki completed a state takeover of the company, cutting electric rates on the island by 20 percent. And as part of the deal, every residence and business received a rebate check of $101 to $232, just in time for the coming election.
Mr. Pataki made deep spending cuts his first two years in office, then allowed spending to grow rapidly the next two years. The turnabout was made possible by a growing economy and a roaring stock market, but it has also helped him remake his image as a moderate.
There is a string of issues on which Mr. Pataki decided that his goal was not important enough to wage a serious fight, or that the political price of the fray would be too high.
In last year's struggle over the future of rent controls, the Governor agreed with the Senate's Republican majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, that the restrictions should be eliminated. But while Mr. Bruno railed against the evils of the system, the Governor said barely a word for months, playing the neutral arbiter. Then he proposed phasing out the controls, but abandoned the idea when it proved unpopular. Finally, he brokered a deal that kept the controls largely in place, and claimed victory.
The Governor favors legalization of casino gambling, a ban on discrimination against lesbians and gay men, and softening of the state's harsh drug-possession laws, but he has not worked at getting them past a resistant Senate. Democrats note that if he pushed harder on such issues, he would incur the wrath of Republican conservatives around the country as he considers a run for national office in 2000.
"I think he tries to have it both ways on issues, and he does it fairly skillfully," said Judith Hope, chairwoman of the state Democratic Party. "He robes himself in moderate positions but doesn't lift a finger to advance them. There's a right-wing drummer offstage that he can hear, that the rest of us are unaware of. I think his core issue is becoming President of the United States."
 
A Bland Manner Belies a Bold Rise
The Governor asserts that there is a philosophical constant running through his policies, one that explains positions as diverse as his support for abortion rights and his insistence that welfare recipients work for benefits. "Giving people more opportunity, more freedom, more confidence in the future, and at the same time, requiring responsibility of people," is the way he puts it.
Those views, he says, are the self-reliant legacy of his father, Louis, the son of Hungarian immigrants who worked as a mailman and operated a small fruit and vegetable farm in Peekskill.
Recalling his undergraduate days as a small-town boy at Yale, the Governor said that too many people believe wrongly that government makes better decisions for people than they make for themselves. "You'd meet people who would look down on the average worker, those on the right and those on the left who would look down on the average worker," he said. "And I would sit there and think that average worker is my father."
The opacity that makes the Governor hard to pin down politically applies to him personally, too.
Mr. Pataki is an avid reader, mostly of history and other non-fiction, who has a taste for fine food and French wine. He can be an energetic storyteller, and occasionally gives vent to a serious temper. A fervent outdoorsman, he can wax rhapsodic on hiking and snowshoeing, avocations that animate his desire to preserve wild lands.
Most New Yorkers, though, see none of this. In public, his enthusiasm, sophistication, ambition and intelligence are shrouded behind a bland, plain-spoken manner.
Privately, he is a sharp political analyst, but when asked to share such insights for the record -- Does talk of impeaching President Clinton hurt Senator D'Amato's chances for re-election? How does the 2000 Presidential race shape up? -- he likes to say, "You'll have to ask the political people," as if he were not one.
He and his wife, Libby, have been careful to shield their private lives and those of their four children, ages 19 to 11, from public scrutiny. They did not move into the Governor's mansion in Albany, opting instead to remain in their home a couple of hours south, in Garrison. And reporters who cover the Governor's doings every day were unaware until recently that his mother, Margaret, had moved in with the family after the death of his father, Louis, two and a half years ago.
Mr. Pataki's demeanor is relaxed and genial, yet his resume is studded with bold, successful challenges to incumbents -- for mayor of Peekskill, for Assembly, for State Senate, and for governor.
"Here's a guy who'd like to give the image he's sort of listless, and yet he went from being an Assemblyman in the minority party to being Governor in a little over two years," said one of his top aides.
Some of his closest advisers say they have urged him, at times, to loosen up in public, to no avail. One said: "I'm not sure he's a guy that thinks it's to his advantage to have people know him too much. He never tips his hand."
In 1994 and 1995, many Democrats questioned the Governor's intelligence. It was always an odd view to have of a graduate of Yale, who made law review at Columbia and worked for a prestigious Wall Street firm.
No one in Albany doubts Mr. Pataki's intellect any longer, but some Democrats still question his work habits, noting that unlike Mr. Cuomo, he does not routinely work marathon days, or feel compelled to master every issue. Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Assembly Speaker -- who declined to be interviewed for this article -- once described the Governor as "lazy."
But people in and out of government who have worked with him often describe him as a quick study who is better-informed than they expected.
Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, clashed with the Governor early in his term, and thought then that Mr. Pataki did not know or care about health care policy. "Now," he said, "you can have a serious conversation with him on all these issues."
Mr. Pataki adds to the impression that he is not breaking a sweat by placing great faith and authority in his top policy advisers.
"He's very good at determining who can do what, and he's secure enough to let them go and do it," said one of those aides, Louis R. Tomson, the secretary for public authorities. "He doesn't mind if delegating authority means people still underestimate him. They do it at their peril."

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: KENTUCKY;
Fierce Opponents Go Down to the Wire

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: PAINTSVILLE, Ky., Oct. 28

 BODY:
Here in the hills of eastern Kentucky, where Loretta Lynn grew up as a coal miner's daughter, the politicians are talking this fall about "a turnout election." You hear the same phrase in Louisville and Paducah, and in Wisconsin, New York and North Carolina -- everywhere there is a close race for state or Federal office.
It is the cliche of the year, like "Year of the Woman" in 1992. "Tell me who's going to show up at the polls next Tuesday," said Representative Jim Bunning, the Republican nominee in this state's nasty, down-to-the-wire Senate contest, "and I'll tell you who's going to win." 
 Predicting the turnout in midterm elections is never easy, but the professionals find it harder than ever this time. The impeachment proceedings against President Clinton provide the added imponderable. Will Democrats stay home, or will they turn out to register their anger against Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, and the Republicans in Congress?
The importance of those questions was vividly illustrated in a poll published in today's Courier-Journal in Louisville. It showed Mr. Bunning trailing his Democratic rival, Representative Scotty Baesler, by a statistically insignificant 44-to-43 margin among registered voters who said they were likely to go to the polls but leading him once the sample was corrected to reflect recent turnout patterns.
Kentucky's Senate race is one of the half-dozen or so close contests that will collectively determine whether the Republicans have the 60 votes they will need in the next two years to cut off debate.
In addition, the House seats Mr. Bunning and Mr. Baesler are giving up are among the most hotly disputed in the nation. Ken Lucas, a Democrat, leads in the race for Mr. Bunning's seat, although Mr. Bunning's name atop the ticket may help the Republican, Gex Williams, to pull through. Ernest Fletcher, a Republican, is favored in the contest for Mr. Baesler's seat, but turnout is a major question in that race, too.
At a get-out-the-vote rally on Tuesday night in Louisville's old Union Station, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat, accused the Republicans of plotting to keep people at home on Election Day.
"They're running a negative campaign," Mr. Biden said, "because the more negative, the more visceral the campaign, the more people turn off, especially women. If only the most motivated voters show up, the Republicans win."
The Republicans, of course, deny an effort to suppress turnout. Indeed, they blame Mr. Baesler for slinging the first mud in a campaign that has more than lived up to this state's tradition of political brawling. But when Mr. Bunning's campaign coordinator, Kyle Simmons, heard the results of the Courier poll, he reacted by saying, "Hope it rains."
Although a Democratic House candidate in the Louisville area has run advertisements criticizing Republicans for authorizing an open-ended investigation of Mr. Clinton, neither Senate candidate has tackled the impeachment issue on television. One top strategist said it was "too hot, too volatile and too unpredictable to touch with a 50-foot pole."
Ron McCloud, the state Democratic chairman, said he thought "the way the Republicans in Washington beat up on Clinton has energized some of my people, got them stirred up to work and vote, which is often a problem for us." Overwhelmingly Democratic in registration, Kentucky regularly elects Republicans to top offices because Democrats break ranks or stay home.
"It's turnout, it's turnout, it's turnout," Mr. McCloud said. "I hope we've learned from 1994. If a few more Democrats in key places had voted, we might have had Dick Gephardt instead of Newt Gingrich as Speaker."
Mark Mellman, a pollster for Mr. Baesler and other Democrats, said he expected a continuation of the steady decline in national turnout this year, "with more than likely an equal decline for both parties."
Curtis Gans, who heads a committee that studies voter participation, said he expected fewer than 4 registered voters in 10 to cast ballots, a new low.
Why? One big reason, Mr. Mellman said, is that "this is not an issue election, not a referendum on Clinton or the economy or anything else."
As befits a border state, Kentucky developed a two-party system earlier than states in the Deep South. John Sherman Cooper and Thruston B. Morton held Senate seats here as early as the 1950's, taking their places alongside Democratic icons like A. B. (Happy) Chandler and Alben W. Barkley, who was Harry S. Truman's Vice President.
Even in the one-party days, the state had a reputation for quarrelsome politics. Fred Vinson, a Kentucky politician who became Chief Justice of the United States, used to tell about asking a local officeholder whom he planned to support in a primary election. "I don't know yet," the officeholder replied, saying he was waiting to see what the opposition did, so he could take the other side.
Mr. Bunning and Mr. Baesler are both fiercely competitive people, with backgrounds in sports. Mr. Bunning, still lean and fit at 67, spent 17 seasons as a right-handed fireballer in the big leagues. He wears a Hall of Fame ring on his left hand. Mr. Baesler was captain in 1962 and 1963 of one of Adolph Rupp's legendary University of Kentucky basketball teams. Given basketball's status in this state as a kind of secular religion, he is even better known than his rival.
Their personalities could hardly be more different. Mr. Baesler is soft-spoken and seemingly reluctant to work a crowd. Mr. Bunning is an in-your-face sort of campaigner.
"We get along well enough," Mr. Baesler said in an interview. "We see each other on the Hill almost every day and we don't growl at each other. But he's always been a little strident. In his playing days, I guess, you knocked the other guy down with a baseball if you didn't like him. In basketball, you can't do that; you have to find a way to work around him."
Early in the campaign, Mr. Bunning ran a commercial showing Mr. Baesler making an uncharacteristically vehement speech, accompanied by Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries." The Democrats denounced the spot as an effort to suggest subliminally that their man was a Nazi, and newspapers and civic leaders joined them in issuing condemnations.
"Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd used that music, and people think it's funny," Mr. Bunning replied.
The two men have spent weeks accusing each other of lying on subjects like Social Security, health care and education, often seizing upon narrow differences and magnifying them. Mr. Baesler for example wanted to save 100 percent of the Federal surplus for Social Security, while Mr. Bunning settled for saving only 90 percent. The 10 percent difference is a big issue.
Mr. Bunning has played down issues he has used in the past like abortion and flag-burning. But his slide toward the center has been uneven. While he was portraying himself this week as the defender of Social Security and Medicare, his campaign brought Oliver L. North, a symbol of the far right, to Paintsville to campaign for him amid the Technicolor hillsides of autumn.

UNITED COMPANIES FINANCIAL TO CUT ITS BUSINESS BY 30%

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The United Companies Financial Corporation, a home mortgage and home equity lender that put itself up for sale in July, said yesterday it had failed to find a buyer and would shrink its business by 30 percent to cut costs. The company, based in Baton Rouge, La., said its board approved a plan to dismiss 1,070 employees, or more than 30 percent of its staff, and close all businesses that could not be sold except the unit that lends directly to borrowers. The plan will cost between $4 million and $6 million. The company also reported that third-quarter income from continuing operations fell 3 percent, to $25.8 million, from $26.7 million in the period a year earlier.

Strike Is Authorized By Jersey City Teachers

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
The 2,500 teachers in New Jersey's second largest school district voted yesterday to authorize a strike, the union said.
The 2,500 teachers who are members of the Jersey City Education Association have been working under terms of a contract that expired on Aug. 31, and negotiations have failed to produce agreements on raises, prescription drug co-payments and the lengths of the school day and year, Thomas J. Favia, the union president, said. Mr. Favia said about 1,800 teachers who attended a union meeting yesterday unanimously authorized the strike. 
 Mr. Favia said 25 teachers have resigned since September because of anxiety over job evaluations being conducted throughout the district, which was seized by the state in 1989 because of poor performance among its 33,000 students.
Joanne Kenny, a spokeswoman for the district, said the union is demanding raises of more than 5 percent a year, well ahead of inflation and increases granted in surrounding districts. She said Jersey City teachers without advanced degrees are paid $67,900 after 13 years, $8,000 a year more than their counterparts in Newark, the state's largest district. Ms. Kenny said that substitute teachers, aides and administrators would teach in the event of a strike.

Business Optimism Lags

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Business activity in the New York City region slowed this month and the outlook for the next six months dimmed, a survey of services and manufacturing executives showed.
The New York purchasing managers' index for October fell to 53.8 percent from 58.8 percent in September. In August, the index registered 53.5 percent. An index reading of 50 percent or more suggests the economy is expanding. The figures are adjusted for seasonal variations. 
 "The longer-term growth rate of the local economy has moderated," the report said.
Moreover, the outlook for business activity in the New York region over the next six months was less upbeat with a forward-looking index falling to 53 percent this month -- the lowest reading since the survey was started in May 1993 -- from 59.7 percent in September. An index tracking prices paid by businesses in the New York City area showed inflation is not a problem.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: ILLINOIS;
Governor's Race Lacks Fire, Hurting Democrat

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 28

 BODY:
In the vast megalopolis known here as Chicagoland, which stretches 50 miles from the high-rises along Lake Michigan to suburban cul-de-sacs, it has often been difficult to get voters interested in the political action in the Illinois Statehouse.
The capital, Springfield, in the view of many Chicagoans and suburbanites, is a place to visit Lincoln's tomb or to milk cows at the state fair. 
 The race for governor this year has done little to change that. George Ryan, the Republican, and Glenn Poshard, the Democrat -- men who have never been accused of skating on charisma -- have not managed to fan the political passions.
Lethargy bodes well for Mr. Ryan, the Secretary of State, whose Republican Party has held the governor's office for 22 years. Most surveys of likely voters give Mr. Ryan a double-digit lead, except for an anomalous poll published by The Chicago Sun-Times last week that showed the race nearly a dead heat.
Mr. Poshard, a socially conservative Congressman from Southern Illinois, has often been at odds with liberals in his party. But his problems, at least among residents of Northern Illinois, run much deeper .
"Most people had never heard of him," said Peter Nardulli, the head of the political science department at the University of Illinois.
Mr. Ryan, 64, a former pharmacist from Kankakee, an old railroad town about 45 miles south of Chicago, could walk down most Illinois streets without being widely recognized.
But his name is known everywhere. One of the perquisites of the secretary of state's office, it seems, is the right to have your signature on everything from driver's licenses to mailings on organ donation.
Mr. Ryan has also used his office to call for stricter laws on drunken driving. He takes much of the credit for the state's reducing its blood-alcohol content maximum for drivers to 0.08 percent, from 0.10 percent.
Strategists for Republicans have said they expect the race to tighten. But John Torre, a spokesman for Mr. Ryan, said the voter surveys "reflect the contentment and satisfaction that people in Illinois have with Republican leadership."
Democratic officials note that polls did not predict Mr. Poshard's victory in the primary.
The governor's job has long been regarded as political second banana to that of the mayor of Chicago, at least from the view here, where City Hall looms as the real locus of power.
The city has lost plenty of its influence to the suburbs, which now cast 40 percent of the state's vote. And Mr. Ryan has been able to portray himself as the sort of moderate who plays well in the suburbs, running television advertisements that emphasize his support for gun control.
Democrats, who have been out of the governor's office since 1976, had high hopes this political season. They saw Mr. Ryan, who won the Republican primary without serious opposition, as a much weaker opponent than Gov. Jim Edgar, a popular moderate who is retiring from politics, partly for health reasons.
Mr. Ryan was seen as vulnerable for his opposition to abortion, as well as his crucial role as speaker of the Illinois House in 1976 in defeating the Equal Rights Amendment.
But when Democrats nominated Mr. Poshard, who has a more conservative record on social issues than Mr. Ryan has, the Republican was able to cast himself as the more enlightened candidate. Mr. Ryan, for example, sent representatives of his campaign to appear at the gay pride parade in Chicago, while Mr. Poshard skipped the event.
The campaign of Mr. Poshard, who has said he will not accept money from political action committees, has appeared star-crossed. A scandal tied to Mr. Ryan's state office, involving workers accused of taking bribes has failed to help him.
Scott Lassar, the United States Attorney in Chicago, has said workers in a driver license office took $150,000 in bribes to give trucker licenses. Federal agents also say that some of that money ended up in a campaign fund for Mr. Ryan. The prosecutor has said Mr. Ryan is not a target of the investigation.
Even among blacks, the most loyal part of the Democratic constituency, the view of Mr. Poshard has often been lukewarm. Some hard feelings might remain among blacks who supported Roland Burris, a former state attorney general, who is black, in the Democratic primary.
Mr. Ryan's big lead in the polls, together with the apparent lead of the Republican candidate for the Senate, Peter Fitzgerald, over Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, has caused Democrats to worry that trouble may be in store for Democrats running for the State Legislature.

HEADLINE: Muscling In on Martha Stewart

BYLINE: By JAMES RYAN

 BODY:
ARMED with little more than a sheaf of recipes, a glue gun, some dried flowers and a puritanical zeal for modern home-keeping, Martha Stewart has built a multimedia empire worth $200 million, by one conservative estimate. Thus, it comes as no surprise that pretenders are cropping up thicker than sprouts on a Chia Pet.
Haunted by Ms. Stewart's success and eager to promote their own domains, seven gurus of the homely arts gathered last week in New York for a Halloween photo shoot. These arbiters of design and entertaining, cooking and crafts were armed with enough moss, glitter, candles, dry ice, scarecrows and baled straw to raise Mrs. Beeton from the dead, and were escorted by assistants, publicity agents and stylists. Most have already written books and landed half-hour slots in the rapidly expanding souffle of life-style television. But they're just treading water compared to Ms. Stewart, a polar-ice-breaking juggernaut who has churned out 22 books and by January will fill five hours of television programming a week. 
 Why the audience? Home-decorating shows are soothing -- like those devoted to golf or bass fishing. Burton Jablin, the programming chief for the fledgling Home and Garden network (HGTV), said his company had predicted a downturn in morning ratings the day President Clinton's grand jury testimony was shown. Instead, there was an increase. "People want something safe and apart from what's out there," Mr. Jablin said. "We call it 'informational escapism.' "
Caroline Goldstein, the author of "Do It Yourself: Home Improvement in the 20th Century," said shelter advice is, and has always been, about "wanting to be upper middle class."
Then again, some people just don't aspire to Ms. Stewart's "casual country buffet for 40" or $750 German glass tree ornaments. Annabelle Gurwitch, a host of TBS's life-style parody show, "Dinner and a Movie," said Ms. Stewart and her ilk were depressing: "Watching some of those life-style shows is like watching porn. There are some very tantalizing things happening in front of me that I know that I'm never going to do in my lifetime." But for those who have the time, cash and inclination to gild their pumpkins, homemaking is back.
"Domesticity for a long time got a dour, matronly rap," said Katie Brown, 35, the anti-Martha who is the host of Lifetime's "Next Door With Katie Brown." "It was embarrassing to say, 'I baked these.' Women of my generation are embracing nesting again." What does this Gen X'er bring to the table? She uses a shower curtain as a tablecloth.
A healthy economy helped spark the explosion of decorating shows, which range from impressive to infuriating. "There are a lot of wannabes out there," said Chris Casson Madden, 50, the author of two coffee-table books, "Kitchens" and its sequel, "Bathrooms." "There are businessmen thinking, 'Let's create the next one,' like Milli Vanilli. But this isn't as easy as lip-synching a song."
Then again, maybe it is. Ms. Madden has a program called "Interiors by Design" on HGTV whose slim content includes house tours and discussions of barrel chairs and passementerie. Now, she is planning her home-decorating empire. "I'll probably do a fragrance at some point, but it doesn't have to be tomorrow," she said.
The number of imitators grows weekly as HGTV, Lifetime, Discovery, TBS, Romance Classics and E! scramble to fill time slots. Many will be chosen. Few, if any, will succeed. But here are some helpful tips, including a few from Martha Stewart herself, who says, "I'm not usually in the business of giving free consultations to competitors."

 CHOOSE A NICHE -- Barbara Smith, a New York restaurateur and former model, is the host of "B. Smith With Style," a syndicated show. She has emerged as the African-American Martha Stewart. "My show has more rhythm," said Ms. Smith, 49. Her glossy 1995 tome, "B. Smith's Entertaining and Cooking for Friends," features Southern recipes, no-frills party tips and beaming children in red and yellow Kwanzaa outfits.
Then there is Mary Emmerling, 56, the Country Martha Stewart. Ms. Emmerling is the host of an HGTV show called "Country at Home." (Though she glorifies the American West, Ms. Emmerling has lived in Georgetown in Washington, D.C., Bridgehampton and, for 30 years, Manhattan.
Ms. Brown, an actress/waitress turned cool camp-crafts counselor, landed "Next Door With Katie Brown" last year. She's a Sunnier Martha, in the Katie Couric mold, who never stops acting casual, even when sewing fabric butterflies for an indoor picnic or making handmade paper in a blender from boiled newspaper pulp and rose petals.
Colin Cowie, a celebrity party planner, is kind of a Rococo Martha. "I'm on a mission to reinforce and reinstate our social graces," said Mr. Cowie, 36. He is the author of the voyeuristic paperweights "Weddings" and "Effortless Elegance." Not always hands-on, Mr. Cowie believes that effortless elegance is achieved by having a chef assist him during cooking segments of "Everyday Elegance With Colin Cowie" on Romance Classics. If the going gets tough, he's not above plunking a waiter in a cab to fetch Indian takeout.
A glance around the cable spectrum reveals slots open for a Latina Martha, a Sporty Martha and a Rock 'n' Roll Martha.
Martha says: "I never wanted to go after a niche. I want to teach as many people as possible."

 OUT-MARTHA MARTHA -- Ms. Madden and Bari Lynn, the former home correspondent for "Good Morning America," have taken on Martha hand to hand, down to the casual attire and the straw-basket-blond hair. "The dream is to turn me into a brand name and license products: crystal, china, window treatments, bedding," said Ms. Lynn, 35, who is looking for her own television show.
 Martha says, "Why anybody would want to copy me or replicate me is kind of crazy."

 TAPE A SEGMENT ON "OPRAH" -- "Appearing on 'Oprah' was a turning point," said Ms. Madden, who landed her own show after making herself invaluable to the busy Ms. Winfrey, redesigning her private office to include watercolors of Ms. Winfrey's dogs.
Mr. Cowie says he is now recognized at airports, thanks to his annual "Oprah" appearance. "I get a whole hour with her," he boasted. Other Stewart wannabes have appeared on "Entertainment Tonight" (Mr. Cowie), "Good Morning America" (Ms. Madden, Ms. Lynn) and the "Today" show (Lynette Jennings). The telegenic Ms. Smith has appeared on "Oprah," the "Today" show and "Good Morning America."
Martha says, "If you're an expert in something very specific, you may be invited on my show."

 NAME DROP -- Mr. Cowie, who is doing an all-Prada Halloween wedding this weekend in Beverly Hills, Calif., has been a nuptial coordinator for such taste mavens as Hugh Hefner, Kenny G., Paula Abdul and Charlie Sheen. "Because of the celebrity angle," he said, "I have been inundated with offers to do licensing agreements."
Ms. Brown's press kit mentions that she has catered for Quentin Tarantino, Mira Sorvino and Diane Keaton. Ms. Madden trumpets that she is Ms. Winfrey's favorite designer. One of the most popular names to drop is that of the poet Maya Angelou. She was touted as a guest, client or book subject by at least four of the seven interviewed.
Not to be outdone, Martha says, "Even Oprah has said to me, 'Where do you get your ideas?' "

 EXPLOIT A COLORFUL PAST -- Ms. Stewart, 57, was variously a model, a stockbroker and a caterer before she turned to life-style management. Ms. Jennings, 50, studied architecture and owned a company that actually built homes. Ms. Smith's career as a model has given her poise, and 12 years of running her own restaurants in New York, Washington and Sag Harbor have made her comfortable with a wooden spoon.
Ms. Brown said she learned cooking tips by pestering chefs during her years in New York as a waitress. A childhood in Kitwe, Zambia, and studies in pharmacy provided Mr. Cowie with inspiration to become, as his biography states, an "international arbiter of taste." And Ms. Madden's success suggests that a background in public relations works, too. She spent time in the publicity departments of Random House, G. P. Putnam's Sons and Simon & Schuster before becoming a design writer. "I know a trend when I see one," she said.
Martha would like to own up to a more colorful past, but says, "I don't remember the last time I made a mistake."

 FIND A NEW GIMMICK -- So far, no one has come up with a trademark to match Ms. Stewart's signature phrase, "It's a good thing." But that's not for want of trying. Ms. Emmerling is the doyenne of five-minute decorating and promotes decor that might best be termed rack 'n' stack. Check her book "Quick Decorating" for details, but it involves piles of books, things hanging from coat racks and folded blankets. "Folding just comes naturally to me," she said.
Ms. Madden so believes women need personal spaces that she wrote a book, which includes an exegesis on a nun's adobe cell in Santa Fe, N.M. Mr. Cowie, who employs the word "fabulous" as generously as a truckstop waitress doles out ketchup, has elevated table-top decor (seafood topiary anyone?) to an art worthy of a Hallmark card.
Martha says: "I look for what isn't out there. My next book is about hors d'oeuvres. There's a need out there for a good handbook on hors d'oeuvres."

 GET INTO PRINT -- Ms. Lynn shot her own photos for "Eclectic Living," while Ms. Smith hired Andrea Gentl and Martin Hyers, a husband-and-wife team who have worked for Martha Stewart Living. Ms. Madden has one-upped them all: her editor at Clarkson Potter, Annetta Hannah, used to be Ms. Stewart's editor.
Mr. Cowie and Ms. Madden say they will start their own magazines within a year. Ms. Brown, the new spokeswoman for Arm & Hammer baking soda, said she currently has book offers from 21 publishers.
Martha says: "Whether it's as simple as roasting a chicken or as complicated as making Jean-Georges's chocolate delight dessert, readers want to know the real way and no short cuts. People never put the real way in their books."

GET YOUR OWN SHOW -- Without a weekly show, you're just another guest stylist. Ms. Brown has managed to leapfrog her competition. Come January, her show will expand to five half-hour segments a week.
Ms. Jennings, a pioneer in the genre, has spent 10 years on the Discovery Channel. Her highly professional series, "Lynette Jennings Design," combines instructional home tours with practical decorating tips. "I consider myself more of a teacher than a celebrity, a hostess or a star," said Ms. Jennings, the Ted Koppel of life style.
Martha says: "I surf the networks at night, seeing how other people are doing. People are not being offered quality programming except for mine."

 RESTORE, RECYCLE, RE-USE -- Even Ms. Stewart in recent weeks has recycled standbys like "How to Load a Dishwasher" and "How to Hang a Backyard Clothesline." How can any mere mortal consistently come up with new ideas? "Everything's recycled these days," Ms. Emmerling said. "I don't care who you are -- you can't do it all yourself. You get it from magazines, from books, from store windows. Why did I see 'Out of Africa' 20 times? I wanted to see that living room again."
Martha says, "I come up with 25 ideas a day."

 THINK FRAGRANCE -- Create a brand, and market it shamelessly. Not everyone will have the longevity of Ms. Stewart, whose line of Everyday sheets and towels for Kmart is expected to top $1 billion in sales this fiscal year. "Except for Martha, it comes and goes for everyone," said Ms. Emmerling, who lost her line of sheets for J. C. Penny and is now down to wallpaper and American Country West furnishings.

 While most empire builders want to expand quickly, Ms. Jennings held off until this year, when she became the spokeswoman for Home Depot and signed deals with Delta (for crafts products), Crown Craft (for bedding and throw rugs) and Time-Life (for books and videos). "We wanted to wait until we could work with the top people in each field," she said.
Martha says: "I must have turned down 44 perfumes. I've never licensed my name. That is not something that is going to be fabulous."

 SPAWN A PARODY -- Ms. Stewart is a target because of her perfectionism and apparent lack of humor, as anyone who watched her flock a Christmas tree with cotton candy on the David Letterman show can attest. So far, none of the seven pretenders to Martha's throw rug have proved worthy of parody. But what pleasures lie ahead?
Martha says: "Love the late-night jokes. But the parodies are so stupid. I could do those better myself."

 BODY:

THE STORY OF AMERICAN FREEDOM
By Eric Foner
Illustrated. 422 pages. W. W. Norton. $27.95.
In 1792, fearing the emergence of a monarchical Presidency, Congress directed that the new American nation's first coins display not the head of the President but "an impression emblematic of liberty, with an inscription of the word Liberty" stamped upon them. A decade later, when Thomas Jefferson effected the Louisiana Purchase, he referred to the enlarged country as "the Empire of Liberty." And three generations after that, at the height of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said of both sides: "We all declare for Liberty, but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing."
Freedom has always been the American religion, but, as Lincoln said, the concept has meant different things at different times to different groups. The competing definitions are closely described in this new book by Eric Foner, a Columbia University historian. "The Story of American Freedom" is a retelling of American history, from the Revolutionary War to the Reagan revolution, organized around the concept of freedom, its meaning and how that meaning has been manipulated, argued and transformed. 
 The history of freedom, Mr. Foner writes, is "a tale of debates, disagreements and struggles rather than a set of timeless categories or an evolutionary narrative toward a preordained goal."
That statement is no doubt true and also worth remembering as one reads Mr. Foner's well-informed and scrupulously balanced book. And yet, there is something dutiful rather than inspired about Mr. Foner's writing and his approach, which, despite the author's claim to have taken a fresh look at American history, comes across as a bit familiar. It seems rather obvious, for example, that a history including the Civil War, Reconstruction, Jim Crow and the denial, until after World War I, of the vote to women, never reflected liberty as an immutable principle. Despite that, and despite a certain blandness in the writing -- freedom as a matter of "divergent connotations and applications," for example -- and despite the abstractness of his approach, Mr. Foner has written an instructive book on the spirit of American political life.
Mr. Foner examines each major period of American history, isolating the concept of freedom that prevailed at the time, demonstrating how the concept was either challenged or reinforced. He treats the Revolutionary War, for example, as a seminal episode that did far more than simply win independence for the colonies and create a nonmonarchical republic. The roots of American freedom lay in the former mother country, but "its emergence as a new and distinct ideology grew out of the struggle for independence and the creation of a nation-state that defined itself, in James Madison's words, as the 'workshop of liberty to the Civilized World.' "
The great national hypocrisy was slavery and, after slavery, the institutionalized racism that persisted until after the first half of the 20th century. Mr. Foner shows what seems extraordinary now, that the debate over slavery was to a degree a contest between alternate concepts of freedom, one stressing the rights of all to be free and the other the supposed normal hierarchy of human society in which some were naturally subordinate to others.
Mr. Foner's examples of the effect that slavery had on American practices and vocabulary are among the book's most fascinating passages. "The contrast between liberty and slavery provided a rhetoric through which those outside the boundaries of American freedom could challenge their exclusion and, in so doing, transform the meaning of freedom itself." Just as, in Mr. Foner's interpretation, the Revolution established freedom as the national ideology, the Union's victory in the Civil War "consolidated the northern understanding of freedom as the national norm."
The Civil War also fostered the image of a powerful Government as the ultimate guarantor of freedom, and this suggests a tension in American history as old as the nation, the tension between governmental power as a threat and as the guardian of the oppressed. Subsequent national debates over the concentration of capital, for example, echoed the earlier competing conceptions of freedom, whether it meant unrestricted economic activity or something close to its opposite, controls on private property to prevent the economic enslavement of labor.
Mr. Foner traces the development of the concept of civil liberties to court cases involving free speech early in this century. He argues that the New Deal finally recognized economic security as "a political condition of personal freedom." In the postwar world, Mr. Foner argues, freedom became associated with material prosperity, an association made clear in Richard Nixon's famous "kitchen debate" with the Soviet leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev. "In the 1950's," Mr. Foner writes, "freedom became fully identified with consumer capitalism, or, as it was now universally known, 'free enterprise.' "
Mr. Foner ends on a note of description rather than analysis. He shows how freedom was, in his view, expanded by the cultural revolution of the 1960's, but also how a different concept of freedom -- based, again, on economic freedom and the fear of big Government -- came to prevail when Ronald Reagan become President. The two final chapters, in which Mr. Foner covers this ground, are rapid-fire summaries of recent American history, from the 60's notion of freedom as an erotically charged challenge to authority to the Reagan-era concept of freedom based on smaller government and free enterprise.
Mr. Foner is nothing if not comprehensive here, as in the rest of his book, but these final chapters, which involve violently contested visions of American freedom, seem strangely bloodless as well as familiar. Reading "The Story of American Freedom," one is grateful for Mr. Foner's clarity and knowledgeability, even while wishing that he had been conceptually bolder and more outspoken about his passions and less dutifully respectful of so many points of view, including those he clearly does not agree with.
