HEADLINE: Trade Gap Is Lowest In 5 Years

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit dropped sharply in September to $7.94 billion, its lowest level since late 1984, the Commerce Department reported today.
Both aspects of the gap showed improvement, with exports climbing 1.9 percent and imports tumbling 3.9 percent from the record August level.
But while the September deficit was considerably lower than most analysts expected, the report inspired little enthusiasm in the financial markets, and even the Bush Administration warned that the figures may not be as good as they seem.
 
An Official Urges Caution
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said yesterday that he had considered a sharp increase in the deficit in August ''an aberration'' and that the even bigger move downward in September ''must also be viewed cautiously.'' 
One reason for the lack of enthusiasm was the fact that the rise in exports was entirely the result of a jump in aircraft sales, mostly to Western Europe. Because of a strike that began at the Boeing Company in early October, aircraft exports are expected to fall sharply in coming months.
As for imports, their decline did indeed help lower the trade deficit but it also seemed to be further evidence that the American consumer is cutting back on spending. Consumers, who account for two-thirds of business activity, had been the main engine for economic growth in the first half of the year, but sales of cars and some other items have lagged of late.
 
Some Optimism
Even with all those qualifications and the widely shared skepticism about the reliability of the trade data, many analysts said the latest figures provided reasons for some optimism.
''I think basically the story is pretty good for the domestic economy,'' said Michael P. Niemira, an economist for Mitsubishi Bank in New York. He cited a firm export pace - some 13 percent higher last month than in September 1988 - and his own surveys of airports and seaports showing expectations of further export gains.
Scott M. Hoyt, assistant economist at the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, called the export sector ''encouraging,'' adding that it suggests ''the increases in the dollar aren't taking too much of a toll.'' A stronger dollar makes American exports more expensive and less competitive abroad.
The dollar, which rose above 2 West German marks and above 150 yen during the summer, has since eased, but remains strong. It is about 4 percent higher against the mark since the beginning of the year and about 15 percent higher against the yen.
In general, economists regard the export side of the equation as a better indicator of the nation's economic performance. Export business means jobs, production and incomes, while imports - though they help raise living standards and provide employment in distribution - mean the production benefits accrue elsewhere.
Today's report showed September exports rose $500 million, to $31.1 billion, just shy of the record $31.3 billion set in June. This included a $1.3 billion increase in capital goods, like industrial machinery, and a $400 million decline in vehicles, parts and engines. The United States exported $2 billion of airplanes, according to figures that are not adjusted for seasonal variation, up from $1.1 billion in August.
 
Decline in Imported Oil
Among imports, industrial supplies and materials fell $900 million and capital goods fell $700 million after surging in August. The nation's bill for imported oil eased $300 million, to $4 billion, but still accounted for more than half of the total deficit. A 23-million-barrel decline in the volume of petroleum imports was partly offset by a 24-cent rise in the average price of a barrel.
The trade gap was about $1 billion narrower than analysts had expected, making it the smallest since a $6.79 billion deficit in December 1984.
The August deficit, meanwhile, which initially had been reported at $10.8 billion, was revised today to $10.1 billion, which is tied with the May figure as the worst of the year. All but about $100 million of the August change was because of a lower import level.
For the first nine months of this year, the deficit is a seasonally adjusted $80.42 billion, compared with $87.94 billion in the 1988 period.
 
Deficit With Japan Rises
The American deficit with Japan edged up about $100 million, to $4.1 billion, but there was a big swing into surplus with Western Europe, a heavy September buyer of aircraft. The United States sold $1.2 billion more goods to Western Europe than it bought during the month, while in August it had a $700 million trade deficit.
The deficit narrowed about $100 million each with Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong and dropped by about one-third, to $700 million, with Canada, the nation's biggest trading partner.
Without adjusting for seasonal variation, the September deficit was $8 billion, down from $10.9 billion in August and $10.7 billion in July, today's report showed.

HEADLINE: Texas Air In 40-Plane Airbus Order

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
The Texas Air Corporation, placing its largest order ever for its Continental Airlines subsidiary, said yesterday that it had ordered 40 aircraft worth about $4.5 billion from Airbus Industrie, the European consortium.
The order was an indication that Airbus is making inroads in the United States market after a shaky start.
The medium- and long-range A330 and A340 jets, which are still being developed by Airbus, will enable Continental to replace some aging planes and expand its international service, particularly in the Pacific, the fastest-growing market, said Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air. Earlier this month the United States and Japan signed an agreement that paves the way for more flights to and from Japan. 
 
Order Backlog at Makers
As airlines rush to expand service and modernize their fleets, a backlog of orders stretching into the mid-1990's has developed at the manufacturers. Gaining a slot, or delivery position, becomes crucial. ''Texas Air had to do this to stay competitive,'' said Raymond Neidl, an analyst with Dillon, Read.
Mr. Lorenzo said that as many as 25 percent of the planes might be assigned to Eastern Airlines, Texas Air's other subsidiary.
In August Mr. Lorenzo said that he was considering selling a minority or controlling interest in Continental and that he had talked to several interested parties. At yesterday's news conference he declined to discuss the progress of such talks, saying only that the Texas Air board was receptive to offers.
Nevertheless, industry analysts said that regardless of Continental's status, the aircraft order was needed to insure the airline's viability. Continental already has a fleet of 330 planes.
In the last few years Airbus has increased its success in selling in the United States, which accounts for 45 percent of the worldwide market. Ten United States airlines are now flying or have ordered Airbus jets. The consortium includes aerospace concerns from France, Spain, West Germany and Britain.
Although Mr. Lorenzo said that Texas Air had secured financing for 20 of the jets, he declined to provide details, saying that the arrangement may change. Industry analysts speculated that Airbus, which has been aggressively courting American carriers, offered Texas Air attractive financing. ''Airbus is probably giving them a leasing and financing arrangement that Boeing would be reluctant to do,'' said George Shapiro, an analyst with Salomon Brothers.
Deliveries for the airplanes will not begin until February 1993. Earlier this year, Texas Air announced orders for up to 100 Boeing 737-300's worth about $2.8 billion. Of the 40 aircraft orders announced yesterday, 20 are firm and 20 are options to buy.
The A340 is a four-engine wide-body plane that seats 286 passengers and can fly nonstop from Continental's hub in Houston to Tokyo. The A330, which seats 300 passengers, is a medium-range twin-engine plane that the airline will use in North America and to expand its service to Europe. Both planes use advanced cockpit electronics and ''fly by wire,'' where the flight controls are linked to the cockpit through a computer rather than mechanically.
Texas Air has yet to announce which engines will be fitted on the Airbus planes.

HEADLINE: At Budget Hotels, Growing Pains

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill.

 BODY:
Judging by the jammed parking lot at the Fairfield Inn here, one might think that the budget hotel business is flourishing. But now, with more than 50 such chains in business, the supply of inexpensive rooms is beginning to outstrip even the surging demand for them, and occupancy levels and profits are sliding.
Some of the best-known names in the hotel industry - including Marriott, Ramada and Quality Inns International - have been opening hotels with no-frills rooms for as little as $25 a night. Their target, increasingly, is the business traveler whose cost-cutting employer is no longer willing to foot a bill of $75 or more.
The result has been a fierce competition for market share. Many operators are cutting prices further, stepping up their advertising and even resorting to giveaways. Indeed, industry analysts now joke of ''amenity creep'' - a move from offering spartan rooms to providing simple perquisites like shampoo and free phone calls, and then on to more exotic frills like facsimile transmission and phones that permit computer hookups. 
 
Some May Be Forced Out
Given such competition, industry experts say, a number of chains will be driven out of business or forced to merge.
Budget hotels are not new. Motel 6 dates from the 1960's, when it offered rooms for $6 a night, and the Days Inns chain started in the 1970's. Days Inn is still the largest chain of budget hotels, with 81,600 rooms expected by the end of the year; Motel 6 is second, with 60,000.
But in the last two years one big hotel chain after another, troubled by stagnating revenues in their full-service hotels, have entered what was once a land of ersatz leather furniture, gold shag rugs and bathtubs with broken tile. The Marriott Corporation, for example, developed Fairfield Inns; the Ramada Corporation acquired Rodeway Inns, and Prime Motor Inns Inc., which owns the Howard Johnson hotels, acquired Wellesley Inns, a budget chain operating in the Northeast. Quality Inns International, which already owned the Comfort Inns chain of ''luxury'' budget hotels, the third-largest chain, developed Sleep Inns.
 
Old Chains Expanding
Even industry old-timers are getting into the act. Kemmons Wilson, the founder of Holiday Inns, has started his second chain, Wilson Inns, expected to open 14 properties by next month.
Meanwhile, budget hotels in existence for years are expanding rapidly. Days Inns of America, the Atlanta-based chain, recently developed Daystop, a barebones operation for $25 a night. And Hampton Inns, which since its inception in 1984 has replaced the since-sold Holiday Inns as the principal lodging chain of the Holiday Corporation, plans to open 55 budget hotels this year, up from 40 in 1988.
''Years ago we used to have rooming houses; now we have budget hotels,'' said Steven Brenner, a leading industry consultant based in New York.
Market figures bear this out. Since 1981, the number of hotel rooms over all has increased by 2 percent annually, according to Laventhol & Horwath, an accounting and consulting firm. But the number of budget rooms grew by 20 percent in 1988 and is projected to rise 17 percent this year, to 613,500 rooms, according to Laventhol.
So fast has the growth of inexpensive hotels been that by the end of the year roughly one in five of the three million hotel rooms in America will be in the budget category.
 
Rates Sharply Lower
Budget hotels are for people concerned mostly about a clean bed and bath, a television set and a telephone. Rates average $32 a night, compared with more than $60 a night for conventional full-service hotels.
Yet in many ways, some budget hotels are hard to distinguish from their full-service counterparts. At the Fairfield Inn in Peoria, for example, guests get two queen-sized beds and a large work area, and can tune in scores of television channels received by a satellite dish out back.
But at the lower end are the so-called hard budget hotels, which offer one bed and a shower but not a bathtub, and in some cases bath towels that might more appropriately be called paper towels.
While the pace of development of budget-hotel rooms has recently shown signs of abating, growth is still so overheated that ''small, regional chains will be hard-pressed to compete,'' said Daniel W. Daniele, a Laventhol executive who tracks the budget-hotel business. ''Only the big national companies will have the marketing dollars to maintain a competitive edge.''
 
Consolidation Under Way
The industry shakeout has already produced consolidation. Motel 6 acquired Sixpence Inns, a budget chain operating in the West, as well as parts of Envoy Inns, which is in the Midwest. Kings Inn, an inexpensive chain in the Southwest, became part of the Comfort Inn chain. And Skylight Inns, which also operates in the Middle West, joined the hugeTravelodge chain.
The budget hotels' success has not been at the expense of the most luxurious hotels. Top executives and other wealthy people continue to stay at such hotels. Rather, the chains have been taking business from more middle-of-the-road properties like Holiday Inn, Ramada Inn and Howard Johnson's.
Some hotel chains have steered clear of the budget-inn business, fearing it might adulterate their image.
''You can't be all things to all people under one brand name,'' said William Hulett, president of the Stouffer Hotel Company, which has not entered the budget business. ''Ultimately, that confuses people. When people think of Stouffer hotels, we want them to think it will cost them $100 a night to stay there.''
 
A Lower Break-Even Point
Big hoteliers that do invest in budget chains like the much lower break-even point of those hotels, largely the result of less fixed overhead than their full-service brethren. They need be only 52 percent to 55 percent full, compared with 65 percent to 68 percent for a full-service hotel.
What is more, occupancy rates at some budget hotels now run close to 70 percent. While the budget hotels have scored their greatest successes among self-employed entrepreneurs, independent salespeople and other travelers paying their own way, more and more big corporations have begun to send lower-level employees to budget hotels to control costs. Some of the companies are: General Motors, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, I.B.M. and Caterpillar. Business travelers now make up the budget hotels' largest customer group, providing 42 percent of revenues.
Moreover, the financial risk posed by budget hotels is much lower than that of the more expensive hotels. Because they are often placed in rural areas and outside major cities, where land costs are low, budget hotels can be built for as little as $32,000 a room. ''A full-service room can cost double that to build,'' said Robert F. Fitzgerald, chief executive of Rodeway Inns.
 
Profits Lower
Most budget-hotel properties remain in the black. An economy hotel that charges the industry average of $32 a night for a room might pay about $7.50 a day for linens, laundry and cleaning for that room. Another $7.50 a day may go for overhead and the hotel manager's salary. That leaves $17 before fixed charges like rent or mortgage, property taxes, insurance and interest are paid. After those expenses, profit now averages $1.09 before income taxes, down from $4.17 two years ago, according to Laventhol.

Jarmusch's 'Mystery Train,' Vignettes Linked by Elvis

 BODY:
''Mystery Train'' was shown as part of the recent New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Vincent Canby's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 29. The film opens today at the Cinema Studio, Broadway at 66th Street.
Elvis Presley - the myth, the music and (in one scene) the man -hovers over Jim Jarmusch's blissful new comedy, ''Mystery Train,'' bridging the film's three separate but vaguely interrelated vignettes. The principal setting is the run-down Arcade Hotel in Memphis. The Arcade doesn't offer its patrons television (not that the usual Arcade patrons would be interested in it anyway), but every room does have its own portrait of Elvis. One can't be sure, but the portraits look to be tinted. 
What makes this night different at the Arcade is that three most particular sets of patrons would prefer television to Elvis. That is, all except Mitzuko, the effervescent Japanese teen-ager who has traveled to Memphis on a pilgrimage with her dour teen-age-suave boyfriend, Jun.
In the film's opening story, Jun and Mitzuko are first seen on the train taking them into Memphis, each in the private world of a Walkman headset, riding past small mountains of worn-out automobiles, most probably Japanese.
The Memphis that Mr. Jarmusch elects to show in '' Mystery Train'' is no Memphis that any hometown booster would want to recognize. It's a place of abandoned movie houses, eerily empty streets and ailanthus trees growing like weeds in otherwise vacant lots.
To Mitzuko, who has come to pay her respects to Elvis at his shrine of Graceland, Memphis is magical. Her eyes are saucers. Jun, who prefers Carl Perkins and Roy Orbison to Elvis, remains unimpressed by the Memphis landscape. ''If you took away 60 percent of the buildings,'' he says, ''Yokohama would look just like Memphis.''
When, at the end of the day, they are finally ensconced at the Arcade, Jun starts taking pictures of their room. Why? He'll remember the sights outside, he says, but he'll need the snaps to recall everything else, including the airports they've passed through.
Jun and Mitzuko are tourists, serenely voyaging on the cheap as they make the grand tour of America's holy places. The second segment of ''Mystery Train'' is about Luisa, a pretty Italian widow forced to spend a night in Memphis while accompanying her husband's body back to Rome. In the lobby of the Arcade, she befriends DeeDee, a chattering young woman who, nearly broke, is running away from her boyfriend. Luisa offers to share her room with the younger woman.
DeeDee is fleeing Memphis, while Luisa is just passing through. For her, Memphis is an anonymous stopover until, sitting in a coffee shop, she is gently accosted by a tall, skinny man with a strange story. The gist of his tale is that the ghost of Elvis has entrusted him with a crummy pocket comb to be given to Luisa. She listens, amused and rather pleased, until the man suggests they continue their dialogue elsewhere.
The third vignette, which more or less brings all the elements of the narrative together, involves the fellow DeeDee is leaving, an unemployed, working-class Englishman who is named Johnny and nicknamed Elvis, and his two pals. They are Will Robinson, a laid-back truck driver, and Charlie, DeeDee's brother, a fastidious barber who can't hold his liquor.
In the course of a feckless spree, Elvis holds up a liquor store for two bottles of whisky, and a gun goes off, forcing the three to seek a hideout at the Arcade. It's not easy to describe the dizzy gaiety of Mr. Jarmusch's films, each set in a universe that seems to be even more torpid than that of the film before. ''Mystery Train'' is buoyantly funny from start to finish. One doesn't laugh out loud all that often. One grins and, as the odd events and eccentric information accumulate, begins to recognize an enchanted vision within the seediness.
Mr. Jarmusch is an American original who, for all of his hipness, is remarkably benign. Like ''Stranger Than Paradise'' and ''Down by Law,'' the first two Jarmusch films to be commercially released, ''Mystery Train'' has something of the pragmatic craziness of the great Krazy Kat cartoons.
Nobody tosses bricks in ''Mystery Train,'' which, unlike Krazy Kat and the two earlier comedies, has been photographed (by Robby Muller) in brilliant colors. Yet there is a bluntness to the Jarmusch method that gives substance to the seemingly fragile narratives.
It's now obvious that calling his comedies shaggy-dog stories isn't good enough. They aren't really stories at all. Each is an amalgam of attitudes, images and music, especially music (blues, jazz, rock), which evoke something most cheering and comic about the human condition, even in extremis.
The dialogue sounds as if it had been gathered by means of microphones hidden in diners, buses, waiting rooms, restrooms, motels and park benches. Sometimes it is hilariously banal, with never a word wasted.
The ''Mystery Train'' performers fly. There isn't enough space to give them all their due, but those who must be mentioned include Masatoshi Nagase and Youki Kudoh, as Jun and Mitzuko, Nicoletta Braschi as Luisa, and Joe Strummer as ''Elvis.''
Presiding over these hapless folk are Screamin' Jay Hawkins, who plays the Arcade's unflappable night clerk, and Cinque Lee (Spike's younger brother), who plays the bellboy. John Lurie, the actor and musician who starred in ''Stranger Than Paradise,'' wrote the film's fine score, which is punctuated by Elvis hits.

HEADLINE: A Final Fling on Nutcracker's Eve

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
THIS is the weekend before ''The Nutcracker'' arrives, like a fond but overwhelming aunt whose visit means that all else must be dropped or put aside. As if to celebrate those last free moments before the holiday classic gathers audiences up into its cheerful bosom, dance companies and soloists are presenting a wide-ranging variety of work in theaters around New York City tonight through Sunday.
The chilly, pure art of jiuta-mai, the most refined of Japanese classical dance forms, will be represented, as will the giddy vulgarisms of American vaudeville. There will be flamenco and home-grown American modern dance, including the newest of new choreographers and a veteran performance artist.
The Joffrey Ballet, which ushers in the first of the area productions of ''The Nutcracker'' next week, goes out in a blaze of repertorial glory this weekend at City Center. Tonight and tomorrow night, there is the company's spectacular newest addition, ''Two-a-Day,'' a souffle of a ballet by Gerald Arpino, the Joffrey's director and resident choreographer, filled with stock vaudeville characters and numbers presented with stylish and infectious exuberance. 
Other Joffrey highlights are performances tomorrow and Sunday afternoons of Eugene Loring's ''Billy the Kid,'' an American classic featuring two good lead casts; ''La Vivandiere Pas de Six,'' a piece of late 19th-century effervescence by Arthur Saint-Leon that is on the matinee program tomorrow, and William Forsythe's ''Love Songs,'' a dark, sardonic look at romance that is performed to some of the greatest songs sung by Aretha Franklin and Dionne Warwick, tomorrow night. Performances to watch for are those of Peter Narbutas, an unusually nuanced Alias in ''Billy the Kid''; Tina LeBlanc in a virtuoso role in ''Vivandiere,'' and the daredevil Jodie Gates in ''Love Songs.'' (The Joffrey Ballet performs at City Center, 131 West 55th Street, tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 and Sunday at 2 P.M. Ticket prices range from $8 to $42. Information: 581-7907.) Garth Fagan and his Bucket Dance Company have grown a great deal in the 20 years since Mr. Fagan started choreographing for a group of untrained, working-class students in Rochester.
The dancers are now sleek, expert performers. Mr. Fagan, once a member of the National Dance Company of Jamaica, has become a more sophisticated choreographer. But the rough-hewn, highly personal quality of the dances and dancers has remained a hallmark of the company.
''I like a kind of freshness and rawness about these dancers,'' Mr. Fagan told the dance writer Eric Taub in 1984. ''But freshness is not to be confused with a lack of discipline, form or structure. It's like the beauty of a wildflower versus a calla lily. I adore both, but I want my dancers to keep that wildflower feeling without having their dancing turn into an expressionistic, undefined free-for-all.''
This weekend, the company will present nine dances, ranging from Mr. Fagan's new ''Telling a Story'' to a revival of his ''Of Light and Melanin.'' The earlier piece, created in 1981 and set to music by Keith Jarrett, has become a kind of signature work, with a central, high arabesque in a solo for a lead female dancer that is emblematic of the magic Mr. Fagan and his dancers can create. It will be performed tomorrow afternoon in Program III. The acclaimed ''Telling a Story'' is a plotless, two-part homage to Miles Davis, to whose music the new work is danced, and to Mr. Fagan's parents and grandchildren. It will be performed in Program I, tonight, tomorrow and Sunday nights.
There are pieces set to music by other jazz composers and to scores by Dvorak, Brahms and Vivaldi. Mr. Fagan's use of African dance idiom comes to the fore in ''From Before,'' performed on Sunday night in Program II. ''Oatka Trail,'' a signature work performed in Program I, displays his individual mixing of idioms that include ballet, gymnastics and modern dance influenced by Mary Wigman and Martha Graham. (The Bucket Dance Company performs at the Joyce Theater, Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 and Sunday at 2 and 7:30 P.M. Tickets are $22.50. Information: 242-0800.)
 
Economy of Jiuta-Mai
Suzushi Hanayagi is an experimentalist modern-dance choreographer who has made use of video in some of her dance. She has also worked with Robert Wilson, creating the Bessie Award-winning choreography for his ''Knee Plays'' and co-choreographing the Paris Opera Ballet's ''Martyre de St. Sebastien.'' But Miss Hanayagi is also one of Japan's foremost classical dancers, trained by the famous Takehara Han and specializing in the stark, utterly refined dance form of jiuta-mai, which was developed by the Kyoto aristocracy in the 17th century. And in works like ''Yuki (Snow),'' a study of a woman withdrawing from the world, which Miss Hanayagi will dance tonight and tomorrow night at Asia Society, she offers an unforgettable example of how economical great performing can be.
Miss Hanayagi will be joined by her older sister, Suzusetsi, also a noted performer of Japanese classical dance, and Suzusetsumi Hanayagi, who is unrelated but has taken on the professional name. The program will also feature kabuki numbers, including ''Echigo-Jishi (Lion Dance).'' (The Hanayagis will perform at Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, tonight and tomorrow at 8. Tickets are $20. Information: 288-6400. Charge: 517-2742.) If Suzushi Hanayagi could be called a performer of magnificent economy, Victoria Marks will probably always be known as the choreographer who gave us a look at the process of socialization through the minimalist gestures of four young women in drab schoolgirls' winter coats. That signature work, ''Dancing to Music,'' will be performed again, tonight through Sunday at Performance Space 122, in a program that also features Miss Marks's new ''Force of Nature,'' a fast-paced and wild ensemble piece danced to music by Chris Cochrane, and her ''Natural Selection,'' which has been described as an ode to the Reagan years in the White House.
Later each night, Charles Dennis takes over at P.S. 122 with an evening of performance and dance pieces that includes ''Just Say Yo,'' set to music by Bob Telson, with slides, film and video. Mr. Dennis, a founder of P.S. 122, will also perform in his recent ''Living RRRoom,'' a solo that examines the domestic life of a freelance artist. His ''2 x 2 x 4'' is a dance for Mr. Dennis and 14 two-by-four planks. (The Victoria Marks Performance Company dances at 8 and Charles Dennis performs at 9:30 P.M. at Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street. Admission to each show is $8; Theater Development Vouchers accepted. Information or reservations: 477-5288.)
 
Flamenco
Paco Pena, the flamenco guitarist, has appeared before in New York only as a solo artist. On Sunday night, he brings his company to Town Hall for a single performance sponsored by the World Music Institute. For those who like to know exactly what they are about to see, the program for the company's first American tour ranges over styles from all periods of flamenco. And Mr. Pena's reputation as a musician of great spontaneity and warmth with austere virtuosity bodes well, too, for a provocative evening of dance. (The Paco Pena Flamenco Dance Company performs at Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, on Sunday at 8 P.M. Tickets are $15, $20 and $25. Information: 206-1050. Charge: 947-5850.) And for those who like to be surprised, there is ''Fielday,'' a five-hour program of dance tomorrow night by 21 choreographers. All are new or ''emerging,'' as the organizers put it, and all have been invited to take risks with their dances. Some of the names are familiar, among them Sara Pearson, Bill Coleman, Alice Varga Forner and Lorn MacDougal. Most are not. But the Field, which is sponsoring the marathon, is serious and imaginative about encouraging choreographers, so there ought to be at least a gem or two in the bag. (''Fielday'' will take place tomorrow night, beginning at 7, at Eden's Expressway, 537 Broadway, near Spring Street. Tickets are $5, for all or part of the program, and will be available at the door. Information: 691-6969.)

HEADLINE: House Votes to Raise Members' Pay and Ban Fees for Speaking

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
After a year of scandal and internal turmoil, the House of Representatives voted today to raise its members' salaries, tighten its ethics rules and sharply reduce the members' dependence on outside income.
By a vote of 252 to 174, the House approved a measure that would raise the pay of House members, Federal judges and top Government officials by more than a third over the next two years. It would prohibit House members from accepting speaking fees from outside groups, a practice that critics have attacked as an effort to curry favor and influence. It would tighten rules on gifts, travel and outside earnings. 
''I think it's a breakthrough day for the institution,'' said Fred Wertheimer, head of Common Cause, the governmental watchdog group. ''It really is, I would hope, the beginning of the end for the anything-goes ethics era that has functioned in Washington in the 1980's.''
 
On to the Senate
''The House has suffered a great deal of damage, both from within and without,'' said Representative Lynn Martin, Republican of Illinois, a co-chairwoman of the House group that produced this measure. ''The House has a rare opportunity to redeem itself today.''
The proposal would raise the salaries of House members, judges and other officials by 7.9 percent Jan. 1, 1990, and 25 percent more, plus an adjustment to make up for inflation, one year later. House leaders estimated that this would raise members' salaries to about $125,000 in 1991, from the current $89,500, for an overall increase of about 40 percent.
The legislation now heads to the Senate, where leaders from both parties are still struggling to find a politically palatable plan for Senate salaries and outside income. By tradition, neither chamber tries to set the pay or otherwise dictate the internal workings of the other chamber. The Senate could adopt the pay package and the guidelines on speaking fees set by the House for its own members, or it could approve the proposal for House members and come up with a different plan for its own members. President Bush has endorsed the House proposal. George J. Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, said tonight that the House measure would come to the floor on Friday. Opponents of the measure, including Ralph Nader, who sharply criticized the size of the raise, said they hoped to block it there.
Today's vote in the House came after a campaign carefully orchestrated to build bipartisan support and political protection for lawmakers. Unlike the 51 percent raise that would have taken effect in February if Congress had not blocked it, this salary increase was made part of a sweeping revision of the House ethical rules so that leaders could promote it as an ethics package, not a raise.
 
Pledge From Party Leaders
One leader after another rose to argue that the new rules were critical to restore public confidence in the House and that the long-term gain to the institution would far exceed the outcry over the pay increase.
To buttress their courage, lawmakers were presented with an extraordinary non-aggression pledge from four party leaders: Lee Atwater, the Republican national chairman; Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic chairman; and Representatives Guy Vander Jagt, Republican of Michigan, and Beryl Anthony Jr., Democrat of Arkansas, the heads of the Congressional campaign committees. ''The four of us have agreed to issue instructions to our staff that the vote on H.R. 3660 is not an appropriate point of criticism in the coming campaigns,'' the leaders said.
In the end, the measure shot through the House: More than 150 aye votes were cast in the first 30 seconds, to whoops and whistles.
 
No More Speaking Fees
In return for the pay increase of more than a third, the legislation would require members to give up their speaking fees, starting in 1991. Currently, lawmakers may accept fees and other outside earnings equaling 30 percent of their Congressional salary. They could still earn outside income from activities like teaching, but the amount would be limited to 15 percent of the Congressional salary. And the measure would prohibit members from earning professional, legal or directors' fees. ''It was a real effort to close off all the spigots,'' said Mr. Wertheimer.
Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, said of the legislation today: ''It says: 'Boys and girls, this is a full-time job. Pay attention to what's going on here. We'll compensate you straight from the public Treasury, right out in the open, but no more side employment deals.' ''

HEADLINE: With America Honoring Walesa, Little Poland Is Filled With Pride

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
In the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, which is known as Little Poland, the ties to the old country remain strong.
Meat markets are heavy with the garlicky scent of kielbasa and the sweet fragrance of freshly baked babka. A liquor store on Manhattan Avenue boasts of stocking 118 brands of vodka. Signs in store windows announce ''Polska Mowa,'' or Polish Spoken Here. Travel agencies do a brisk business booking flights to Warsaw and arranging shipments of food, clothing and dollars to family members overseas.
This week the neighborhood is buzzing with talk, much of it in Polish, about Lech Walesa's first visit to the United States and his two-day trip to New York City that began yesterday. His triumphant welcome in Washington has renewed the pride of Polish-Americans in Solidarity, the trade union he founded that helped bring about a new political order in Poland. 
Greenpoint is still the main destination for many Polish immigrants seeking economic liberation. But it is also a reminder of the hardships facing the new Poland. Until the shelves of the markets in Warsaw are as full as those in Greenpoint, Poles are likely to continue to come to the West, abandoning the promise of freedom at home for the certainty of abundance abroad.
Such was the case with Peter Walczak, a 38-year-old carpenter who left his home in Poznan two weeks ago to come to the United States. On Wednesday, he was shopping for bread and kielbasa in Greenpoint with his older brother, Andy, who came to New York City 10 years ago.
''The situation in Poland is not going to change day after day,'' Mr. Walczak said in Polish, using his brother as a translator. ''It's going to take time, and right now it's very drastic - shortages of food, shortages of clothes, shortages of supplies. If you want to buy, say, a TV, you have to wait two years. You have to put your name on all of these lists.''
Asked to identify the biggest difference between the United States and Poland, Mr. Walczak said, ''being able to buy things.''
Except for that distinction, and the street signs in English, Mr. Walczak said he feels as if he is walking through a small Polish city when he wanders through Greenpoint.
 
A Common Culture
Although only a short trip across the East River from midtown Manhattan, it is a neighborhood that has maintained much of its ethnic insularity since Polish immigrants first settled there in the mid-19th century.
During that era it was shipyards, one of which built the Civil War ironclad Monitor, that attracted Polish, Irish and Italian immigrants. Succeeding waves of immigrants settled there to be near family members and to share a common culture.
Greenpoint's cultural isolation is at least partly due to its lack of a direct subway link to Manhattan. Commuters must change trains either in Queens or elsewhere in Brooklyn. That may also have something to do with the neighborhood's relatively low crime rates. There has not been a homicide there since February.
The city's Planning Department estimates that about five percent of New York City's 350,000 residents of Polish descent live in Greenpoint. But because many of the roughly 1,000 Poles who emigrate to New York City each year settle in Greenpoint, the area has retained its ethnic vitality.
 
Memories of 1939
The six Polish Masses celebrated each weekend at St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, the neighborhood's spiritual center, are packed with parishioners. In the early 1980's, when Solidarity was banned under martial law, dozens of residents crammed into the back room of the Pol-Am Bookstore to plot strategy for raising American money and consciousness for Solidarity.
The memory of Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939 is fresh enough in Greenpoint that there was some nervousness in the neighborhood last week when it was announced that travel restrictions were being relaxed in East Germany. ''Polish people do fear the reunification of Germany because of the history of aggression of the German nation,'' said Edward J. Celmer, a doctor who grew up in Greenpoint but received his medical training in Poland during the early days of martial law.
Virtually everyone in Greenpoint regards Mr. Walesa, a former shipyard electrician, as a national hero. And his trip to the United States has brought home Solidarity's accomplishments to the immigrants who have had to watch the ferment from afar. They found immense gratification in his being awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Bush and his being honored as only the third person who was not a sitting head of state to be asked to speak to both houses of Congress.
''It means they can pick up their heads, look people in the eyes and say, 'We are not so low, not so downtrodden. We have people we can be proud of,' '' said the Rev. Stanislaw Staniszewski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church.
 
No Visit to Little Poland
Father Staniszewski said he wept yesterday while reading a transcript of Mr. Walesa's speech to Congress in Nowy Dziennik, the New York-based Polish daily.
Many people in Greenpoint said they were disappointed that Mr. Walesa was not planning to visit the neighborhood. Dr. Celmer said he could envision a huge rally in Walesa-Solidarity Square in front of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church.
Most, however, were willing to forgive Mr. Walesa for planning to spend his time with labor leaders, politicians and newspaper editors. They said they understand that the focus of his trip is not Polonia, as the Polish-American community is called, but the politicians and opinion leaders who can help Poland win greater economic aid from Congress.
 
Rendezvous at a Shrine
Mr. Walesa's visit to New York will be largely out of the public's view, and so some Greenpoint residents plan to go elsewhere to catch a glimpse of him. On Sunday, Father Staniszewski plans to take two busloads of parishioners to Doylestown, Pa., where Mr. Walesa is to attend a Mass at a Polish shrine.
Mr. Walesa chose not to run for Parliament last summer, but has maintained a strong influence on the government from his home in Gdansk. Many Polish-Americans in Greenpoint believe he made the right decision.
''He's a national figurehead,'' said Dr. Celmer. ''He represents - the Polish word is ruch oporu - the Underground, but you could also translate that to mean conscience.
''In those bleak times, he was the one who held fast. My personal opinion is he should not be in the government because he represents the Polish conscience, the movement. He should not become tainted by the everyday workings of government.''
Darek Sczepanczyk, who owns the Pol-Am Bookstore with his wife, said he wished the new non-Communist government well, but he added he was skeptical about its prospects for success, and about Mr. Walesa's role as the power behind the parliament. ''Basically people like him,'' he said, ''but there are a number of people who feel he's turned into a dictator, that we're talking about democracy but there is a strongman. I hope he knows what he's doing.''
Mr. Sczepanczyk conceded, however, that Mr. Walesa's status as an international figure holds advantages for Poland. ''He is a Nobel Prize winner and people know him,'' he said. ''Nobody can get things done for Poland as he can.''

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Jackson And the Democrats

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
Is Jesse Jackson, as he claims, entitled to a share of the credit for the recent election victories of David Dinkins in New York and Douglas Wilder in Virginia?
Mr. Wilder, the apparent victor in a close election for governor, certainly doesn't think so; indeed he regards the Jackson claim as ''amazing.'' Reverend Jackson, he says, gave him no help ''directly - or indirectly -that I know of.''
Nor does the record show that Mr. Jackson appeared with or on behalf of Mr. Wilder, or with any frequency or substantial impact for Mr. Dinkins, the Mayor-elect. And it has been frequently pointed out - in this column, for example - that both those candidates, though black, campaigned essentially as middle-of-the-road moderates with little of Mr. Jackson's fire and originality. 
Nevertheless, Jesse Jackson's claim seems justified to me. Had he not been as active and vocal in Democratic politics as he has been at least since 1984, David Dinkins and Douglas Wilder might well not even have been at the head of their party's tickets - and that is said with no intent to detract from the courageous, well-conceived and tightly managed campaigns each of them waged.
One of Mr. Jackson's contributions is obvious - voter registration. He has been highly successful in getting black voters to register and turn out on Election Day; it's not as clear but highly likely that he also encouraged a good many whites, particularly among the disadvantaged, to sign up. Not just Mr. Wilder and Mr. Dinkins, but numerous black and white Democratic officeholders owe more to Mr. Jackson's registration efforts than perhaps they care to admit. That's especially so in Southern states where most blacks and a lot of whites once were unable to vote.
But Mr. Jackson's greater contribution is less tangible - his presence in national politics as a black candidate not only able to win Presidential primaries and command a large bloc of delegates at a party convention, but as an articulate advocate of bold, often original economic and political approaches that appeal to white and black alike.
Can it really be doubted that that presence, striking as it has been, has made black candidacies more plausible, black political participation more effective, black political performance and aspiration more demanding of respect from all races? Jesse Jackson himself may never be President but he has made it considerably more likely that a black President can and probably will be elected in his lifetime - not to mention black governors and mayors.
It can be argued that had Mr. Jackson, who turns off a lot of white voters, remained a Chicago community leader unknown to national politics, black candidates like Mr. Wilder and Mr. Dinkins would have won by larger margins. Maybe; and no doubt that possibility is why both resisted Mr. Jackson's active support. The likelihood seems to me, nevertheless, that each won on his own merits, but not least because black candidacies everywhere had been made more credible by the success and obvious ability of Jesse Jackson.
The moderate, centrist appeal of Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Wilder is the best way to build the broad coalitions needed for victory on Election Day, former Gov. Charles Robb of Virginia pointed out the other day at a meeting of moderate, centrist Democrats. That's true; but a sharp-edged, issue-laden, occasionally radical approach is vital, too. Whether by Jesse Jackson or Ronald Reagan, such a candidacy gives American politics what ideological content it has, provides the goals toward which coalitions glacially move, and prevents the center - sometimes - from settling into an inert mass.
There's a warning here for those Democrats who urge Jesse Jackson to run for mayor of Washington D.C., mostly in hopes of keeping what they consider his divisive presence out of the Presidential campaign of 1992. Mr. Jackson, in fact, is his party's most charismatic figure; he upholds its best tradition of enlightened concern for the downtrodden; he leads one of its most important and loyal factions; and Governor Robb described him as a politician with more ''raw talent than anyone else on the scene.''
If he's divisive, it's mostly because his is one of the few voices in either party that has anything new or interesting to say about the nation's political and economic straits. That's always divisive, and needed.

HEADLINE: How About a Real Minimum Wage Increase?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Help, at Last, for the Working Poor'' announced your lead editorial Nov. 2, referring to the increase in the minimum wage and the expanded tax credits for low-income families. You agree with President Bush, who prefers tax credits to minimum-wage increases: ''Because most low-wage workers, like students, are not from poor families, lifting the minimum wage helps poor and nonpoor alike.''
If most low-wage workers are not from poor families, who are the working poor that will get this ''powerful relief''? Although there are students from nonpoor families in the work force, they by no means constitute the majority of low-wage workers. And surely you realize that there are working students from poor families - that not all students are middle class. 
If President Bush and you are afraid of the nonpoor benefiting from an increase in the minimum wage, check out the people at soup kitchens and food pantries. In New York State alone, there are 1,550 food pantries and 325 soup kitchens. The soup kitchens serve one million people annually, while the food pantries provide free food to 440,000 hungry each month. Between 20 and 30 percent of them are employed - or to be more precise, underemployed.
The figure for Americans at or below the poverty line is 13.1 percent; in the inner cities and in rural areas, that jumps to 18 percent. These numbers are considerably higher than the unemployment rate and reflect not only the chronically unemployed, but also the underemployed working poor, those whose minimum wages are not enough to raise them above the poverty level.
Figures are impersonal. I suggest that President Bush and you venture out into the real world of the hungry in our society and talk to people who must eat in soup kitchens and get free food from pantries. You might not then be so concerned about a few nonpoor students benefiting from a meaningful increase in the minimum wage.

HEADLINE: Administration Gives Momentum To a Vote on Puerto Rico's Status

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
The Bush Administration gave momentum this week to a Senate bill that would give Puerto Rico the right to decide if it is to be the 51st state, an independent country or remain a commonwealth, but with greater control over its own affairs.
The measure, endorsed by the White House, has already been approved by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and is expected to reach the Senate floor early next year. On the House side, the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs plans to hold hearings in early 1990 on similar legislation.
But the 3.3 million people on the Caribbean island are sharply split over the issue, and their Governor, Rafael Hernandez Colon, opposes the bill on two grounds. He is against statehood and feels that the bill unfairly tilts the referendum in favor of statehood. The bill would provide immediate benefits to Puerto Ricans but delay the costs, if the island becomes a state. The vote would be held in 1991. 
The Bush Administration readily admits it favors statehood. And that assertion was repeated this week by Kenneth W. Gideon, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for tax policy, in testimony to the Senate Finance Committee. ''As the President has noted a number of times,'' Mr. Gideon said, ''he favors the admission of Puerto Rico to the Union as a state, thereby assuring the people of Puerto Rico an equal standing with other U.S. citizens.''
 
'You Can't Have Both'
The chief sponsor of the Senate bill, Senator J. Bennett Johnston Jr., the Louisana Democrat who is chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has told the Puerto Ricans, ''You can't have both independence and the wealth of services,'' and added, ''Puerto Rico has to understand that it can't have its cake and eat it too.''
The island was ceded by Spain to the United States after the Spanish-American War in 1898 and became a commonwealth in 1952. The status gives Puerto Ricans all the usual obligations and privileges of citizenship except the right to vote in Federal elections and the duty to pay income taxes.
Statehood would mean the current $82 million ceiling for Federal money for welfare, Medicaid, food stamps and other social programs on the island would be removed. And Federal expenditures for these programs are expected to increase at least tenfold if Puerto Rico became a state.
But statehood would also mean the end of an estimated $2 billion a year in tax benefits intended to lure United States companies that invest in the island. That tax break is responsible for most of the economic investment in Puerto Rico. The Senate bill would phase out the tax break over a seven-year period.
Puerto Ricans would also lose their exemption from Federal income taxes, although the Senate bill would delay this provision until 1994.
 
High Rate of Unemployment
Governor Hernandez Colon argued that the big expected increase in Federal benefits would prove popular on the island, which has a per capita income of $5,157, less than half that of the rest of the United States, and an unemployment rate of 15 percent, almost triple the United States average.
The Senate measure, Governor Hernandez Colon said this week, ''obscures the true costs of statehood from the electorate.
''It camouflages, for them, the disastrous long-term economic consequences of statehood while spotlighting the prospect of immediate and dramatically higher welfare benefits,'' he added.
And the Governor emphasized the importance of the tax benefits for United States investors. ''This is not just another provision of the tax code, but rather the very foundation of the Puerto Rican economy,'' he said. ''Statehood would inevitably destroy that foundation.''
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, agreed that under the bill, ''statehood offers Puerto Ricans the prospect of immediate social welfare benefits but long-term economic losses.'' On the other hand, he said, ''Commonwealth promises long-term economic gains, but with no immediate social welfare enhancements.''
 
Champions of Statehood
The bill was strongly supported by two former Governors, Carlos Romero Barcelo and Luis A. Ferre, who are both champions of statehood.
''Congress is insuring the right of self-determination,'' Mr. Ferre told the Senate Finance Committee.
Mr. Barcelo said, ''We are living in one of democracy's finest hours.'' He noted that ''Europe's eastern bloc is moving en masse toward democracy,'' and said that in Asia, Africa and Central and South America, ''the people will not long be denied.''
''And, with this legislation, the longstanding promise of self-determination for the world's oldest colony finally will be realized for the 3.3 million American citizens living in Puerto Rico,'' he added.

In Quest of a Post-Cold War Plan

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Dennis Ross, the director of policy planning for the State Department, was musing the other day about the difficulties of doing any kind of advanced strategic planning for the Secretary of State at time when so many things are changing so fast.
''I had a friend of mine from the C.I.A. come down yesterday to give me a briefing on East Germany,'' remarked Mr. Ross. ''He told me that he revised his paper three times on the drive from the C.I.A. to the State Department just because of things he was hearing on the radio.''
''It gives you a flavor of what we're up against,'' he continued. ''The world is changing in very big ways, hour by hour. That keeps you humble when someone says, 'Please draw me up three scenarios for the future of Europe.' '' 
Indeed, as the cold war draws to a close, the members of today's policy planning staff find themselves in the same quandary as did their founding predecessors 42 years ago, when a devastated Europe was struggling to find a new postwar order.
 
Origin of Marshall Plan
In 1947, George Marshall, then Secretary of State, summoned a bright young Sovietologist to his office, told him to form a policy planning staff and in 10 days turn in a program for reconstructing the European continent. His only advice was two words: ''Avoid trivia.''
''I was supposed to review the whole great problem of European recovery,'' George F. Kennan, that young Sovietologist, recalled in his memoirs, ''to tap those various sources of outside advice, to present to the Secretary the recommendations he wanted, and be prepared to defend these recommendations against all governmental critics.''
Mr. Kennan somehow managed to pull it off, crystallizing ideas already proferred by Dean Acheson, John McCloy and Averell Harriman into what eventually became the Marshall Plan.
As the European order that Mr. Kennan and the other ''wise men'' helped to forge is rapidly dissolving, the State Department policy planners once again find themselves playing a central role at Foggy Bottom - but with one big difference.
 
Contrast in Missions
The policy planning bureau was created by Secretary Marshall at a time when American power was at its zenith, when Europe was begging for American leadership and there was a clear-cut enemy: the Communist world led by the Soviet Union. Now, the group must rethink the world for Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, providing visions of how Western and Eastern Europe can be peacefully reintegrated into a new European order, at a time when American power is more limited and when the enemies have not quite disappeared, but also aren't what they used to be.
''Be careful in drawing parallels with the past,'' said Mr. Ross in an interview in his office. ''The United States emerged from World War II with unparalleled power - politically, economically and miltarily. Today, we do not have unparalleled power. Policy planning is more complicated now. As we shape our responses, we have to recognize our real assets and our real strengths. That doesn't mean that we don't have a potential to lead, but that we have to lead in partnership.''
Even before the dramatic events of the last few weeks, Mr. Baker, who came into his job not entirely trusting the judgment or the capacity for ''new thinking'' of the State Department bureaucracy, had been using the 25-member policy planning staff as both his personal think tank and mini-State Department. This did not, to say the least, endear the policy planning staff to some Foreign Service veterans, who viewed Mr. Ross and his associates not only as outsiders but also as a group of still-wet-behind-the-ears whippersnappers with too much authority for their tender years.
Nevertheless, after several months of tension, a fairly amicable working relationship appears to have been established between policy planning and the rest of the building. Department veterans have learned that they must build alliances with the policy planning bureau to be effective, and policy planning has built alliances with the operating bureaus to get ideas carried out.
 
Crucial Role in Department
''Policy planning has become like a National Security Council staff for Baker - they don't just write speeches they actually micromanage certain policies,'' observed one State Department veteran. ''If you want to be influential these days, you better have a contact on policy planning -otherwise you will end up with the crumbs. We feed things into them but we don't always get fed back.''
''Let's keep our influence in perspective,'' counters Mr. Ross, who greets publicity with the enthusiasm normally reserved for a $100 parking fine. ''The best way to pursue policy is to insure that there is a marriage between the conceptual and the operational. Too often in the past there has been a total gap.''
Save for a brief two-year stint as director of the Berkeley-Stanford program on Soviet International Behavior, the 41-year-old Mr. Ross has been working in Washington since the early 1980's, first as a Middle East specialist on the policy planning staff of Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., then in the Pentagon and finally as the Middle East adviser to the N.S.C., where he came to know George Bush, and later, as Mr. Bush's senior campaign foreign policy adviser.
Mr. Ross's carefully balanced sense of the limits and opportunities, his penchant for policies with high potential gains and low domestic political risks, infuses Mr. Baker's approach to foreign affairs. It is, in many ways, the intellectual bond cementing their relationship.
The rest of the 25-member policy planning staff reflects Mr. Ross's eclectic background. There is a C.I.A. Sovietologist, Foreign Service veterans of Central America, an Air Force colonel, economists and environmentalists, as well as the only man in the State Department who has had almost as much written about himself in the last year as Mr. Baker: Francis Fukuyama. Mr. Fukuyama's essay, ''The End of History,'' about how Western liberal ideas have triumphed over their ideological competitors, has touched off a heated debate among intellectuals.
''We have a range of philosophies on the staff - from those who think we are at the end of history to those who think we are at the beginning of it,'' said Mr. Ross. ''I wanted people who did not reflect conventional thinking in their areas of the world, since the conventional thinking did not predict any of the changes we are now seeing.''
 
Preparing Strategies on Europe
Mr. Ross runs the policy planning staff in coordination with Mr. Baker's counselor, Robert Zoellick, a self-described ''36-year-old public policy junkie, with a background in law, finance and government,'' who oversees both the policy planning papers and all those from the rest of the State Department that go into Mr. Baker's office, thereby insuring that the ideas being generated by the policy planning staff are meshed with the department's day-to-day operations.
At the moment, the policy planning staff, in coordination with the European Affairs Bureau, is preparing strategies on Europe for Mr. Baker on three interrelated themes.
The first area that the staff is concentrating on involves ''trying to look at how you transform established institutions, such as NATO, to serve new missions that will fit the new era,'' explained Mr. Zoellick.
The Bush Administration is approaching the next phase in Europe's transformation with the assumption that no matter what happens with the Soviet military threat, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has to be maintained as a vehicle for managing change in a post-cold war Europe. With German reunification now a live, though still very remote possibility, Administration officials feel that NATO will be needed more than ever as the basis for a stabilizing American military presence, as a forum for alleviating friction among the allies and helping to constrain German influence and keep Germany securely under a Western umbrella.
The second area, consists of a series of papers examining how Eastern and Western Europe might be more closely reunited, as well as the different ways in which West and East Germany might choose to be reassociated.
 
How to Exercise Leadership
The third area being examined is how the United States, lacking the power it had 40 years ago, can continue to exert leadership in Europe.
''That means finding ways to impart leadership through the force of ideas,'' said Mr. Zoellick.
''People on the outside have a lot of illusions about how policy planning actually gets translated into policy,'' he continued. ''The truth is most of the people at the senior level of government don't always have a lot of time to sit down and reflect. Therefore a lot of new thinking, while it draws on prior reflection, tends to get fed into the policy makers in short conversations, or in a brief paper, or quick preparations for meetings.''
''I bet if you looked back at how NATO and the Marshall Plan were produced, though,'' he added, ''you'd find out that a lot of their concepts came together in conversations which took place in the hall.''

The Fire For Wood As Fuel Is Cooling

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIDDLEBURY, Vt., Nov. 16

 BODY:
There is a closet in John Illick's house where a wood stove used to be. For seven years, he and his wife, Beth, burned wood for primary heat in the long winters here, for economic and esthetic reasons. But the appeal began to wear thin. ''Wood is dirty and it's a lot of work,'' said Mr. Illick, who is a vice president at the Bread Loaf Construction Company. ''I got sick of vacuuming up the dirt and dust and bugs all the time! You end up jamming your fingers in the stove while you're loading it and swearing a lot. My daughter, Adrienne, tripped and burned her face on it.''
When the Illicks renovated their house two years ago, the stove went. 
There was a time after the Arab oil embargo when wood seemed the answer, when many Vermonters had more time than money, when ''renewable resources'' was the battle cry.
But that was before doctors warned of the respiratory hazards of wood smoke and states began to regulate wood-stove emissions. It was also a time when oil prices were high.
''When the price of oil and other fuels started to go back down, wood was no longer a tremendous cost saving,'' said Mr. Illick. ''If the price of oil went back up, would I go back to wood? Well, there's a closet there now, so it's a moot point.''
The Green Mountain Power Corporation surveyed its customers this year and found that only 16 percent used wood as the primary source of heat, as against 33 percent five years ago.
Figures compiled by the state's Conservation and Renewable Energy Unit indicate that Vermonters, over all, burned 323,000 cords of wood in the 1987-88 heating season, 36 percent less than the 503,000 cords of the 1981-82 season.
''While the state is still actively promoting the use of wood, it's true that fewer and fewer people are using it,'' said Stuart Slote, the wood specialist for the state agency.
Stephen Morris, vice president for sales and marketing of Vermont Castings Inc., a wood-stove manufacturer, has seen many competitors go out of business. He said Vermont Castings has stayed afloat, has in fact grown by expanding its market overseas and emphasizing the smaller, fancier stoves that appeal to owners of second homes. ''The market has moved upscale to enameled, highly efficient models,'' he said. ''A lot of people who used to burn wood for primary heat are becoming recreational wood burners.''
Roger Mann Jr. has been in the wood business in Waterville for 15 years. As the price of diesel fuel, chain saws and log skidders has gone up, so has his price for a cord of wood - ''$85 in the country and a city fee when I deliver around Burlington.'' He travels as much as 300 miles a day, making three round trips to Burlington.
''In the early 80's,'' he said, ''I'd take my customers a load of logs, and they'd have a chain saw and a splitter to cut it up. Now they want their wood already split. I see a lot of splitters and chain saws just sitting in the corner. They're expensive pieces of equipment.''
To be sure, wood still has its fans. Robert Sherman, a lobbyist who lives in Washington, Vt., owns 400 acres and burns about eight cords of wood a year to heat his house. ''I love to cut wood,'' he said. ''It's great exercise. I love being in the woods and cutting it and splitting it - the whole process. I also love the fact that you never have to worry what the thermostat is set at.''
More typical is Rodney Morris, a teacher. Once, when he wanted heat, he would wad newspapers, pile kindling on top of them and chunks of wood on top of that. Sometimes the wood was dry. More often it wasn't. It would splutter and steam before it caught. He couldn't travel in the winter: his pipes might freeze and burst.
''I was tired of water all over the floor from the melting ice because I never had my wood under cover,'' he said. ''I was tired of competing with the stove for the available oxygen in the house. The last straw was realizing how many burn holes there were in the linoleum in front of the stove.'' Now he has a propane heater. Just turn the dial.

The Government Seeks to Stop the Decline In Industry Before It Leads to a Rebellion

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Czechoslovakia is like a young man who inherits a fortune from his grandfather and fritters it away, dissipating the capital instead of investing it wisely. Two generations ago, at the time of World War I, this was a rich country, with two-thirds of the industrial capacity of the entire Austro-Hungarian Empire concentrated in Bohemia and Moravia, which make up the western two-thirds of Czechoslovakia. The Skoda armaments works and the Bata shoe factories were world famous.
The region was comparable to Pittsburgh or Manchester or the Ruhr. 
Now Czechoslovak industry is inefficient, old-fashioned and undercapitalized. Soft coal still turns many wheels; its soot and its smell are everywhere. The famous glass industry, which once taught the world, is trapped in the styles and technology of the 1930's. The machine-tool industry cannot supply the computer-driven elements that can be ordered from Japan or West Germany. And things are getting worse. If the Communist Government cannot halt the rot, and many of its own economists doubt that it can, it will eventually be unable to deliver on its side of the bargain that has kept the Czechoslovak public quiet for the last two decades: We'll keep your standard of living up, and you leave the political decisions in our hands.
 
Threat to the Social Contract
So far, Czechoslovak consumers have been served. There were lines outside a greengrocer's shop on Narodni Street on Monday, but they were not terribly long, and there were plenty of oranges, grapefruit and lemons available. Most manufactured goods are dowdy or shabby or both - skimpy towels, tinny pans, rough gray writing paper, oafish shoes. A grandmother, looking for children's books for Christmas presents in a shop near Wenceslaus Square on Tuesday, shook her head at the pitifully small selection that was available.
Still, most shelves are full, and Government subsidies keep prices low. A bottle of decent Moravian wine can be bought for $3 retail, for example.
Now, the underpinnings are threatened, and with them the unwritten, unspoken contract between the rulers and ruled. The economies of the Soviet Union and Poland, both prime trading partners, are in tatters. The spread of peace in various parts of the world has hit hard at Czechoslovak munitions plants, like those in Brno that produce automatic rifles.
Many Arab countries have turned out to be customers who don't pay on time. So feelers have gone out from an increasingly desperate Government to what a Western diplomat calls ''the kind of ideologically unsound countries that they'd never have done business with in better times'' - Taiwan, South Korea and Chile.
 
Revisions and Inflation
Even Israel. Edgar Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress, was in town this week talking to the leadership about a number of matters and Israel, he said, ''would be the ideal kind of trade partner for them.''
Extensive revisions have also been proposed in the domestic economy, including limited authority for managers of state enterprises to hire and fire employees. So far, most American experts who have examined the plants have been unimpressed, largely because of the absence of entrepreneurial elements.
What Mikos Jakes and the rest of the Czechoslovak leadership are trying to do is what the Yugoslavs and the Hungarians have already failed to do: restructure the economy without setting off an inflationary spiral and without lowering the standard of living. Both of those countries have considerably more political and economic flexibility in their systems than Czechoslovakia.
It will not be easy, even in a nation with a 150-year legacy of industrial skills and enterprise.
 
'Words Aren't Enough Anymore'
''If the new ideas don't work,'' a prominent Czechoslovak journalist said, ''then you'll see people in the streets. People here are bourgeois. We tend to think about a roof over our heads and a meal on our plates before we think about abstract ideals. So we look around, we like our situation better than Poland's, where there's nothing to eat, or Hungary's, where it costs too much.
''Those are essentially aristocratic countries, where people are willing, even happy, to live on debt and glory in a way that we're not.''
A middle-level hotel employee said: ''Words aren't enough anymore. I admire Vaclav Havel and the other dissidents, sure, but I won't raise my head above the wall until they show me that they can run things.''
All of that would probably change, of course, if Poland or Hungary or East Germany showed marked economic progress over the next year. The Czechoslovaks are accustomed to comparing themselves to the Austrians and the Germans, not the Russians and the Bulgarians, and the stirring that is palpable today could become an earthquake if Mr. Jakes or his successor lets Czechoslovakia, an island of resistance to change in a changing Europe, fall behind the others.
Mr. Dienstbier, a wry man, sat in his center-city apartment the other night and told of a visit from an elderly Communist, a former Politburo member, still a member of Parliament.
''For 40 years,'' the dissident said, laughing, ''this man has known when the wind was shifting. He's never been wrong. So if he wants to know me now, he must see something that isn't obvious to us yet. It must mean that the sleepy Czechs are awakening.''

Walesa Warns on Reunification Of Germany, Citing Hitler's Rule

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Lech Walesa, the founder of the Solidarity movement in Poland, gave a sharp warning today against any early consideration of the reunification of Germany.
In a talk to the National Press Club here, Mr. Walesa, who is on a weeklong visit to the United States, applauded the changes occurring throughout Eastern Europe. But when asked about reuniting East Germany and West Germany, he offered the long-held Polish wariness of a united nation. 
''This is a bomb,'' he said of the issue. ''We paid a heavy price for the existence of Hitler. I do not need to say how heavy.''
In addition to the heavy casualties the Polish people suffered during World War II at the hands of Hitler, he said, ''there was a second nation on Polish soil, the Jewish nation, and it disappeared.''
''We have to do everything to avoid repeating mistakes,'' he said.
 
A Step Before Reunification
Mr. Walesa said that with the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe, he favored moves toward an economically united Europe. Only then could German reunification be considered.
Earlier, he told a small audience at the Board of International Broadcasting that ''we cannot make a mistake here'' when asked about reunifying Germany. ''We have had enough of bad solutions. We should leave the political situation as it is now.''
Mr. Walesa told the National Press Club audience that if Europe could be integrated economically, the issue of German borders would naturally arise because the current situation is ''artificial.''
''Economic integration will necessarily be followed by political integration,'' he said. ''If we try to do it in reverse, it will inevitably lead to disaster.''
 
An Electrician With Influence
Mr. Walesa sought to soften his harsh words by concluding with a smile, ''Of course, this is only the opinion of an electrician.'' But while he is indeed a former electrician and while he holds no official Government position, he remains the most influential public figure in Poland.
Mr. Walesa has been a relentless salesman during his visit, urging American entrepreneurs to invest in Poland.
''The Iron Curtain is no more,'' he said at the press club. ''We have fought and we have won, but the victory is mostly a theoretical victory.'' He said it amounted to ''a beautiful house of cards'' that would collapse without a lot of American aid and investment.
On Wednesday, in a speech to a joint session of Congress, Mr. Walesa called for an investment and loan program along the lines of the Marshall Plan, which was used to help rebuild Western Europe after World War II.
At today's luncheon, when the moderator announced that the program was over, Mr. Walesa interrupted and complained cheerfully that no one had asked him a question that allowed him to make a sales pitch, which he then offered.
 
The Question of Anti-Semitism
Mr. Walesa's remarks about the fate of Polish Jews prompted him to complain about what he said was the chronic accusation that Poles have been anti-Semitic. He said, ''This is something we cannot catch up with, cannot eliminate.''
''In Poland all or nearly all the Jews were murdered,'' he said. ''Of course, there were some pigs, as there are pigs everywhere, but not the whole country.''
''Cohabitation with Jews was profitable'' for Poles, he said. ''For Jews cohabitation with Poles was profitable. Please stop those who, even today, try to play the political card of anti-Semitism.''

NATO Officials See Role in Transition of Europe

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Playing down its traditional role as a military alliance, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has begun arguing that it is the instrument through which the United States and Western Europe can best manage the political transition of Eastern Europe.
Senior NATO officials here said a strong Western alliance remained essential, not only as a shield against possible outbreaks of violent unrest in Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union but also as a framework for negotiating the terms of any future reunification of Germany.
''At a time of generalized euphoria, it is our job to be cautious and prudent,'' one official said. ''We have to adjust to events, but we can't lower our guard.'' 
The officials further noted that it was vital for the United States to participate in the reshaping of Europe and that this was only possible through NATO. ''Take away the United States and a decisive factor of stability in Europe has gone,'' said NATO's secretary general, Manfred Worner.
 
Defining Its Role
NATO's sudden need to redefine its role in more political terms reflects the tremendous impact that recent events in Eastern Europe have had on an organization that had come to view the Berlin wall as the ultimate symbol of its reason for existence. With the Soviet military threat seen to be shrinking as democracy spreads through Eastern Europe, the alliance has had to come up with reasons to justify why it continues to be necessary.
The 16-nation alliance, which for most of the last four decades has represented the West in its dealing with the East, is also now being quietly challenged for leadership by the European Community. Several European governments believe the Community should even assume some security responsibilities so that Europeans - and not Americans or Soviets - can design the new Europe.
In reality, 11 of the 12 members of the Community are also in NATO. But that coincidence has not sufficed to eliminate tensions because, while the United States belongs only to the alliance, France, which is currently president of the European Community and is strongly committed to promoting a European solution, has only limited participation in NATO.
Worried that the Soviet and American Presidents will make crucial decisions about Europe without consulting Europeans when they meet off Malta on Dec. 2 and 3, President Francois Mitterrand of France has invited other Community leaders for dinner in Paris Saturday to prepare their own strategy for Eastern Europe.
 
A Briefing in Brussels
The United States, in contrast, still prefers to work through NATO, where its influence remains enormous. And, to reinforce this position, either President Bush or his Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, is expected to travel to Brussels to brief NATO ministers on the outcome of the Malta summit on Dec. 4.
''There is a temptation, particularly among some European members, to use other, smaller focus for collective approaches to common problems,'' said William H. Taft IV, the chief United States delegate to NATO. ''Whichever course is chosen, our concern is that European unity not be purchased at the expense of Atlantic cooperation.''
Many NATO officials in fact believe the alliance's importance will grow as developments in Eastern Europe bring new tensions to a European Community already strained by disagreements over the speed and extent of its own economic and political integration.
''I even have my doubts that the process of the political-economic reunification of Europe would continue without the umbrella of NATO, without the commitment of the United States,'' Mr. Worner said in an interview.
 
Question of Reunification
Specifically, some officials believe the military-political nature of NATO will enable it to handle the delicate question of German reunification more easily than the European Community, where some countries are already worried whether they can avoid being totally dominated by a single Germany.
''A strong NATO can act as a counter-balance to German might,'' one official said. ''In fact, there are some European governments that want the United States to stay in Europe to protect them as much from the Germans as from the Soviets.''
Another Western defense analyst said that although the Bonn Government had repeated its commitments to both NATO and the European Community, the alliance would nonetheless have to reduce the political and even psychological burden to West Germany of membership of NATO.
Already this year, Bonn successfully demanded that NATO postpone a decision on modernizing short-range nuclear weapons currently stationed on its territory. Now, with German reunification the talk of Europe, the expert said Bonn's acceptance of a new generation of missiles ''that only kill Germans'' was virtually impossible.

HEADLINE: CLAMOR IN THE EAST;
Europeans Press Case For Shaping the Future

BYLINE: By SHEILA RULE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
As the European Community prepares to meet over the dramatic developments in East Germany, politicians and commentators say that its 12 member countries hope to make clear the importance of their role in fashioning Europe's future before the meeting next month between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Some analysts said they thought the hastily called summit meeting in Paris on Saturday would give the Europeans a chance to organize their positions and remind the superpowers that the first major response to the developments in Eastern Europe should come from the countries most affected.
Analysts said the community wanted to avoid a situation that developed during the superpower summit in October 1986 in which President Reagan agreed to remove cruise missiles stationed in Europe without first consulting his European allies.
On a visit to West Berlin today, the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said the European Community must quickly decide the framework within which to deal with Eastern European countries emerging into democracy. 
 
Membership for the East Bloc
In Bonn earlier in the day, Mr. Hurd did not rule out eventual European Community membership for countries like Hungary and Poland when they became fully democratic. But echoing Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, he said the first step ''will probably be some form of associate membership,'' similar to that enjoyed by Turkey.
The Paris summit meeting is seen by some commentators as an attempt by President Francois Mitterrand of France to deal with the German question quickly and keep the agenda of the European Community's meeting in Strasbourg in December clear for two projects he favors, European monetary union and a European social charter.
Those analysts said President Mitterrand hoped that accelerated steps toward monetary and economic union in Europe would lock West Germany into the union and prevent the Community's plans from being derailed by East European revisions.
Developments in Eastern Europe, and the West's reaction to them, continue to dominate headlines, editorials, news bulletins and political commentary in Western Europe. An editorial in El Pais, Madrid's leading newspaper, said there were ''two contradictory attitudes among European political circles: joy at the progress of democracy'' and ''concern, even anguish over the expiration of political and mental structures.''
 
No Talk of Dissolving NATO
In Belgium, political comment has turned cautious after the initial euphoria produced by television images of the breaching of the Berlin wall. The Christian Democrat-Socialist coalition Government of Prime Minister Wilfried Martens, while welcoming the change, has emphasized that prudence in the face of an uncertain future is the best policy.
Defense Minister Guy Coeme of Belgium, who is a Socialist, has said that prospects for a settlement at negotiations on reduction of conventional forces had dramatically improved because of events in Germany but that there were currently no plans for decreases in defense spending, and there is almost no talk of dissolving NATO or reducing the 24,000 Belgian troops stationed in West Germany.
In Italy, Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti told Parliament on Wednesday that events in Eastern Europe had made it ''our obligation to accelerate the pace of European construction,'' despite the resistance of those countries that ''are not so much against economic and monetary union as against the very concept of European union.''
Sergio Romano, an editorial writer for the Turin daily La Stampa and a former Ambassador to Moscow, said in a telephone interview that in light of the summit meeting, he was writing an editorial that warned that ''Europeans must not frustrate German aspirations to unity.''
''Surely, a certain preoccupation is justified,'' Mr. Romano said. ''But not to the extent of creating a frustrated Germany again. We've seen frustrated Germans before.''
''This is a unique historical opportunity for political unity, not only monetary unity, which Europe must not miss,'' he said. ''The two superpowers will step back and a new space will be there to fill in. It is the time for Europeans to fill that space.''

HEADLINE: KILLING OF PRIESTS DENOUNCED BY U.S.

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
The Bush Administration today condemned the killing of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador and said it had asked President Alfredo Cristiani to order a full inquiry.
The State Department spokesman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said the United States did not yet know who was responsible for the killings, apart from circumstantial evidence from El Salvador of Army involvement. The Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, the Jesuit Provincial for Central America, said that the victims were tortured before they were killed, but this could be not independently confirmed.
''We do not know who committed this barbarous act, which we condemn in the strongest possible terms,'' Miss Tutwiler said. Other State Department officials said that William J. Walker, the American Ambassador, had raised the matter today with President Cristiani. 
''We made the point that there has to be the fullest inquiry and certainly a rapid one,'' one American official said. ''Cristiani said he was undertaking a complete investigation.''
In El Salvador, Eduardo Valdez, the director of Jesuit studies there, said that the Jesuits had received many anonymous threats in recent days and that a rightist death squad was probably responsible for the killings. But a Jesuit priest who asked not to be identified said that a witness at the site of the killings saw about 30 uniformed soldiers enter the university grounds and the priests' residence shortly before shots were heard.
In a letter today to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, the human rights organization America's Watch said circumstantial evidence indicated that the Salvadoran military carried out the killings. It called on the Bush Administration to take ''firm and immediate measures'' to prevent further slayings.
Citing reports from church officials in El Salvador, the letter said that a large contingent of soldiers had surrounded the Jesuit university grounds for the last several days. It said that the soldiers had searched the Jesuit rectory where the priests were killed while the Rev. Ignacio Ellacuria, one of the priests killed, was present.
''We call upon the United States to denounce these killings and to insist on punishment of the soldiers responsible,'' the letter to Mr. Baker said.
If the Salvadoran military played a role in the killings, the Bush Administration will come under pressure from Congress and human rights organizations to suspend American military aid to El Salvador.
Miss Tutwiler confirmed that the Salvadoran military had asked for arms and ammunition to help beat back a rebel offensive, and she said that the Administration was ''moving to address their needs.''
In 1980, under President Carter, the United States briefly suspended new military and economic aid to El Salvador pending a clarification of the role of Salvadoran security forces in the killing of three American nuns and a lay missionary.
When the Reagan Administration took over, it initially blamed ''right wing'' elements for the murders. It was later determined that those religious workers were killed by National Guard troops, who were eventually prosecuted and convicted.
At a hearing on Friday, the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs will question the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Bernard W. Aronson, on the slaying of the priests and the escalating violence in El Salvador.
''I am devastated by these cold-blooded murders, which appear intended to silence human rights activity in El Salvador,'' said Senator Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee.
''I appeal most urgently for an end to the fighting and for a cease-fire so that civilian wounded can be evacuated, he said, ''and ask that those responsible for these murders be brought to justice as swiftly as possible.''

HEADLINE: 6 PRIESTS KILLED IN A CAMPUS RAID IN SAN SALVADOR

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Six Jesuit priests, including the rector of a leading university, were killed here before dawn today by what one witness described as a group of 30 men dressed in military uniforms.
Most of the priests were dragged from their beds in cubicles in a dormitory at the Jose Simeon Canas University of Central America on the outskirts of the capital and shot in the head with high-powered rifles, apparently of the same type issued by the army. The Jesuits' cook and her 15-year-old daughter were also shot to death.
''They were assassinated with lavish barbarity'' said the Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, the Jesuit Provincial for Central America. ''For example, they took out their brains.'' 
 
Torture Is Reported
He said the victims were tortured before they were killed, though this could not be independently confirmed.
In Washington, the Bush Administration condemned the killings ''in the strongest possible terms,'' and said it had asked the Salvadoran President, Alfredo Cristiani, to make a full inquiry. [Page A12.] Colleagues of the dead priests and some human rights monitors blamed the army or right-wing death squads for the killings, which provoked outrage here. They noted that only Government forces were able to move freely during the dawn-to-dusk curfew now in effect.
 
Government Vows Inquiry
The Government denied it was responsible and denounced the killings. It promised an investigation and said the rebels had the most compelling motive for the slayings, strongly hinting that the rebels were responsible.
If the army is found to have been responsible for the killings, this would probably cause severe strains in its relations with the United States, which has been the Salvadoran Government's chief supporter for more than a decade. It has supplied the Government with hundreds of millions of dollars in military and economic aid and an American military advisory team has been involved for most of that period in helping to train Salvadoran armed forces.
The killings came during a major military offensive by leftist guerrillas that began on Saturday night and has touched off the fiercest fighting in the decade-old civil war, which has claimed 70,000 lives.
 
Soldiers Ring University
A letter issued in Washington by Americas Watch, a human rights organization, said that for the last several days, a large contingent of soldiers had surrounded the Jesuit university grounds and that a group of soldiers had searched the rectory where the priests were killed.
Persuasive evidence has often linked the army and the governing party -the Nationalist Republican Alliance, known by its Spanish acronym, Arena - to the death squads. In the early 1980's, they marked for assassination those who tried to organize the left or criticize the right.
Until the shootings today, the most notorious attack occurred in March 1980 when Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero of San Salvador was shot to death as he was saying Mass in the chapel of a hospital. Political opponents of Roberto d'Aubuisson, the leader of Arena, accused him of responsibility for the killing.
The victims of today's killings included Ignacio Ellacuria Beas Coechea, the rector of the university, who was a critic of right-wing violence; Ignacio Martin-Baro, the Vice Rector and a leading expert on Salvadoran public opinion, and Segundo Montes, the dean of the school's department of social sciences. The three other slain priests were identified by colleagues as Joaquin Lopez y Lopez, Amando Lopez and Juan Ramon Moreno. The Jesuit's cook, Julia Elba Ramos, and her daughter, Celina, were found shot to death in the bed they shared.
''They did not want to leave witnesses,'' said Eduardo Valdez, director of Jesuit studies at the university, which is considered one of the best in the region.
An employee of the university who said he saw the killings of the six priests told their colleagues that about 30 men broke into the back of the rectory shortly after 3 A.M.
According this account, the intruders tossed a bomb into the one-story, stucco building, and shot two of the priests in their sleeping cubicles and then killed the cook and her daughter.
Colleagues of the victims said the witness had told them that the three other priests were dragged from their beds. The attackers then went next door to Father Ellacuria's small home, gathered the four men on the lawn and killed them.
A sign left with the bodies saying the killings were the work of rebels was being widely dismissed by the colleagues of the priests as amateurish dissimulation.
 
'Crime of Such Repugnance'
The United States Ambassador, William J. Walker, denounced the crime and said it played into the hands of the rebels. But he acknowledged that an investigation would be almost impossible during the current heavy fighting.
''This is a crime of such repugnance that to say that I condemn or deplore seems inadequate,'' he said in a briefing. ''It is a barbaric act that has brought shame to El Salvador.''
''I have difficulty in imagining what sort of animals would, in cold blood, execute priests, and other innocents,'' he said.
The killings came a day after Mr. d'Aubuisson issued a thinly veiled threat against rebel sympathizers. He warned Salvadorans who had known about the coming rebel offensive but had not informed the Government. In the past, death squads have often followed up similar warnings by killing those Mr. d'Aubuisson had publicly criticized.
In testimony before a Congressional committee, Robert White, the former United States Ambasador to Salvador, referred to Mr. d'Aubuisson as a ''pathological killer,'' saying the State Department had ''compelling if not 100 percent convincing evidence'' that he had ordered the killing of Archbishop Romero. Had Been Shunned by U.S. Mr. d'Aubuisson had been shunned by American officials since 1984 when the United States learned that he had reportedly ordered the killing of Thomas Pickering, then the American Ambassador. That policy of ostracism was ended when Vice President Quayle met with Mr. d'Aubuisson last June.
The university, which was started as an alternative to the radicalized National University, is one of the most highly respected in Central America. But for more than a decade the extreme right has accused its Jesuit teachers of favoring the rebels and fostering subversion.

HEADLINE: DIALOGUE ON CHANGING SOVIET FORCES - IS MOSCOW CUTTING ITS MILITARY?;
Yes, By Necessity

BYLINE: By Barry M. Blechman; Barry M. Blechman is chairman of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a research and educational organization.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
State Department analysts have concluded that Soviet military spending will decline in 1989, to between 14 and 16 percent of gross national product, down from 15 to 17 percent in 1988. While this conclusion is disputed by others in the Government, the evidence is overwhelming.
Less than a year after Mikhail Gorbachev's surprise announcement of dramatic cuts in his military forces, reductions in Soviet military deployments and operations are accelerating rapidly. The cutbacks, which will bite deeply into important Soviet military capabilities, are the result of necessity, not choice. 
By cutting military spending, Mr. Gorbachev hopes to free the capital, skilled manpower and technology needed for modernizing the sick Soviet economy. By moderating Western perceptions of the Soviet military threat, Mr. Gorbachev no doubt hopes that the cutbacks also will help his nation gain greater access to Western technology, capital and expertise.
Whatever the reason, the cutbacks - and further cuts sure to come -will diminish significantly the Soviet threat to vital Western interests in several categories, including:
Ground and air forces. Unilateral cutbacks amount to perhaps 15 percent of Soviet forces. Roughly one-half the total reductions of 500,000 personnel - including 100,000 officers - will come in Eastern Europe and the European portions of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1990, 10,000 tanks, 8,500 artillery pieces and 800 aircraft will have been removed.
When completed in 1990, the reductions - estimated by a House Armed Services Committee delegation to reduce Soviet capabilities in Eastern Europe by 20 to 25 percent - will make it impossible for Moscow to mount a surprise attack in Europe.
Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev has stated that annual tank production would drop to 1,700 in 1989, one-half the number that the U.S. says were produced annually, on average, between 1986 and 1988. Western intelligence sources confirm that Soviet tank production is declining.
Naval forces. According to a Defense Department publication, ''Soviet Military Power,'' Soviet naval activity outside home waters has dropped by 15 percent, and further cuts can be expected. Even at current production rates, Moscow is not producing warships and submarines fast enough to maintain the strength of its rapidly aging fleet. And Soviet civilian analysts say that the next five-year plan includes major cutbacks in shipbuilding. Western observers already have noted delays in completing Moscow's first large aircraft carrier and slowdowns in submarine production.
Nuclear Forces. Although the Kremlin continues to operate formidable modern missile forces, it is phasing out older nuclear forces. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Soviet nuclear stockpile peaked in 1988; substantial reductions can be expected in coming years.
Programs to deploy modern weapons also are being cut back. For example, the Soviet Blackjack bomber, long expected as a counter to our B-1, is apparently being abandoned.
Obviously, not all weapon programs will be terminated. The Soviet Defense Minister, Dmitri Yazov, said in early October that Moscow would continue developing and producing new variants of strategic missiles. The appearance of a new model of the SS-18 - much remarked upon by conservatives - confirms this position.
On the other hand, many futuristic weapon programs appear to have been abandoned. ''Soviet Military Power,'' for example, makes little or no mention of a follow up to the SS-24, a new class of strategic submarines, new submarine-launched cruise and ballistic missiles or the SA-X-12, a surface-to-air missile. Each of these strategic systems previously was said to be under development.
Clearly, Mr. Gorbachev's initiatives have opened the door for negotiated reductions that would complement and reinforce the radical political changes underway in Eastern Europe. Yet, we should not respond to the unilateral Soviet cutbacks with unilateral cuts in our own forces. Instead, we should seek to pocket the concessions already made, before Mr. Gorbachev's enthusiasm for the talks fades in the face of growing opposition from the military.
Defense Minister Yazov has said that Moscow could cut its defense spending by 50 percent if the negotiations are successful. We should not disappoint the Minister; both countries could make productive use of the resources.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has ordered the nation's armed services to draw up plans for cutting $180 billion in projected spending, reflecting the Bush Administration's judgment that Federal deficits and political changes in Europe are leading toward a smaller Pentagon budget.
In addition, Mr. Cheney appears prepared to accept a decline in military spending in the fiscal year 1991 after inflation is taken into account, a senior Administration official said. The Administration will present its 1991 spending plan to Congress in January.
The $180 billion in cuts by the services would cover Pentagon spending from the fiscal years 1992 through 1994. It would represent an average annual drop of about 5 percent in spending after inflation over the three-year period, Administration officials said. President Bush had previously proposed increases of 1 or 2 percent in each of these years. 
 
No Decision at Hand
A senior Pentagon official said Mr. Cheney has made no decision on whether to go forward with all the $180 billion in reductions and added that the exercise is intended to force the services to identify their priorities and to set an outer limit for negotiating somewhat less extensive trims.
Administration officials said a $180 billion reduction could mean extensive base closings, deactivation of several Army divisions and the retirement of two or three aircraft carriers. That would mark a retrenchment equivalent to the decline that followed the Vietnam War. A Pentagon official said, however, that if the cuts were enacted, the Defense Department would do everything it could to avoid reductions in forces by paring spending on maintenance and on installations.
 
One of Potential Sources of Cuts
But this official and other Administration specialists said the orders were significant because they represent a recognition that the twin pressures of budget deficits and political changes in Europe have eroded Mr. Bush's earlier plans for slow, steady growth in the Pentagon budget.
With the White House committed not to increase taxes, cuts in military spending represent one of the few potential sources of money to pay for Administration programs that Mr. Bush has begun with great fanfare but limited financing, including his effort to combat drug abuse. The military budget represents about a quarter of total Federal spending but has well over half the money available for reductions because programs like Medicare and Social Social Security have been relatively politically difficult to cut.
''We have got to be prepared for the inevitable, instead of waiting for it to happen and doing the cuts in haste,'' a senior Pentagon official said.
''This is quite serious,'' another official said. ''It is not a game.''
 
'Worst-Case Scenario'
Another senior official in a military service termed the proposed $180 billion cuts a ''worst-case scenario'' intended to produce options for Mr. Cheney, but added: ''This is not a bookkeeping exercise. My sense is that if we do not take the bull by the horns we will be gored by it.''
Sean O'Keefe, the Pentagon's comptroller, sent a directive to the services Monday night ordering them to devise plans for cuts by today because the recent changes in Eastern Europe added new momentum to the growing movement on Capitol Hill for significant reductions in the military budget.
The Pentagon comptroller's directive was intended in part to change the Pentagon ''culture'' in which the military based plans on the assumption that military spending would steadily increase in the future, officials said.
 
'Not All Asleep at the Switch'
''What this indicates is that we are not all asleep at the switch,'' an official said. ''This building is going through culture shock. The services have always assumed you have got to produce some kind of growth out there.''
Members of Congress have warned in recent days that East Germany's decision to open its border to the West will lead to a further erosion of public support for military spending. By some estimates, about 60 percent of military spending is devoted to the defense of Western Europe.
Cuts in American military spending will come at a time when the Soviet Union is beginning to make its own cuts in military spending, apparently fulfilling the promises made by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader. Mr. Gorbachev has said the Soviet Union will cut its military spending by 14.2 percent. Soviet officials said the cuts will occur over three years, beginning with a 1.5 percent cut in 1989, 7 percent in 1990 and 5.7 in 1991.
Conservative members of Congress, like Senator Jim Exon, a Nebraska Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said the Pentagon must now be prepared to accept cuts after inflation of up to 5 percent over the next several years.
''I would say that if the Defense Department suffered only a 2 percent per year annual cut over the next five years, it would be a miracle,'' said Senator Exon, who heads the Armed Services' Subcommittee on Strategic Forces and Nuclear Deterrence. ''There is a general perception in the land that peace has broken out all over. The public will demand, and the Congress will respond in some fashion.''
Mr. Bush pledged strong support for military spending in last year's Presidential election campaign, portraying Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts as soft on the military.
 
Temper Spending Plans
But the growing Federal deficit is forcing the Bush Administration to temper its plans, Administration officials said.
Mr. Bush has proposed spending about $295 billion on the military in fiscal 1990, which keeps pace with inflation. Congress is the process of approving the fiscal 1990 spending plan.
The Administration is now preparing its military spending request for fiscal 1991, which will be reviewed by the Cabinet in early December and sent to Congress in January.
Mr. Bush had projected a $311 billion Pentagon budget for fiscal 1991, a 1 percent increase on top of inflation.
One Pentagon official said, however, that preliminary cuts of $13 billion to $14 billion have been identified in the projected spending for fiscal 1991, although the military services are expected to appeal some of the cuts.
Pentagon officials are considering a range of options, including a cut of 3 to 4 percent in the fiscal 1991 budget after the effects of inflation are taken into account. Already, the fiscal 1990 budget now before Congress marks the fifth consecutive year that military spending has decreased after the effects of inflation are discounted.
Cuts of the magnitude under discussion are likely to force members of Congress to make an unpleasant choice between closing bases and canceling weapons that provide work for large numbers of constituents.
''Cheney is right,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who serves on the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Defense. ''There are bases that will have to be closed, and we're going to have to accept that. We're not going to be able to just stretch out procurement costs to save money.
 
'Some Serious Choices'
''There will be some serious choices about cutting whole systems,'' Mr. Leahy continued, ''and that's going to hurt some companies that are major employers in member's districts.''
''We can't do this by nickel and diming,'' Senator Leahy said.
Representative Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin, has said that next year's spending plan will be the first ''Gorbachev-driven budget,'' an allusion to the political changes encouraged in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe by Mr. Gorbachev. Other lawmakers agreed, but said that the deficit remains a significant factor pushing military spending downward.
Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, said the tide had shifted in Congress for lower spending. He expressed concern that Congress was being overwhelmed by a ''1935-style isolationism'' but said Pentagon budgets of zero real growth could be preserved if Mr. Bush exerts vigorous leadership.

 CORRECTION:
A headline in some editions on Saturday, with an article about the reduction in spending that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has ordered the armed services to plan for, misstated the percentage of the reduction. With inflation taken into account, it would average about 5 percent annually for the fiscal years 1992 through 1994.

HEADLINE: Doors Closing as Mood on the Homeless Sours

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER

 BODY:
As New Yorkers become increasingly disturbed and exasperated by the overwhelming presence of homeless people, more and more public institutions are adopting policies intended to keep out the homeless.
Dr. Kim Hopper, an assistant professor of anthropology at the New School who has extensively studied the homeless, said the new policies reflected the public's growing sense of helplessness.
''They're thinking,'' Dr. Hopper said, '' 'It's still going on after all these years and after all this money has been poured into it, maybe it's time to get tough.' The public is being misled into thinking that these folks have had their chance.''
The tougher attitude is particularly evident in the city's transportation centers. 
Last month the transit police began enforcing rules that prohibit behavior like begging, lying down or sleeping in subway stations or cars. At the same time, efforts are being made to coax homeless people from the stations and into shelters. Advocates for the homeless say, however, the rules have the effect of forcing homeless people out of certain stations in Manhattan, where enforcement efforts are concentrated, and into other stations or onto the streets.
Since last year, only passengers with tickets have been allowed into the Port Authority Bus Terminal after 1 A.M. A few months ago, the terminal began replacing its old wood seats with narrow plastic ''flip seats.'' The seats, which are six and a half inches deep and fold down like theater seats, require so much concentration to balance that sleeping or even sitting for long is impossible.
A train ticket is needed to sit in the new waiting area that opened in September at Grand Central Terminal, and the six benches there now represent the only public seating in the entire terminal.
At Pennsylvania Station, Amtrak also restricts its waiting area to passengers with tickets, and it has begun stationing police officers outside restrooms to prevent people from sleeping inside.
 
Private Institutions Take Action, Too
Private institutions are taking similar steps. An organization of homeless people had been meeting on Saturday mornings for a year in the sculpture garden at the Whitney Museum Annex inside the Philip Morris Building, across 42d Street from Grand Central. But in August, signs were posted banning meetings there.
''We've been coexisting with the homeless since we've been in the building,'' a spokesman for Philip Morris, George L. Knox, said. ''But one Saturday they had nearly 200 people in there. We said: 'It's enough. You have taken over the space.' ''
Officials at the institutions, as well as advocates for the homeless, said the restrictions had emerged as a result of the failure, after nearly a decade, to ease homelessness. The homeless who are living on the streets and in public spaces are having an economic effect on public agencies like the Transit Authority. And New Yorkers have grown tired of confronting homeless people every day on the subway, at the train station and at the entrances to supermarkets and apartment buildings.
''People are tired of stepping over bodies,'' the advocacy director for the Coalition for the Homeless, Keith Summa, said.
Lynette Thompson, a Transit Authority official who oversees the outreach program for the homeless in the subway, said there had been a marked change this year in letters from riders.
''At the beginning of last year, the tenor of those letters was, 'Please do something to help the homeless,' '' Ms. Thompson said. ''But since August and September, they've been saying: 'Just get them out. I don't care. Just get them out any way you can.' It got worse, and people got fed up.''
Transit officials said they worried that ridership levels, already flat, would decline because of deepening aversion to homeless people who not only panhandle, but also live in stations. According to Transit Authority figures, average weekday ridership so far this year is just 0.4 percent higher than in the same period last year.
''If we get a decreased ridership, we eventually get decreased funds from state, city and Federal sources,'' Ms. Thompson said. ''If we get decreased funds, then we go into a downward spiral, and then we go into decreasing service.''
 
Expensive Effort And Major Distraction
For the homeless, the new restrictions mean it is more difficult than ever to find a place to rest. Charles Lark, 29 years old, who said he had spent the last three years sleeping on subway trains and platforms, left New York on the day the subway-enforcement program began. ''This is a coldhearted city,'' he said. ''I'm going to Washington. I hope it'll be better there.''
''The mere fact that we have to devote so much time and effort to dealing with the homeless in our facilities is a sign of a lot of other people's failures,'' said Stephen Berger, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is spending more than $1 million this year on social services for the homeless.
In all, New York City will spend more than $320 million this year to shelter 25,000 single homeless people, as well as 11,000 homeless families. Although the city has reduced the number of homeless families in the system, from 5,200 in August 1988 to 3,800 now, the number of people on the streets has continued to increase.
No one knows precisely how many people live on the street. Some estimates put the number at 40,000 to 60,000. An estimated one-third are mentally ill or drug abusers, or both. Estimates of the number of homeless people in the subways - on platforms and trains as well as rat-infested tunnels near the electrified third rail - range from 2,000 to 4,000.
Advocates for the homeless, as well as the homeless themselves, say city-run shelters, where widespread drug abuse and violence have been documented, are too frightening and overwhelming to serve people on the street.
In his successful campaign for mayor, David N. Dinkins said in response to a questionnaire from the Coalition for the Homeless that he would close 80 percent of the municipal shelters for singles by July 1991 and replace them with transitional and permanent housing. He also said he would create community rescue centers, for fewer than 100 people each.
Nancy Wackstein, a member of Mr. Dinkins's transition staff who has been his policy adviser for social services, said yesterday that although Mr. Dinkins still intended to fulfill the pledges, that might be more difficult than anticipated.
''There is an intent to pursue that path,'' Ms. Wackstein said. ''But he's probably got a $1 billion budget problem. He's going to have to make the decision as to how he balances the needs of the homeless against the other needs of the city.''
 
The Public Reacts, With Ambivalence
Gauging the public attitude toward the homeless is difficult. In a New York Times/WCBS-TV News poll in June, 59 percent of the respondents said that they would pay more taxes to help the homeless.
Further, the advocacy groups for the homeless, as well as private shelters, say they have more volunteers and are receiving more contributions than ever. About 13,000 volunteers work at the 150 church and synagogue shelters of the Partnership for the Homeless. The Coalition for the Homeless reports that it receives 75 to 100 telephone calls a week from people who want to help.
Yet advocates for the homeless also see and understand the public's increasing frustration, as if a scale of tolerance is being tipped. When the Transit Authority polled its riders last spring, they found the two greatest sources of unease were homeless people and aggressive panhandlers -many of whom are not homeless.
''There's just too much of it,'' said Diane Sonde, director of Project Reachout, which serves the homeless mentally ill on the Upper West Side. ''You can't get away from it. People are tired of going to their neighborhood bank machine and having it opened by someone asking for money.''
Paula Dubrow, a freelance graphic designer, does more for the homeless than many New Yorkers. One night a week, she sleeps in a shelter at a synagogue on the Upper West Side. She gives money to people on the street. But she has come to dread riding the subway, because of the parade of panhandlers working their way through the cars.
''I'm never without a book now,'' Ms. Dubrow said. ''I hide behind that book, because I feel like I'm being assaulted. They're making me very uncomfortable - they should make me uncomfortable - and yet I don't know what I can do.''
When the Parks and Recreation Department adopted new rules in the spring, it deleted specific provisions against begging, sleeping and storing belongings in parks after civic and religious leaders had criticized the proposal.
''The public mood is both ways,'' Parks and Recreation Commissioner Henry J. Stern said. ''On the one hand, people don't want them around and demand that you remove them. On the other hand, people feel guilty and give them money.''
 
Daily Contact, Mounting Burden
Another purpose of the new policies is to try to lessen the enormous burdens felt by workers who never expected that dealing with homelessness would be part of their job.
As a Transit Authority superintendent, Urias Fritz is responsible for eight subway stations in lower Manhattan. Mr. Fritz started as a car cleaner 31 years ago and takes immense pride in his job. Over the years, he has come to know many of the homeless people who live underground, and he says he feels compassion for them. On winter days, he said, more than 60 people can be found on the mezzanine of the Broadway-Lafayette Street station, alone.
''I tell the people who work for me: 'This is another human being. You may not like the fact that he doesn't have a home, but that's a fact.''
As homelessness rises across the country, other cities are also adopting restrictive policies. Advocates for the homeless say the police arrested and otherwise harassed homeless people in downtown Miami last winter; the police said they arrested just those suspected of crimes. In Washington and San Francisco, gates are placed at the entrances of the subways at night to keep homeless people out, when the subways stop.
 
The Push to Expand Social Services
Along with the new restrictions, institutions have stepped up social services. Since January, teams of social workers have been offering services to homeless people in New York's subway stations. The efforts have had modest success.
From January through September, workers from the Volunteers of America said, they contacted 36,000 homeless people, with many of the contacts obviously repeats. Of those, 3,380, including 230 repeats, accepted services, and most of those were taken by van to city shelters. It is difficult to estimate how long people stay in the shelters.
The Human Resources Administration has also been sending outreach teams through the subways with the transit police. From January through Oct. 31, those teams contacted 5,056 people, with 1,445 being sent to city shelters.
Officials acknowledge that these efforts hardly address the complex social problems and housing policies that underlie homelessness.
''I don't pretend that the drop-in center is a solution to the problem,'' said Mr. Berger, referring to two centers the Port Authority has opened near the bus terminal and in lower Manhattan. ''It's a responsible Band-Aid.'' To an extent, courts have protected the rights of homeless people in public places. Last year, New York State's highest court, the Court of Appeals, struck down as unconstitutional a law that had banned loitering in major transportation centers. The law had sometimes been used to arrest homeless people. The new regulations are narrower, aiming to regulate patrons' behavior or to exclude those who are not traveling.
Advocates for the homeless warn that the restrictive policies indicate that if steps are not taken now to come to grips with homelessness, the problem may never be solved. The chairman of the Coalition for the Homeless, Robert M. Hayes, said small rescue centers and safe shelters should be established, to attract people off the streets. Then, he said, the people should be given appropriate housing and additional support like psychiatric care, drug treatment, remedial education and job training.
''It's a pivotal moment,'' Mr. Hayes said. ''The growing public frustration is forcing a response, and yet this particular response will have no effect on what is causing the frustration. There are not enough troops in the Western world to shove homeless people out of doors when there is no place else to go.
''The politicians are the best reflections of public opinion, and right now they're saying, 'Let's help those people.' The danger is that ultimately the public will just get fed up and say: 'Let's get rid of them. Put them on Rikers Island.' ''

HEADLINE: Clamor in the East;
Walesa's View of Glemp Irks Jewish Leaders

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS

 BODY:
When Lech Walesa, the founder of Solidarity, entered a midtown law office yesterday to meet with about 70 leaders of Jewish organizations, he was enthusiastically applauded. In a scene that has become familiar during the Polish leader's weeklong visit to the United States, many in the audience stood and cheered.
But many of those present at the private hourlong meeting that followed said that significant disagreement surfaced on the issue of Polish anti-Semitism and the dispute over a Roman Catholic convent at the site of the Auschwitz death camp.
Mr. Walesa has complained that repeated accusations of Polish anti-Semitism are unfair and exaggerated, and create divisions that are hampering Poland's efforts to move toward democracy and a free-market economy. But many of the Jewish leaders told him it was important to acknowledge what they said was a sad but undeniable history. 
''There was a great disposition to greet him in the warmest possible way, to treat him as a hero,'' said Philip Baum, the associate executive director of the American Jewish Congress. ''People were very much captivated by him, although many found some of his answers very unsatisfying.''
Seymour D. Reich, president of B'nai B'rith and the chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, presented Mr. Walesa with an ancient vase from Israel as a gift. Mr. Walesa kissed the vase and declared his ''love of Israel and the Jewish people,'' Mr. Reich said.
Mr. Reich said he was one of several who told Mr. Walesa that ''Polish anti-Semitism existed and it had to be acknowledged and it could not be hidden.'' He said that Mr. Walesa seemed to feel that such an emphasis ''could tarnish the mood for investment.''
Much of the discussion focused on the dispute over an agreement to move a convent from the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz and the position taken on the issue by Jozef Cardinal Glemp, the Roman Catholic Primate of Poland.
Although the Vatican agreed in 1987 to move the Carmelite convent in deference to complaints from Jews, Cardinal Glemp resisted and eventually repudiated the agreement, complaining of what he said were shrill Jewish protests.
Angered by Jews' insistence that the convent be moved in accordance with the agreement, Cardinal Glemp complained in August that national sovereignty and the ''feelings of all Poles'' were under attack from the Jewish community. In September, he relented and said the convent would be moved to an interfaith center to be built nearby.
Mr. Baum said that Mr. Walesa described the August statement as unfortunate and badly formulated.
Justin J. Finger, the associate national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said that Mr. Walesa said he regretted that Cardinal Glemp had made the remarks, but that he considered the reaction to the Cardinal's statement to be excessive. Mr. Finger quoted Mr. Walesa as saying that the Cardinal ''is my Primate and I listen to him in matters of religion, but not politics.''
 
Leaves Some 'Quite Cold'
Robert K. Lifton, president of the American Jewish Congress, said that Mr. Walesa's ''defense of Cardinal Glemp left the community quite cold.'' He said that many pointed out to Mr. Walesa that the Solidarity newspaper had been quick to criticize the Cardinal.
''In view of that,'' Mr. Lifton said, ''I found it surprising he felt obliged not to say he disagreed with Glemp.''
Rabbi Henry D. Michelman, executive vice president of the Synagogue Council of America, said that Mr. Walesa ''spoke very directly about his abhorrence and rejection of anti-Semitism.'' Rabbi Michelman said that while he was slightly dismayed by some of Mr. Walesa's responses, he applauded his overall approach to Polish-Jewish relations.
In a meeting yesterday with editors of The New York Times, Mr. Walesa said he was greatly troubled by the dispute over the Auschwitz site and that he was ''ashamed that they can fight over a thing like that.''
Mr. Walesa said he told the Jewish organization leaders that ''the Jewish community is the nation that has paid the highest price in the history of the world. And we, the Polish nation, have paid the second highest price. Are we supposed to fight among ourselves?''
Mr. Walesa said that ''Auschwitz belongs to the world. It does not belong to any cardinals, it does not belong to Walesa, it does not belong to the Jews.''

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Proposing Increase In Tribal Control of Federal Aid

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Finishing a two-year investigation into corruption and mismanagement of American Indian land and money, a Senate panel today proposed that tribes be given the opportunity for greater control over Federal aid that officials in Washington now administer.
The aim, according to members of the panel and their staff, is to give tribes the option of particiating in a program that offers them direct control over and accountability for their individual shares of more than $3.3 billion in annual Federal grants for education, health, economic development and natural resource development.
The program would be administered by a new executive branch office and would operate through a block grant system similar to the relationship between the Federal Government and state and local governments. More than 500 Indian tribes and Alaskan native groups would be eligible. 
Federal aid to these groups now comes through a wide range of Federal programs with varying obligations for monitoring and control over how the funds are used. The result, the Senate panel said, is a system where there is little accountability and considerable opportunity for abuse.
 
'Best Defense' Against Abuses
''The most basic of all rights, the right of self-determination, is the Indian's best defense'' against such abuses, said Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican. The panel gathered evidence of abuses, including corruption in the tribal government of the Navajos; administrative lack of interest, which permitted child sex abusers to teach for years in Indian schools, and theft of oil from Indian lands in Oklahoma.
''The system is desperately in need of improvement,'' agreed Representative Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Colorado Democrat and a Cheyenne who spoke at a news conference called by the panel's chairman, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona.
The reaction from Indian tribal leaders was cautious and uncertain, reflecting widespread doubts about whether many tribes had the technical and managerial knowledge to deal with the requirements of a Federal block grant.
The panel's recommendation ''is the long-term goal of all Indian tribes, but it cannot be done overnight,'' said Duane Beyal, a spokesman for the Navajo Nation. ''There has to be a lot of work and preparation so that tribal governments can develop the capability to administer Federal programs and services.''
Mr. Beyal is serving as press spokesman for the interim tribal leader of the Navajos, Leonard Haskie. Peter MacDonald, elected leader of the 210,000-member tribe, is currently suspended from his post and is accused, under tribal law, of more than 100 instances of fraud or mismanagement. The allegations against Mr. MacDonald figured heavily in the testimony before the panel earlier this year.
The panel's recommendations, the first major attempt in more than a decade to alter the tangled and troubled 200-year relationship between the Federal Government and the Indian tribal governments, also evoked a cautious reaction from the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
Eddie F. Brown, the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs in the Interior Department, acknowledged in a statement today that ''the report reveals many instances where the Bureau of Indian Affairs has failed to serve Indian tribes and individuals.''
In an interview this afternoon, Mr. Brown said the report ''reflects a trend which is growing stronger within tribal communities - the asumption of greater self-determination by tribal governments.'' The bureau, he added, ''is already in transition from being a direct service provider to being a contractor, monitor and assitant'' to various tribes.
He noted that under a 1988 Interior Department pilot program, 17 tribes are currently conducting limited experiments with self-governance.

HEADLINE: Touring the New York of 60 Years Ago in Pictures

BYLINE: By RICHARD F. SHEPARD

 BODY:
Like a musician playing variations on a theme, Irving Browning ''played'' New York on his camera. The New York of 60 years ago that caught his eye lent itself to every mood, to every interpretation. He was a professional who did work for hire, and in his off hours he snapped photographs of New York for the sheer joy and art of it.
''Irving Browning: City of Contrasts,'' an exhibition on view at the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, includes 65 of the 1,889 vintage photographs Mr. Browning gave to the society in 1959. They conjure up a vision of New York during the late 1920's and the Depression days of the early 1930's. He understood, like all the good and remembered photographers of New York, that every place in the city is a photo opportunity and that the comments, often contradictory with each new roll of film, actually represent the city speaking for itself. 
The Browning brothers, Irving and Sam, opened a photography studio on West 40th Street during the 1920's and were soon commissioned by architects, advertising agencies and magazines. As photographers, they worked in point-blank reality and in montage, depending on the client. Irving's own taste was New York eclectic; he could give a bright, clear image of a Waldorf-Astoria towering loftily into the sky, and he could catch the weariness of a jobless man.
 
Without Captions
The photographs bear no captions, although they are arranged in sections, each of which is introduced by a quotation about New York by an eminent writer.
''We don't have much documentation to go on,'' said Dale Neighbors, the assistant curator of photography at the society and the curator of this show. ''Browning was a good businessman and I am sure that he kept records, but they didn't come with the images he gave to us. His widow, who is still alive, believes that any documentation might have been discarded after he died in 1961.''
Browning's still photographs appeared in shows alongside those of such contemporaries as Berenice Abbott, Ralph Steiner and Margaret Bourke-White. He was also interested in movies; in 1931 he produced a short documentary, ''City of Contrasts,'' which gives this exhibition its name.
Mr. Neighbors told how a full-length photograph of the Chrysler Building, looming tall from top to bottom, came about.
 
'They Managed It'
''Walter Chrysler was told such a photograph of the building in full could not be made,'' he said. ''Somebody told him about the Brownings. He commissioned them and they managed it.''
The work Browning was hired for is on the society's walls: photographs of the Waldorf-Astoria, the Roxy Theater, the Earl Carroll Theater and the Empire State Building.
But there is also the photography that clearly represented no client. There are the Hoovervilles, built of packing boxes; the newsboy sitting atop a pile of papers and actually reading one; the jobless clustered around an employment-office bulletin board. Strange, how formally clad the jobless men appear, all wearing ties, jackets and fedoras, particularly in the photograph of what might well be a banker except that he is selling fruit neatly heaped on packing boxes, with a sign: ''Help the Unemployed. Buy Tangerines, 2 for 5 cents. Apples, 5 cents.''
 
Double-Decker on Fifth
There is a photograph of Fifth Avenue and 49th Street, the St. Patrick's Cathedral corner, with a double-decker Fifth Avenue bus passing the long-gone special avenue traffic lights: delicate gold-colored lamps, each topped by a figure of Mercury. Now only the church remains on the corner. There is another view of a vanished New York: the waterfront, with men loading the ships and cargo slings hauling the commerce that made the port great.
Broadway was as flashy then as it is now, as evidenced by a neon-streaked photograph of the street with signs proclaiming ''Al Jolson in Mammy'' and ''Carl Laemmle Presents 'All Quiet on the Western Front.' '' On a different, but no less popular, cultural scale are the burlesques and the dance halls in the Browning lens. The photographer captured the cityscape in different moods: a breathtaking glimpse of Manhattan rising in concrete from the Battery, the city as seen from the deck of the Queen of Bermuda in the Upper Bay, the mating of park and edifice that distinguishes the Sherman Square corner where Central Park meets the Plaza Hotel.
This exhibition of New York, from little apples to Big Apple, is being shown through Dec. 3 in tandem with ''Cased Images: The 150th Anniversary of Photography,'' a show of 40 daguerreotypes from the society's collection.

GRAPHIC: ''Sandwich Boards,'' a 1929 photograph, is in the exhibition ''Irving Browning: City of Contrasts'' at the New-York Historical Society.

HEADLINE: Opium War Was Nothing Like U.S. Drug Crisis;
The Long Battle Won

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Flora Lewis in ''The Opium War'' (column, Oct. 29) does not mention the outcome of the opium wars waged by the Chinese people, which ended in their winning the battle after a long struggle.
At the end of the 19th century, of a population of 300 million Chinese, 90 million were addicted to opium; the old Chinese empire was threatened by fragmentation, and the foreign powers were poised to divide it into economic zones of influence. The dismantling did not occur. 
In the first part of the 20th century, a national revival stressing basic Chinese values prevailed. It was a period of revolution and civil strife, but all the Chinese were determined to stamp out opium addiction from their country. The United States and the European powers supported them in this.
In 1906, a few years before the demise of the Manchu imperial dynasty, the Chinese Government concluded a 10-year agreement with India that specified that China should cease domestic cultivation of poppies and forbid the consumption of opium on the understanding that the export of Indian opium to China should be reduced in equal proporton and cease altogether within a decade.
This agreement reversed a longstanding British policy in India. But at the Shanghai international opium conference in 1911, held at the suggestion of Theodore Roosevelt, Britain and France were among the 13 world powers who began an international policy to restrict opium use to medical and scientific purposes.
Total eradication of opium use from China occurred only at the end of the civil war in 1949, when Mao Zedong assumed power over a unified country. All of it, including the former international concessions and the southern provinces, was made drug-free in a few years.
The Chinese nationalists, following their defeat, retreated to Taiwan, where the cultivation of the poppy has been banned since 1945. The Chinese in Taiwan share the mainland's contempt for opium and other addictive drugs. The Chinese were able to solve the problem of massive opium addiction by decreasing the demand for the drug and cutting off the supply. Opium addiction has been eliminated in mainland China and Taiwan, as well as Singapore. It still prevails only in Hong Kong, a British crown colony.

HEADLINE: A Pipeline to Petroleum Security

BYLINE: By J. Bennett Johnston; J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana, is chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Warnings about our growing dependence on imported oil are coming thick and fast these days, and not without reason -imports will soon reach 50 percent of total demand. But in responding to the danger, we risk overlooking an important difference between today and the early 1970's: Key OPEC nations now seem anxious to strengthen America's perceptions of its own energy security.
In fact, a novel possibility arises that OPEC nations could help us expand our main protection against a supply disruption - the Strategic Petroleum Reserve - and do so faster than we could otherwise afford.
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve now contains 575 million barrels of crude oil. While this equaled the target of 90 days of imports in 1988, only one year later the reserve now represents barely 79 days. The reason? Oil imports are growing faster than our stockpile. 
To maintain the 90-day target in the 1990's, the reserve will need to grow to at least a billion barrels or more -far beyond the 750 million barrels it will contain by the turn of the century at current fill rates. The problem is finding the money to pay for the added reserves.
That's where a new approach, under study by the Department of Energy, shows great promise. It starts from the premise that we don't have to buy oil to accomplish our major objective of obtaining an option to buy oil during an energy emergency. To accomplish this, we can just as easily ''lease'' the oil from OPEC countries and store it in the strategic reserve.
Here's how it would work. We would secure physical custody over the oil and control over its sale on behalf of the owner. In return, we would pay annual lease payments that would be a tiny fraction of the oil's purchase price.
We would neither own the oil nor profit from its sale. But we wouldn't pay for the oil either. Yet the public would have the assured option of buying that additional oil at the market price during an emergency. When the term expired, we would have the option to extend the lease, buy the oil or terminate.
Several oil producing nations with excess production capacity appear willing to discuss the proposal, including Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. They are interested in the arrangement as a way to circumvent OPEC's quota ceilings.
Oil leased for storage in the U.S. apparently would not count against the quota until it is actually sold. A producer who leased his oil would receive annual lease payments under a contract with the U.S. Government, plus the hope of its eventual sale. Now, oil in excess of the quota has little value for the producer because its sale is barred by the quota.
In addition, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations with large oil reserves are anxious to reassure the oil-consuming countries that they can rely on a long-term supply of OPEC oil at an acceptable price. The OPEC nations long since recognized that the rapid run-up of oil prices in the late 1970's and early 1980's was counterproductive. It led to widespread energy conservation, fuel-switching, increased non-OPEC oil production and economic recession. As a result, demand for OPEC oil plummeted.
We can theorize forever about the merits of the lease arrangement. No one will really know until the Administration takes the initiative and negotiates specific terms with a potential lessor. The most important considerations may be political, not economic, however.
Given the deficit, an alternative financing approach such as oil leasing may be our best hope to expand the strategic reserve to an adequate size. If OPEC is extending an olive branch, we should accept it warily. Let's continue our energy security programs, but let serious talks on oil leasing begin.

HEADLINE: OBSERVER;
Pitiful, Helpless Giants All

BYLINE: By Russell Baker

 BODY:
Suddenly the world seems littered with pitiful, helpless giants. There was Lech Walesa in Washington knocking on the castle door, talking of another Marshall Plan to help make freedom ring in Poland.
President Bush gave him a medal and sent him up to Capitol Hill for a round of applause. That's nice, like getting a big locomotive and a chorus of ''Boola Boola,'' but Marshall Plan it ain't. 
What ''Marshall Plan'' means is not just ''big, big money,'' but also a heavy commitment of American political vigor and brain power. It means dollars by the billion and determination to make the investment pay off, as it paid off in turning 1945's ruined Western Europe into today's economic powerhouse.
The American giant that did all that has not grown old and feeble so much as muscle-bound to the point of helplessness. Congress will provide some money for Poland and Hungary, but it will be a lot less than $1 billion for the two, and ever since Washington discovered the trillion you're not even talking money down there if you're talking less than $1 billion.
The old muscle-bound giant has billions galore. He measures his bills by trillions nowadays, but his money is all tied up in enterprises he can't seem to get out of even when they don't pay off.
There's $70 billion committed for the Stealth bomber. Its usefulness was always debatable, but since the cold war started to vanish, it now seems a grotesque boondoggle. For obvious political reasons, though, the giant finds it nearly impossible to switch any of those Stealth billions to something as useful as a ''Marshall Plan'' for Poland: the cold war has built us an economy that lives by Stealth bomber construction.
Switch a few billion from Stealth to Poland and California screams, just as Long Island screams whenever somebody suggests switching Grumman's share of the cold-war budget to something sensible.
With American politics tied inescapably to cold-war spending, it's hard to come up with money for anything new, no matter how necessary - short of raising taxes, of course.
And what are the chances people will sit still for new taxes so long as the daily news is all about gigantic swindles conducted at taxpayers' expense?
President Bush is criticized for not showing zealous enthusiasm about Communism's collapse in Europe, yet one can see why it is a blessing he might have preferred not to happen on his watch. The cold war was a familiar way of life, the American economy was based on assumptions of its permanence, and American mentality was conditioned to preserve and promote it.
An end to the cold war meant rethinking absolutely everything. This would have been an extraordinary challenge for the most inventive and imaginative minds, and invention and imagination are not the strengths of Mr. Bush and the men around him, nor for that matter of any group anywhere on the American political horizon at present.
So we have the old muscle-bound giant hunkered down in the castle at Washington, dazzled by the excitements going on around him, but probably wishing, if the truth be known, that people didn't expect him to get up and participate in the havoc.
It was President Nixon who coined the phrase ''pitiful, helpless giant'' in a different context. The United States, he warned during the Vietnam War, would become ''a pitiful, helpless giant'' unless Americans showed the resolution needed to claim some kind of victory there.
He was alarmed partly by the popular movement against the war which had divided the country and made it difficult for him to apply American power casually in Asia.
Now we see popular movements everywhere turning governments into pitiful, helpless giants. Gorbachev, by responding to popular hunger for release from a moldering past, reveals that the Soviet Union may be the most pitiful, most helpless giant of all.
The discovery that Stalin really is dead, and Lenin had it all wrong, and the castle at Moscow is all cobwebs and decrepitude, quickly exposed the pitiful helplessness of eastern Europe's antique tyrants. While they had been strutting like giants, history had left them as pitiful, though not alas as comical, as the Wizard of Oz.
Armies of course can always give half-pints the illusion they are giants (see China), but the air just now is filled with a sense that the age of the giants is ending. In Washington nobody seems to have any idea what to do about it.

HEADLINE: Grocery Official Is Found Slain By Rural Road

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MORRISTOWN, N.J., Nov. 17

 BODY:
An executive of the Pathmark supermarket chain was shot to death early Thursday, several hours after he left his office in Woodbridge, the authorities said today.
The victim, Robert E. Wunderle, 45 years old, of Westfield, was shot once through the heart and once above the left ear, and his body was left in a brush-shrouded drainage ditch beside a secluded unpaved road in Rockaway, about 100 yards from the closest highway, the authorities said today. The site, about a half-mile from Exit 37 on Interstate 80, is about 25 miles northwest of Mr. Wunderle's office. 
The Morris County Prosecutor, Lee S. Trumbull, said investigators had found no motive for the murder and had not ruled out the possibility that it was committed by a hired killer.
''That's an area we're exploring, but we're not focusing on that,'' Mr. Trumbull said.
Powder burns were found next to both wounds, suggesting that Mr. Wunderle was shot at a range of less than two feet, Mr. Trumbull said.
 
'Esteemed and Valued Colleague'
His wallet and his company car, a gray four-door Mercury Grand Marquis with New Jersey license plate EXC-26V, are both missing, Mr. Trumbull said. But because Mr. Wunderle's expensive wristwatch was undisturbed, the authorities are uncertain about robbery as a motive, Mr. Trumbull said.
Mr. Wunderle was chief economist and vice president of public affairs of the Supermarkets General Corporation, the Woodbridge-based parent company of the Pathmark chain.
''He was an esteemed and valued colleague whose tireless efforts on behalf of S.G.C., as well as the food industry as a whole, were remarkable,'' the company chairman, Jack Futterman, said yesterday.
Mr. Wunderle, who was married and had two sons, was a prominent lobbyist for the food industry in the Northeast, having served on the government relations committees of the New Jersey Food Council, the New York State Food Merchants, the Pennsylvania Food Merchants and the Food Marketing Institute, a national supermarket organization. He was former chairman of the Community Food Bank of New Jersey, an organization that distributes surplus government food to the needy.
 
Missed Business Dinner
As a spokesman for the industry, he was often quoted in news articles about trends in food merchandising and supermarket development.
Mr. Wunderle's body, dressed in business suit and raincoat, was found about 9 A.M. Thursday by a municipal heavy-equipment operator who was enlarging the ditch. He was identified by a business card found in a pocket.
He left his office at 8:45 P.M. Wednesday, and his whereabouts afterward are unknown, Mr. Trumbull said. He planned to attend a business dinner in Mountainside but did not arrive or call to cancel.

HEADLINE: Board Refuses Approval For Shelter's Expansion

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
The New York City Board of Estimate has refused to approve retroactively the addition of nearly 300 beds to a homeless men's shelter in the former Greenpoint Hospital in Brooklyn.
Mayor-elect David N. Dinkins joined the majority of board members who voted Thursday night to require the city to scale back the shelter by about 300 beds. The board was reviewing the expansion under a court order. 
Only Mayor Edward I. Koch voted to keep the shelter at its current capacity of nearly 1,000 beds. First Deputy Mayor Stanley Brezenoff said yesterday that it was unclear what the administration's next step would be. He said the city would continue to use the shelter for ''as long as we can,'' adding, ''We have no other place to put these individuals.''
The board also approved a housing project for the aged at Avenue C and Ninth Street on the Lower East Side. This site is now La Plaza Cultural, whose admirers call it a community garden, play area and open-air performance space. Its detractors call it a dangerous vacant lot.
 
Speakers Urge Rejection
Although the expansion of the Greenpoint shelter, at Kingsland and Skillman Avenues, has already occurred, the city is under a court order, obtained by a community group called the Greenpoint Renaissance Enterprise Corporation, to take the matter through the uniform land-use review procedure, which involves the Board of Estimate.
More than three dozen speakers urged the board to reject the authorization. They were protesting what they said was a reversal of a commitment by the Koch administration to reduce the shelter population to 250 over five years, beginning next May. Mr. Koch made that commitment last August, less than a month before the Democratic mayoral primary.
The president of Greenpoint Renaissance, Gary Sam Hattem, said yesterday, ''We're pleased with the vote in that it sends a signal that when government makes a promise to a community, that promise should be kept.''
Koch administration officials insisted that they had not broken their word but conceded on Thursday that the shelter would be phased out more slowly than they first indicated.
Councilman Abraham G. Gerges, whose district includes Greenpoint, said: ''The Mayor appeared in Greenpoint and personally assured people that the shelter would be closed. To now reverse that would be the greatest insult by the government to any community. And we will not stand for it.''
 
Apartments for the Aged
Several hours later, the board held its hearing on Casa Victoria, a proposed six-story building with 79 apartments for the aged, built by the Lower East Side Coalition Housing Development Inc.
The federally subsidized project attracted attention recently when it was cited by David Burns, the regional economist for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In 1987, Mr. Burns said, Joseph Monticciolo, the department's regional administrator in New York, ordered him to approve the Lower East Side site, which he was going to reject.
''This project has not been and is not under any investigation,'' said Antonio Pagan, executive director of the development company. ''We intend to transform a drug-ridden hell hole into quality, affordable housing for the elderly.''
Opponents of Casa Victoria said the location was inappropriate for housing for the aged, given the number of abandoned buildings in the vicinity and the amount of drug dealing on the streets.
And yet, opponents stressed, the site was functioning well as La Plaza. ''Green space is as important to this city as housing,'' said Patsy L. Margolin, a neighbor.

Companies
 General Electric plans to buy back $10 billion worth of its stock during the next five years. It also announced a 15 percent increase in its dividend. The stock-repurchase program apparently is the largest ever announced at one time. G.E.'s shares rose $2, to $59.50. G.E.'s chairman said there were no suitable acquisition candidates now and buying back shares appeared to be the best use for the company's sizable cash reserves. [Page 35.] B. Altman is closing almost all its stores, including the 124-year-old chain's flagship store on Fifth Avenue. That store was once a favorite of Manhattan's carriage trade but its business has been in decline for more than a decade. Altman's current owner, the L. J. Hooker Corporation, is under bankruptcy protection and had been seeking a buyer for the seven-store chain. The five other stores to be closed are in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and on Long Island. A store in Cincinnati will remain open because it is an essential part of a new shopping mall. [35.] Lockheed will take a charge of about $300 million against fourth-quarter earnings because of a miscalculation in bidding for a contract to develop an antisubmarine aircraft for the Navy. The charge might result in a loss for the full year. The charge amounts to half of the $600 million contract. [35.] Northeast Utilities sweetened its bid for the assets of the bankrupt Public Service Company of New Hampshire and said that it had won the endorsement of some secured creditors. [36.] Dunkin' Donuts agreed to be acquired for $325 million by a British food and beverage group, Allied-Lyons P.L.C. The chain, which has more than 1,800 outlets, fought off a hostile bidder earlier. [37.]
 
 
 
The Economy
 The Fed's policy makers decided not to lower rates immediately when they met last month. A report of the meeting said that part of the reason for the decision was a reluctance to be seen as succumbing to pressure from the Treasury. The report was an unusually explicit acknowledgement of a division over interest rates between the central bank and the Treasury. [35.] Housing starts bounced back by 12 percent in October from September's seven-year low. Analysts said they expected the construction to remain stable through early 1990. [36.]
 
 
 
Markets
 Stock prices posted broad gains aided by a rally in high-technology stocks and G.E.'s stock buyback announcement. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 17 points, to 2,652.66. For the week, the Dow had a gain of 27.05 points, or about 1 percent. [38.] Treasury note and bond prices declined further as the debt market continued to digest the large volume of quarterly refunding and other offerings auctioned this week. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 7.93 percent, up from 7.89 percent a week ago. [38.] One argument for dual trading of futures was dismissed by the staff of a Federal regulatory agency. Their report said they had found no evidence that the market worked better when traders are allowed to deal for both themselves and their clients. [46.] Precious metals futures prices rose broadly, supported by continued buying of gold, silver and platinum, and by supply fears about palladium linked to reports of problems at a Soviet metals refinery. [43.] The dollar finished mixed in a quiet session with traders lacking any incentive to buy or sell heavily. [43.]
 
 
 
Today's Columns
 The office chair has been redesigned by an engineer who says his version is more comfortable. The new chair has no springs in its recliner mechanism and uses balance and gravity to do most of its work. Patents. [36.] The holiday season poses a threat to the year-round financial health of many people, especially those who make only minimum monthly payments on their credit cards. One expert warns that browsing in stores can lead to impulse purchases and recommends instead that shopping be organized, using a list. Your Money. [36.]

HEADLINE: Split With Treasury Cited By Fed in Report on Rates

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Policy makers of the Federal Reserve decided at a meeting last month not to lower interest rates at once in large part because they did not want to be seen as succumbing to pressure from the Treasury, according to a report of the meeting released today.
This was an unusually explicit acknowledgement of a division over interest rates between the Fed and the Treasury and of the central bank's determination not to be swayed by the Treasury on monetary policy.
The Oct. 3 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee came 10 days after Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and the other finance ministers of the Group of Seven, the seven largest industrial democracies, announced that they had agreed to take steps to bring down the value of the dollar. The move was designed to improve American trade imbalances. 
Their effort to drive down the dollar would have been aided by lower interest rates in the United States, which would have made the dollar less attractive in the markets.
But, according to the Open Market Committee report, Fed officials felt not only that domestic economic conditions did not warrant a reduction in interest rates but also that ''an easing of policy so soon after'' the Group of Seven meeting ''would be misinterpreted as an attempt to use monetary policy to force the dollar lower.''
The Open Market Committee is made up of the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board and the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks. It meets behind closed doors eight times a year to set monetary policy. A sketchy report of each meeting is published about six weeks afterward, a few days after the following meeting. However, if a decision is made to raise or lower interest rates, the markets recognize it within days.
The report published today said: ''Monetary policy should not be used, in the judgment of the committee, to attain particular levels for the foreign exchange value of the dollar that could conflict with domestic policy objectives. In current circumstances, an easing might well provoke an undesirable sharp decline in the external value of the dollar.''
Robert H. Chandross, chief economist in the New York office of Lloyds Bank and a student of the Fed, said he regarded that as ''an unusually clear statement by the Fed to the Treasury that they were not going to give in to pressure.''
After time had passed, however, the Fed did approve a lowering of rates. The rates were permitted to slide a bit following the stock market drop on Oct. 13, and the Open Market Committee members agreed in a telephone conference call last week to a further small reduction.
The report released today did not address those actions.
 
Rate Below Oct. 3 Level
 The Federal funds rate, which is controlled by the Fed and which is the rate banks charge one another for overnight loans, is now at 8.5 percent, about half a percentage point below the level on Oct. 3.
The Fed officials also took issue in the report with the decision by the United States and its allies - Britain, West Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada - to intervene in currency markets to drive the dollar down. ''Some members expressed concern,'' the report stated, ''that if this intervention resulted in a sizable depreciation of the dollar, the inflationary consequences could be viewed as inconsistent with the committee's long-run policy of achieving price stability.''
Following the September meeting of the finance ministers, the industrialized countries sold dollars aggressively. As a result, the dollar fell modestly against the West German mark and slightly against the Japanese yen. The higher values of the foreign currencies make their products more expensive in the United States, which can drive up inflation if the consumers' appetite for imports remains strong.
Differences between the Fed and the Treasury over interest rates are well established but, in the Bush Administration, have only occasionally appeared in public. The Fed's principal goal is to contain inflation, and that implies high interest rates. The Administration is more concerned about economic growth and believes that that requires somewhat lower rates.
 
Differences Minimized
 In an interview last week, Secretary Brady acknowledged but minimized the differences as ''between the 40-yard lines.''
''The Fed,'' he said, ''has a special view about the containment of inflation, and at the same time it is not unmindful of the necessity for growth. We have a special feeling about growth because it is the tide that lifts all of the boats, but we have an eye on inflation.''
Moreover, Fed officials have repeatedly told the Treasury that intervention in the currency markets cannot help the dollar for very long if market forces are pushing it the other way. Most economists accept that view. The Treasury, on the other hand, needs for political reasons to be seen as acting to help improve the trade balance, and a high dollar makes exports more costly and imports less expensive.

HEADLINE: $10 Billion G.E. Stock Buyback

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
The General Electric Company, in an apparent effort to increase the price of its stock, announced yesterday that it would purchase up to $10 billion worth of its shares during the next five years. It is evidently the largest such repurchase program ever announced at one time.
The company also increased its dividend 15 percent, from an annual $1.64 a share, to $1.88 a share. G.E.'s shares rose $2 yesterday, to $59.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.
''The reaction in the investment community is very positive,'' said Linda M. Shuman, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. She said some institutional investors had feared the company would make an unsuitable acquisition as its cash reserves grew. 
 
Bright Forecast
 In a meeting with securities analysts in New York, G.E. officials projected a rosy future for the company. They predicted that annual revenue would exceed $60 billion by 1992 and that earnings would exceed $5 billion. Last year, the company earned $3.4 billion on revenues of $50 billion.
John F. Welch Jr., the chairman of the company, said G.E. officials had decided the company should buy its stock because they ''do not see the values'' in any potential acquisition candidate.
The G.E. repurchase plan appears to be the largest such undertaking covered in a single announcement, but other companies have also been buying back large numbers of shares. The International Business Machines Corporation has bought $1 billion to $2 billion of its shares each year for the last several years, and it announced earlier this year that it would buy as much as $1 billion in 1989. In 1987, the General Motors Corporation announced a $4.72 billion repurchase plan.
 
Generated Internally
 G.E. officials said about 60 percent of the money for the repurchase would be generated internally, with the rest coming from borrowings. Today, the Standard & Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investors Service Inc. both reaffirmed their top ratings for G.E.'s debt.
Mr. Welch said almost 10 years of divestitures and acquisitions had made the company a leader in 13 business categories. ''In the decade ahead, we believe these businesses will provide high earnings growth and significant cash flow,'' he said.
''These prospects give us flexibility to increase dividends in line with earnings, maintain a high level of internal investment, make complementary acquisitions and also repurchase a significant amount of stock,'' Mr. Welch said.
Russell L. Leavitt, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc., said, ''I think the message is that they are satisfied with their current postion and are poised to generate solid earnings and cash flow.'' He said yesterday's action, by reducing the number of shares publicly held, would bolster G.E.'s stock price because any increases in earnings or dividends would be spread over fewer shares.
Mr. Welch said the only event likely to derail the stock repurchase would be a large, very suitable acquisition opportunity. ''It would take a blockbuster acquisition,'' he said.
He said a stock repurchase, rather than a large one-time dividend payment or a sharp dividend rate increase, gave the company flexibility if a big acquisition became possible or if economic conditions changed. ''We are not after a higher stock price today,'' he said. ''We think it's is a sounder plan than a quick-hit dividend.''
Dennis Dammerman, G.E.'s senior vice president for finance, said the company expects 1989 revenues to total about $54 billion and net income would be $3.91 to $3.96 billion, or $4.32 to $4.38 a share.
The only dark spot in an otherwise bright picture, Mr. Welch acknowledged, was in the major appliances division, which he said was not meeting a productivity growth target of 4 to 6 percent a year.

HEADLINE: Starts in Housing Show 12% Rebound for October

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 (AP) -Housing starts bounced back by 12 percent in October from September's seven-year low, the Commerce Department reported today.
Analysts said they expected the construction rate to remain stable through the first quarter of 1990.
''The housing market seems to have bottomed out,'' said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. But he and other analysts said they did not expect any surge in building.
The Commerce Department reported that new homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.42 million units last month.
 
Drops in Previous Two Months
 The 12 percent rebound from September was the sharpest gain since a 13 percent advance in December 1986. Starts had fallen 4.6 percent in September and 6.4 percent in August.
Although September's pace was revised upward from the 1.26 million reported earlier, it was still the most sluggish since new homes and apartments were built at an annual rate of 1.17 million units in October 1982 during the depths of a recession.
Many analysts attributed the September construction drop to a rise in mortgage rates and said the October gain followed a subsequent decline.
The housing industry has been among the hardest hit as the Federal Reserve drove up interest rates to slow economic growth and lower inflation. But the Fed has slowly eased rates over the summer and, except for the blip in September, rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have fallen from March's 11.22 percent peak to 9.82 percent by the end of October, according to surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
 
Decline in Inventories
 The higher rates stifled sales and bolstered inventories of single-family homes to an 8.1-month supply by last March, said Richard Peach, an economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. As rates have fallen, he added, inventories have dropped to a six-month supply, which, he said, ''by historical standards'' puts the industry ''in good shape.''
But even though many analysts expect mortgage rates to drop another half of a percentage point in coming months, Mr. Peach said he did not expect a sharp rise in building.
Construction of single-family homes in October rose 6.9 percent, to an annual rate of 1.03 million units. Single-family starts had fallen 3 percent in September and 3.5 percent in August.
Apartment construction rose 28 percent in October, to an annual rate of 393,000 units. It had fallen 9.4 percent in September after dropping 14 percent in August.
Total housing starts during the first 10 months of the year were down 6 percent from the corresponding period of 1988.
The South, which posted a 14.7 drop for the steepest regional decline in September, turned in the sharpest increase in October, up by 17.1 percent, to 562,000 units. It was followed by the Midwest with a 16.5 percent gain, to 289,000 units.
Construction rose 6 percent in the Northeast, to 176,000 units, and 5.1 percent in the West, to 393,000 units.

HEADLINE: Treasury Issues Continue to Decline

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Treasury note and bond prices declined further yesterday as the debt market continued to digest the large volume of quarterly refunding and other offerings auctioned this week. Dealers said prices began falling from the opening, after the Government reported that housing starts rose 12 percent in October.
Dealers also said that the corporate bond market was depressed by the decision of the Tennessee Valley Authority to price $4 billion of seven- and 40-year bonds yesterday. Originally, $3 billion of bonds were due to be priced next week. Also, the T.V.A.'s 40-year bonds were priced to yield more than a percentage point above the Treasury's long-term bonds. 
Meanwhile, further evidence of an improving economy came in the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's index of general business conditions, which projected a sharp improvement for the current month. Economists watch the index as a precursor of the much more publicized index issued each month by the National Association of Purchasing Managers.
 
Manufacturing Component Gains
 ''The Philadelphia Fed's zero-based index for November is down 5.8 percent, a sharp improvement from the minus 10.2 percent in October and minus 7.6 percent in September,'' said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. ''What may have upset some people in the fixed-income market is that the manufacturing component of the Philadelphia Fed's index also showed improvement.''
But the index also showed that manufacturers were having to pay more for their purchases, while the prices they are receiving have slimmed along with their profit margins, Mr. Ricchiuto added.
Francis A. Scotland, managing editor of the International Bank Credit Analyst in Montreal, said: ''Other factors are also weighing on the fixed-income market. Few market participants care to take any significant position before a holiday-shortened week, when trading will be light and prices subject to the volatility that usually attends a relatively illiquid market.''
Mr. Scotland also noted that ''with the Fed still in a do-nothing mode and few important economic statistics due out in the next two weeks, the market doesn't expect any move until the November employment data are released next month.'' He added, ''We believe the jobs data will provoke the Fed into pushing the funds rate down to 8 percent by year-end.''
 
Federal Funds Down to 8 3/8%
 Late trading found the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for temporary loans, down to 8 3/8 percent, from 8 1/2 percent Thursday. This apparently had little impact on short-term rates. The discount rate on Treasury 90-day bills was unchanged at 7.68 percent; six-month bills rose four basis points, to 7.46 percent, and the new one-year bill was unchanged at 7.17 percent.
In the intermediate maturity sector, the new 7 3/4 percent notes of 1992 fell 5/32, at 100 1/32, for a yield of 7.74 percent; the 8's of 1996 dropped 12/32, to 100 24/32, and a yield of 7.85 percent, and the new long-term notes, the 7 7/8's of 1999, fell 13/32, to 100 3/32, for a yield of 7.86 percent.
The Treasury's benchmark long-term bonds, the 8 1/8's of 2019, tumbled 24/32, to 102 7/32, with the yield rising to 7.93 percent, from 7.86 percent Thursday and 7.89 percent a week ago.
Meanwhile, the T.V.A. priced $1.5 billion of 8.25 percent noncallable bonds due in 1996 at 99.45 to yield 8.355 percent, or about 52 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The $2.5 billion in bonds due in 2029 were given a 8 5/8 percent coupon and priced at 95.90 to yield 9.005 percent, or 110 basis points more than the Treasury's 30-year bond. Underwriters, led by Morgan Stanley & Company, said the bonds were noncallable for 10 years.
This offering follows last month's $4 billion issue, which marked the agency's first trip to the public debt market in about 15 years.
The T.V.A. said debt sales would raise funds to pay off $6.7 billion of high-interest debt the utility owes the Federal Financing Bank, an arm of the United States Treasury.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 17 Points, Led by G.E.'s Strength

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices posted broad gains yesterday, aided by a rally in high-technology stocks and General Electric's announcement that it intends to buy back as much as $10 billion worth of its stock.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 17 points, to 2,652.66, as advances on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6, with 766 rising and 682 falling. For the week, the Dow gained 27.05 points, or about 1 percent. 
G.E. rose 2 points, to 59 1/2, and was the Big Board's busiest issue on a volume of more than 3.1 million shares.
 
Technology Issues Rise
 Better-than-expected earnings by Hewlett-Packard provided a catalyst for the recently lagging high-technology sector, traders said. Hewlett jumped 3 1/4, to 44 1/2. Other technology issues quickly followed, with I.B.M. up 2, to 99 1/8; Digital Equipment up 2 1/2, to 88 1/4, and Motorola up 1/2, to 57 5/8. In over-the-counter trading, Intel gained 1/2, to 34.
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.03 points, to 341.61, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index edged up 0.53, to 189.28.
Volume on the Big Board rose to 151 million shares, from 148.4 million on Thursday.
Joseph Battipaglia, associate director of research at Gruntal & Company, said yesterday's gains could be called the G.E. rally. ''The announcement of the $10 billion buyback and 15 percent dividend increase gave investors in blue chips cause to cheer,'' he said. But the analyst also pointed out that the many stocks were lackluster and the bond market weakened on a confused economic outlook. There have been signs of economic weakness in a number of recently released statistics, but the Commerce Department reported yesterday that housing starts rose a better-than-expected 12 percent in October.
A ''double witching hour'' occurred yesterday as November stock options and stock indexes expired, but analysts said it had little effect on stock prices.
Among individual issues, Lockheed dropped 2 1/8, to 39 1/2. The company said that it would take a charge of about $300 million against fourth-quarter earnings related to the development of a Navy patrol plane and that the charge could result in a loss for the year.
Active blue chips included Union Carbide, up 5/8, to 23 7/8; Unisys off 3/8, to 14 1/2; Philip Morris up 1/4, to 41 3/8; American Express, unchanged at 34 5/8, and A.T.&T. off 1/8, to 43 1/4.
Dun & Bradstreet added 3/8, to 42 7/8. The stock had fallen 7 3/4 the preceding two days after the company said it expected to show lower earnings in 1990 as it reorganizes its credit-services business.
Actively traded over-the-counter stocks included MCI Communications, which rose 3/8, to 44 1/8, and Sun Microsystems, which was up 5/8, to 16, and Lin Broadcasting, which dipped 1/8, to 115 3/4.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed on Quiet Day; Focus Now Is German Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mixed yesterday in a quiet session with traders lacking any incentive to buy or sell heavily.
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $394.60 an ounce, $3.20 higher than Thursday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted an ounce of gold at $394.25 late in the day, up $2.95 from Thursday's late bid. 
''There was not much activity today'' in the dollar, said one currency dealer, John McCarthy.
Mr. McCarthy, who is with the New York office of the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank, said currency dealers focused on buying West German marks.
Demand for marks has increased as currency investors speculate that West German economic growth will accelerate as a result of closer ties with East Germany.
Traders said news that United States housing starts had rebounded by 12 percent in October from September's seven-year low failed to evoke much of a response in the currency markets.
The dollar ended lower against most major currencies in United States trading after a mixed performance overseas.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 143.98 yen, up from 143.85 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 144.15 yen. By the close of trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 144.25 yen, unchanged from Thursday's late level.
In London, the pound fell to $1.5705, from $1.5805 late Thursday. The pound weakened further in later New York trading, falling to $1.5670 from $1.5755 on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's late rates, included: 1.8410 West German marks, down from 1.8427; 1.6307 Swiss francs, down from 1.6326; 6.2630 French francs, down from 6.2725; 1,355.00 Italian lire, down from 1,357.25, and 1.16945 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16875.

Falling Mortgage Rates

 BODY:

The slowing economy has created opportunities in real estate, as a generally depressed housing market has reduced the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage by more than 1.25 percentage points since March. It is now 9.66 percent, a five-year low. Continued soft spots in the economy, including housing, could push that rate down another half-point by spring, many analysts say. If so, delaying a $100,000 mortgage commitment could reduce monthly payments by more than $30, producing savings of more than $12,000 over the life of the loan. Here are examples of savings that could be achieved if rates fall further. 

$	 	 	 	Rate	 Monthly Cost	 Total Cost	 Savings	9.66 (current)	 $852.55	 $306,918	 ---	9.50	 $840.85	 $302,706	 $4,212	9.25	 $822.68	 $296,165	 $10,753	9.00	 $804.62	 $289,663	 $17,255

Antilock Brakes, Once Rare, Emerge as Prime Auto Option

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Antilock brakes, once considered an esoteric device to prevent uncontrolled skidding on slippery roads, are showing up as standard equipment or being offered as optional equipment in many new car, truck and van models. So more new-car buyers than ever before are getting a chance to buy this safety feature.
Automotive experts say the proliferation of these specialized braking systems - sometimes called A.B.S. - is likely to continue through the late 1990's, when antilock brakes are expected to become fairly common even on economy models.
Some insurance companies are granting discounts to clients whose cars have the brakes. Consumer advocates advise drivers who are shopping for cars now to make antilock brakes an important consideration.
 
A Helpless Feeling
The benefits of antilock brakes will be immediately evident to anyone who ever has had the experience of inadvertently braking too hard on a slippery road, only to encounter a frightening loss of control as the car careers or spins toward a possible collision. In this kind of situation, the wheels of the car, having been stopped by the brakes, remain locked while the car continues to skid. The steering wheel is useless: no matter which way it is turned, the vehicle continues to move in the direction it was moving at the moment the wheels were locked. Sometimes the car will turn sideways or begin to spin.
Driver-education courses warn against slamming on the brake pedal precisely because it is so easy to lock the wheels on a slippery surface because of the lack of friction between the rubber and the road. Students are taught that on wet or icy roads, they should repeatedly pump the brakes gently then quickly release the pressure until the vehicle slows or stops. The series of short braking actions reduces the chance of lockup.
 
Electronics Take Over
 In essence, antilock brakes mimic those instructions, automatically applying and releasing pressure even faster than a driver could. As the brakes are applied, an electronic sensor detects when a wheel is about to lock and then releases it, overriding any pressure on the pedal. The driver retains the ability to steer the car and can depress the brakes as hard as possible without releasing pressure: the system will slow the wheels gradually without locking them. In some systems the driver can actually feel the pedal pulsing as the computer is applying and releasing the brakes.
The General Motors Corporation is installing antilock brakes as standard equipment in 20 of its 1990 models and will offer the system as optional equipment in 13 models. The most expensive Cadillac models will include antilock brakes, and so will sportier versions of the Pontiac Grand Prix and Buick Electra, as well as the Chevrolet Astro van. Buyers of the Buick Regal, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and other medium-sized models can pay $925 to receive them as an option.
For 1990, the Ford Motor Company has made antilock brakes standard on the Lincoln Continental, the Lincoln Mark VII, the Mercury Cougar and the Aerostar van, and some versions of the Taurus, the Thunderbird and other models. If ordered as an option, the brakes cost $924 to $1,085.
The Chrysler Corporation offers the system as standard on the Maserati TC, and as an option on the Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer, the Dodge Dynasty, Chrysler Imperial and Chrysler New Yorker for $926 to $998.
The brakes are standard on Acuras, and some Mazdas. Toyota, Nissan, , Mitsubishi and Subaru all offer them as an option on a varitety of models; the prices range from $995 to $1,495. They are standard on all BMW's, Jaguars and many models of Mercedes-Benz.
G.M., Ford and Chrysler also offer antilock brakes on many pickup trucks.
Like many advances in automotive technology, this one has been around for decades. It was first used on airplanes in the 1950's and in large trucks in the 1960's.
Only in recent years, however, have auto makers deemed the systems practical and economical enough for industrywide distribution. This follows the pattern of disk brakes, which were introduced in more expensive vehicles and, over time, became commonplace.
Josef Mack, a manager for the Robert Bosch Corporation, a leading making of antilock brake systems, estimates that 15 to 20 percent of the cars and trucks on the road will have them in the near future. ''Since 1978 we have produced four million systems worldwide, and many consumers who have them say they'll never own another car without them,'' he said.
At present, it is so complicated and costly to retrofit a car or truck with an A.B.S. that it is not practical.
 
Some Practice Needed
 The brakes take a little getting used to. Deepak Dighe, a G.M. engineer, said pumping them, as many drivers been trained to do with stanbard brakes, will not take full advantage of the antilock technology.
Perhaps the greatest potential danger with respect to these systems is that they may imbue drivers with an undue sense of invulnerability when driving on wet or icy pavement.
''Antilock brakes improve controllability, but they don't necessarily reduce the stopping distance on slippery pavement,'' Mr. Dighe said. ''You cannot defy the laws of physics. It still takes longer to stop a vehicle on wet pavement than on dry.''

This Year, Service Plus Bargains

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
When the holiday shopping season begins at Thanksgiving, people can expect to see still more of the heavy markdowns they have seen the last few holiday seasons.
But in department and specialty stores they are also likely to find more - and perhaps better - service from sales people because of snowballing trends like commission selling, manufacturers' representatives on sales floors and personal shopping services.
''Quality service is more important than ever this year,'' said Terry Lundgren, executive vice president of Neiman-Marcus in Dallas. ''We're adding 10 percent more selling associates on the floor, and the customer will definitely notice a difference for Christmas.'' 
Herbert Wittkin, a New York management consultant, said: ''The lack of customer convenience hit bottom last year and is mostly bouncing back now. I think there's something real happening.''
This year the practice of paying retail sales people a combination of salary and commissions, or commissions alone, became an industry-wide phenomenon. With Nordstrom's of Seattle in the lead, commission selling has spread to pace-setting stores like Jordan Marsh in Boston, Marshall Field's in Chicago and the Broadway in Los Angeles.
''With commission selling, the service level goes up,'' said Peter Schaeffer, vice president of Bloomingdale's in New York, which began converting its sales force to a commission structure this summer. ''As a result, this Christmas there will be fewer part-time employees.''
 
Avoiding 'the Claw'
 The danger of commission selling, however, is summed up by something that retailers call ''the claw,'' a sales person who will not let go until the customer buys. Susan O'Dell, president of Mandev Consulting in Toronto, said consumers will not fully benefit until retailers make it clear to their sales staffs that ''they are more heavily rewarded for creating a client for life than for making an immediate sale today.'' She added, ''This insures customers don't feel pushed and oversold.''
While store employees are likely to earn more in commissions than in salaries, more and more merchants are also augmenting their staffs with sales people who are on the payrolls of their suppliers.
This practice, long prevalent in departments like cosmetics, jewelry and shoes, has spread to other areas like ready-to-wear clothes and accessories.
''This trend has been growing because manufacturers feel that retailers can't do some of the things that should be done,'' said Walter K. Levy of Walter K. Levy & Robert E. Kerson Associates, a New York consulting firm. ''There are also people called rotators who are paid for by manufacturers and go to different stores to make sure that their merchandise is properly displayed.''
 
An Effective Sales Force
 Missy Lo Monaco, the vice president for fashion merchandising at Bonwit Teller, said sales people who are paid wholly or partly by manufacturers are very effective in working with customers. She acknowledged that their primary loyalty may be to the producer paying their salary, but she added, ''If someone wants to see something from another collection, they will pass them on and won't leave them standing there.''
Another service that will be more obvious in the weeks ahead is the increasing number of personal shoppers in the big stores. These men and women, who know what goods are stocked in all departments, either accompany customers to speed their shopping expeditions through the store or select merchandise in advance to show them individually in a room far from the madding crowds. Typically this service is open to anyone, with no additional fee or minimum purchase requirement.
''Everyone wants to do business with the working woman who has more money than time,'' said James Posner, a New York retailing consultant.
''But if stores use personal shoppers, there is an obligation that they be up to the level of the women who need them. They have to be really good.''
 
One Hour, Eight Gifts
 One store with such a service is Saks Fifth Avenue, which calls ait the Fifth Avenue Clubs. The clubs' offices are laid out like private clubs, where clothing can be shown or where customers can meet an experienced employee who will take them around the store.
''You don't have to stop at each department and pay at each department,'' said Susan Olden, director of the clubs. ''In one hour you can do eight gifts and you're on your way.''
Macy's, which has long had a personal shopping service called Macy's by Appointment, developed a new wrinkle this year: a display in the personal shopping office at which impulse items culled from all over the store are displayed for sale.
''Time is so precious at Christmas that we decided we would set this up,'' said Linda Lee, a Macy's vice president. ''While someone is sitting and waiting for something to be wrapped, they can view 70 different items.''
Other experts agreed that a major thrust by retailers in the pre-Christmas period will be systems and procedures to get customers in and out of the stores quickly - with as many purchases as possible, of course.
''In many families they no longer have the designated shopper, namely the unemployed mother,'' said John R. Kelly, a sociologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. ''We did one study last year which showed that a main concern people have about shopping is the amount of time it takes.''
 
ESCORTS FOR SHOPPING
 Personal shoppers are sales people who know the merchandise in all departments and are paid to help you shop. A store may have 25 or more on duty in the holiday season. They work for salaries, not commissions, and will spend as much time as you need. Here are some things to remember:
* No minimum purchase is either required or implied, nor are there any extra charges for this service.
* It is best to call for an appointment, but personal shoppers who are available will take a customer through the store at any time.

HEADLINE: Economic Watch;
Curing the Greenhouse Effect Could Run Into the Trillions

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
World political leaders may be rushing to broad accord on the urgent need to halt global warming, but since the mid-1980's economists have been worrying about the bill. Their misgivings have been deepened by recent estimates of the cost of limiting emissions of carbon dioxide, which is the primary cause of the problem.
Economic analysts do not speak with one voice on the issue. But all recent studies, including those carried out by environmentalists, implicitly share one conclusion: unless it proves remarkably easy to adapt technologies that drastically cut the need for oil, natural gas and coal, the price of correcting the carbon dioxide problem will run to trillions of dollars through the next century.
By one pessimistic but not implausible estimate, the United States' annual cost of holding the line on carbon dioxide production could rival the current level of military spending. 
 
Obstacles to Consensus
Economists also agree that the benefits of reducing carbon dioxide are sure to vary greatly from place to place. That will make it difficult for countries to develop a consensus for a collective response to the problem.
Carbon dioxide and other pollutants trap infrared radiation from the sun in the earth's atmosphere, in much the same way a greenhouse works.
Some effort to curb carbon dioxide may eventually prove to be a cost-effective means of coping with the greenhouse effect. But in the near term, most economists conclude, a major effort to limit carbon effluent makes little economic sense unless it can be justified on grounds of energy security or tax revenue.
 
Overwhelmed Natural Processes
Scientists have long understood that certain trace-gases in the atmosphere efficiently trap solar energy and heat the planet. Some are naturally produced. But many, notably carbon dioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbons, are also byproducts of modern civilization, and are being spewed out faster than the biosphere can neutralize their effects. It is now generally if not universally believed that a resulting warming effect is overwhelming natural processes that tend to cool the atmosphere.
How fast the greenhouse gases are heating the air is not known. Neither the heating effect nor the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the air is thought to have direct effects on human health. But there is at least a chance that another century or perhaps less of unchecked accumulation would melt polar ice and alter weather patterns, leading to coastal flooding and radical changes in land fertility patterns.
For many environmental advocates, those who believe in the ethical obligation to pass on the biosphere intact to future generations, the policy message is clear and simple: move quickly to reduce the production of carbon dioxide, which accounts for about half the greenhouse effect.
 
Using Fear to Get Action
The cause has drawn support from diverse interests who share what David Harrison of the National Economic Research Associates consulting firm, calls ''the Christmas tree view.'' These groups hope to use greenhouse worries as a lever for everything from promoting nuclear power to tightening automobile mileage regulations.
This month, all 68 nations taking part in a high-level conference in the Netherlands agreed that carbon dioxide emissions would have to be stabilized.
Only objections from the United States, the Soviet Union and Japan prevented the conference from endorsing a goal of cutting emissions to 1988 levels by the year 2000. But William Nitze, a State Department official coordinating Bush Administration policy, acknowledges there is now heavy diplomatic pressure for an accord next year.
 
Simulations by Computer
Greenhouse politics have yet to be influenced by sober economic analysis, however. And while environmental groups would generally be inclined to draw different lessons from a new utility-financed simulation by Alan Manne of Stanford University and Richard Richels of the Electric Power Research Institute, almost everyone agrees that the computer model does illustrate the potential cost dimensions of carbon-dioxide containment.
The Manne-Richels model compares a hypothetical future of unconstrained carbon dioxide output with one in which carbon emissions are limited to the 1990 rate through 2000 and then gradually cut by 20 percent.
Even if no technological adaptation to break the link between energy production and fossil fuels proved possible, consumers could muddle through for a while by switching to natural gas, which delivers 70 percent more energy per pound of carbon effluent. But the carbon limit begins to bite deeply around the year 2010.
With cheap supplies of gas exhausted, the model estimates that a twentyfold increase in the price of coal would be needed to force sufficient changes toward energy conservation. Annual losses in output would reach about 5 percent of national income, or about $500 billion, in the year 2030.
Optimists, including the economist Irving Mintzer of the World Resources Institute, argue that technological innovations might sharply cut these costs. And the computer model bears him out. Some reasonably priced way of trapping smokestack carbon would reduce the economic impact by one-tenth.
A low-cost source of electricity from non-carbon fuels, providing solar, nuclear or geothermal energy, would trim it further. Technical change that increased the efficiency of energy use for the entire economy by 1 percent each year at low cost would do yet more.
 
Drop in American Incomes
But even the happy circumstance of technological victories on every front would still permanently reduce American incomes by about 1 percent, according to the Manne-Richels model. And 1 percent in a $5 trillion economy is a whopping $50 billion a year.
Other studies suggest that this most optimistic Manne-Richels scenario is too optimistic. William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale University, pegs the cost of containing carbon emissions to 1990 levels at 1 percent to 2 percent of national income by the middle of the next century. A study in progress by the Congressional Budget Office is reportedly yielding numbers in the same range.
High cost alone need not rule out action, of course, if the alternative is catastrophe. The mere possibility that the greenhouse effect could lead to greater climatic changes in the next 100 years than those experienced in the previous 10,000 might be expected to give even the most detached bean-counters cause to lose sleep.
But according to Thomas Schelling, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, such projections can be misleading. While climate has not changed rapidly in the last century, both the will and technological ability to adapt to radically different weather obviously has. In 1860, he says, 2 percent of Americans lived outside temperate or subtropical zones. By 1980, the percentage had increased to 22 percent.
 
Adjusting to Climate Changes
While changes in rainfall, temperature and sea level could be dramatic, there is yet no reason to believe that the process would be completed too quickly to allow evolutionary responses - expanding irrigation, for example, or building dikes. The cost of growing food might conceivably rise by 20 percent, Mr. Schelling speculates. But this loss, he argues, is almost certain to be overwhelmed by a century's worth of improvements in seed strains and growing techniques.
By the same logic, Mr. Schelling says, the appealing idea of bequeathing the biosphere intact seems arbitrary. The quality of life in 100 years, he suspects, will depend as much or more on the endowment of technology and capital as on the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air. And if money to contain carbon emissions comes out of other investment, future civilizations could be the losers.
This hardly means that the greenhouse effect can be safely ignored. But it does imply that it should be viewed as a problem in balancing costs against benefits. And here, crude initial estimates suggest that for the next half-century or more it may be cheapest to deal with the effects of global warming rather than the causes.
For example, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the cost of protecting America's coastal cities against a three-foot rise in sea level would be $73 billion to $111 billion, a lot of money but not so much compared with the likely cost of prevention.
A doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide, likely to occur by the middle of the next century if output is not constrained, would dramatically reduce yields for some crops in some regions. But according to a 1989 study by three Agriculture Department economists, the net losses would be less than one-tenth of 1 percent of income in industrial countries. Argentina and Australia would actually be economic winners, since the likely fall in yields would be smaller than the increases in world prices.
 
Nations Most at Risk
This illustrates a looming problem in prevention strategies. The benefits from controlling greenhouse gases would be far greater in some countries than in others. Bangladesh, India and the Netherlands are at great risk from coastal flooding. But many countries would be able to expand farming into regions that are now too cold or too dry to support it. And a few, like Saudi Arabia, would lose much of their national income in a successful attempt to curb the use of fossil fuels.
The costs of carbon conservation would vary enormously. China, for example, is counting on its rich supplies of coal to develop with limited dependence on imported energy and capital.
Yet without a broad, enforceable agreement on containing carbon, expenditures by individual countries would not pay off. Lester Lave, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University, argues that an early commitment by the United States to tough carbon standards could lead to the worst of both worlds. ''We pay attention to treaties,'' he says. But big carbon emitters like China and the Soviet Union might ignore their obligations, undermining the whole logic of collective action.''
Such considerations lead many economists, including Mr. Lave, to counsel waiting until more is known before trying to devise preventative measures. Dan Dudek, an economist for the Environmental Defense Fund, draws a different conclusion. He wants to buy a modest amount of insurance against the small possibility of a true greenhouse effect disaster, some as yet undiscovered ecological effect that is impossible to reverse.
This is the time, he argues, to experiment with flexible ''emissions-trading'' systems that ''improve the menu of options'' for slowing global warming at minimum cost. Electric utilities might, for example, buy the right to emit carbon from existing emitters, or plant a sufficient number of trees to absorb an equivalent amount of carbon effluent.
Mr. Nordhaus offers a different rationale for action soon. The potential damage from the greenhouse effect has not been pinned down yet, he concludes; but some damage is almost certainly being done. And any sensible approach to balancing costs and benefits in the future will almost certainly involve a limited attempt to control greenhouse gas emissions, along with parallel efforts to sequestor carbon and mitigate the effects of global warming.
 
A Financial Incentive
A modest tax on greenhouse gases, one targeted at heavily damaging chlorofluorocarbons as well as carbon dioxide, would thus be very likely to increase economic efficiency; it would also give emitters a financial incentive to search for alternative carbon-free technologies. And it could provide billions in taxes to offset the Federal deficit.
Virtually all economists seem to agree on the need to get beyond what Mr. Lave calls the ''Earth Day come back'' syndrome. The symbol of greenhouse effect, they argue, cannot be allowed to obscure the dimensions of the perplexing, high-stakes problem that lies beneath.

HEADLINE: AIR FORCE OFFERS TO CLOSE 15 BASES AND SCRAP MISSILES

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Responding to the Administration's call for major cuts in military spending, the Air Force has proposed closing 15 bases, stretching out purchase of the Stealth bomber and eliminating five fighter wings, Administration officials said today.
The Air Force plan also proposes cuts in purchases of the F-16 fighter, retiring some B-52 bombers that carry conventional weapons and retiring Minuteman II nuclear missiles. The proposal came in response to an order from Defense Secretary Dick Cheney for the services to offer reductions totaling $180 billion from projected spending levels in the three years that begin with the 1992 budget year.
The officials said the Air Force cuts equal about $34 billion, about $10 billion short of the amount the service was asked to find for the three years. #2 Factors Propel Policy It could not be learned today what the other services had suggested to meet the goals set by Sean O'Keefe, the Pentagon's comptroller. Some Pentagon officials have said cuts of two to three Navy carriers and several Army divisions would be necessary to meet the targets. 
Mr. Cheney's request for the $180 billion in cuts from projected spending from 1992 through 1994, disclosed this week, has been driven by the need to reduce the Federal deficit and respond to reforms in Eastern Europe, Pentagon officials said.
The decision to consider cuts of this magnitude is one of the major policy developments in the first year of President Bush's Administration.
The proposed Air Force reductions reflect the difficulties the Bush Administration faces in trying to rein in Pentagon spending without becoming caught up in the whirlpools of self-interest in military services and on Capitol Hill.
The Air Force plan proposes reducing the number of American bases worldwide to 125 from 140, 10 more than it had been previously expected to do. Officials did not say which bases would be cut. Proposals for base closings have historically touched off fevered protests from the House members and senators whose constituents are effected.
 
Counter to Cheney's Wishes
And the preference for stretching out procurement, as opposed to killing weapon systems outright, runs counter to Mr. Cheney's stated preference for making hard choices.
In general, Pentagon officials oppose delaying procurement because it forces inefficiencies in production, thus raising the cost per weapon.
The Air Force proposal does call for canceling some small programs for bombs or missiles, but prefers to extend procurement when it comes to the Amraam missile to shoot down fighter planes, one of the service's more favored new programs.
The plan calls for cutting the number of fighter wings to 31, from 36.
Military officials said the Air Force intends to submit further reductions in the coming days. Administration officials defended the Air Force recommendation against eliminating major weapons programs, citing the importance of maintaining weapons that are the subject of ongoing arms control talks.
Mr. O'Keefe asked the services to come up with cuts totaling $43 billion in fiscal 1992, $59 billion in fiscal 1993 and $78 billion in fiscal 1994, representing a reduction of approximately 5 percent annually after recent assumptions about the rate of inflation are incorporated, Administration officials said.
The Pentagon is looking to the long-term reductions even as it prepares a budget for the fiscal year 1991 that will cut military spending after inflation. An option under consideration includes cuts of about 3 percent.
Administration officials and lawmakers say Mr. Cheney stands at the center of maelstrom as the Administration tries to work out what may become the sharpest cuts in military spending since the end of the Vietnam War.
In an interview with The Washington Post today, Mr. Cheney said he was carrying out President Bush's instructions in ordering Pentagon budget analysts to find ways to cut spending. In assigning the task to Mr. Cheney, the President has underscored a striking feature of the political alignments in his Cabinet. Mr. Cheney, whether by accident or design, has positioned himself as one of the Administration's foremost skeptics about change in the Soviet Union and has thus armed himself with the hard-line credentials needed to roll Pentagon spending back from the high levels reached in the years of President Ronald Reagan's military buildup.
The American military cuts are coming at a time when the Soviet Union is beginning to make its own. Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet President, has said the Soviet Union will cut its military spending by 14.2 percent beginning in 1989.
In an interview today on the CNN program ''Evans & Novak,'' Mr. Cheney confirmed that the Soviet Union has cut military spending this year.
The outlines of the Pentagon spending problem have been clear from the moment Mr. Bush anchored his Presidential campaign on a pledge of no new taxes. But they have come into sharper relief in recent weeks, as the fast-moving events in Eastern Europe have increased the pressure for a dramatic change in the military budget.
 
Money for Other Purposes
Mr. Bush's political advisers believe that to hold his support among younger voters, he must make some dramatic proposal on issues of concern to them, which polls show are drugs, the environment and education. One of the largest amounts of money available to deal with these problems is the Pentagon budget.
Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has confided to associates that he fears that the combined impact of the deficit and the euphoria over changes in Eastern Europe could stampede the Administration into cuts of as much as 25 percent in the military's forces over the next five years.
Administration officials say they are determined to learn the lessons of the 1970's, when the Pentagon achieved the post-Vietnam reductions by cutting across the board. Instead of eliminating whole divisions, for example, the Army shaved money for men and supplies from each outfit. The effect of this, Administration officials said, was to create a ''hollow Army'' that looked good on paper but was ill-prepared for combat.

HEADLINE: New York City Opera Union Ratifies a 5-Year Contract

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL

 BODY:
Members of the New York City Opera orchestra have ratified a new five-year contract with the company, officials of their union announced yesterday.
The ratification, by a 47 to 16 vote, concluded a bitter 66-day strike that led to the cancellation of the City Opera's fall season at the New York State Theater and jeopardized its spring musicals season and the company's very future.
The vote took place Wednesday night at the State Theater, but the results were sealed until the executive board of the union, Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, could meet yesterday morning.
''I think this contract is a major victory for both sides,'' said Martin J. Oppenheimer, vice chairman of the City Opera board and its chief negotiator. ''The orchestra has gotten increases that are fair and reasonable, and the company got what is perhaps most important, long-term stability.'' 
 
'A Huge Negative'
John Glasel, president of Local 802, sounded less sanguine. ''We're glad it's over and we hope the contract will lead to better relations,'' he said. ''In my personal opinion, though, the five years is a huge negative.''
Frank Morelli, the orchestra's principal bassoonist and chairman of its negotiating committee, said he thought the contract was the best one possible under the circumstances.
''I'm not really satisfied,'' he said. ''We were faced with the choice of coming to terms with this board or taking them at their word that they would go out of business rather than meet industry standards. I personally couldn't assume the responsibility of trying to force this thing to a cataclysm and hoping something better would emerge from the ashes.''
Christopher Keene, the opera's general director, was more optimistic. ''Five years will give us the chance to improve our relations with the orchestra without being disrupted every three years,'' he said.
 
The Major Provisions
The new contract runs retroactively from June 1 but will not compensate musicians for wages lost in the strike.
Its important terms include:
* A five-year duration, rather than the normal three years.
* Annual raises of roughly 6 percent, with a weekly base minimum of $800 this year - up from $755 in the final year of the last contract - to $1,000 in 1993-4.
* A comparable rise in the hourly rate for rehearsals, with an annual rehearsal guarantee starting in the second year.
* A cost of living provision in which wages can rise up to an additional 2 percent if the New York Consumer Price Index exceeds 6 percent in 1992.
* A rise in the second year in the number of guaranteed workweeks, from 23 to 26, with the elimination of the current six weeks in which either work is provided or half-pay supplementary unemployment benefits are paid. In the fifth year, the guaranteed weeks drop to 25 but the vacation weeks rise from three to four.
* An increase in the pension payments from the current 8 percent of performance pay to 9 percent in the third year and 10 percent in the fifth.
* A reduction in each player's workload in the fourth year from five and one-half performances per week to five and an increase, slightly greater than that received by the regular players, for some 100 substitute musicians who periodically perform with the orchestra.
 
Parity With Other Orchestras
As a whole, the package would seem closer to the company's original goals than those of the orchestra. The orchestra had been seeking parity with the orchestras of the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the San Francisco Opera, which already earn about 20 percent more than the City Opera musicians. An average City Opera player received approximately $27,000 from the company during the last year of the old contract.
Yesterday each side blamed the other for the strike. ''We had to go out just to get the negotiation started,'' Mr. Glasel complained.
The company hopes to settle soon on new contracts with its other unions, chief among them the American Guild of Musical Artists, which represents about 250 singers, choristers, dancers and stage directors.
This strike was but the latest stage in a troubled history of labor relations between the City Opera and its orchestra. Since 1962, every contract negotiation except 1986 resulted in a work stoppage.
Asked if this contract would lead to the same bitterness that followed the 54-day strike of 1983, John Palanchian, vice president of Local 802 and a City Opera violinist for 22 years, said the new pact was better than that of six years ago.
''At least this time,'' he said, ''we didn't have to go through all this agony for nothing.''

HEADLINE: Town Digs Out From Tumbleweed Invasion

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOBRIDGE, S.D., Nov. 15

 BODY:
Some people may see romance in the vision of tumbleweeds rolling along the prairie, but Mayor Darrell Bender of Mobridge sees only horror stories.
His town spent the past week and $8,500 digging out from under 30 tons of the dry prairie weeds.
''We had houses completely buried, streets plugged and alleys blocked,'' Mayor Bender said. ''If I hadn't seen it, I wouldn't have believed it could happen. The worst part is, nothing is to stop it from happening again. All it will take is another strong west wind.'' 
Mobridge is a town of 4,180 people on the east bank of the Missouri River near the North Dakota border. Its economy is built on nearby wheat and corn farms and cattle feed lots, and in more recent years, on a growing number of fishermen and pleasure boaters who use the river.
 
'As Big as Cars'
Residents on the south and west edges of town awoke on the morning of Nov. 8 to find houses buried and streets blocked by thousands of tumbleweeds.
''Some of these things were as big as cars, and they'd piled so thick in one tree belt it looked like a sand dune,'' said John Rothstein, who owns an insurance agency here. ''People had to take front-end loaders and tractors just to uncover their cars.''
Tumbleweed is the common name for a variety of plants that include the Russian thistles prevalent in South Dakota. They grow into fat puffballs in untended fields and ditches and along fences. In late summer and early fall, it is common to see them rolling across a highway or clinging to barbed-wire fences.
The tumbleweeds that bombarded Mobridge grew to an unusual size in the fertile river valley soil that is normally covered by the water of Lake Oahe, a 200-mile-long lake that extends almost from Pierre, S.D., to Bismarck, N.D. Two years of drought dropped the level of the lake this summer to 38 feet below the high-water mark. That uncovered an area of lake bottom two miles long and nearly one mile wide just outside of Mobridge.
A powerful west wind gusting to 60 miles an hour snapped the stalks of huge tumbleweeds and pushed them into town.
 
A Fire Hazard
''When I got up that morning, I couldn't see anything from most of my windows the weeds were so high and thick against my house,'' said Darlene Zahn. ''I couldn't even budge my door to let my little dog out, they were that tight.''
Ms. Zahn, the city finance officer, called the street department for help. Workers cleared a path but not before they gave her cause to worry.
''When I called, they said, Whatever you do, don't start your car,'' Ms. Zahn said. ''I got scared. The thought of a fire with all those things packed around, was really disturbing. There is no way I'd ever have gotten out of that house myself.''
Fire was Mayor Bender's biggest fear, too.
''When tumbleweeds are packed that tightly, they almost explode if they're ignited,'' he said. ''We had a dangerous situation, and we were fortunate to get out of it without injuries.''
City workers pulled weeds away from buildings and houses, and Mr. Bender hired a farmer to bring a four-wheel-drive tractor to crush the plants. The debris was fashioned into windrows, and another farmer brought a baler and picked up the windrows. #30 Tons of Tumbleweed ''We made 60 bales,'' Mr. Bender said. ''I figure 1,000 pounds to 1,200 pounds a bale, or at least 60,000 pounds of tumbleweed. That's 30 tons of weed. We used snow removal money to handle it.''
Unless weeds still growing along the river are somehow removed, the town could be buried again, Mr. Bender said.
''The long-range answer, of course, is a higher water level in the river to cover the problem,'' Mayor Bender said. ''That's not likely unless we get more rain and snow. In the meantime, we're a target for the next west wind that blows in.''

HEADLINE: Atlanta's Boom Area or City's Spoiler?

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Nov. 18

 BODY:
From a new skyscraper, Sam Massell presides over the boom town snaking along Peachtree Road that is billed in its own magazine as ''the Cultural Crossroads of the South.''
Mr. Massell is a former Atlanta Mayor, but the locale being extolled is Buckhead, the affluent, overwhelmingly white north Atlanta neighborhood where Mr. Massell is known these days as the unofficial mayor.
Buckhead has been a loosely defined part of Atlanta for 150 years. But when the Georgia Department of Transportation recently put up highway signs officially denoting the area, it posed some intriguing questions about the cultural and economic role played by the whitest part of a city that is now almost 70 percent black. 
''People say, 'Y'all must be up to something,' '' said Mr. Massell, Atlanta's last white Mayor, who served from 1970 to 1974. He is now president of a year-old group of powerful business leaders and developers, the Buckhead Coalition.
''We're just trying to preserve and protect what's here,'' he said. ''We have no desire or thoughts of seceding from Atlanta.''
 
Role in Development
Others say that it is not quite so simple. The growth has played a major role in the city's economic vitality by capturing some of the development that might otherwise have gone to the suburbs. But some feel that the growth has also helped pull development farther from the city's black core south of downtown, creating a new white hub. At the least, what is going on is in keeping with Atlanta's historic preference for something new.
Buckhead's name dates from 1838, when someone killed a deer at what is now the heart of Buckhead's downtown, and then hung it on a post at Henry Irby's store. As Atlanta grew, Buckhead became its most prestigious section, an area of lush, dense foliage and gently rolling hills, with middle-class neighborhoods and the grandiose mansions of Atlanta's business elite.
Over the past decade, Buckhead has been transformed by a surge in construction that has left 20-story office towers, like the one Mr. Massell operates from, across the street from two-story mom-and-pop businesses. Buckhead now has almost 9 million square feet of office space, as against 12 million downtown. A boom in hotel construction will result in 4,000 hotel rooms, and Buckhead now has more than a billion dollars in annual retail sales, dwarfing that of downtown Atlanta.
Downtown Buckhead is also becoming more and more a haven for the Mercedes-and-white-wine crowd. It now offers a plethora of trendy bars and eateries; there are plans for people movers, increased density and more of the feel of a new downtown. Boosters, who like to describe Buckhead as Atlanta's answer to Beverly Hills or Palm Beach, say Buckhead's office market will eventually exceed downtown's.
''I would hate to think what Atlanta would be without a Buckhead,'' Mr. Massell crowed in a recent issue of Inside Buckhead, a slick magazine about the area. ''We are the tail wagging the dog.''
He went on to acknowledge that Buckhead needs the rest of Atlanta, and indeed there is no separating the two. In fact, Buckhead often functions as a reconstituted, upscale version of what Atlanta once was. Its own business elite, the Buckhead Coalition, is modeled after the downtown business establishment that has guided Atlanta's development, and it has the same evangelical zeal for growth.
Atlanta has for decades fought battles over highways planned for inner-city neighborhoods. But this year, the Buckhead Coalition was one of the most ardent backers of a plan approved by the Atlanta City Council in May to build a $274 million six-lane toll road through one of the most densely wooded residential neighborhoods in north Buckhead.
 
Other Side of Growth
Not everyone is happy with the growth and its choking traffic and neighborhood change. Many longtime residents feel that Buckhead, like Atlanta, is losing whatever sense of place and distinctiveness it once had.
''I don't think it will even be habitable in 20 years,'' said Anne Rivers Siddons, a novelist who has chronicled Buckhead life in books like ''Peachtree Road.'' ''Buckhead used to have this wonderful village feel to it, which we've totally lost. It's gone to hell in a BMW.''
To some, Buckhead's growth and the proposed new highway linking it with the white northern suburbs continue and perhaps accelerate the region's lopsided growth away from Atlanta's black majority.
''The harsh fact - in a sense, the sad fact - is that one of the key development forces is the desire of developers and investors to distance themselves from the black population,'' said Clarence Stone, a professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland who wrote ''Regime Politics,'' a recent book on the way Atlanta is run.
 
Integration at the Malls
But other observers, like Leon Eplan, Atlanta's former Planning Commissioner, and Tom Weyandt, Atlanta's Commissioner of Community Development, cite the spurt in construction in downtown Atlanta and say Buckhead is more the northern end of Atlanta's core than the southern end of the white suburbs. And they note that Buckhead's shopping malls serve a truly interracial clientele and that Buckhead bears a disproportionate share of Atlanta's tax burden.
In the late 1960's, James Dickey wrote a poem, ''Looking for the Buckhead Boys,'' in which he searches for the lost Buckhead of his youth. Twenty years later, what remained from his youth is gone as well.
''Most people who grew up in Buckhead can show you any skyscraper or any mall and tell you who used to live there,'' said John Huey, who grew up in Buckhead and is editor of Southpoint magazine here. ''That's Atlanta. When you see something go up, you know it won't be long until they tear it down for something else.''

HEADLINE: Congress Grinds Toward Adjournment

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Lurching toward adjournment, Congress slapped together agreements on politically difficult issues this weekend, from Congressional pay and ethics to the program to protect the elderly from the costs of extended illnesses.
Early this morning, the House gave final Congressional approval to a plan that would raise the salaries of House members, Federal judges and top Government employees by at least a third by 1991 and tighten the lawmakers' ethical rules. Senators chose to give themselves a smaller pay increase but to retain, at least for now, their outside speaking fees, which would be banned in the House.
Senate leaders, who implored their members to accept the House plan for themselves, issued an extraordinary series of rebukes when their pleas were rejected. ''We have failed the country, we have failed the institution and we have failed its future,'' said Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia. 
 
Bush Backs House Plan
The pay and ethics measure is on its way to President Bush, who has endorsed the House plan. A Presidential spokesman said today that the White House still had to review the final bill as amended by the Senate.
The measure won initial passage in the House on Thursday, approval by the Senate on Friday night with the addition of its plan for its own members, then final passage early Saturday morning by the House. The House agreed to the Senate changes and eliminated the need for a conference committee.
In keeping with legislative custom, Congress is suddenly moving on a variety of other fractious issues as next week's planned adjournment for the year approaches. After five weeks of intense bargaining, House and Senate negotiators agreed to accept a House bill that would repeal the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, which was intended to protect 33 million older Americans from the high costs of extended illnesses. The decision needs the approval of the House and the Senate.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who was an architect of the program, told reporters about midnight Friday that negotiators were unable to reach a consensus to salvage the program. There was, he said, ''a lot of deep disappointment, starting with me.''
The program had proved enormously controversial because of the surtax it levied on about 40 percent of the elderly beneficiaries to help cover its costs. Some senators vowed they would wage a floor fight on Sunday to save part of the program.
The pay and ethics bill rolled through Congress over the past two days, with leaders in both parties intent on resolving an issue that has haunted this session from the start.
 
'I Regret This Decision'
Under the measure approved early this morning, beginning in 1991 House members would no longer be permitted to accept outside speaking fees, a practice that critics assert is a veiled attempt to influence lawmakers. Under current rules, House members can make up to 30 percent of their Congressional salary in speaking fees and other forms of outside earnings; senators can make up to 40 percent of their salary in speaking fees.
After an emotional and bitter debate Friday night, the Senate refused to accept the House plan for itself. Many senators appear to have made a political calculation that the speaking fees would be less controversial than a sizable pay increase.
''I regret this decision,'' George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, said after announcing that he could not muster a majority for adopting the House plan for the Senate and would not force a vote.
Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Republican whip, hailed the House's courage for accepting the larger pay increase, ''while the majority of this body choose to sneak and pad around in the alley and get the bucks.''
Under this legislation House members, Federal judges and top Government employees would get a raise of 7.9 percent in 1990, and 25 percent more, plus an adjustment to make up for inflation, a year later. House leaders estimated that this would raise members' salaries by as much as 40 percent, from the current $89,500 to about $125,000 in 1991.
The Senate, meanwhile, would get a raise in 1990 of close to 10 percent, rising from $89,500 to $98,400. The legislation says that the Senate would eventually ban the acceptance of outside speaking fees, and would reduce the amount that senators could accept, dollar for dollar, as their Congressional salary goes up. But it sets no time frame for their elimination.
 
Close In on Deficit Plan
The late-night session also brought lawmakers an important step closer to final agreement on a plan to reduce the deficit. House and Senate tax negotiators cleared a final hurdle when they tentatively agreed on a plan to raise additional revenue to meet the deficit reduction targets.
Most of the revenue increases would affect businesses rather than individuals. That could clear the way for both Houses to act Sunday on the plan to reduce the deficit.
The plan is aimed at lifting most, but not all, of the $16 billion in across-the-board spending cuts imposed by the President on Oct. 16. The cuts were required under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law because Congress and the President had failed to agree on their own package to reduce the deficit by that date.
Under the tentative agreement between the two Congressional tax committees, a variety of popular tax breaks due to expire at the end of this year, and several that have previously expired, would be extended through Dec. 31, 1991.
Both Houses are pushing to complete their business and adjourn for the year on Monday. But there are many pitfalls along the way, including the possibility of a floor fight in the Senate over the repeal of the health care plan. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said he would use whatever tactic is available to stop the repeal.

As U.S. Assesses East-Bloc Policy, Experts Differ on How Bold It Should Be

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
American foreign policy experts interviewed last week differed widely on what steps the United States Government might take to respond to the radical changes under way in Eastern Europe.
The experts, including scholars and former Government officials, differed on whether Washington should move boldly or cautiously in setting policy on substantive matters. Those included troop reductions, relations with West Germany and the security arrangements of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Their views, offered mainly by telephone in response to questions from The New York Times, generally fell within the parameters defined by Professor Charles Gati of Union College in Schenectady, a specialist in Soviet and Eastern European relations. 
''U.S. policy must steer between two conflicting assumptions,'' he said. ''One is that a historic change is indeed under way in the Soviet Union and in Europe. The other is that the changes that have happened are reversible.
''We simply cannot forget the lesson of Tiananmen Square,'' he said, referring to the Chinese Government's crackdown on the democracy movement in June.
 
The 'Best Place' for Troops
Caspar W. Weinberger, who served as Defense Secretary in the Reagan Administration, said, ''I do not believe that the U.S. security role should be reduced'' in Europe.
''We must recognize that we are not in NATO or in Europe for purely altruistic reasons,'' he said. ''We are there because that is the very best place to defend the United States.
''Our presence there undoubtedly helps materially in the defense of freedom in Europe. But that defense of freedom is enormously in our interest, too. So the main thrust of U.S. policy in Europe should be to stay there.''
Mr. Weinberger, a lawyer who is now publisher of Forbes magazine, said he did not feel that ''anything has yet happened in the world situation that warrants deep reductions in U.S. or NATO military strength - certainly not at this time.''
''The Soviet military threat remains just as great despite a great deal of soothing rhetoric,'' he said.
 
Gorbachev's Prospects Uncertain
Referring to the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, he said, ''Even if Mr. Gorbachev should be completely honest and sincere in all that he has said, we have no indications whatever of how long he may remain in office, and we do not know who or what his successor would be.''
''Under those circumstances,'' Mr. Weinberger continued, ''it would be criminal folly for us to reduce the strength of our military, which after all was a key factor in producing much of the changed behavior we seem to be seeing now.''
Mr. Weinberger was commenting before published reports that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has ordered the armed services to draw up plans for cutting $180 billion in projected spending. The decision reflects the Bush Administration's judgment that the Federal budget deficit and political changes in Europe are eroding support for growth in military spending.
''If there are any troop reductions, they ought to be asymmetrical ones,'' Mr. Weinberger said, ''in which the Soviets would make very much greater reductions than NATO. That is because the Soviets still have a very large imbalance in their favor.''
 
Cuts 'in the Interest of Both'
Prof. Stanley Hoffmann, a political scientist who is chairman of Harvard University's Center for European Studies, said he was certain that troop cuts would take place in Europe within the next three years. ''It's in the interest of both superpowers,'' he said, ''and of course the West Germans are rather eager to be able to reduce their defense establishment also.
''Since there isn't any likelihood of war in Europe, there is no need to maintain the number of troops and weapons which were deemed necessary in the past,'' he added.
Professor Hoffmann, who analyzes American foreign policy, particularly relations with Europe, said that West Germany's continued role as a NATO stalwart would ''very much depend on whether, at some moment in the future, the Soviets offer to West Germany reunification in exchange for neutralization, and whether the West Germans then decide that this is in their interest, which they very well might.
''But ultimately, I think, that particular card is in the hands of the Soviets,'' he said. Neutralization of Germany ''would really mean the end of the two alliances,'' he noted, referring to NATO and the Warsaw Pact.''
 
Reductions 'All to the Good'
Richard Pipes, a director of Eastern European and Soviet affairs in the National Security Council under President Reagan, said, ''I believe it not only possible but likely for major troop reductions to occur in Europe in the next three years.
''If they are equitable, making allowance for the Soviet Union's closer proximity to Western Europe, and verifiable, they should be all to the good,'' he said in written remarks. ''The U.S. devotes some 60 percent of its military budget to the defense of Europe.''
Mr. Pipes, who is the Baird Professor of History at Harvard, said, ''I think it important that the United States, Great Britain and France make it unmistakably clear to Bonn that they will take strong exception to any German arrangements with Moscow at their expense.''
''Even if major troop reductions occur in Europe, and East-West relations improve considerably, Europe is likely to remain the principal focus of our security concerns for strategic, economic and political reasons,'' he said. ''Even a genuine detente is not going to mark an end of great-power competition.''
 
A 'Logical and Sensible' Step
Helmut Sonnenfeldt, counselor of the State Department in the Nixon and Ford Administrations, said that troop reductions were ''a logical and sensible accompaniment to the political transformations that are occurring in the East, and consequently with regard to the division of Europe.''
Mr. Sonnenfeldt, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said he believed that West Germany would ''remain a major member of the Atlantic alliance in presently forseeable circumstances.
''Of course, there already are serious differences between the Germans and other alliance members on questions of nuclear weapons, or the deployment of nuclear weapons, and of chemical weapons also.
''But I don't believe this affects the basic German decision that it remains in their interest to be tied to the United States and to other European powers through the Atlantic alliance,'' he said.

Western Europe Pledges to Aid East

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 18

 BODY:
At an impromptu summit meeting called by France, leaders of the European Community nations tonight pledged to provide all possible economic assistance to East bloc countries that move toward democracy.
The informal session, held over dinner at Elysee Palace, was aimed principally at emphasizing the 12-nation community's determination to play an active role in the process of change sweeping Eastern Europe.
The 12 leaders also gave provisional approval to a French proposal that a new European Development Bank be created to provide low-interest loans to help finance the modernization of Eastern European countries.
 
Aid Linked to Democracy
The community leaders, who in the past have clashed over the pace and extent of their countries' own process of economic integration, appeared to have agreed on the need to link their aid program to democratic advances in Eastern Europe. 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who has often been at odds with her European colleagues, said tonight that ''we wish to do everything we can to encourage reform and the process of democracy through the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.''
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany also used the occasion to assuage fears expressed in Paris and other Western European capitals that the dramatic developments in East Germany over the last 10 days might result in a weakening of Bonn's commitments to the community.
''He who thinks we should now withdraw from Europe and take care of German things betrays the reform movement in East Germany, Poland, Hungary and surely tomorrow in Czechoslovakia as well as betraying perestroika in the Soviet Union,'' Mr. Kohl told reporters after the three-hour meeting.
 
Bush-Gorbachev Summit
President Francois Mitterrand of France, who is serving as President of the European Community until the end of this year, also played down speculation that the meeting was called to anticipate the meeting between President Bush and the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, off Malta on Dec. 2 and 3.
Mr. Mitterrand said he had spoken with Mr. Bush by telephone this week and would do so again in the coming days. He added that he expected to meet with Mr. Bush next month. Mrs. Thatcher said the American President would personally brief the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels after the Malta summit.
 
'Politics of Europe'
Mr. Mitterrand, who addressed a crowded press conference this evening, did nonetheless concede that one motive for tonight's session was to prevent developments in Eastern Europe from dominating the regular biannual community summit meeting to be held in Strasbourg on Dec. 8 and 9.
France hopes that at that meeting the European Community will approve a timetable for accelerating its move toward economic and monetary union as part of an existing program to create a single regional market by the end of 1992.
''If tonight's meeting was called urgently,'' the French President said, ''it was because everyone felt the need to talk about the politics of Europe.''
The focus of the debate, he said, was on how the community can help create healthier economies in Eastern Europe ''in exchange for a verified return to democracy, respect for human rights and the calling everywhere of free and secret elections.''
 
Poland and Hungary Discussed
He noted there was extensive discussion of the needs of Poland and Hungary, which already have economic agreements with the community. He added that it was essential that both countries reach agreements on new economic programs with the International Monetary Fund before the end of this year.
Referring to East Germany, he said its ''expected evolution toward democratic reform'' would open the way for conclusion of similar economic accords with the community. Noting that Bulgaria ''will probably go the way of the others,'' Mr. Mitterrand emphasized that the community wanted to encourage all reform movements in Eastern Europe.
The French leader said tonight's meeting had also asked for a study on his proposal for creation of a European Development Bank. A report, to be prepared by Mr. Mitterrand, Spain's Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez, and Ireland's Prime Minister, Charles Haughey, will be presented to next month's summit meeting in Strasbourg.
But Mr. Mitterrand also warned that the community's commitment to completing its own integration program meant that it would not be possible for new members to join the 12 before 1993. He said this would affect not only Turkey and Austria, which have already applied for membership, but also countries of Eastern Europe.
Jacques Delors, the former French minister who participated in today's meeting in his capacity of President of the European Commission, arrived here today after holding talks in Hungary and Poland on the specific needs of the two governments.
In Budapest on Friday, Mr. Delors, who was accompanied by the French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, held open the possibility of a loan to tide the Government over until Hungary's first free elections since 1947 are held early next year. He noted that Poland and Hungary were countries ''as European as us,'' and might eventually become ''cousins'' of the Community.
In Warsaw, Mr. Delors Mr. Delors said Poland and Hungary could receive as much as $1 billion from the Luxembourg-based European Investment Bank, while the community could take separate measures to strengthen the Polish currency.

Congress Approves Aid Plan Of $852 Million for Poland

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Congress approved legislation early today to support democracy and private enterprise in Poland with a major new program of economic aid over the next three years.
President Bush is expected to sign the bill, even though it provides twice as much money as he requested. The bill provides $852 million for Poland and $86 million for Hungary.
Final approval of the legislation came at 1:10 A.M. when the Senate, by voice vote, adopted a compromise version worked out in negotiations with the House of Representatives. 
Lech Walesa, the founder of Solidarity, appealed for such assistance when he addressed Congress on Wednesday. More than four decades of Communist rule have ''led the Polish economy to ruin, to the verge of utter catastrophe,'' he said.
 
Giving Solidarity a Chance
The legislation was immensely popular on Capitol Hill, but was delayed by two months of partisan wrangling. Republicans did not want Democrats to get too much credit for the legislation, feared a huge aid package could embarrass Mr. Bush and insisted that the bill promote the development of a Western-style free-market economy in Poland.
Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, hailed the bill as ''a wager on Poland's experiment with democracy and an investment in our security,'' and he said it would give ''Solidarity a fighting chance to succeed.''
Mr. Simon, who has many Polish-American constituents, steered the bill through the Senate. He is up for election in 1990, has been listed as a prime target by Republican strategists and faces a challenge from Representative Lynn Martin, who suggested that a recent trip to Poland by Mr. Simon was politically motivated.
The bill, the Support for East European Democracy Act of 1989, seeks ''to facilitate the transition from state-directed controls to a free-market economy'' in Poland and Hungary.
It would provide Poland with $125 million in food aid and $240 million in grants to private businesses, including at least $25 million to help modernize Poland's telephone system. The bill provides up to $200 million to support the Polish currency, the zloty, whose exchange rate against the dollar sometimes fluctuates wildly. Poles have so little confidence in their currency that important business transactions are often conducted in dollars.
 
Loans to Import U.S. Goods
The legislation also provides Federal guarantees for up to $200 million in loans to Polish companies wishing to import American products.
The bill directs the Bush Administration to seek ''a generous and early rescheduling program for debts owed by the Government of Poland'' to the United States and other countries.
It also directs the Labor Department to help Poland develop job retraining programs and a system of unemployment insurance for people who may lose their jobs if state-run industries lay off workers or private businesses go bankrupt.
The bill also provides money to finance academic and cultural exchanges with Poland; to train Polish managers in Western business techniques, and to help Poland reduce air pollution and other environmental problems. $10 Million to Teach Capitalism The United States would spend $10 million to teach Poles the ''commercial, entrepreneurial, financial, scientific and technical skills'' needed in a market economy.
Ted L. Kontek, a founder of the Friends of Solidarity, in Washington, welcomed the aid package, saying, ''It will do a lot to help Poland get out of its economic disaster.''
Rafal H. Krawczyk, a profesor of economics at the Catholic University of Lublin, in Poland, said the United States must follow up to make sure the money is wisely spent.
''The Polish Government has a lot of good will, but it is easy to waste money in Eastern Europe,'' said Mr. Krawczyk, who is spending the year in Washington at the Heritage Foundation. ''Polish officials define the market from handbooks of socialist economics. The difference between the Eastern European understanding of markets and the reality is bigger than you could imagine.''
 
Big Demand for Dollars
The Solidarity-led Government of Poland has adopted an economic plan that calls for making zlotys more freely convertible into dollars. If that happens, Mr. Krawczyk said, there might be a big demand for dollars, and Polish banks ''might run out of dollars in half a year.'' Nobody knows if the $200 million offered by the United States will be ''enough to keep the exchange rate stable,'' he said.
Representative William S. Broomfield, Republican of Michigan, said the Administration supported the final bill because it ''contains the basic legislative package'' requested by the President, as well as many features added by Congress.
The House approved an earlier version of the bill by a vote of 345 to 47 last month. The Senate passed a similar measure on Tuesday by a vote of 99 to 0.
 
'Enterprise Fund' for Hungary
Most of the money for Hungary, $60 million of the $86 million, is for an ''enterprise fund'' that will make loans and grants to private businesses and credit unions in Hungary. The remainder is for scholarships, cultural exchange programs, medical aid and various forms of ''technical training.''
Conservatives who often vote against foreign aid supported the bill, in part because it states that Poland and Hungary should dismantle wage and price controls and give citizens ''full rights to acquire and hold private property.''
Liberals said their support was motivated in part by a belief that the United States could safely reduce military spending if Poland and Hungary became more firmly committed to democracy and free-market economic principles.

HEADLINE: CLAMOR IN THE EAST;
Capitalism Arrives in Hungary With a Vengeance

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, Nov. 18

 BODY:
The gold rush is on in the new Republic of Hungary, even before the shape of its future government is clear.
Every weekend, the Audis and BMW's and Opels and Mercedes-Benzes roar in from West Germany and Austria, laden with shoppers and sightseers, and the hotels are so packed with businessmen that message centers and room-service waiters often cannot cope.
There were three or four antique shops on Buda's Castle Hill last summer, when President Bush was in town; now there are almost a dozen. Workmen are building new boutiques all over the city. Prices for vacation houses on Lake Balaton are soaring. 
General Electric has bought a controlling interest in the Tungsram Company, a long-established light-bulb manufacturer, and hopes to challenge Siemens and Philips in Europe from a Hungarian base. That deal was worth $150 million. General Motors is believed to be close to signing a $200 million deal to build auto engines near Gyor in northwestern Hungary.
 
Koreans Buy the Hilton
A South Korean group, local business executives reported, has closed a deal in the last 48 hours to buy the Budapest Hilton Hotel. The Japanese Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, is planning to visit Hungary in January, and the word is that he will have something to announce, perhaps an agreement on a car factory.
Working feverishly to keep up, the interim Government of Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth put out major policy statements this week on the establishment of a stock exchange, on telecommunications and on energy policy. It decided to set up a Labor Ministry to look after the interests of workers in the new capitalist environment. Officials held talks about aid with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and with Jacques Delors, president of the European Community, and Roland Dumas, the French Foreign Minister.
Foreign Minister Gyula Horn flew to Strasbourg to present his nation's application for full membership in the Council of Europe, a grouping of 23 Western European democracies. The joint, in other words, is jumping. Ronald S. Lauder, erstwhile candidate for Mayor of New York and before that Ambassador to Austria, flew into Budapest this weekend from Moscow, where the family cosmetics business has just opened a shop. It already has a thriving outlet here on Vacy Utsa, the local equivalent of Fifth Avenue.
 
'Not for Short Hits'
Now Mr. Lauder, who plans three more visits before Christmas, is looking for hotels, tourist businesses and manufacturing companies to buy -''not for short hits,'' he said, ''but good companies that, with an injection of capital from us, can grow and export, which is the way to generate earnings in hard currency.''
Sitting in the lobby of the Forum Hotel, where at least half a dozen groups of businessmen were huddling, Mr. Lauder said Eastern Europe and especially Hungary ''have got Americans so worked up that they're doing deals they would walk away from in the United States or Western Europe.''
With office space short, communications shaky and the political situation unsettled, Mr. Lauder said, ''a few people will make a lot of money, and a lot of plungers who don't know the territory will lose their shirts.''
Ultimately, the country's leaders promise, all of this activity will benefit the average Hungarian, who so far has seen little profit from the coming of capitalism. For the moment, inflation is cutting into the small fixed income of pensioners, and the forint, the Hungarian currency, is losing ground. Officially, the rate is 55 to the dollar, but in the streets it is rapidly approaching 100.
''I have to charge more, because the money isn't worth anything now,'' said a gray-haired dealer in the flea market, where foreigners flock in search of Jugendstil treasures.
 
Race of Decline vs. Reform
Several months ago, Janos Szentagothai, a former president of the Academy of Science, described the future of Hungary as ''a race between economic decline and political reform.'' His meaning was that it was unclear whether political change would come fast enough to halt the slippage in living standards in a country with an average annual income of only $2,200, about half of that in South Korea.
In formal terms, the change has come faster here than anywhere else in Europe. Hungary's old Communist Party has broken in two - a Socialist Party, which is the official successor to the old party, and a hard-line Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, which pictures itself as the only real bearer of the Marxist torch.
But there is no sign that either remnant has been able to shake the stigma of the past and establish itself as a popular force. Only 30,000 of the Communist Party's 720,000 members have joined the Socialists. And none of the new parties has had enough time yet to build a widespread following.
The really hard economic decisions have not been made, because no one, in advance of the elections, wants to be blamed for causing hardship.
So the gargantuan agricultural co-ops have not been broken up into the efficient units that top economists here believe necessary. The industrial dinosaurs such as the steel mill at Miskolc have not been closed. The planning bureauracies have not been dismantled. The top-heavy Government-owned companies, many of them near-monopolies, have not been privatized. Payrolls have not been pared. And Professor Szentagothai's race is not over yet.
 
Only the Direction Is Clear
''Nothing is clear here except the direction,'' said Mark Palmer, the United States Ambassador to Hungary. ''The direction is toward democracy and toward a market economy. When the election will be held, what the system will be, who will win, whether the winners will get the economy under control - all of that is still impossible to predict.''

HEADLINE: Ban on Journal Erodes Thais' Tolerant Image

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Although Thailand's ban on the import and sale of The Asian Wall Street Journal is likely to be temporary, it is certain to diminish the country's reputation for tolerance. The damage has increased as the Government considers a similar ban on the weekly Far Eastern Economic Review.
In both cases, the Police Department and Interior Ministry are acting on complaints about particular articles that seem to have offended some Thais' notions of national dignity. Some Government officials, particularly around the Prime Minister, Chatichai Choonhavan, are seeking to have the ban on The Journal lifted rapidly, perhaps as early as next week. The ban was imposed on Nov. 2, but was not enforced until Friday. 
It is not unimportant, some Thai officials acknowledge, that Mr. Chatichai had previously welcomed a suggestion by The Journal that it would like to start publishing in Bangkok next year, in addition to Singapore, Tokyo and Hong Kong, where the paper is edited.
Mr. Chatichai's goal is to make Bangkok a regional financial and publishing center with special ties to Indochina. He is said to understand that The Journal cannot consider printing in Bangkok so long as it is subject to political pressure or a ban on circulation.
The police say they banned The Journal because of an article published in August about a rift in Thai Buddhism, the official religion. The article, by John Berthelsen, focused on the arrest of a fundamentalist monk named Phra Bodhirak on charges of heresy. The story suggested that Buddhist practices can sometimes be less than pure, and clearly stirred the ire of the kingdom's Supreme Patriarch, Somdej Phra Nyanasamvara, who is appointed by the king.
While The Journal's editor, Barry Wain, says the paper received only one letter objecting to the article, a complaint was filed at the Police Department's Special Branch. A recommendation to ban The Journal was apparently forwarded to the Interior Ministry in September, which issued such an order in mid-October. On Nov. 2, the ban legally came into force when it was published in the Royal Gazette.
But no one informed The Journal or its distributor in Bangkok, The Nation, an English-language newspaper. And nothing happened until The Nation's older rival, The Bangkok Post, published a story on Thursday about the ban, along with an editorial criticizing its impact.
Apparently stung into action, the Police Department issued its ban effective with Friday's issue, which was not delivered to subscribers. Mr. Wain flew here and appealed to officials to lift the ban, saying that The Journal ''regretted any misunderstanding the article may have caused.''
The Asian Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Dow Jones, the American publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a circulation in Thailand of about 2,000 copies.
 
Applying U.S. Standards
The Journal is Asia's only regional English-language newspaper. The paper's efforts to apply American standards of journalism to countries whose domestic media are often censored or controlled has caused it many difficulties, most of all in Singapore.
Dow Jones also owns the Far Eastern Economic Review, a respected weekly magazine. A recent article about AIDS and the sex industry in Thailand, entitled ''The Lust Frontier,'' apparently offended the Tourism Authority of Thailand, which has asked the police to ban the magazine and to refuse to renew the visa of the author, Paul Handley. Mr. Berthelsen of The Journal said that his own Thai visa had just been renewed without difficulty.
The Thais have been moving from autocratic governments to a broader form of participatory democracy. Mr. Chatichai, in office since August 1988, is the first directly elected prime minister in 12 years. Still, it is a transition plagued by intermittent tensions.
While the Thai-language media have been subject to various constraints, foreign-language media have largely been left alone. Similar articles on sensitive topics have brought only oral complaints, provided that they are not published in the region.

HEADLINE: Greek Parties Make Final Effort for Coalition

BYLINE: By PAUL ANASTASI, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATHENS, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Greece's feuding political parties have embarked on a last-ditch effort to form an all-party government to end the political and economic crises resulting from this month's inconclusive general elections.
The negotiations, called by President Christos Sartzetakis, are taking place amid clashes between anarchists and the police and stringent credit restrictions to save the economy from collapse.
If the parties fail in their effort, then new elections will have to take place on Dec. 17, the third elections in six months. They have until Tuesday. 
The attempt to set up an all-party administration, a last resort specified under the Constitution, followed the successive failures of each of the three major parties to form a coalition government after the Nov. 5 election.
Though the conservative New Democracy Party outpolled the Socialist Party of former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, it fell 3 seats short of a majority in the 300-member Parliament. The conservatives, who got 46.2 percent of the vote, attributed the deadlock to the electoral law passed by the Socialist Government shortly before it lost power this year. The electoral system is also the main reason for the three major parties' failure so far to agree to an all-party administration. The Socialists and Communists are insisting on further changes to the law to make representation in Parliament more proportional to the popular vote, a move from which they and smaller parties would benefit. The conservatives, led by Constantine Mitsotakis, prefer reinforced proportional representation, by which the larger parties would get a boost in their number of seats to ease the formation of a stable one-party government. They say that adoption of the Socialist-Communist demands would increase political instability and that the economy would deteriorate further.
Mr. Papandreou, who remains a strong political figure despite being indicted on charges related to a wave of scandals, almost succeeded last weekend in forming a coalition with the Communists and several independents. But his efforts failed when his offer was rejected by the sole deputy of the environmentalist Green Party.
 
Economic Crisis Deepens
The political situation is aggravated by the economic crisis. The Bank of Greece last week imposed severe restrictions on credit and mortgage loans for the private sector, saying it needed the money to cover the enormous public deficit. It said there was only enough money to pay civil servants and pensioners up to the end of December. In addition, over the last two days students and anarchist groups have clashed with the police and have caused extensive damage during rallies marking the anniversary of a 1973 student uprising against the rightist military dictatorship. They also made an unsuccessful attempt to storm the United States air base in Athens, demanding that the American bases in Greece be abolished.
The uncertain political climate here since the first inconclusive elections in June has caused a sharp drop in investment and productivity, as well as losses on the stock exchange. Discussions of key foreign policy issues have also been suspended, including talks on the future of the American bases and the American extradition request for a Palestinian wanted in connection with the bombing of a Pan Am jet in 1982.

HEADLINE: Is It Time Now to Cry for 'Evita'?

BYLINE: By JAMES GREEBERG; James Greenberg is senior editor at American Film magazine.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Political unrest, financial collapse and bruised egos - enough to rival the life of the dramatic Eva Peron herself - have marked the tortured path of ''Evita'' from stage toward the screen. Like so many film projects in Hollywood that go on for years without being made, ''Evita'' is an example of the hazards of the high-stakes marriage between art and commerce.
 
Almost since its London opening in 1978, the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim
Rice opera has been talked about as a potential motion picture, and with good reason. To date, more than 100 productions have been staged in 12 languages. The show has grossed in excess of $300 million, and the sound track has sold more than 10 million units. Four film companies have had their hands on the property; seven directors have been considered, and at least 15 actresses have been touted. And still no movie. 
If the history of the production resembles an elephant described by blind men, as one participant put it, it is because everyone involved has a different version of what happened based on their own experience and self-interest. And, as is often the case in Hollywood, many of the those interviewed for this story would not speak for attribution, if at all, about sensitive issues.
It did seem, however, that when Oliver Stone was signed in April 1988 to direct the film version of ''Evita,'' the long-delayed production might finally get under way. Meryl Streep was in the wings to star as the Argentine actress who became mistress and wife to the dictator Juan Peron and a national hero. The Weintraub Entertainment Group was financing the film, Robert Stigwood was producing and a Christmas 1989 release was tentatively planned. Now Mr. Stone is gone, Ms. Streep is likely gone and W.E.G. is gone. What remains is Mr. Stigwood and a project in search of a production.
But the failure to get ''Evita'' made is not just simply a set of unfortunate circumstances. There are some persuasive reasons why the project has remained stagebound. To make any motion picture is difficult (''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next'' took 13 years), but Broadway musicals bring with them special problems. With the exception of the ''street'' musicals of the 70's (''Grease,'' ''Hair''), the tradition of film musicals has all but disappeared. The less than smash business of films such as ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' ''Godspell'' and ''Chorus Line'' delivered a sure message to producers that musicals were a genre in trouble artistically and commercially. Furthermore, for a young audience accustomed to the quick rhythms of MTV, a story in operatic form was regarded as problematic.
The producer Allan Carr (''Grease'' on film, with Mr. Stigwood, ''La Cage aux Folles'' on stage) agrees that ''musicals are like any other movies but trickier because you have not only the Hollywood people to satisfy but the Broadway people to satisfy, so what you've got are eight different camps vying for their own interests. Hollywood is terrified of Broadway.''
Over the years, ''Evita'' may have given the impression of being more active than it actually was. Because of Mr. Stigwood's relative silence on the matter, the press often took the slightest rumbling as fact. Among the more tantalizing combinations advanced by the media were: Franco Zeffirelli directing Diane Keaton; John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John and Elton John as Che Guevara, Eva Peron and Juan Peron, respectively; Bette Midler as Eva; Pia Zadora as Eva; Barbra Streisand as Eva and Elliott Gould as Juan; Sylvester Stallone as Che; Barry Gibb as Che and Meatloaf as Che.
 
Ken Russell Wanted Liza Minnelli
 In reality, Mr. Stigwood says that the project has had only two intense periods of activity: when Ken Russell was on board in the early 80's and most recently with Mr. Stone. There have been a number of directors who had ''great interest and will,'' says Mr. Stigwood, ''but not much clarity'' about how they would translate the play to the screen. ''When we sat down and talked they couldn't tell me how they'd do it.''
Paramount Pictures bought the rights to develop the material in 1981, and shortly thereafter Mr. Russell was named director with plans to shoot in Spain. At the time, the frontrunner for Eva was Elaine Paige, who had originated the role on the London stage. But as the librettist Tim Rice recalls, ''The Hollywood boys wanted an international film star, which I thought was generally narrow thinking, since so many films are hits without names.''
Mr. Russell, not surprisingly, had a mind of his own and screen-tested Liza Minnelli - in a blond wig. When he insisted that he could not make the film without her, Mr. Stigwood finally fired him. ''Russell was an insane choice and would have wrecked the film if he had gotten his hands on it,'' says Mr. Rice. ''I was relieved when he got the boot.'' Mr. Russell could not be reached for comment. Following Mr. Russell's departure, Mr. Stigwood attempted to pick up the pieces, and in not so rapid succession, the directors Herbert Ross, Richard Attenborough, Alan Pakula and Hector Babenco came and went.
 
Madonna Wanted A Rewritten Score
 The project was largely dormant in the mid-80's, with only occasional flurries of activity, as Mr. Stigwood went off to produce ''Staying Alive'' and other projects. By this time Paramount lost its enthusiasm but was briefly roused from its indifference when Madonna showed an interest. Obviously serious about playing the part, she arrived for a meeting with Mr. Stigwood with her hair styled in a 40's twist and decked out in an evening gown Eva Peron herself might have worn.
Mr. Stigwood was impressed with Madonna and actually thought she would be good in the role. His enthusiasm cooled considerably, however, when the actress requested that Andrew Lloyd Webber's score be rewritten to suit her. The producer did think enough of Madonna to suggest that Mr. Stone meet with her when he took over the reins, but a 15-minute meeting ended that possibility.
By 1987 the project seemed indefinitely stalled when Jerry Weintraub entered the picture. Mr. Weintraub was an old crony of Mr. Stigwood's from the music business who had made a fortune managing the careers of performers like Bob Dylan and John Denver and was now ready to move into the film business in a big way. He had raised some $460 million in bank loans and private investment to finance the Weintraub Entertainment Group, and one of his first moves was to pick up the rights to ''Evita.''
 
Oliver Stone Tried For Argentina
 At about the same time, Oliver Stone, hot off the success of ''Platoon,'' asked his agent to check with the Robert Stigwood Organization about ''Evita.'' Mr. Stone was a fan of the musical and wanted to know why it had never been made as a film. The response from the Stigwood group was positive - Mr. Rice was ''red hot keen'' on him - and before long the two sides were in negotiation.
What Mr. Stone brought to the project that earlier candidates didn't was a vision of how it should be done. He imagined a production that returned to the glamorous style of the Vincente Minnelli and Arthur Freed musicals of the 50's with beautiful sets and a cast of thousands. He believed ''a whole country'' was needed as backdrop for the action when Eva addressed the masses from the palace balcony. It was a fundamental precept for Mr. Stone, who began immediately to work on the screenplay.
What the new production also had going for it was a dramatically changed political climate in Argentina, which could make it possible to film in Eva Peron's homeland. As recently as the late 70's, anyone seen scrawling Eva Peron's name on a wall could be sentenced to death, but after the Falkland Islands debacle, the ruling military junta was ousted as the Peronist Party enjoyed a resurgence.
Mr. Stone set off on an exploratory trip to Argentina, where he visted Eva Peron's birthplace and encountered a Government eager for American film business. In subsequent visits, the newly elected President and head of the restored Peronist Party, Carlos Saul Menem, assured Mr. Stone that Argentina was not a banana republic and guaranteed the production freedom of speech as well as 50,000 extras.
The one remaining problem was who would play the lead. The press fueled speculation that Olivia Newton-John or Madonna was about to be offered the role. Barbra Streisand was so irked by published reports that she was under consideration that she denied for the record any interest. Barely mentioned was Ms. Streep, perhaps because on previous occasions when Mr. Stigwood had inquired about her availability, her agent, the powerful Sam Cohn, had reportedly demanded that his client be packaged with a director and writer from the same agency, International Creative Management. Mr. Cohn was unavailable for comment on this or any other matter related to ''Evita.''
Mr. Stone and Ms. Streep met, and a musical audition was scheduled. Mr. Stigwood recalls her arriving ''very quietly and very secretively'' at his New York office to rehearse with his musical director. After two weeks of work, she recorded a tape with just a piano backing, and the results, according to Mr. Stigwood, were ''just mind-boggling what she had achieved'' in such a short time. ''She has a marvelous voice.'' A copy of the tape was sent to Mr. Stone, Mr. Lloyd Webber and Mr. Rice, who all agreed that they had finally found their Evita. Mr. Lloyd Webber, Mr. Rice and Mr. Stigwood jointly control the rights to make the film.
 
Then Eyes Turned Toward Spain
 With Mr. Stone and Ms. Streep in place, there was now every reason to believe that ''Evita'' would finally be made. A $29 million budget was submitted to W.E.G., and an early 1989 start was targeted. But no sooner was the production rolling again than the wheels started to come off. Food riots erupted in Argentina in the summer, with 13 people killed. Fearful of a work stoppage and concerned about the safety of the cast and crew, Mr. Stigwood and Mr. Weintraub balked at the prospects of shooting there.
To this day, sitting in his Venice Beach, Calif., office, Mr. Stone heats up when he talks about the decision. ''I argued to shoot there, but Weintraub said he had it from his sources in the White House - he was a major financier of the Bush campaign - that there was no way he would shoot in Argentina. I told him he was defaming a country.'' For his part, Mr. Stigwood is willing to take the blame and says that the decision to pull the plug on the Argentina shoot was the result of State Department intelligence he had obtained, not Mr. Weintraub.
In any case, the Argentine shoot was canceled and after unsuccessful reconnaissance missions in Brazil and Chile, focus was shifted to Spain, where the estimated budget ballooned to $35 million. But by this time there was trouble at home as well. Without a box-office hit, W.E.G. was experiencing a severe financial drain and was virtually without production money. This led to what is euphemistically known in Hollywood as ''creative differences,'' and W.E.G. decided to abandon the project.
According to the W.E.G. president Kenneth Kleinberg, when the company took over the project in 1987, it imagined a budget in the $16 million range. W.E.G. saw the production as a concept picture not necessarily done on such a large scale. ''It's an opera; we're not talking about 'Batman,' '' argues Mr. Kleinberg.
 
When Money Became a Factor
 While W.E.G. apparently remained very high on Mr. Stone's script, ''The magnitude of the project was too large and consequently too expensive'' to continue, explains Mr. Kleinberg. ''If you decide all you want to spend is the money to buy a Pontiac and you look at a Mercedes, you might like it, but feel that you can't afford it.''
Mr. Kleinberg insists that the company's declining financial position had nothing to do with its decision to abandon the project and categorized it as purely a business decision. ''We didn't feel that, in the package presented to us, the rewards outweighed the risks.''
Other parties involved, however, see W.E.G.'s collapsing bank account as precisely the reason the filmJU wasn't made at that time. ''It didn't really matter if it was $26 million or $32 million because they [W.E.G.] had run out of production funds,'' says Mr. Stigwood. Mr. Stone was even more blunt. ''If Weintraub had the money, Meryl and I would be in Spain shooting right now.''
But they didn't, and with time running out at the end of August, W.E.G. informed Mr. Stigwood that the company was electing not to proceed with the production. That could have been the end of the road for ''Evita'' had not Carolco Pictures, the home of ''Rambo'' and the company where Mr. Stone had a production deal of his own, come to the rescue. Carolco picked up where W.E.G. left off and over the next three weeks tried to hammer out deals with the principal people. Ms. Streep, through Mr. Cohn, was asking for a pay-or-play deal, a common clause for a star of her stature whereby she would be paid for her commitment of time whether the film was shot or not.
According to parties privy to the negotiations, things came to a boil in mid-September when Ms. Streep kept escalating her salary demands. A 48-hour deadline was set by Mr. Cohn and was apparently met when all hands agreed to take a cut in their share, which would then go to Ms. Streep. Everything appeared to be back on track again when, in Mr. Stigwood's words, ''out of the blue,'' Mr. Cohn sent a terse, two-line fax to Carolco and to R.S.O. advising them that Ms. Streep was pulling out of the project for ''personal reasons'' because of exhaustion. Mr. Stigwood was reportedly furious and in retaliation sent out a press release to announce her departure.
 
Meryl Streep Did The Tango and Left
 Ms. Streep was in the midst of completing back-to-back productions, ''She-Devil'' and ''Postcards From the Edge.'' She had begun to work with the ''Evita'' choreographer Paula Abdul on the tango and was taking singing lessons to strengthen her voice and was scheduled to start rehearsals shortly.
At least one person with knowledge of the production wondered if her exhaustion may have stemmed as much from a weariness with negotiations and the prolonged preproduction period and concern over financing as any physical ailments. Another party suggested that Ms. Streep had wanted to get out earlier but when her demands were met, she was left no choice but to withdraw.
Whatever her reasons for leaving, 10 days later, according to Mr. Stigwood, Ms. Streep reconsidered and decided she wanted to make the movie after all. But when Mr. Stigwood called Mr. Stone to inform him that ''Meryl was back on track,'' the director told him that he was not. In the week that the film was down, Mr. Stone had already let the key production people go and had refocused his energies on a film about the rock group, the Doors, which he had been writing for the last several months.
For Mr. Stone, the roller-coaster ride of trying to make ''Evita'' had just gone on too long. Crucial relationships in making a movie may have been strained beyond repair. He also feared a production budget that could easily run up to $50 million. ''If it had all been there, it would have been fun and fantastic,'' says Mr. Stone, with equal traces of disappointment and relief. ''What started as a whim turned into a reality'' for Mr. Stone, and he says he was exhausted by the process.
But true to its history, ''Evita'' is still not dead. Mr. Stigwood is hoping to resurrect the project with Ms. Streep and a new director, using Mr. Stone's script, and is awaiting an answer from the actress. Despite the countless disappointments, Mr. Stigwood refuses to be discouraged and says that the production could be under way by early summer in Seville and in theaters by Christmas of 1990.
''Of course, to be in the wonderful world of entertainment you have to be optimistic. Some wonderful things have taken 10 years to make,'' Mr. Stigwood says. And, for better or worse, each of them has been the work of a producer who just wouldn't let it go.

HEADLINE: POP VIEW;
Cabaret Polishes Its Image As a Solo Act With Attitude

BYLINE: By Stephen Holden

 BODY:
For most Americans, the term ''cabaret,'' if it suggests anything at all, probably conjures up movie images of a hyperkinetic Liza Minnelli and an epicene Joel Grey in a squalid Berlin dive on the eve of the Nazi era. In the film ''Cabaret,'' the Minnelli character's invocation of ''divine decadence'' helped stamp the very word ''cabaret'' with intimations of depravity that it unfortunately still carries.
A contemporary and equally negative image of cabaret is presented in the recent movie ''The Fabulous Baker Boys.'' During an audition sequence, aspiring nightclub singers are presented as a bunch of self-dramatizing, no-talent caricatures. The song chosen to illustrate the common denominator of musical taste among nightclub patrons is ''Feelings.'' And although the supposedly wonderful singer portrayed by Michelle Pfeiffer isn't embarrassing, her blandly sultry voice communicates no special feeling or point of view about what she's singing. 
Cabaret's negative image was one of many issues addressed last month by a shifting panel of nightclub owners, journalists and performers who convened at Town Hall for three days as part of the First Cabaret Convention. Organized by the Mabel Mercer Foundation, the weeklong series of events also presented several gala performances at which more than two dozen performers, ranging in age from their late 20's to well into their 70's, each sang two or three songs. Not all were first-rate, yet the level of talent and taste was on the whole impressive.
Besides image, some of the other problems addressed during the panel discussions were the reluctance of television talent coordinators to book performers perceived as cabaret-oriented, the tightrope economics of operating nightclubs and the difficulty of attracting the theater audience into clubs. Although no miraculous solutions were offered, the convergence of so many interested parties - the panel discussions drew audiences of around 200, and the galas, bargain-priced at $5 a ticket, were nearly sold out - helped bolster a sense of solidarity within the cabaret community.
If the convention's concept of cabaret had encompassed rock and comedy clubs, there would have been no crisis to discuss. In its narrow definition, however, the term refers not just to a physical setting but to a particular kind of entertainment and sensibility. The quintessential cabaret act is a solo performance of about an hour in which a singer, with an accompanist or backup group, turns a carefully selected program of popular songs into an intimate, often idiosyncratic expression of personal taste and attitude.
The golden age of cabaret in America is remembered as the 1940's and 50's, when singers like Mabel Mercer and Billie Holiday performed regularly in jazz clubs on West 52d Street, the Copacabana played host to Frank Sinatra and New York's grander hotels had plush, sophisticated show rooms. Though those days may be long gone, casualties of television, rock and the rise of glitzy entertainment capitals like Las Vegas and Atlantic City, the cabaret tradition continues in its quiet way in places like the Ballroom, Jan Wallman's, the Cafe Carlyle and the Oak Room in the Algonquin Hotel.
Cabaret matters for the same reasons the classical art song does. It is the only forum in which popular singers who possess vision but don't write their own material can express themselves on such an intimate and personal level. More than that, it is the most significant way in which the prerock tradition of American popular song is kept alive.
The last 10 years have seen a growing realization by music historiansand cultural institutions of just how singular and valuable that tradition is. ''The great craftsmen,'' as the late Alec Wilder called songwriters like Jerome Kern, Cole Porter, Rodgers & Hart, Johnny Mercer, Irving Berlin and Harold Arlen, bequeathed a literature that begins to look like a peculiarly American form of classical music.
Refined in its craft yet remarkably adaptable in performance, this literature occupies a special historical place. Conforming neither to the European classical tradition of written music intended for strict interpretation nor to the oral tradition of American jazz and rock, it stands as a bridge between opposite musical worlds. The often silly, dated shows in which the pop standards were introduced may never be mounted again, but the best songs have a life of their own.
Like any other music, this literature can continue to live only through performance. Though its preservation has already been guaranteed by a large body of recordings whose cornerstones are the Ella Fitzgerald songbook albums and most of Frank Sinatra's work, its future vitality depends on live performance. This large pool of literature represents about three-quarters of today's cabaret repertory. One has only to go see a performer like Andrea Marcovicci, now at the Algonquin, sing Irving Berlin's ''Always'' to discover how a cabaret artist can take a piece we think we all know and re-examine it from a fresh, very contemporary perspective.
Nowadays it is fashionable to disparage the predominance of romantic love and its complications in the lyrics of American pop standards. Yet as several generations of singers have shown, the love lyric is an endlessly adaptable platform for expressing states of feeling and philosophical points of view that go far beyond the question of two people ending up in each other's arms. As the generation of gospel-trained pop-soul singers demonstrated in the 60's, the lines between the secular and sacred in popular song are really very thin. Gospel inflections turn love songs into hymns. In the hands of a thoughtful, expressive cabaret performer, a ballad of unrequited love can become a pained, moment-by-moment reflection on spiritual faith and the meaning of life.
It would be foolish to anticipate a mass audience for a form as rarefied in its way as classical art song. But that's the level of artistry that cabaret, at its best, aspires to. More than just keepers of the flame of a classic literature, today's serious cabaret performers are vernacular art singers without an academy to certify their significance.

Japan's New Screen Image: Economic Toughie

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA; Susan Chira was a New York Times correspondent in Japan for nearly five years.

 BODY:
There is one moment in ''Black Rain'' when it is clear that the old film images of Japan are giving way to new ones.
Two detectives, American and Japanese, are trading insults at a bar. ''Music and movies are all America is good for,'' says the Japanese detective, played by Ken Takakura. ''We won the peace.''
The Japan of ''Black Rain'' has muscle. It is rich, powerful and arrogant, as befits a country that now challenges its former conqueror. 
This Japan is not the defeated land of ''Sayonara,'' the 1957 film starring Marlon Brando as an American soldier in occupied Japan who has an ill-fated affair with a geisha. Nor is it the rebuilt Japan that clings to noble traditions pictured in ''The Yakuza,'' the 1975 film that also teamed an American policeman with Mr. Takakura, this time playing a former gangster.
There is a new edge running through the portrayal of Japan in ''Black Rain,'' an edge born of economic rivalry. The film, which opened in the early autumn, has garnered mixed reviews, but is a hit in both Japan and the United States. The success of ''Black Rain'' insures that this new image of Japan is reaching mainstream audiences who have had little other exposure to Japan. And more films focusing on the American-Japanese relationship may be on the way. Alan Poul, the associate producer of ''Black Rain,'' who is fluent in Japanese and has worked extensively in Japanese film productions, said he knows of three separate film projects circulating about the life of American baseball players on Japanese teams.
''Black Rain'' pits Michael Douglas as an iconoclastic, dedicated but morally tarnished cop against the rule-bound but upright Mr. Takakura in a rivalry that mimics the one between their two countries. This undercurrent of economic tension, film critics and historians say, is replacing older film images of Japan, just as trade tensions between Japan and the United States dominate most discussions of relations between the two nations.
''I do think we are seeing a changing image,'' said Keiko McDonald, an associate professor of Japanese literature and cinema at the University of Pittsburgh. ''Japan as an economic power is very much to the fore.'' Professor McDonald had a cameo role in one of the earliest films to focus on Japan's economic role, the 1986 ''Gung Ho,'' the saga of an ailing American automobile plant whose workers ask the Japanese to manage the factory.
''Gung Ho'' recounted the tensions between the Japanese managers, shown as joyless, overworked perfectionists, and the more easy-going American workers. In ''Gung Ho,'' the Japanese are setting the standard of excellence, and it is the Americans who must work at near-superhuman levels just to keep up. Along the way, some of the Japanese managers learn to relax a little and have more fun, while the Americans gain a new pride in their work.
Yet this new image of Japan, in the eyes of many scholars and film critics, is little better than the old stereotypes. ''There was the geisha and the samuarai, the houseboy and the gardener, the bucktoothed, slanty-eyed kamikaze pilot,'' said Peter Grilli, an authority on Japanese films who has also examined the way American movies portray Japan. ''Now it's the Japanese as slick businessmen. There is no subtle depth to the image. A lot of stereotypes go from the economic pages to the screen.''
Todd Gitlin, professor of sociology at the University of California at Berkeley and a chronicler of American popular culture, pointed to the popular video creation ''Max Headroom.'' Several years ago, in the original episode, a reporter is trying to unearth the evil forces behind a television commercial that causes some viewers to explode. The bad guys turn out to be a Japanese company, Zik-Zak. By contrast, he said, the malevolent force in the 1976 film ''Network'' turned out to be Saudi Arabia.
''It's not uncommon to see the Japanese as a single cartel,'' he said. ''It's like the recent Newsweek headline 'Sony Invades Hollywood.' It's sort of a horror movie that's playing in America.''
On the surface, of course, ''Black Rain'' is not about economic rivalry at all. Michael Douglas plays an American cop who captures a Japanese gangster in New York, escorts him back to Japan and then hands him over at the airport to Japanese gangsters posing as police.) Under investigation for skimming profits off a drug deal back home, suspected by his superiors of taking a payoff for letting the Japanese gangster go, Mr. Douglas knows he cannot go back without recapturing his gangster. But his quest is frustrated by the Japanese police, who do not want him interfering with their by-the-book investigation. Mr. Takakura is assigned to be his liaison, and the film charts how Mr. Douglas enlists him in the search for his man through the shadowy world of Japan's yakuza, or gangsters.
In ''Black Rain,'' with flashes of realism, come more ominous images. The film is shot in Osaka, long a center of business and the underworld. Ridley Scott, the director who also emphasized stark urban settings in ''Blade Runner,'' shows Osaka mostly in darkness or shadow, suffusing the film with a sense of menace and mystery. And while the action focuses on staking out, chasing and shooting gangsters, the film's not-so-subliminal message is the superiority of the American way.
Michael Douglas is the embodiment of the American cowboy - loner, rule breaker - while Ken Takakura expounds the value of belonging to a group and obeying its codes. The investigation proceeds only after Mr. Douglas has convinced his Japanese counterpart to break the rules and go after the gangsters on their own. Although Mr. Takakura suffers for his rebellion and is briefly exiled from his group, he finally joins Mr. Douglas on his mission, and together they rope in their man.
''The movie says that Americans have to teach Japanese who cannot act effectively because they are bound by rigid rules,'' said Kyoko Hirano, director of the Japan Society's Japan Film Center. ''Takakura's character becomes sympathetic when he moves closer to the American model.''
That is a very different lesson than the one imparted in ''The Yakuza,'' written and filmed before economic conflict between Japan and the United States grew so heated.
''Black Rain'' is set in Osaka, famous even in Japan for its pursuit of money, but most of the action in ''The Yakuza'' takes place in Kyoto, a seat of Japanese tradition. This setting informs the film, which is a reverent, admiring portrait of Japanese values. In ''The Yakuza,'' directed by Sydney Pollack, Robert Mitchum plays an American detective who returns to Japan for the first time since his posting there as an American soldier during the United States Army's occupation.
Trying to help an old friend whose daughter is kidnapped by the yakuza, he is forced to enlist the help of Ken Takakura, as a former gangster and the brother of Mr. Mitchum's former mistress. Mr. Takakura hates his sister for having consorted with his former enemy and grudgingly agrees to help Mr. Mitchum because he had saved his sister's life. But rather than Mr. Mitchum teaching Mr. Takakura about the American way, it is Mr. Takakura who introduces him to the Japanese ideals of duty, honor and obligation. In the end, realizing that he has ruined Mr. Takakura's life, Mr. Mitchum chops off his finger, a yakuza tradition to amend for misdeeds. In doing so, he wins the friendship and respect of his former foe.
''The American in 'Black Rain' remains an outsider,'' said Professor McDonald. ''He comes out with only a little bit of knowledge about Japan. But in Sydney Pollack's film, the protagonist played by Mr. Mitchum returns to the United States with a much broader understanding of Japan. In 'The Yakuza,' the pattern moves from disparity to understanding to harmony.''
The clash of values is hardly a theme new to ''Black Rain,'' but now that contest is painted in explicitly economic terms. The gangster that Michael Douglas is chasing belongs to a counterfeiting ring, plotting to distribute counterfeit American money - and thus, by implication, to ruin the American economy. Several economists, policy makers and historians, notably the late Theodore White, have argued that Japanese are out for revenge, winning economically the war they lost politically. That, the head of the yakuza organization tells Michael Douglas, is what he is after.
''I was 10 when the B-29's came,'' he tells him. ''You made the rain black. You shoved your values down our throat. We forgot who we were. I am paying you back.''
Exchanges like these have fueled accusations by some scholars and film critics that the film is racist, or at the least grossly insensitive. Black rain is the way Japanese refer to the radioactive fallout that darkened the sky at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
''I was extremely offended by the title,'' said John Dower, a professor of history and Japanese studies at the University of California at San Diego, who has written a widely acclaimed book on American anti-Japanese wartime propaganda. ''It's like taking Auschwitz and making it a code name for some gangster movie. Then using it gratuitiously in a speech about we're going to ruin your economy by taking revenge for your black rain - it somehow turns a tragedy into one more Hollywood gimmick.''
The film's producers and actors say ''Black Rain'' is not racist, and point to its huge popularity in Japan. On a recent trip to Japan to promote the film, Mr. Douglas found that the Japanese thought that Mr. Takakura, not he, was the hero. They see Mr. Takakura redeeming Mr. Douglas, teaching him a lesson in honesty by telling him that a cop who slips even a little betrays his profession. Japanese audiences burst into applause when the gangster talks about paying back Americans for forcing their values onto Japan. He and Mr. Poul said ''Black Rain'' reflects real conflicts between the two countries that are better aired than hidden.
Mr. Poul, the associate producer of ''Black Rain,'' said he does not believe the film chooses sides. ''I feel that Michael Douglas as a loner hero is a venerable movie icon and doesn't necessarily represent any proselytizing by the film makers,'' he said.
Ms. Hirano of the Japan Society also sees the film as essentially benign. It is true that ''Black Rain'' focuses on evil gangsters who chop off their fingers and gun each other down, she said, but movies about the American Mafia also show a closed and menacing crime underworld.
While the movie does champion American individualism over Japanese groupism, the film ends with its two detectives fast friends and the bad guys who set out to wreck the American economy defeated.
Whatever the verdict on ''Black Rain,'' it clearly marks another turn in the portrayal of a land that has long captured the American imagination. As the American hostess in an Osaka bar who helps Michael Douglas tells him when he thanks her for coming over to his side, ''A love-hate relationship can last a long time.''

HEADLINE: The Treasury's 'Mr. Diffident'

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Some Treasury Secretaries over the years have dominated their Administration's economic policies with their political skills and their strong personalities. James A. Baker 3d, the Secretary in Ronald Reagan's second term, and John B. Connally, who served two years under Richard M. Nixon, are cases in point. They were glib and outspoken, politically ambitious, familiar faces on television and crafty manipulators of the press - men who caused heads to turn when they entered crowded rooms.
Other Secretaries have tended to fade into the woodwork. Like David M. Kennedy, Mr. Nixon's first Secretary, they seemed ill at ease on their feet and uncomfortable in the limelight. Often at home in boardrooms, they never grasped the peculiar ways of Washington. And whatever influence they had on policy has long been forgotten. 
By temperament, Nicholas F. Brady fits into the second category of Treasury Secretary. He is bland on television and awkward as a public speaker. In a city of bombast and pomposity, Mr. Brady is unusually gentle and modest, a man who can and often does enter a restaurant or a large party unrecognized. At international meetings, he has taken pains not to stand out from the ministers of other countries. At home, he has been overshadowed day after day in his first year in office by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and Richard G. Darman, the budget director. With large egos, sharp minds and aggressive personalities, these politically sophisticated men have taken strong roles in the execution of economic policies.
''In all my years in Washington,'' said an admirer who has served here in several different capacities in the Government over the last 35 years, ''I don't recall a Treasury Secretary as diffident as Brady.''
But when the history of the Bush Administration is written, Mr. Brady will probably be recorded as a central figure. Although he had a rocky start, Mr. Brady seems to have learned from his mistakes, and has seen his reputation here grow the longer he has been in office.
Despite, or maybe because of, his preference for staying in the background, he has an asset none of his modern predecessors had.
Nicholas Brady is a close friend of the President, perhaps George Bush's closest friend. That alone gives him enormous authority.
''When he wants to, Brady picks up the phone and gets to talk to the President like that,'' said John E. Robson, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, snapping his fingers. ''Or he walks right over to see him. When you think of the DEW line created around the President, any President, that's unique.''
Senator Jim Sasser, a Tennessee Democrat who is chairman of the Budget Committee and who met with Mr. Brady for countless hours this year in budget negotiations, said that when the Secretary is in a room, the tone of the discussion changes. ''Just by being someplace, Brady brings Bush's lever into play,'' Mr. Sasser said. ''You get the sense that you are hearing directly from the President and that what is being said will be repeated to the President over cocktails or on the tennis court.''
Mr. Brady refuses to discuss his friendship with Mr. Bush and what influence it gives him within the Administration. ''I don't really care to talk about that,'' he said in an interview in his office. ''I don't think of it in those terms. I think of it in trying to get to the President substantive and correct positions on issues that he ought to have advice on. Whether that is easier or harder to do because we've been friends, I never think about.'' Period. Next question, please.
Mr. Brady's senior assistants say he never discusses the relationship with them either. They recount small incidents they have witnessed: a telephone call early one morning from the Secretary on his car phone to the residential quarters at the White House; his getting the President to host a reception at the White House for leading American and foreign bankers during the meetings this fall of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank; his spur-of-the-moment decision one night to walk over to the White House to brief Mr. Bush at an important point in the negotiations with Congress over cutting the capital gains tax.
But when they are asked how the friendship has manifested itself in Government policy, the aides draw a blank. They say they suspect it may have been a factor in the President's decision in May to name Japan, India and Brazil as unfair traders, subjecting them to possible sanctions, and the decision in July to extend import quotas on steel for only an additional 30 months, both matters in which Mr. Brady's position prevailed over others in the Administration. But the aides acknowledge that they do not know for sure and that those decisions might have gone the way they did regardless.
 
A Confidant
 ''One of the features of the unique relationship Brady has with the President is that Brady keeps things very quiet, very confidential, and the President knows that,'' said Hollis S. McLoughlin, the Assistant Secretary for Policy Management, who acts more or less as Mr. Brady's chief of staff and spends more time with him than any other assistant.
A White House official said Mr. Brady is important to the President as a confidential adviser as much as a Cabinet officer. ''The President knows,'' the official said, ''that if he tells Brady something or asks his advice on something, it won't go beyond the room.''
Mr. Bush and Mr. Brady met on a tennis court in 1975, introduced by Mr. Bush's brother Jonathan, and they became fast friends almost at once. Mr. Brady, who is now 59, is six years younger than Mr. Bush, but their backgrounds are remarkably similar - wealthy Eastern families, education at prep school and Yale - and they shared an interest in competitive sports. Mr. Bush had just completed a tour as the United States representative in China. Mr. Brady was chairman of Dillon, Read & Company, the New York investment firm where he had worked all his adult life.
Mr. Brady had never been active politically, but it soon became apparent that his political views were almost identical to those of Mr. Bush. By 1979, he was heading Mr. Bush's campaign in New Jersey for the Republican Presidential nomination. Mr. Brady's connection with Mr. Bush was also instrumental in his temporary appointment to the United States Senate in 1982 to fill the last eight months of the term of Harrison A. Williams Jr., a New Jersey Democrat who resigned during the Abscam scandal. And shortly after Mr. Bush was re-elected Vice President in 1984, he announced that Mr. Brady was the only person authorized to speak about his plans to run for the Presidency in 1988.
In September 1988, when Mr. Baker resigned as Treasury Secretary to run Mr. Bush's general election campaign, Ronald Reagan named Mr. Brady to the Cabinet post. It was understood that if Mr. Bush was elected President, Mr. Brady would remain at the Treasury.
He was in office only days when gossip began circulating here among bureaucrats, lobbyists and economists who follow the Treasury that Mr. Brady was in over his head, the latest of the Wall Street lightweights who could not cut it in Washington.
There was evidence to substantiate that view. His early testimony before Congress was disastrous. Lawmakers who had been on the banking and finance committees for years fired questions at him about elements of Government policy that he could not begin to answer.
 
An Embarrassing Gaffe
 His maiden speech about international debt managed to offend the Japanese. What seemed to Mr. Brady to be a casual comment in a television interview about the value of the dollar - ''Markets go up and down. I really don't worry about it very much'' - was misinterpreted by traders as a lack of concern. It caused the dollar to fall further.
A few days after the inauguration, he created a political firestorm by saying that the Administration was considering a fee on bank deposits to raise money to rescue the savings and loan industry. And news that he has a reading disability, perhaps dyslexia, and prefers that material be presented orally, caused snickers in some circles.
Mr. Brady was pushed further into the background as Mr. Darman dominated the budget negotiations with Congress, and Mr. Sununu took more interest in economic matters than any other recent chief of staff. ''You're just not very conscious of his presence,'' said Robert Solomon, an economist at the Brookings Institution. ''It's hard to characterize the absence of a presence.''
Abroad, Mr. Brady has been compared unfavorably with the dynamic Mr. Baker. ''I've seen Baker and I've seen Brady, and the difference in presentational skills is enormous,'' said a leading central banker from an allied country. ''Baker has the capacity to dazzle you. Brady doesn't. It's unfair, but you can't help but compare them.''
For many months, in fact, Mr. Brady could not emerge from the shadow of Mr. Baker, who is now Secretary of State. M. Peter McPherson, executive vice president of the Bank of America, who became Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under Mr. Baker in August 1987 and stayed on under Mr. Brady until last April, had an insight into the situation.
 
Beloved Baker
 ''Washington,'' he observed, ''likes people who are articulate and look at the big picture and have all the answers. Washington likes the Jim Bakers of the world. Brady doesn't fit in that way as a superb Washington operative. Washington doesn't have a very long focus. Brady talks about the long-term perspective, but he's often talking to an audience without appreciation of long-term views.''
Gradually, however, opinions here of Mr. Brady have changed. His success in moving the savings and loan legislation through Congress and his advocacy of a new plan for dealing with third world debt are widely praised, even by those who disagree with elements of one or the other. And he has used the skills he honed over years of serving clients on Wall Street to gain many friends and admirers in Congress.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat from Brooklyn who sits on the banking and budget committees, expressed the prevailing view: ''Is he the smartest guy in the world? No. Did he make some major screwups? Yes. But Brady is one of the few people in the Government trying to do real substance. On savings and loan, he stepped up to the plate and swung at balls. The same with the third world debt. I'm not sure I agree with his plan, but at least he tried to do something. So, in an Administration where so much seems aimed at image and hype, Brady does deserve a lot of credit.''
Perhaps most important to the Administration, key Democratic lawmakers, who are increasingly antipathetic toward Mr. Darman, have learned to like and trust Mr. Brady. ''Nick's candid,'' said Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee. ''What he says, that's it. He's not like some of these fellows, where they say, 'Good morning,' and you say, 'What do you mean by that?' ''
Asked if he was referring to Mr. Darman, Mr. Bentsen replied, ''You said that. I didn't.'' Mr. Darman declined to be interviewed for this article.
Mr. Bentsen was furious at the announcement late last month that Mr. Brady was advancing Government borrowing, at a cost of about $20 million, to give the Administration one more week to fight the battle over capital gains. The Senator said he chose to believe that Mr. Darman and Mr. Sununu had made the decision and forced it on Mr. Brady. Treasury officials say the decision was Mr. Brady's alone, but they are happy to let Mr. Bentsen think what he does.
 
Wall Street's View
 On Wall Street, Mr. Brady is criticized for not having lowered the budget deficit. And commercial bankers believe his plan encouraging banks to write off part of the debt of developing countries and make new loans to them at the same time is unrealistic.
But the overall view of him on the Street now seems to be positive. ''He's not going to be the most exciting guy in the world,'' said John H. Gutfreund, chairman of Salomon Brothers Inc. ''But he has good judgment. And he knows he doesn't know all the answers, and that's important.''
Mr. Brady said he learned from his early mistakes to be careful about what he said in public and to pay more attention to details. ''It takes a certain amount of time unless you've been in Government to learn all the details,'' he said, ''and it surprised me that you would be judged so much on your ability to spit out details.''
As an investment banker, he said, ''the essence of trying to make progress is to separate the details from the important things and act on the important things.'' He said he has learned in Washington, however, that ''each detail means something to somebody, and in trying to drive toward a conclusion in Government work, you have to be more responsive to what somebody else thinks is one of the three or four main factors even though in your own mind, it isn't.''
As for his difficulty in absorbing material by reading, Mr. Brady said, ''God gave us a number of senses. Maybe it has made me listen more carefully.''
Mr. Brady said he began the year determined ''to clear away the underbrush,'' problems that were inherited from the Reagan Administration. But, he continued, ''some of the underbrush turned out to be sequoias.'' He has had little time, he continued, to concentrate on anything other than three of those big problems: the collapsing savings and loan industry, the third world debt and, ''overarching everything,'' the budget deficit.
 
Raising Taxes
 A good start was made on the first two, he said, and despite setbacks this year, he is ''optimistic'' that the Administration and Congress will come to grips with the deficit next year. Without saying so directly, Mr. Brady seems to be more flexible than the President and others in the Administration on the question of new taxes. He suggested that if Administration officials and Congress could agree first on exactly how to spend the additional money that would be raised, they could then agree on a package of tax increases and spending cuts that would be acceptable to all parties.
If he can, Mr. Brady said, he would like to turn his attention next year to the herculean task of encouraging American industry to avoid the quick buck and take a longer-range view. He believes that ultimately the standard of living of all Americans is at stake. His aides have suggested that proposals in this area might be incorporated into President Bush's State of the Union message in January. But Mr. Brady said he realized that the proposals would have to be modest as long as the Government was running a large budget deficit.
For example, he said, tax changes that would make equity financing more attractive or expand individual retirement accounts to encourage people to save would create too great a loss in revenues to be practical next year. But he said he would continue to press Congress to lower the capital gains rate and might suggest some modest measures that would give managers incentives to focus on long-range performance.
In any event, he said, he does not intend to change his style and plans to continue as a confidant to the President as long as Mr. Bush wants him. If he is eclipsed in the public eye by Mr. Darman and Mr. Sununu, he said, so be it.
''I don't think for a minute about being out front,'' Mr. Brady said. ''If you have two people as bright as Dick Darman and John Sununu, why wouldn't you solicit their views? I don't care who gets credit. Those are two extraordinarily bright people, and where they've got insights in the economic scene, they ought to be sought out, and if those insights are correct, they ought to be pursued.''
Edwin L. Dale Jr., an assistant to Mr. Darman who has been following every Treasury Secretary since the Eisenhower Administration as a newspaper reporter or a Government official, said he has never known one so unconcerned about his public image. ''What's so impressive about Brady,'' Mr. Dale said, ''is that he's a man clearly at peace with himself and not likely to get upset by the to and fro of Washington.''
 
ALL THE RIGHT CREDENTIALS
Nicholas Frederick Brady's background is typical of an Eastern-establishment Republican. He has a family pedigree, an Ivy League education, a career on Wall Street and smooth strokes on the tennis court and golf course. He grew up on a large estate in Far Hills, N.J., and still has a home there as well as places in Washington, in the Bahamas, in New York and on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. He owns horses and has been chairman of the Jockey Club, the registry for Thoroughbred horses. He has been a director of the NCR Corporation, the Mitre Corporation and the H.J. Heinz Company, among others.
Mr. Brady's great-grandfather, Anthony, was an Irish immigrant who made a fortune as a business partner of Thomas Edison. His grandfather founded the Maxwell Motor Company, which was bought by the Chrysler Corporation. His father counted Rockefellers, du Ponts and Mellons among his investment partners, and also ran the Purolator Courier Corporation. Mr. Brady, who was born April 11, 1930, graduated from Yale in 1952 and from the Harvard Business School in 1954. At Yale, he was captain of the squash team and admits to spending more time on sports than schoolwork.
He joined Dillon, Read & Company, the investment banking firm, right out of graduate school and rose to become chairman in 1973. He got the Wall Street job initially through family connection, but colleagues say his skill in bringing in new business pushed him to the top. Under his leadership, Dillon, Read fell from the ranks of the most influential underwriters but remained one of the most profitable. He resigned from the firm to become Treasury Secretary.
Mr. Brady and his wife, Katherine, have four grown children.

HEADLINE: Exxon Valdez's Sea of Litigation

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Can a bartender in Anchorage claim damages for tips he might have received from fishermen thrown out of work as a result of the Exxon Valdez spill?
What about California drivers who had to pay sharply higher gasoline prices after the Valdez grounding temporarily closed the port of Valdez and interrupted the flow of North Slope oil to California refineries?
And how about citizens of other states who have no plans to ever visit Alaska, but who, because of the spill, no longer have the knowledge that they could visit an unsullied region. What of the ''bequest value'' such knowledge would bring to future generations?
These are just a few of the legal questions stemming from the grounding of the Valdez in Prince William Sound on March 24 and the disgorgement of 11 million gallons of Alaskan crude oil into its pristine waters. The lawsuits began proliferating within days of the spill as lawyers from across the nation rushed to the scene. 
''One of the mayors up there told me that the only thing worse than the oil hitting the shore was the wave of gray-flanneled lawyers that came next,'' said T. Barry Kingham, a lawyer with the New York firm of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt and Mosie. Mr. Kingham is not involved with the Exxon litigation but is one of many lawyers who expects it to drag on into the next century. And he is in a better position than most to know why. He represents the French fishermen and villagers suing Amoco in the still unsettled litigation in the United States District Court in Chicago that began 11 years ago when the Amoco Cadiz ran aground off the Brittany coast.
The Amoco Cadiz case involved a spill seven times larger than the one in Alaska, but the latter may well involve more extensive environmental damage and more complicated interactions between state and Federal law. Already, it involves far more types of plaintiffs and byzantine negotiations among high-powered law firms from all over the country over how to share both the work and control over litigation strategy. ''You have to ask whether the legal system is set up to cope with something like this,'' Mr. Kingham said.
 
Exxon's Court Press
 So far, nearly 150 lawsuits have been filed in Anchorage against the Exxon Corporation, its subsidiaries and its partners in the Alaska pipeline. The state court cases have been consolidated for pre-trial motions and discovery (the process of gathering evidence and pre-trial testimony) before Judge Brian C. Shortell under the name Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Litigation. The Federal cases have been consolidated for the same purposes before United States District Court Judge H. Russell Holland under the name Seahawk Seafoods Inc. v. the Exxon Corporation.
Related actions have been filed on behalf of oil consumers in California and by Exxon shareholders against the company's directors. Lawyers have also been busy with administrative hearings before groups like the National Transportation Safety Board, grand jury investigations of possible criminal conduct by Exxon and the Valdez officers, and executing thousands of contracts to hire people to help with the cleanup.
Some lawyers involved say that the Exxon Valdez matter is, in many respects, not a particularly difficult challenge. Richard Gerry, a San Diego lawyer who is a co-chairman of the committee of plaintiffs' lawyers trying to coordinate most of the litigation, said: ''We have got one thing - oil. Whose is it? Exxon's. How did it get there? We all know.''
Mr. Gerry and other environmental lawyers compare that situation to the numbingly complex cases stemming from liability for pollution from waste disposal sites, in which a wide variety of pollutants have been deposited over a long period of time from many sources, some unknown.
But even he concedes that it may be years before the extent of damages from the Valdez spill can be determined. And while the oil was Exxon's, much of the damage may be traceable to the dismal failure of early efforts to contain and clean up the spill. That has drawn Exxon's partners in the Alaska pipeline into the case as defendants because Alyeska, the pipeline company, was responsible for preparations to respond to a spill. To complicate matters further, Exxon has filed a counterclaim arguing that the State of Alaska is liable for the damages because it blocked an Exxon plan to break up the slick with chemical dispersants.
In addition, it is not clear where the courts will look to figure out who is responsible and what kind of damages they might be forced to pay. Exxon's liability may be limited to the extent that maritime law governs the case. Legislation like the Alaska Pipeline Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act may also affect which plaintiffs will be allowed to pursue their complaints and what kinds of compensation or relief they can seek. Most plaintiffs are seeking punitive damages under Alaska state law.
''Our environmental law has become so complex that the tax code is child's play by comparison,'' said Thomas J. Schoenbaum, a University of Georgia law professor who is advising the State of Alaska in the Exxon Valdez litigation.
The dramatic nature of the accident, which has become a rallying point for environmentalists, and the wealth of Exxon and its pipeline partners have naturally acted as a lure for many lawyers. The result has been a Machiavellian jockeying for influence and hours devoted to reviewing - and sometimes nitpicking - documents drafted by others.
''So far, it hasn't created a situation of ineffectiveness but it is time-consuming,'' said Elizabeth Cabraser, a partner in the San Francisco firm of Lieff, Cabraser and Heiman, which has filed a class action on behalf of commercial salmon and herring fishermen. ''At some point, the whole thing could bog down.''
 
Feuding Lawyers
 One of the most basic disagreements pits class-action lawyers, many from big East Coast firms with experience in antitrust and securities cases, against tort lawyers who traditionally represent individual clients. The class-action firms have agreed to group the plaintiffs in the 150 damage cases into seven classes: fishermen; fish processors and distributors; union workers laid off by processors after the spill; Alaska natives; area businesses that supply equipment or services to the fishing industry; tour operators; recreational users of the region, and municipalities.
The traditional tort, or direct-action, lawyers say there is no reason to set up classes when all of the individuals affected can be identified.
''There's an element of scramble for clients, but I would hate to put it so crudely,'' said Richard Oesting, an Anchorage lawyer working on the class actions. ''It's a philosophical disagreement over the best way to handle this from the point of view of efficiency and fairness.''
The crunch comes on the issue of punitive damages. If the class-action lawyers have their way, the litigation will produce one giant punitive damages pot from which all plaintiffs would share according to a formula to be negotiated. Direct-action lawyers believe each plaintiff should have a separate shot at convincing a jury that a certain amount in punitive damages should be awarded.
So far, the two groups are cooperating because they can share the initial tasks of setting up schedules for pre-trial discovery and the basic job of establishing the liability of Exxon and its partners. But both are squabbling with environmental groups, led by the National Wildlife Federation and the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund. The environmentalists have filed suits of their own and want a major say in how the litigation proceeds.
The National Wildlife Federation asked in state court that damages be put into a fund to restore the affected area or, where that is not possible, to buy and protect comparable resources. The Federation's lawyers contend that those injured include even citizens who have no plans to ever visit Alaska because simply knowing that an unsullied region is there for future generations has a value, known as the bequest value, that a jury can estimate when presented with economic studies.
The Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, in behalf of nine groups, seeks to have the Federal court order Exxon to present plans for continuing its cleanup next spring and to rule on whether they meet Federal standards.
 
Getting Organized
 The first job facing the plaintiffs attorneys was to propose to the judges how they could be organized into a committee, a common method of managing complex cases with many plaintiffs. Their initial proposal was carefully balanced between the class-action groups and direct-action lawyers with lesser roles for the environmental lawyers, who had filed suits only a short time before the plan was presented at an unusual joint sitting of the state and Federal courts. After weighing comments, including complaints from environmentalists, Judge Holland recently criticized the plan in a blunt memo saying it did not give the environmental lawyers enough influence and was ''top-heavy.''
Some lawyers agreed. ''It's overloaded with positions that have no purpose,'' said Leonard Ring, a well-known Chicago torts lawyer who dropped out after the plan was proposed in August. ''It's going to be a difficult case to prepare because there's too much politics.''
Exxon is keeping its views on such matters and its own litigation strategy close to the vest. The company has a reputation for following a scorched earth policy to discourage claimants from trying to dig into what is one of America's deepest corporate pockets. But unlike Amoco, which refused to pay damages to anyone for the French oil spill, Exxon has been quick to make payments to the groups most directly affected by the spill, like the fishermen.
''We have paid almost 10,000 claimants over $130 million so far but have settled very few cases,'' said C. Kenneth Roberts, general counsel for Exxon USA, the Houston-based Exxon unit whose subsidiary, the Exxon Shipping Company, owned the tanker. Exxon does expect the payments to be offset against damage awards.
 
Bad Press
 Plaintiffs' lawyers say Exxon has been cooperative so far. Thousands of documents have been exchanged in discovery though the court has not yet ordered it to begin. Some believe the litigation will move rapidly if the judges push it because it provides bad publicity for Exxon each day that it lasts.
However, pleadings filed to date indicate that Exxon can be expected to fight fiercely to avoid punitive damages and to avoid liability to plaintiffs who claim indirect injuries, like bartenders in Valdez or Anchorage. Exxon USA has about 15 of its staff of 170 working on the litigation. The oil company and its subsidiaries also have outside counsel from a battery of prestigious firms, led by Bogle and Gates in Seattle and Anchorage and O'Melveny and Meyers in Los Angeles and Covington and Burling in Washington D.C.
One predictable form of legal fallout from the accident has been the suits filed in behalf of Exxon by its shareholders against the company's directors and senior management. They allege that negligence at the top led to the accident and the huge bills Exxon faces, including the $1.3 billion it has already spent on cleanup and millions of dollars in legal expenses. Such suits are common in any kind of corporate mishap and, in this case, have been filed in both Alaska and the United States District Court in New York where Exxon is based.
 
Limited Liability
 ''As a practical matter, the limits of what we can recover will be the insurance policy, which we understand to be about $100 million,'' said Daniel Krasner, a partner in the New York firm of Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz who has represented shareholders in the Alaska cases. Exxon has appointed a committee of its independent directors to investigate management's performance and that committee has retained former Attorney General Griffin Bell, now an Atlanta lawyer.
A more unusual legal twist developed when J. Garrett Kendrick, a sole practitioner in Los Angeles who supports marine conservation groups, began pondering how he could express his anger with Exxon. That led to the filing in a Los Angeles county court of a class-action suit in behalf of California drivers. According to the suit, consumers were forced to pay up to 20 cents a gallon more for gasoline in the weeks following the Valdez grounding because of supply interruptions. ''It amounts to tens of millions of dollars,'' Mr. Kendrick said.
Not surprisingly, the lawyers involved are reluctant to talk about how much the spill will eventually mean to them financially. The plaintiffs lawyers will spend millions of dollars before recovering fees out of any damage awards. Class-action fees typically run between 10 percent to 15 percent of recoveries. Direct-action fees can run as high as 30 percent but, according to Mr. Gerry, are likely to be between 15 and 20 percent in most cases where one lawyer represents many individuals with similar complaints. The negotiations on how to divide the spoils may become heated if, as some lawyers suspect, the pot turns out to be smaller than expected.
''It will be a fun case, a chance to do some good for the public, but I don't think it's going to be very remunerative for plaintiffs' lawyers,'' said Stephen D. Susman, a Houston lawyer who was an early leader among the class-action plaintiffs' lawyers but was forced to drop out because of a conflict.
''Alaska is a funny place - they love the environment but they also love the oil industry and they won't want to punish it too badly,'' Mr. Susman said. ''Spill cases tend to have their maximum value in the early days when there are dead birds on television. There's going to be real questions in this case on how you measure damages.''
That issue alone may drag out the case, and delay the day when lawyers are paid. One solution, according to Mr. Gerry, may be to treat the spill as a running nuisance case in which damages are re-examined and new payments made every few years. ''It would be unfair to both Exxon and plaintiffs to try to settle some things quickly because it would be sheer guesswork,'' said Mr. Gerry.
Whatever the complications, many lawyers believe the Valdez case is unlikely to set any lasting standard for how much it costs the legal system to sort out liabilities after environmental disasters. ''Look at Chernobyl,'' said Professor Schoenbaum, referring to the devastation caused by the 1987 failure of a Soviet nuclear reactor. ''It is hard to imagine the legal impact of something like that if it occurred in the United States. We haven't scratched the surface.''

HEADLINE: Louisiana's New Philosophy

BYLINE: By MARY C. BOUNDS; Mary C. Bounds is a freelance writer in Atlanta.

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La.

 BODY:
Last month, Gov. Buddy Roemer stepped up to the microphone in the towering Art Deco State Capitol to announce that ICI Americas Inc., based in Wilmington, Del., had selected St. Gabriel in southern Louisiana as the site of a new $100 million plant to produce substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons, bypassing locations in Texas, Kentucky, New Jersey and Canada.
Typically, such announcements are made in a jovial, backslapping atmosphere. But St. Gabriel, where a cluster of chemical plants rises from the banks of the Mississippi, is no longer the trusting, idyllic farming community it once was. Although a recent study by Tulane University found otherwise, many residents believe their miscarriage rates are unusually high because of chemical pollution. 
So, at the news conference, Mr. Roemer praised ICI for making a product that could ease the world's ozone problems. But under forceful questioning from reporters, he made it clear that state leaders believe business and concern for the environment go hand in hand.
''They will have to meet our standards,'' Mr. Roemer said. ''If they can't, they can go to Kentucky, Tennessee or God cares where.''
For a state where the environment had been viewed for years as something that could be traded off for economic development, it was a stunning statement.
Louisiana's new-found interest in the environment did not offend ICI, however. ''We know the rules of the game,'' said Tony Mash, an ICI manager. ''If Governor Roemer has to tighten the law in some ways we respect that and will follow those guidelines.'' At a time of rising environmental awareness nationwide, environmental and economic issues intersect with particular force in Louisiana, for years viewed as one of the most environmentally degraded states. For instance, the Environmental Protection Agency said 776 million pounds of toxic chemicals were dumped into the state's waters in 1987, the second-highest total in the nation.
Cleaning up Louisiana would be difficult in the best of economic times, but with unemployment rates that have led the nation for much of the last three years - ranging from 7.6 to 13.7 percent - it requires a lot of nerve and even more diplomacy.
Louisiana is realizing how much its economic health is tied to cleaning up its environment. The result is a regulatory tightrope aimed at cleaning up existing messes and avoiding new ones without driving away old businesses or scaring away new ones.
It is too early to assess the long-term effects on the industrial base, nearly half of which is petrochemicals. But it has created some tension and, according to the Governor, has caused ''one or two'' companies to choose sites elsewhere ''because we would not arbitrarily and capriciously change the rules for them.'' But no major companies have left and some are even joining the cleanup effort.
The link between environment and economy was clear in the case of the Huntsman Chemical Corporation. A year ago it seemed certain that the company would buy and modernize a plant here. But after being impressed by the water and rail routes, raw-material supply and infrastructure, Huntsman found something less impressive: the soil under the site was contaminated by hydrocarbons.
When Huntsman changed its plans, the state lost 50 to 100 jobs. But it got a vote of confidence from Henry Sullivan, Huntsman's vice chairman. ''The state's attitude toward the whole thing was exemplary,'' he said. ''We didn't want them to have the feeling that if they cut corners we would stay. Cutting corners environmentally is stupid. Your employees aren't proud of you and it costs money in the long run.''
Louisiana's billion-dollar fishing industry has been badly wounded in the months since state officials issued warnings to consumers on the cancer-causing chemicals in the Calcasieu River basin's speckled and white trout. And white-collar jobs most often have gone the way of cleaner environments, where executives prefer to live and raise children.
''We now know that for jobs we must maintain our environment,'' said Paul Templet, head of the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality.
For years, the former professor of environmental management at Louisiana State University was a lonely gadfly, haranguing state politicians with his message that pollution was stagnating the economy. That he now runs an agency whose budget has more than doubled in less than two years, to $62 million, is a sign of the degree to which the state has come to see its environmental crisis as an economic one as well.
One complication in that relationship is the economy's reliance on the chemical industry. With 27,000 employees, it is the largest employer in the state's manufacturing sector.
No one understands this better than Governor Roemer, whose campaign two years ago was built around the ''Four E's,'' environment, economic development, ethics and education.
''We're not trying to slam-dunk them,'' he said of industry in general. ''I consider them good neighbors. I'm still pushing like everything for jobs, and if a petrochemical company wants to come in, I encourage them to come. But we're not making the highest bid for polluters.''
State legislators and voters have followed his lead in making the environment a priority. In the spring, legislators ordered the state to halve toxic air emissions by 1994, phase out oil and gas production pits in the wetlands and start a solid-waste reduction and recycling program. In September they adopted new regulations on the disposal of 25 toxic chemicals into state waters. The law, now the subject of a lawsuit by the chemical industry, is said to be one of the nation's strictest. Last month, voters passed a constitutional amendment establishing a multimillion-dollar trust fund to preserve wetlands.
Chemical industry officials acknowledge that they, too, have had to change. ''In the past, we simply assumed that if we made a product, employed people and paid our taxes everything would be O.K.,'' said Richard Kleiner, a spokesman for the Louisiana Chemical Association.
''But as environmental problems and concerns about public questions came to the forefront, we got behind the curve in communicating to people,'' Mr. Kleiner said. ''Some had the attitude that even if we explained what we were doing, people wouldn't understand. But common sense is pretty darn common. We have no problems with the regulations as long as they are scientifically justified, achievable and applicable to everyone so that no one gets favored.''
Since the early 1970's, he said, the industry has reduced by 90 percent the amount of pollutants released into state waters.
There are other promising signs. The state unemployment rate fell to 7.6 percent in September. And $4 billion in industrial expansion is under way statewide, much of it in the chemical industry, which is experiencing a boom nationwide.
But everyone involved knows that massive problems remain. Even Mr. Roemer is cautious in his optimism. ''I don't want to be guilty of being a Pollyanna,'' he said. ''Right now we're living better than we were a year ago. I feel good about our position, but I don't want to tell you that we've scored a touchdown yet.''

HEADLINE: BUSINESS FORUM: THE VOLATILE DOLLAR;
Conduct a Test of a Gold Standard

BYLINE: By DAVID BOSTIAN JR. David Bostian Jr. is chief economist and managing director of Jesup & Lamont Inc.and president of Bostian Research Associates Inc.

 BODY:
In 1971, following President Nixon's repudiation of the agreement at Bretton Woods to redeem dollars in gold bullion, I was one of the first economists on Wall Street to warn that Nixon's ''New Economics'' policy would lead to serious economic and financial problems in the 1970's.
Ten years later, my testimony in Washington before the Gold Commission hearings stated: ''I do advocate a gradual and experimental shift toward a possible full gold standard through the issuance of new gold-backed bonds or notes.'' These bonds would offer important market information by which to gauge the plausibility of an eventual return to a complete gold standard.
An experimental issue of $100 billion in Government bonds, to be redeemed in gold coin, as proposed in a gold bond bill, sponsored by Representative William Dannemeyer, Republican of California, and now in committee, would demonstrate the value of a partial return to gold. This experiment would be conducted without exposing the debt heavy United States economy to the unforseeable and possibly negative consequences of a sudden return to a total gold standard. 
Bonds with gold convertibility would provide a savings in interest expenses to the Government (and taxpayers) that would be considerable. It is estimated that the Eagle bonds proposed in the gold bond bill would carry an interest rate of only 1.75 percent. The bonds would be attractive to investors even though they would pay such low rates because the gold backing to the bond would serve as a hedge against inflation and preserve the investor's buying power. If the bonds were well received by the market, a phased-in conversion of all Government bonds to gold-backed bonds - which might take five years - could result in interest expense savings averaging as much as $150 billion a year. This savings would substantially eliminate the Federal budget deficit.
The availability of gold-backed bonds would also foster increased savings by Americans. Gold-backed bonds would promote savings because investors would feel secure knowing that the gold backing their bonds will hold its value with less risk than higher yielding bonds not linked to gold. The resulting lower cost of capital, coming from increased savings, would greatly enhance our competitive position relative to major trading partners like Japan.
It is possible that the availability of gold-backed bonds would lead to more stable currency relationships and to a lower trade deficit. With regard to the former, there is a growing recognition that the volatile swings in the dollar over the past decade have had a destabilizing effect on corporate management and international trade as well as government policy.
The discipline of backing bonds with gold would put a measure of restraint on the seemingly endless growth of debt in the United States because gold, unlike paper dollars, cannot be created at will.
If one believes that gold-backed bonds offer such benefits, why not move to a full gold standard immediately?
Too sudden a return to the discipline of a gold standard could have a disruptive effect on economic growth. In a weakening economy it would make matters worse by bringing inflation to an immediate halt or even promoting deflation. This in turn would make it difficult for struggling businesses and individuals to pay back their outstanding loans in cheaper dollars.
There is also the question of what price of gold is appropriate in affixing the convertibility of currencies. While some advocates of a return to a full gold standard do not worry about this point, or assume the market will correct errors in economic judgment, the wrong gold price could result in either inflationary or deflationary tendencies, depending upon economic conditions.
World gold production is volatile, with major discoveries and disruptions of mining hard to predict. The Soviet Union and South Africa account for a majority of world gold production. Long-term economic growth could be retarded by supply and demand problems in the gold market from time to time.
Since America functions in a global economy, any broad-based move to a gold standard in the United States would require international coordination between the major industrialized countries and the international financial organizations. While an international gold standard might be a worthwhile long-term goal, it would require detailed international cooperation to put it into place.
But despite potential benefits attendant to a controlled experiment with gold, it is vital that we remain aware that neither gold nor monetary economics provide the complete answer to the economic challenges confronting the United States and the world economy.

The Floating Dollar Needs an Anchor

BYLINE: By DAVID RANSON; David Ranson is president of H. C. Wainwright & Company, Economics Inc. in Boston.

 BODY:
The United States has paid a high price for the instability of the dollar. A dollar that floats in value against other world currencies confuses markets, distorts supply and demand, and makes it harder for the economy to operate. Long-range investment decisions are clouded by unnecessary short-range uncertainties. Trade is distorted and taxation cannot be fair and efficient if incomes and wealth are miscomputed by fluctuations in prices, inflation and interest rates.
For these reasons the dollar needs an anchor that would firmly fix its value in relation to a set basket of commodities. The basket might, but does not have to, include gold. Fixing the value of the dollar to these selected commodities would stabilize the dollar's value against other currencies as well. 
In Washington, advocating a dollar anchored to a commodity base has, to date, been preaching to the inconvertible. Policy makers will always pay lip service to the idea of monetary stability, but are unlikely to abandon their fine-tuning activities. Indeed, they justify these efforts on the false premise that without their meddling, the private economy would otherwise be incapable of stability.
Prices today fluctuate unnecessarily because the dollar units in which they are expressed are just that: units of measurement and not stores of value. Prices cannot be stable when they must be expressed in terms of an unstable unit. Nor can interest rates be stable when the future value of the currency is unpredictable.
These truths appeal to common sense rather than to economic doctrine and tend to be more easily grasped by laymen than economists. Of course, like all such truths they are an oversimplication.
Monetary instability creates a chain reaction that reaches further than anyone can calculate. Inflation cannot be defeated if there is no limit to the rate at which the dollar is allowed to depreciate. Nor can interest rates remain low if inflation is expected to be high. Over time, an anchored dollar would reduce inflation and preserve buying power.
Globally, unstable money distorts the prices of inflation hedges, including real estate and precious metals. Foreign countries that derive their incomes from natural resources are condemned to an endless roller coaster. Some years when there is a flight from dollars, commodity prices escalate. Other years, when the dollar is in demand, commodity prices slump. An achored currency would reduce these fluctuations.
Why is the dollar an unstable unit? A close look at today's dollar bill doesn't inspire confidence. The dollar describes itself laconically as a note - a hint that it once represented a claim on something or other. In the past, the implied obligation written on the dollar bill was explicit and compelling. Paper money was redeemable in silver or gold: ''This certifies that there has been deposited in the Treasury of the United States one silver dollar, payable to bearer on demand.'' The last redeemable paper disappeared in the past few decades. Silver certificates were abolished by a 1963 act of Congress. Gold certificates were recalled back in 1933. Today a dollar bill is a promise by the Federal Reserve to pay the bearer one dollar: a circular promise which is no promise at all. Like the original greenbacks issued during the Civil War, it is no longer an obligation to pay anything to anybody, and fluctuates in its purchasing power like the debt of a bankrupt foreign nation. The miracle - in my opinion - is that prices are predictable at all and that people accept paper money so readily for goods and services.
Unfortunately, the debate over anchoring the currency has too often been sidetracked by disputes over returning to the gold standard. It's perfectly reasonable to advocate an anchored currency while remaining agnostic about, or even opposing, a gold standard. To use as an anchor a commodity like gold, whose supply is far from fixed and whose geographical distribution is far from uniform, presents problems. For modern times a better, more representative commodity anchor can surely be devised. But there is little point in working to design such a basket while the Federal Government is unwilling to consider an anchor of any kind.
With or without gold, anchoring the dollar would go further to stabilize the world economy than anything else Washington could do. The anchor needs to be firm, and people need to be sure that it is permanent and that it is designed to preserve their purchasing power.
If those conditions are met, foreign governments will not be slow to tie their currencies back to the dollar and, if they do, exchange rates will cease their meaningless gyrations. At a stroke, many of the instabilities that plague the world economy can be eradicated and volatility in the world's financial and money markets will cease.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Once Again, Vietnamese Are Turned Out to Sea

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia

 BODY:
THE irascible Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, recently caused a stir when he used the word ''scum'' to describe Vietnamese boat people who remain here after Western resettlement countries select those among them who qualify as refugees. ''Why should we be responsible?'' Mr. Mahathir asked. ''We did not cause the Vietnam War.''
Mr. Mahathir's remark was consistent with what Western diplomats and relief workers describe as the real inhumanity: Malaysia's policy, since the end of May, of refusing first asylum to boat people who land here and sending them, though with fresh provisions, back out to sea. 
According to Eric E. Morris, the representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for Malaysia and Brunei, some 2,600 Vietnamese arriving in at least 48 boats have been sent on from Malaysia since the end of May.
Mr. Morris's figures represent boat people who have landed elsewhere, most on the Indonesian island of Salang, south of Singapore. There is no way of knowing if others did not survive, he said. Mr. Mahathir says that ''all we are doing is preventing foreign vessels from entering our waters.'' But Mr. Morris says that virtually all the Vietnamese boats came ashore here before being refurbished or re-provisioned.
While mistreatment, rape and murder have been an intermittent hazard for the boat people for 14 years, Malaysia's pushoffs, Mr. Morris said, violated an agreement reached in June between so-called first-asylum countries like Malaysia and resettlement nations like the United States, Australia, France and Canada. Mr. Morris added pointedly that the agreement was reached at a Geneva conference instigated by Malaysia, and at which Malaysia held the chairmanship.
But Mr. Mahathir's comments and Malaysia's actions also reflect an impatience in Asia as the numbers of Vietnamese boat people continue to rise in camps throughout Southeast and East Asia. The old system of dealing with Vietnamese fleeing their homeland has been discarded; the operation of the new one, which was adopted in June, has been stymied by a disagreement over the forcible repatriation of Vietnamese judged not to be true political refugees, but simply economic migrants.
The dispute has pitted the United States, which insists on no forcible repatriation of Vietnamese, against most of the rest of the world, including Britain. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher often points out that Washington sends back Haitians, Mexicans and others who enter the United States illegally if they are economic migrants.
 
A British Lead
Britain, whose temporary colony, Hong Kong, is now coping with some 56,500 Vietnamese, has been most outspoken about wanting to send those who do not qualify as refugees back to Vietnam involuntarily. The only reason it has not yet done so, Western diplomats say, is because of strong opposition from Washington.
Under the old international agreement, all Vietnamese boat people were considered refugees fleeing political or religious persecution. The old agreement was reached a decade ago to end an initial period of extreme hardship for Vietnamese refugees, in which many died at sea. But in 1987, 12 years after the Vietnam War ended, a new surge of people fleeing one of the poorest of countries coincided with a drop in Western interest in their resettlement.
With the number of migrants in the camps rising again, Thailand started pushing the Vietnamese boats back to sea in early 1988, setting a precedent for other nations. The first-asylum countries, led by Malaysia and Thailand, insisted on a new agreement. Boat people arriving after March 14, 1989 (and in Hong Kong, after June 16, 1988), would be screened under United Nations supervision to see if they were legitimate refugees. Resettlement countries agreed to take everyone in the camps before the cutoff dates and those arriving afterward who were judged to be refugees. The first-asylum countries agreed to provide shelter for everyone arriving in the meantime. But the disagreement over what happens to those who do not qualify for refugee status has gummed up the process.
 
Inhospitality
What most exercises Mr. Mahathir is the prospect of being stuck indefinitely with what he calls the ''residue.'' Some Asians have suggested putting those who do not qualify in conditions so inhospitable they will agree to go home; diplomats and relief officials say the British in Hong Kong, though they deny it, have been trying just that, prompting protests by the High Commissioner and human-rights groups.
Malaysia, for its part, has been treating the 20,750 people now in its camps very well, with adequate food, shelter, clothing and health care. But more than half of them arrived after the cutoff date, and some officials argue that politically, no Southeast Asian country can afford to be seen lagging too far behind the British.
The United States finds itself in an awkward position, allied with Vietnam in opposition to forcible repatriation. But what bothers many other Western diplomats and relief officials is what they see as a deeper American inconsistency, rooted in what they regard as Washington's lingering trauma about Vietnam.
These critics say there is a contradiction between the American desire to resolve the problem of the boat people, many of whom are still seen as ideological heroes for fleeing Vietnam, and the way Washington continues to isolate Hanoi.
The continuing American-led Western embargo on aid, trade and investment in Vietnam helps keep Vietnam backward and impoverished, they argue. Though some countries like Australia are slowing cracking the embargo, there is a widespread feeling among Washington's allies that the United States is punishing Vietnam and adding new conditions for normal relations.
''Vietnam has to come to peace with itself and the United States is not helping,'' said an Asian diplomat. ''And one of the prime consequences of that is the boat people.''
In the meantime, the Vietnamese linger, the boats keep coming, and some continue to be pushed away, back into the insentient and unforgiving sea.

U.S. Aid for Poland: Long on Incentives, Short on Dollars

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
LECH WALESA, the hero of Poland's democratic revolution, asked Congress last week for a Marshall Plan to revive the Polish economy. But Congress and President Bush have already decided how to help Poland, and their vision is much more modest.
The ambitious program devised by President Truman and George C. Marshall, his Secretary of State, rebuilt cities, factories, roads and railways devastated in World War II. With Europe close to economic collapse, Marshall declared that the United States ''should provide a cure rather than a mere palliative.'' In 1989, aid to Poland is enormously popular, but Mr. Bush and members of Congress continually emphasize the fiscal and political limits to what the United States can do. 
Poland's task, as described by its new rulers, is to establish a Western-style market economy in place of a Communist system. American officials, wrestling with their own budget deficit, say the best way to help Poland help itself is to stimulate private enterprise. Thus, the legislation approved by Congress last week would create an ''enterprise fund'' to provide loans, grants, insurance, technical assistance and training to private businesses in Poland.
The bill authorizes aid of $938 million over three years, or twice what President Bush requested. Most of the money would come from the Federal Treasury, but it is meant to generate much larger amounts of private investment in Poland.
 
Aid From Europe
On this measure, the Senate showed none of the urgency that characterized the Marshall Plan. In the meantime, West Germany, France and other countries - many of them beneficiaries of the Marshall Plan - beat the United States in offering aid to Poland. In Warsaw last week, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany signed an agreement to provide $2.2 billion, the most offered by any Western nation.
Western experts say the aid would be wasted if Warsaw does not make basic economic changes. Poland has a foreign debt of $39 billion and has been unable to make payments on schedule. Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, said Washington had to be ''fiscally responsible,'' and that ''just providing new subsidies for inefficient, outmoded state enterprises will not do the trick.'' Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, said ''a simple infusion of capital'' could not solve Poland's problems. ''The Poles have nothing to show for their orgy of borrowing in the 1970's but a heavy millstone of debt around their necks,'' he said.
Democrats say Poland does not want to repeat that experience. ''The Poles simply do not want direct Government aid,'' said Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan. Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, said the aid bill was ''phase two of the Marshall Plan,'' but another Maryland Democrat, Representative Steny H. Hoyer, said it was ''far less of an action than we took in the Marshall Plan.''
Aid for Poland, like the Marshall Plan, is based on the premise that political stability is closely linked to economic prosperity. A major goal is to make sure that Poland's fledgling democracy survives and flourishes. Many countries assisted by the Marshall Plan had strong democratic institutions. By contrast, as Senator Paul Simon of Illinois observed, Poland has ''no experience, no background, no traditions to go by.''
Washington will provide Poland with $12 million to support ''democratic institutions'' like civic groups, trade unions and political parties. The United States also intends to share managerial expertise that Poland's state-run industries have conspicuously lacked. Said Mr. Walesa, the labor leader, ''We want to make business deals.''

Making Industrial Policy at the Pentagon

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
IN the 1960's and 1970's, a small Pentagon office called the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency helped create an explosion of innovation in computer research that has had an immense impact on the American economy. Acting independently and without the bureaucratic strings that often shackle Government organizations, the agency served as a de facto venture capitalist for the American computer industry. By paying for innovative research in university and corporate laboratories, it almost single-handedly created the field of computer science in the United States.
Now it appears that the Bush Administration is on the verge of reining in the agency, which some economists consider the closest thing the Government has to a national industrial policy. The office, which is called Darpa, has long operated on the assumption that national defense means not only developing new weapons but supporting basic research and commercial technology. 
Supporters of Government technological initiatives say that for economic and ideological reasons President Bush's economic advisers want deep cuts in the Pentagon's research budget, including support for high-technology consortiums and Darpa programs to develop advanced robotic manufacturing technology and high-definition television. In 1989 the budget for the Pentagon research agency increased to almost $1.3 billion from $880 million in 1988.
The questions about Darpa come as many Democratic and Republic legislators are calling for a redefinition of national defense, with the military competition of the cold war giving way to economic competition with allies like Japan and West Germany. Almost a dozen bills before Congress would create a civilian equivalent of Darpa. Senator Albert Gore Jr., the Tennessee Democrat, has called for a $1.9 billion effort toward a fiber optic network linking the nation's supercomputers.
''I think the Administration truly doesn't understand the erosion and weakness of the American technology and industrial base,'' said Clyde Prestowitz, a former Reagan Administration official who is now at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace in Washington.
A study to be released tomorrow by the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington research center, warns that the United States stands to lose more than two million jobs and suffer a $225 billion trade deficit by 2010 if the Government fails to help industry compete in high-definition television and related technologies.
 
A Modern Renaissance
Since the United States is so far behind Japan on high-definition television, not all supporters of national high-tech efforts think it should be developed. But in general, leaders of the computer industry say Pentagon support has been indispensable. Alan Kay, one of Apple Computer's principal researchers, has referred to the early years of Darpa as a renaissance for computer science. The agency supported research into the first personal computers, computer graphics, computer networks and artificial intelligence. Sun Microsystems Inc., the world's fastest-growing maker of computer work stations, was started by researchers at Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley who worked with the agency's money. A Darpa-financed software project at Carnegie-Mellon University known as Mach has become the basis for several companies including Steve Jobs's Next Inc.
The agency's Strategic Computing Program, begun in the mid-1980's, is often described as the only response to the Japanese Fifth Generation project. Both efforts are aimed at developing machines that have the blinding speed and huge storage capacity of computers and some of the flexibility of human minds.
Still, some supporters of a national industrial policy believe that it should be entrusted to a civilian agency. For most of its 30-year lifetime, the Pentagon agency has been known for supporting research whose military connections were often remote. But in the 1980's it began directing money to more immediate applications. The Strategic Computing Project has spent more than $100 million a year since 1983 financing projects like a robot tank, which many critics consider a waste of money.
Some economists think that the money would be better spent on projects like a data ''superhighway'' to carry computer information, telephone conversations and television signals. The hope is that such a network would lead to the creation of dozens of new information-age industries.

Why the Hard Sell Didn't Work For Detroit

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
THE report on car and truck sales released last week was, by most accounts, a grim harbinger for the American auto industry. While foreign manufacturers are suffering, too, the brunt of the decline hit the Big Three automakers, raising new questions about whether Detroit is entering its first recession in almost a decade.
The report for Nov. 1-10 described a 23.1 percent decline in sales of domestically produced cars and a 15.3 percent decline in light-truck sales, compared with the same period last year. The bad news followed October's gloomy reports, which were somewhat less unnerving because they were expected. 
A couple of declines in a row happen now and then and cause no panic. But many analysts say the latest report demonstrated an underlying and persistent softening of demand for cars that is impervious to the enticements of rebates, cut-rate financing or airplane tickets to Hawaii. What these accomplished, apparently, was simply to stave off the inevitable crunch.
The droop in demand has many possible causes. It could be that consumers' income was being pinched or that consumer confidence was down. It could be that buyers already have what they want; car sales picked up along with the economy beginning in the early 1980's, and people are keeping cars longer. At the same time, imports, particularly from Japan, continue to gain market share.
Americans' disdain for new cars showed up in almost every category in the latest report. Chrysler's minivan continues to sell well, but almost nothing else does. One big disappointment is General Motors' new mid-size four-doors, the Pontiac Grand Prix and the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. Japanese manufacturers that make cars in the United States also suffered declines, but they did better than the Big Three. Sales of imports have generally been off, but figures for this month are not available yet.
For most of the summer, the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation - sensing that consumers indeed were tiring of buying new cars - had been offering rebates of up to several thousand dollars on certain models to cut back their huge inventories. G.M.'s rebate program was lavish. It sold cars, but it also cut profits by more than $500 million in the third quarter.
 
A Desperate Move
The automakers also dangled additional cash bonuses in front of dealers as incentives to cut their profit margins and close more deals. It was a desperate measure, but the result of the heavy promotions was strong sales through the end of September.
On Oct. 1, however, the new model year began, with the normal higher prices across the board and a stiff reduction in rebates. After all, automakers do not like to discount new models. The result was thousands of dollars of difference in prices, even though many models, as usual, remained largely unchanged from the previous year. The industry notes that this year's cars are equipped with expensive, Federally mandated passive restraints. But that seems to make little difference to consumers.
''You really had to want to be the first one on your block to have a 1990 to buy at those prices,'' said Ronald Glantz, an automotive analyst for Montgomery Securities Inc.
As expected, October sales plummeted because so many buyers had already been lured to the 1989's. Moreover, dealers still had many too many cars and trucks and began curtailing orders from the factories. October was what the industry calls a ''payback'' period, when it loses sales it gained previously.
In any event, the Big Three and Wall Street expected the period to be over in November. When the big declines were announced, Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley & Company said, ''These are the kind of numbers that are so bad you want to blame it on the computer. What concerns me is that we still have pretty substantial rebates.''
A Big Three executive, who asked not to be identified, said he believed that because the winter is such a soft selling season it won't be possible until the spring to see what the long-term trend is.
In the meantime, the automakers are not taking chances. If unsold cars and trucks pile up much further they might have to rent space at local fairgrounds, as they did a few years ago, for storage. Plants all over the country have begun closing down for a week or two at a time. And last week the workers at G.M.'s plant in Fairfax, Kan., came back to work to learn that they would be idle for two more weeks.

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Wall Street's Cutbacks And the Ripple Effect On the City's Economy

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
TWO years after the market collapse, Wall Street has begun another wave of job cuts. The continued weakness of the financial services sector comes as another piece of bad news for Mayor-elect David N. Dinkins and his new administration. The growing loss of Wall Street jobs comes on top of an even greater loss of manufacturing employment in New York City and the increasing exodus of back-office workers from the city.
In the past month, Shearson Lehman Hutton, one of the largest investment banks, said it would eliminate up to 800 positions; Salomon Brothers said it would continue its cost-cutting by slashing at least 100 employees by year end; and Drexel Burnham Lambert has begun cuts that could approach 800 by early 1990. Most cuts are in New York offices, and analysts expect more firms to add their names to the list. 
The financial services sector, particularly the securities business, played a central role in the city's economic revival in the 1980's, so any slowdown greatly concerns officials and economists. In addition, a significant decline in Wall Street employment means fewer well-heeled young people purchasing new apartments and spending heavily on retail and other goods and services. The average Wall Street salary is two-and-a-half times that of the citywide average, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the loss of thousands of jobs in the securities business means a large amount of disposable income lost to the city's economy.
But high-paid investment bankers are not the only ones being laid off. Most cuts involve clerical and other lower-level jobs that are crucial to many middle-class minority workers, a group the city can ill afford to lose.
''The loss of jobs on Wall Street is significant for apartment sales, retail sales and other parts of the service economy in the city,'' said Daniel Sandy Bayer, vice president for economic and commercial development at the New York City Partnership, a nonprofit group of business and education leaders. ''It has a major impact on business and consumption in the city as well as the negative impact on the tax base.''
The entire financial services sector, which includes banks, insurance companies, pension funds and other businesses beyond Wall Street, is one of the largest employers in the city, and in 1988 financial services companies contributed about $1.5 billion directly to the city's coffers, according to the New York City Partnership. Over the last decade, Wall Street alone accounted for 20 percent of the increases in total private-sector income in the city.
Still, Gary Kesner, commissioner of the city's Office of Business Development, said the city's economy is diverse enough to withstand the loss of Wall Street jobs.
''Clearly significant cuts in the industry have already been experienced,'' he said, ''but we have had increases in other areas that have balanced off the losses.''
The latest wave of cuts continues a retrenchment that began shortly after the market crash of Oct. 19, 1987, when most large investment houses saw flat earnings ahead and moved to reduce their fixed expenses. 24,000 Jobs Lost Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show that the entire financial services industry in New York City has lost about 24,000 jobs from its peak level of 364,000 jobs in mid-1987.
''There has been a decline in the number of Wall Street jobs but the movement has not been precipitous,'' said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, who noted that the cuts have come in several waves since the beginning of 1988.
Many analysts who track the fortunes of Wall Street firms add that the current contractions will almost certainly continue into 1990 because the sources of profits in the big investment houses have shifted rapidly over the past few years and the firms are overstaffed in many areas.
''The initial round of cuts reflected excess capacity in the industry,'' said Alison Deans, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company. ''Firms were trying to get a handle on expenses across the board.''
Ms. Deans said the downturn in the retail brokerage business, flat earnings from trading and other shifts in profitable lines of business happened so quickly that Wall Street has not fully adjusted.
''Firms grew so quickly during the bull market that they couldn't get a sense of which aspects of the business were actually profitable,'' she said. ''The market changed faster than most of these firms.''
But beyond Wall Street's latest troubles, the city has lost 21,000 manufacturing jobs in the last two years alone. In addition, the city is losing a large number of support staff and back-office operations to New Jersey and the suburbs at the same time that an increasing number of companies are moving their front offices out. The Exxon Corporation, for example, announced recently that it will move its headquarters to Dallas.
''Clearly the last two years have shown us that we can weather the storm,'' said Mr. Kesner of the city's business development office, ''but we need to be more vigilant in our efforts to keep companies here.''
According to a study prepared by the New York City Partnership, New York must make a greater effort to cut the bureaucracy that Wall Street firms and others corporations face if it hopes to prevent more operations from leaving.
''In the long term, we need to improve the quality of the labor force and to take steps to make sure we continue to upgrade our telecommunications, which is the lifeline on which these business depend,'' said Mr. Bayer, the partnership's vice president. ''Short term, the city can address some of the bureaucracy that now exists to negotiate and get approval for financial packages, and to construct facilities in the city.''

HEADLINE: One Germany: Not Likely Now

 BODY:
No one was prepared for the rush of change in East Germany and the abrupt opening of the Berlin wall. So it's not surprising that the good news is being followed by much disquieting conjecture about a feared old topic: German reunification. Even careful Henry Kissinger calls that prospect inevitable. 
Surprises can't be discounted - witness not only the holes in the wall but the other changes in the East. But the fears seem highly premature. For many different and sound reasons, hardly anybody wants reunification to happen.
Look first at East Germany. Its Communist leaders are firmly opposed to political unification, though they certainly would welcome closer economic ties with West Germany. Closer political ties would jeopardize their grip on power as well as East Germany's identity as a socialist state.
Even opposition leaders don't want unification. They retain a belief in socialism; they want to reform rather than abolish their state, and want to combine free-market elements with a capacious social safety net.
Consider next West Germany, whose people already fear being swamped by a massive exodus from the East. Chancellor Kohl expressed the consensus accurately: ''Our compatriots in the German Democratic Republic must be able to decide for themselves which way they want to go in the future.'' To Mr. Kohl, reunification is not now on the agenda.
Though President Mitterrand says he does not fear German reunification, France doesn't want it. Reunification complicates Paris's priority of moving ahead quickly with Western European economic integration. A new fatherland of 80 million Germans would tip the balance in the European Community even further in West Germany's direction.
Britain shares French concerns about an enlarged Germany becoming the economic superpower in Europe. Prime Minister Thatcher's warning against talking prematurely about reunification springs from the traditional British desire to maintain a balance of power on the continent by resisting the emergence of any outsized rival.
Like Western Europeans, Poles and other Eastern Europeans have bitter historical memories of previous greater Germanys whose drives to the East have been at their expense. And Poland has a very particular concern about a new united fatherland claiming ''lost territories'' in now-Polish Silesia and East Prussia.
Washington doesn't want reunification because that would end U.S. military presence in West Germany and dissolve NATO without an adequate substitute. Secretary of State Baker, taking his cue from Bonn, pointedly talks about Germany's legitimate wish for unity Finally, the Soviet Union, the country that suffered worst from Hitler's war, fears the nationalism that might emerge from German reunification. Mikhail Gorbachev also worries that a united Germany might be more inclined to throw its weight around Eastern Europe than in a united Western Europe.
Perhaps the only spur to serious demands for a reunited Germany would be foolish, provocative statements that Germans have no right to such an aspiration. They do have that right, and one day it may become a reality. For now, however, neither Europeans, Russians, Americans, nor indeed German leaders themselves are ready or eager to see a Fourth Reich.
More likely, the two Germanys will gradually blend their economies. In time, this will open the way for new forms of political association. Meantime, the overriding goal, for Germans and non-Germans alike, remains to integrate West Germany into Western Europe and move toward a Europe with truly open frontiers. What better end to a tormented German history, and what greater hope for Europe?

HEADLINE: Colonialism Isn't All of Philippine Story

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Stanley Karnow (''From St. Joan to Lame Duck,'' Op-Ed, Nov. 6) is unique among Americans who comment on the Philippines in that he does not evade discussion of the responsiblity of the two colonial powers - Spain and the United States - for that country's problems.
Mr. Karnow is correct about Spain's promotion of a ''plantation economy that pauperized the mass of the peasantry and enriched a handful of landowners.'' And the United States, when its turn at colonialism came, ''perpetuated the authority of the upper classes'' in the Philippines.
But the irony of colonialism is that the citizens of the former colonizing powers often believe in the righteousness of their country's expansionist adventure. They could never believe that that adventure had been a cause of a former colony's ruin.
Of course, what ails the Philippines today is not all attributable to its colonizers. Sadly, the country's history is littered with national leaders who sold out to vested interests - domestic and foreign - out of greed or fear. A backward glance shows Filipino leaders who were either collaborators with the colonizers, creations or puppets of spy agencies, or political charlatans who pretended to espouse the best interests of their countrymen even as they worked in private to preserve the status quo. The hope for the Filipino people is that President Corazon C. Aquino will turn out to be different.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN: Atlanta

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME; PETER APPLEBOME is chief of The New York Times's Atlanta bureau.

 BODY:
Atlanta, more than any other city in the South, has always looked forward rather than back - interested in the bustle of commerce rather than the history and lore that's so much a part of many Southern cities. Its charms rest partly on the gorgeous wooded setting it began with and partly on the modern city created by the economic juggernaut of the recent past and almost not at all on what came between.
For a change, however, what's new in Atlanta is what's old. The most eagerly awaited arrival in town over the past year has been the $142 million resurrection of Underground Atlanta, the entertainment complex built on what was once the deserted skeleton of the original 19th-century downtown. Underground Atlanta flourished in the 1970's, but attendance tapered off and it closed in 1982. The expanded project, which now covers 12 acres, was reborn this summer amid much hoopla as well as concern about whether Atlanta would support a project in its downtown, which shrivels up after business hours. So far, though, the project has drawn conventioneers, tourists and locals at a pace that has exceeded all expectations and given downtown a focus it badly needed. 
In December, Atlanta will celebrate another success that will be forever associated with the city - the 50th anniversary of the Dec. 15, 1939, premiere of the film ''Gone With the Wind.'' Festivities will include historical tours, appearances by cast members, an antebellum ball, and a Scarlett and Rhett look-alike contest.
 
Underground
The new version of Underground Atlanta (404-523-2311) has been reborn between Peachtree Street and Central Avenue at Alabama Street.
Unlike other projects of the Rouse Company, like Faneuil Hall in Boston and Harborplace in Baltimore, Underground Atlanta has no natural amenity such as a harbor or river to play off of. But its location at the heart of where Atlanta began and its evocative blending of old and new architectural touches gives it a distinctive sense of place.
Underground has about 140 shops, restaurants and clubs and is oriented toward night life. For fast food, there is the attractive food court, which offers a little of everything, for example the grilled chicken sandwich ($2.95) at Louie's Chicken Grill or the roast turkey plate ($4.85) at Turkey Express Diner.
For more serious dining, Lombardi's (94 Upper Pryor Street; 404-522-6568) is a good bet. A meal with a glass of wine is about $20. Try the veal Milanese ($12.95) or the pizzas made in wood-burning ovens ($8.25).
For night life, clubs offer jazz, blues, folk and country music. Perhaps the most popular is Dante's Down the Hatch (Lower Alabama Street and Lower Pryor Street; 404-577-1800). There's jazz nightly with a $5 entertainment charge. Banks and Shane's (94 Pryor Street SW;404-577-4300), offers, at various times, jazz, bluegrass and folk; $5 cover charge Tuesday to Saturday, $3 Monday. At Blues Harbor (155 Kenny's Alley; 404-524-3001) the music is Chicago-style blues and jump swing. The cover varies with the act.
 
'G.W.T.W.'
Visitors to Atlanta looking for traces of Rhett, Scarlett and Tara usually come away disappointed. There's no Tara, but December may be the best time ever for ''Gone With the Wind'' fans to fantasize about Atlanta's past. The biggest anniversary event will be the ''re-premiere'' of the film Dec. 15 at the Fox Theater, 660 Peachtree Street, N.E. The festivities start with the Parade of Stars motorcade at 5:30 P.M., followed by a 6 P.M. cocktail reception. The screening starts at 8 P.M. and is followed by a champagne breakfast at midnight.
Prices range from $15 and $25 for the screening only to $100 for the whole shebang plus a souvenir program. Some of the events, such as the ball and the re-premiere, will be attended by 11 members of the cast of the movie. They include Butterfly McQueen, who played Prissy, Cammie King-Conlon, who played Bonnie Blue Butler, and Evelyn Keyes, who played Suellen O'Hara.
Those convinced of their own star quality can enter the Rhett and Scarlett look-alike contest Dec. 12 at the Continental Ballroom of the Hyatt Regency Atlanta hotel, 265 Peachtree Street, N.E. Judging of 10 finalists will be Dec. 12 at 8 P.M. For information on applying call 404-262-7660.
Winners and losers alike can strut their stuff Dec. 14 at the Gone With the Wind Antebellum Ball - period costumes or black tie optional - an attempt to re-create the Premiere Ball in 1939. Admission, at the Georgia International Convention and Trade Center, (1902 Sullivan Road) is $100, which includes a Southern buffet.
Special tours as part of the celebration will be a good opportunity to explore what's left of Atlanta's past. Among them is the Frankly My Dear . . . Historic Jonesboro tour Dec. 12, which will take in one of the area's most historic communities and some of its Tara-like architecture. The tour runs Dec. 11, 12, 14 and 16 and the cost is $28. A tour called Mansions and Magnolias: The Houses of Newnan visits a part of Georgia that was spared by Gen. William T. Sherman and thus has the highest concentration of antebellum homes near Atlanta. The cost is $38.
A tour Dec. 12 and 14 tracing Sherman's march through Atlanta, concludes at the Cyclorama, a Civil War exhibit featuring a massive panoramic painting, next to Zoo Atlanta at 800 Cherokee Avenue, S.E. The cost is $19.
Atlanta's Black Heritage Tour Dec. 13 will include stops at such places as the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change and the Atlanta University complex. The cost is $14.
For information on the ''Gone With the Wind'' festivities and all tours, call 404-262-7660.
If you just want to see the film, ''Gone With the Wind'' shows daily year round at 2:15 and 7:15 P.M. at CNN Center, 100 Techwood Avenue, S.W.; 404-577-6974). Admission is $3.50; on Tuesdays, $2.
 
Other Events
One of the most popular Atlanta theatrical offerings in years has been the Alliance Theater's production of ''Driving Miss Daisy'' by Alfred Uhry, an Atlanta native. It runs to Dec. 31 at the Alliance Studio Theater, part of the Woodruff Arts Center (1280 Peachtree Street, N.E.; 404-892-2414). Tickets are $14.25 to $20.25.
The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Yoel Levi, offers a full schedule at the Woodruff Arts Center. Tickets are $12.50 to $40.
In the same complex is the High Museum of Art (404-892-4444), designed by Richard Meier, which opened in 1983. From its gleaming porcelain-enameled steel exterior to its swirl of ramps and wash of natural light inside, it is probably the most architecturally ambitious building in Atlanta. Currently on view is ''Land of Deepest Shade: Photographs of the South by John McWilliams.'' Museum admission is $4. The museum is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. (open Wednesday until 9 P.M.) and Sunday, noon to 5 P.M.
The Atlanta Ballet, at the Civic Center (395 Piedmont Avenue; 404-892-3303), presents ''The Nutcracker'' Dec. 15 to 30. Tickets for evening performances are $8.50 to $31.25 and for matinees, $8 to $24.75.
The Carter Presidential Center and Jimmy Carter Library and Museum, 1 Copenhill Avenue, N.E.; 404-331-3942) has exhibits on the Carter Presidency and other subjects. Until Jan. 25, works of the 19th-century political cartoonist Thomas Nast are on display. Admission is $2.50. Open 9 A.M. to 4:45 P.M. Monday to Saturday and Sunday noon to 4:45 P.M.
 
Where to Eat
An interesting joint venture is Indigo Coastal Grill (1397 North Highland Avenue, N.E.; 404-876-0676) and Partner's, A Morningside Cafe (1399 North Highland Avenue, N.E.; (404-875-0202). The restaurants, owned by the same management, are next door to one another in the up and coming Virginia Highlands area northeast of downtown. Indigo specializes in coastal cuisine from Cape Cod to the Keys. The Northeast steamer (half a lobster, clams, scallops and mussels), at market price, has been $16.95 lately. Partner's specializes in what it calls ''cross-cultural'' cuisine, emphasis on Mediterranean. Try the fish in parchment, lately $14.95 or $15.95.
A popular hangout for the conspicuous consumption crowd in the affluent Buckhead area is the Buckhead Diner (3073 Piedmont Road, N.E.; 404-262-3336) where the food and the Art Deco decor are lively and irreverent and dinners run about $20. A speciality is the grilled salmon B.L.T. on homemade brioche with tarragon mayonnaise ($8.75). For dessert try the white chocolate banana cream pie at $3.95 a slice. For lunch downtown try Delectables (1 Margaret Mitchell Square, N.W.; 404-68l-2909), which is perhaps the best restaurant you'll ever find at a library - Atlanta Fulton County library in this case. A specialty is lemon tarragon chicken salad at $6.50 as an entree and $3.95 as a sandwich.
For dinner at one of the more formal restaurants in town, try the Hedgerose Heights Inn (490 East Paces Ferry Road, N.E.; 404-233-7673). Entrees run from about 6 to $23. A specialty is sauteed veal medallions served with chive sauce, asparagus and ratatouille ravioli for $18.50.
Perhaps the best formal dining downtown can be found at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel (l8l Peachtree Street, N.E., 404-659-0400). The Restaurant, as the dining room is modestly called, offers Continental cuisine. Entrees begin at $19.50.
 
Where to Stay
The 454-room Ritz-Carlton (l8l Peachtree Street, N.E.; 404-659-0400) is Atlanta's premier downtown hotel. Doubles start at 55. It and other popular downtown hotels such as the Hyatt Regency (265 Peachtree Street, N.E.; 404-577-1234) and the Omni International (100 CNN Center; 404-659-0000), the official headquarters of the ''Gone With the Wind'' extravaganza, will offer special package rates for the festivities. Standard rates for doubles are $170 at the Hyatt Regency and $160 at the Omni.
In Buckhead in north Atlanta are two exceptional new hotels, the Ritz Carlton Buckhead (3434 Peachtree Road, N.E.; 404-237-2700), where doubles start at 55 and the Westin Lenox (3300 Lenox Road, N.E.; 404-262-3344), where doubles start at $2l5.
Budget choices: Less expensive in Buckhead is the Holiday Inn Buckhead (3340 Peachtree Road, N.E.; 404-23l-l234). Double rooms start at $79. A comfortable hotel downtown is the Days Inn Downtown (300 Spring Street, N.W.; 404-523-1144), where doubles start at $79.
For information on about 100 bed and breakfast establishments at prices from $32 to $100 a night, contact Bed and Breakfast Atlanta, 1801 Piedmont Avenue, N.E., Suite 208, Atlanta, Ga. 30324; 404-875-0525).

HEADLINE: The Way It Should Be Remembered

BYLINE: By Blanche McCrary Boyd; Blanche McCrary Boyd teaches writing at Connecticut College. She has just finished her third novel, ''The Revolution of Little Girls.''

 BODY:
CHARLIE HALL HAS BEEN A WEATHERMAN at WCSC-TV in Charleston, S.C., since 1953, when the city's first television station went on the air. A silver-haired man with a rich voice, Charlie is a local celebrity, a highly respected figure, and one of the reasons WCSC-TV's local news programming has dominated the ratings. He is also my friend. At 3 o'clock on the afternoon of Sept. 21, 1989, Charlie Hall's voice broke while he was delivering the forecast.
''People had been calling the station all day asking, 'Where is Hugo going to hit?' '' he told me several weeks after the hurricane. ''But when I saw the 3 o'clock computer picture, I didn't need the National Weather Service anymore to tell me what was going to happen. What the people calling meant was, 'Where is the eye going to go across?' It didn't matter. This was a monster storm, a killer. It was bigger than the entire state, and it was headed straight toward us.''
I grew up in Charleston, and, like many coastal Southerners, considered myself hurricane savvy. At my home in Connecticut, I was watching the radar picture of the storm moving toward the South Carolina coast. ''It's not going to hit us,'' I said to my friends, forgetting, briefly, where I was. ''It'll swing up, you'll see. It'll hit Myrtle Beach or North Carolina. This has happened to us before.'' 
Like my family and friends living in the Charleston area, I could not take in the enormity of what was happening. Like them, I still can't. In fact, as I'd soon learn, this had not happened to us before.
HURRICANE HUGO, THE MOST DESTRUC-tive storm ever to hit the continental United States, struck the coast of South Carolina near midnight, near high tide. The eye went up the mouth of Charleston harbor. The winds were officially clocked at 139 miles per hour, although, as Charlie told me, no one knows for sure, because the local equipment broke at 119. The storm surge, a mound of water that moves much faster than a tide, was 10 feet in Charleston, closer to 20 feet a few miles up the coast, at the village of McClellanville. In McClellanville, 600 people had huddled in a brick school in darkness with water up to their chests. They had torn the paneling off the ceiling and stuffed their children into the air vents.
We tend to measure disasters by body counts and property damage, and to rate one disaster against another. Eighteen people in South Carolina were killed by Hurricane Hugo, 65,000 left homeless, and property damage will probably reach $8 billion. Nevertheless, Hugo, as news, was soon eclipsed by the San Francisco earthquake, where, although the body count was higher, property losses and homelessness were not as severe.
At first I didn't want (Continued on Page 90) to go. My family and friends were physically unhurt. There were trees on the houses and cars smashed, but everything was fixable, and I have worked hard to put South Carolina behind me.
But like many Charlestonians, I am obsessed with the place. Although I left home at the age of 18 and have lived in California, Boston, Vermont and New York City, the world, in many ways, has merely continued to divide, for me, into South Carolina and not-South Carolina.
Two weeks after Hugo hit Charleston, I was on a plane. Every day I'd found myself scanning newscasts for familiar buildings, familiar landscapes, and calling my family with questions. When my sister found out I was coming, she spoke slowly: ''Nothing you've seen on TV, Blanche, will prepare you for this. Pictures can't do it.''
The plane landed in the afternoon because the night lights along the runways had been destroyed. I missed the entry ramp to the interstate because the sign was gone and the landscape looked different.
''Everything is so oddly bright,'' my friend Ross had told me, ''because of all the trees that are down,'' As I drove across the Ashley River, everything was oddly bright. The Lowcountry has always been a shady place full of graceful, dense pines and huge, live oaks draped with moss, but now trees were snapped off or overturned everywhere, and those left standing were nearly denuded of leaves. All along the interstate I saw roofs that were torn or smashed, windows broken and boarded over.
This is not so bad, I kept telling myself, more amazed, in a way, at what was intact than at what was damaged. The river was wide, steady and serene, looping through the wavering marsh grasses, and if many of the houses scattered along the water had bright blue tarps instead of roofs, the sight seemed picturesque from a distance.
MY MOTHER'S apartment downtown was still uninhabitable, and she was staying with my aunt and uncle and cousins, who were crowded together in a house with a tree through the roof. I stayed with Ross.
Her house was intact, but her street was a tunnel of debris, with one lane cleared. There were extension cords running across the pavement because power had been restored on one side of the street, and neighbors were sharing.
Ross is a native Charlestonian and she grew up downtown in the ''historic'' area, where many houses are hundreds of years old and there is a distinctive style of architecture. A small, olive-skinned woman in her mid-30's, Ross has a placidity and a graciousness that represent the best of Charleston. Put off by the self-importance and pretentiousness that represent the worst of Charleston, she has chosen to live her adult life in a small housing development west of the Ashley River.
After I found her house, we rode together out toward Folly Beach.
On each pilgrimage I make to South Carolina, I go to Folly Beach. The hurricane of 1938 tore the front row of houses off of Folly, creating a kind of class effect, since the most expensive houses were gone and much of the beach itself was washed away. The houses that remained as beachfront property were generally small, and at high tide some had waves breaking against their pilings. Breakwaters were built out into the surf, to try to save the sand, but they haven't helped much. ''The day will come,'' my grandmother used to say, ''when the Folly River and the Atlantic Ocean will meet, and Folly Beach will exist no more.''
Folly's atmosphere of precariousness and ruin has always attracted me. Charleston is a city in love with its own history, its own myth of gracefulness and restoration in the eye of destruction. The Lowcountry has survived the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, hurricanes and earthquakes. As a child I was told that Charleston was not burned by Sherman during the Civil War because the canny residents put up warning signs about measles, and the Union army burned Columbia instead.
The highest point in the historic district of Charleston is only 17 feet above the average low tides, and some streets downtown flood at particularly high tides. There are visible ''earthquake rods'' in houses that survived the quake of 1886. Charlestonians are as proud of their bumpy streets, their cobblestones, the crazy angles of their settled houses as they are of their walled-in gardens, their tiny alleys, their brilliant flowers, and the descendants of slaves selling handwoven baskets made of marsh grass to the tourists. In Charleston, the horses that pull the touring carriages wear diapers. When Charlestonians talk about ''the Holy City'' they are not being particularly ironic.
But nowhere is the area's fragility more apparent than on its barrier islands - Sullivan's Island, the Isle of Palms and Folly Beach. Though Folly was not, when I was growing up, a place where many affluent people lived, a decade or so ago developers moved gingerly into the area. On the Charleston side of the Folly River, condominiums replaced a funky restaurant where you could sit at old carved varnished tables and eat buckets of boiled crabs. At the end of the road onto the island, a large hotel was built right on the beach, near where the pier had been repeatedly destroyed. With these projects, the values of the flimsy properties on Folly went up.
Ross and I both hold the opinion that Charleston has been overdeveloped and overrestored. We resent not only the outside developers but the careful grooming of the downtown area. We miss the sweatier, messier Charleston of our childhoods.
The main building in the condo complex looked ruined, and we could see daylight right through the body of the hotel. ''I have to admit I feel like cheering,'' I said.
Ross was hanging out the car window, taking pictures. ''I guess,'' she said.
THERE IS A THRILL to any destruction, the natural electricity we all feel in the face of an enormous force, but my first glimpses of the destruction in the Charleston area were weirdly satisfying. Charleston was like a lady wearing too much makeup, I told myself, and Hugo had blasted that makeup right off. Once again I was getting to see Charleston's scarred, lovely face.
We parked the car where a piece of the road had been washed out and went sightseeing through the debris of people's lives. In an exposed kitchen with the refrigerator door hanging open I saw Lean Cuisines and melted chocolate ice cream, and in a bedroom torn open and sitting in the road I saw water-stained pictures of a family, an oil painting of an ocean sunset still hanging on the wall, a broken record of Lawrence Welk's Greatest Hits on the varnished wood floor.
Ross was beginning to catch my mood. ''You know the place they call the washout? It washed out.'' We both began to giggle.
On the eastern end of Folly Beach there is a sharp curve in the highway where, at high tide, waves break against the rocks guarding the road. You can see clearly what happened in the hurricane of 1938, that the front beach washed away. The island is thin, mostly marsh and road.
We got back in the car and made our way down to the wouldn't let us take a vehicle in, so we parked and walked. Bulldozers were trying to repair the road, and power-company crews were stringing wires along the new poles they'd put up. Past the washout, some of the houses on the marsh side of the road appeared unharmed. A sunburned man in a bathing suit was talking to a power-company man wearing a hardhat. ''If I can get power to one house on the island today, I'll be satisfied,'' I heard the man in the hardhat say. The man in the bathing suit nodded to us. ''At least it's a beautiful day,'' he said.
HOME IS THE SA-cred refuge of our life,'' Dryden wrote. Home is also where you can get stuck, by birth, or economic dependejce, or love. Home can fael safe or horrible, lost or portable, and home can dredge up anguish, as any attachment can.
By the time I got to my cousins' house that night, my exhilaration was fading, and home had begun to dredce up m 3/4nguish. I was beginning to comtvelend tle {ersonel} loss that Hurricane Hugo meant for each person in its path.
I satith m 3/4$ mothernd aunt and uncle and iy cousins Samm and Glenn around the kitchen table, and they did what many Southerners do: they told their painful tales humorously. ''I swear I'll never be that scared again in my life,'' Samm said. ''You should have seen us huddled there in the hall. When that tree came through the roof, Glenn and I crawled up the stairs and put a trash can under the hole, to catch the water. Then we crawled back down.'' He made crawling motions with his arms.
They talked about how the rivers were turning black from spilled sewage, and they talked about the loss of all the trees in the yard, the destruction of the woods across the way, all the inexperienced people who were having to use chain saws. Many people were getting injured; one man had died. ''But the man that lives behind us he's found his calling,'' my mother said. ''He loves his chain saw more than Jason does.''
''Daddy's car got harpooned first,'' Samm said. ''Then it got flattened.'' ''I'll tell you this,'' my mother said, ''I never want to see another damn pine branch Christmas decoration in my life.''
They discussed the storm as if it had an anatomy. ''When we passed through the wall of the eye,'' Glenn said, ''and those thunder cells around it began to explode that's when all the trees were popping. Inside the eye it was pitch black, and we went outside, and everyone was calling down the street, You all right? I've got a tree through my roof. Everybody on this street had trees on the roof.''
''Did we tell you about the sheet lightning?'' Samm said. ''The whole sky would light up this powder blue color for maybe 10 seconds, and you could see everything, and then you couldn't see anything again. The glass in the windows was bulging out. You could feel the wind sucking by the door. I was afraid the house might explode.''
Some houses did, in fact, explode. An apartment in my mother's building had blown outward, moving the bathroom into the hallway.
The coffee we were drinking tasted terrible. Two weeks after the storm the water in Charleston was safe but nearly undrinkable: pine in the water supply from the downed trees had made it bitter, medicinal.
Glenn, who is a State Senator, mourned the loss of the roof of The Confederate Museum, down at The City Market. ''The Secession flag was lying in the water,'' he said. Then he remembered his humor. ''They had a lock of Robert E. Lee's hair, too. I guess it got washed.''
''I'll tell you this,'' Samm said. ''We're 13 miles from the water, and somebody had to stay and take care of the house. It seemed like the right decision. But when Charlie Hall broke down delivering the weather report, I thought, 'Maybe we've made a mistake.' ''
SOUTHERNERS LIKE to tell a story not quite the way it happened, but the way it should be remembered, and over the next few days I would hear that Charlie Hall had sobbed on the air, that he had thrown his papers on the floor, that he had turned to the news director and said, ''Goodbye, Bill.'' At the time I visited, the station could not find the videotape, and Charlie has been unable to find the paper containing his ''last words.'' ''He knew the winds were over 200 miles an hour,'' several people told me quite seriously, ''but he didn't want to say so.''
Hurricane Hugo was not a 15-second encounter with death, as in the San Francisco earthquake, nor was it a surprise, other than in degree. Hugo was prepared for, faced and endured, and it lasted for many hours. Every person I talked to admitted wondering, at some moment, whether he or she was going to die.
After any near-death experence there is the euphoria of being alive. For Charleston, this phase lasted several days. Then, slowly, the reality of all the destruction settled in. It was, my friend Ross said, like being in a terrible automobile accident. First you think, 'Hey, I'm alive,' and then you notice your arms and legs are broken.
A similar process took place in me. I spent a day walking around Charleston, another out at Sullivan's Island and the Isle of Palms, and I began to cry. I smiled a lot and talked with people and took lots of notes, but in the privacy of my rented car, I often seemed to be crying.
On The Battery, downtown, a postcard scene of Charleston's pride, the bricks were torn off the fronts of some houses, the roofs off others. The houses had been flooded, not just with salt water, but with slimy ''pluff'' mud. A woman showed me the ceiling light fixtures in her living room, corroded from salt. Her car had just died from salt damage. ''We are so lucky,'' she said sadly.
On Sullivan's Island I talked with a man whose 1882 Victorian beach house was off its stilts, lying crushed nearby. His eyes burned with a kind of shame. ''Don't use my name, Miss,'' he said, ''and please don't take any pictures.'' I asked if this was a summer house or his regular place of residence. ''Summer house,'' he said, staring at the ground. ''But my other house is wrecked, too.''
I found a house I had lived in once, a brick house on the front beach. It was torn nearly in half. An octagonal house I'd also lived in remained intact, but now the house that had been across the street was resting right against it.
On the Isle of Palms I tried to find my friend Charleen's place, but the roads were too torn up for me to recognize anything. Arbitrarily I chose a lane to the front beach, and there I met Helen Ray.
Helen Ray was walking around the lot where her house had been, trying to salvage something. An attractive older lady with blunt-cut white hair, she was wearing rubber boots and gloves, and placing carefully, on a piece of concrete, her finds: a nickel, a bottle of artichoke hearts, an unbroken plate from a set of eight. In the trunk of her station wagon was an antique chest she'd found several blocks away. Her Mercedes sedan was lying crushed, upside down against a tree. ''It was garaged,'' she said, pointing to a shingled roof nestled among two houses off their stilts farther back from the water. ''That's the roof of my garage over there.''
Helen Ray did not even have the satisfaction of having survived Hugo; she was in Maine when the storm hit. Her husband, a Navy chaplain, had died the year before, and Helen had lost a lifetime of their carefully collected treasures. She had also lost all her papers, having taken them out of the safe-deposit box shortly before the storm. ''I'm not dealing with this well at all,'' she said lightly.
Her house, designed by an architect, had been built in 1971. She showed me the metal hulk that had been her spiral staircase, the black hole where her goldfish pond had been, the bright patch of grass that had been her walled-in garden. ''It was nice here,'' she said. ''We had the sunrise over there, and the sunset over there.''
Another woman drove up to the empty lot to visit her. This woman was maybe 10 years younger and had short, frosted hair. ''We lost our house too,'' she said, ''but I wanted to see how you're doing.''
''I'm not dealing with this well at all,'' Helen Ray said.
''I'm doing O.K.,'' the woman said, ''except when I find a picture of the children, or something.''
THE LAST DAY I WAS in Charleston, I was supposed to visit one of the razed forests and then ride up to McClellanville. But it was raining, and, anyway, I didn't have the heart. Instead I went to my brother's business, near the airport, and waited for a plane.
It was raining through the corner of the roof of my brother's office building. Water was gushing down the stairs. His secretary kept saying, ''Charlie, we've got to do something about this.'' ''Wilma,'' he said, ''what do you expect me to do?''
My brother has chosen to live with his inheritance in a way that I have not. The business he owns belonged to our dead father. He plays golf, like our father.
Charlie is a tall, heavyset man with sweet, guarded eyes. He told me how, during the eye of the hurricane, he'd gone out of his house barefooted and nearly stepped on a raw wire. So he went back inside and got his shoes.
''Charlie, what good did you think your shoes would do?''
''I don't know.'' He said he'd tried to get through the branches of the tree across his car to see how bad the damage was. ''It was a good thing I couldn't get to it, because there was a huge wasp nest right where I was trying to crawl, and if I'd gotten there I've had been killed. It would have been the most ignominous death of the hurricane.''
Charlie had bought a generator, to keep his house powered during the storm. He'd thought the electricity would be off for maybe a day. It was off at his house for two weeks. He rested his chin in his hands and smiled. ''It's kind of depressing, you know? You wake up every day and it just hasn't gone away.''
Charlie's son, Hayes, who is 12, was there with us, in the raining office. ''You should see what I've collected,'' Hayes said. ''I've got a transformer, a street light, two street signs. I tried to get a stop sign, but I haven't been able to find one.''
I was lighting one cigarette off of another. ''What are you going to do with all that stuff, Hayes?''
He shrugged happily. ''I guess I'll show it to my children.''
I SURVIVED HUGO, MANY T-shirts in Charleston say, and, on the plane back to Connecticut, I was thinking how someday the wearers can tell their grandchildren of the time the biggest hurricane came, and the forests blew down like weeds. They can recount how the water was bitter and the rivers ran black and the sky turned powdery blue at midnight. They can say how the weatherman cried.
Where there is destruction there is also the story of destructon. The story of destruction requires narrators, requires survival. For now, Charlestonians are just hurting and smiling and going on. Someday, they insist, the Lowcountry will look almost like it used to.

LOOKING FOR AMERICA ON THE NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE
By Angus Kress Gillespie and Michael Aaron Rockland.
Illustrated by Ruth Strohl-Palmer.
219 pp. New Brunswick, N.J.:
Rutgers University Press.
$18.95.
There is something at once menacing and magnetic about the New Jersey Turnpike. Running through the heart of our most industrialized, most motorized, most suburbanized state, it is the ultimate American highway, the embodiment of the utilitarian ideal, a symbol of all our economic triumphs and human failures. Its power, efficiency and weird toxic beauty have inspired novelists, poets, painters and rock-and-rollers - not to mention the smirking aficionados of the New Jersey Joke. Although others might wince at the thought, the turnpike is, for many, an icon like the Brooklyn Bridge. 
One approaches a scholarly study of the New Jersey Turnpike with a mixture of curiosity and caution, on guard against everything from cultural snobbery to sentimental slumming. Happily, ''Looking for America on the New Jersey Turnpike'' by Angus Kress Gillespie and Michael Aaron Rockland steers clear of any number of academic vices and turns out to be a lively, informative, thoroughly entertaining examination of this most American of highways.
Mr. Gillespie and Mr. Rockland, both members of the American studies department at Rutgers University, have researched the turnpike from a number of angles, describing the insistently bottom-line spirit in which, in 1947, it was conceived, recounting the history of its construction and official opening in 1951, investigating its economic, environmental and psychological impact and, finally, speculating about its future. They explain in comic detail the paramilitary mentality of the Turnpike Authority, examine the sometimes corrupt workings of the turnpike's enormously profitable financial machine and explore its status as a semiautonomous political entity. Drawing on interviews with turnpike administrators, state troopers, toll collectors, tow truck drivers, rest area employees and commuters, Mr. Gillespie and Mr. Rockland provide a vivid, authentic and often humorous picture of life withinJU this otherworldly corridor.
In a particularly entertaining chapter titled ''Rest Area Culture,'' the authors explore that most anonymous of American meeting places. They visit the Walt Whitman Rest Area near Philadelphia in search of an employee who knows who Whitman was - in vain. They examine the purposefully bland rest area environment in its seldom-discussed function as sexual trysting ground: a place that has been the site of everything from back-seat student romances to alleged prostitution rings operating out of the snack bars. Unfortunately, Mr. Gillespie and Mr. Rockland rely mostly on vague hearsay reports or rather tame interviews to flesh out their vision of the turnpike's secret eroticism.
Anyone who has been struck by the ferocious beauty of the turnpike's northern reaches will be interested in the authors' discussion of the highway's role in art and esthetics. (This discussion is somewhat undercut by a brief lapse into self-indulgent silliness, in which they attempt to dramatize the turnpike's visual and olfactory impact by creating a fictional family of Virginia tourists headed by a father with the generic hick name of Jim Bob.) Much as we might recoil from its frenzied harshness, the turnpike stands as the purest expression of a distinctly American industrial esthetic, which finds articulation through artists as diverse as Allen Ginsberg and Bruce Springsteen. At the same time, the authors add, the bleakness and monotony of the road suggest there might be limits to the idea that beauty always results when form follows function.
In its examination of both the glory and the squalor of its subject, ''Looking for America on the New Jersey Turnpike'' remains admirably fair-minded. Nowhere do Mr. Gillespie and Mr. Rockland play down the harm that the road has done to countless communities (like Elizabeth, forced to endure a wall dividing the city into two sections); nowhere do they gloss over the stories of official corruption, administrative arrogance and police brutality; nowhere do they become apologists for dreariness and tedium. Yet their admiration - even affection - for this megahighway, coexisting with their dismay over its destructiveness, is evident throughout, and Mr. Gillespie and Mr. Rockland deserve recognition for writing an original and substantial work.

 BODY:

PRICING THE PRICELESS
Art, Artists, and Economics.
By William D. Grampp.
290 pp. New York:
Basic Books. $19.95.
Don't be fooled by the innocuous title of William D. Grampp's book. It attempts to make an economic analysis of the visual arts, and from there, a case for abolition of government support for them. His grounds - are you ready? - are that such support is not cost-effective and nobody really wants it, anyway. The case has been made before, by such conservative thinkers as the political scientist Edward C. Banfield, who holds that Federal support of the arts is not constitutionally justified and doesn't work in practice; that is, it does nothing to enhance the esthetic experience. 
But ''Pricing the Priceless'' is anchored in economics. To be sure, art has always been allied with money; but to measure even esthetic transactions in monetary terms is like sticking pins in butterflies. A professor emeritus of economics at the University of Illinois and an advocate of unregulated markets, Mr. Grampp takes what are not exactly large-minded views: that painters, despite the lofty ideals they profess, are basically businessmen with a product to sell; that the arts should support themselves on a laissez-faire basis; that the Government misguidedly subsidizes such activities as art to ''protect people from the market,'' that is, to ''provide them with a higher income than they could earn there.''
In his discussions of various sectors of the art economy, he is perhaps most convincing when he chides museums for not acknowledging their collections as capital, that is, not thinking in terms of the interest income that would be received if the capital were invested in another form. By not doing so, he suggests, museums encourage the unbridled growth of their holdings, much of which languishes in storage. The implication is that more staff, better scholarship, more intensive research activities and so forth might flourish with the divestiture of swollen inventories. ''The effect . . . of an overstated gain or an understated loss is to induce the organization to do more than it efficiently can do,'' he writes. One serious consequence of museums' phenomenal growth, he points out, is that as they expand, they devote more of their space to administrative rather than exhibition purposes.
But generally, Mr. Grampp's points are tediously argued and insufficiently supported. We eventually arrive at the clincher, that it is not really productive for government to support the visual arts. Tilting at those who say it is, he attempts to dismantle their arguments premise by premise. There is no evidence, for example, to show that subsidizing art because it is a public good ''would yield as much benefit as there would be in subsidizing something else or nothing at all.'' He also gives short shrift to the ''positive externalities'' of art - for example that it makes communities attractive to live in and improves the cultural climate. ''To say that art diminishes the coarse fibres of human nature may be true, or may not,'' he writes, ''but is no guide to how to spend the public's money.''
And he rejects the idea of art as a ''merit good,'' that is, as something that should be given by the Government or other patrons to people who do not know enough to want it even though they can afford it. As Mr. Grampp sees it, ''if art is actually to the benefit of people they will themselves acquire a taste for it.''
Had enough? That the art world, like many other worlds, is not economically tidy and efficient most of us are prepared to acknowledge. We will even agree that some people - mainly those who buy cheap and sell dear - make inordinate profits from it while many of those who create art cannot live by their income. But in this country the battle for public support of the visual arts - and what a pittance it is, compared with the level of funding in Europe! - has been won many times in Congress, beginning with the birth of the National Endowment for the Arts in 1965. While Mr. Grampp believes that Congress has more of a mandate from the arts lobby than from the people, he overlooks the fact that most of the Endowment's grants are given on a collaborative basis; that is, funds from Washington must be locally matched, which hardly supports the thesis that at the grass roots no one cares. NOR, although he would like to abolish public funding for the arts, does Mr. Grampp say how he would do it. Would he kill the Endowment outright, as Ronald Reagan wanted to do when he took office, and as some conservative Congressmen want to do today? Would he have the Federal or local governments do away with educational funding that helps broaden the exposure of school children to art? Would he discourage grants to promising artists? Cancel funding for conservation of major works? As difficult as it was to initiate government support for the arts, it would not be easy to do away with it, and Mr. Grampp offers no program.
But this book has made a timely appearance. Even though it does not touch on the current furor over the Endowment's support of certain artworks held to be ''obscene'' and irreligious by conservative Congressmen, it gives aid and comfort to their views.

HEADLINE: About Cars;
Luxury Car Adds Trimmings

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
There is much truth in the notion that it is folly to tamper with success, and the Ford Motor Company's Lincoln division has made capital of this idea with its Town Car sedan.
For nearly a decade, the Town Car has been the epitome of American luxury: big, square-cornered, pillow-soft. During that time, luxury-car sales have grown 62 percent, compared with a 14 percent increase for cars in general, and Lincoln has billowed along on the crest.
Now, though, it is time for a change, in the opinion of Ross Roberts, the Texan who heads Lincoln-Mercury. He was in New York recently, and he talked about the car, the philosophy behind it, and the people who buy it. 
The 1990 model is bigger, rounder, more aerodynamic. It is more fuel-efficient and more hushed than its formerly already silent self. But it will make big noise on the country-club scene.
''We had to change it,'' Roberts said. ''We needed the aerodynamics. And we needed to move. The old car hadn't been changed much since we introduced it in 1980. And I think people are ready.''
The new Town Car is indeed sleeker than its predecessor, with a coefficient of drag of only .36, down from .46 last year. That translates into smoother airflow, with less wind noise, and better economy. And Roberts said more consumer clinics had been held on this car than on any other Ford product but the Taurus.
''We were nervous,'' he said. ''But the people at the clinics gave us good marks. And the dealers loved it.''
That may be so, but a bit of time behind the wheel of a metallic-gray test car garnered opinion that was both pro and con, and one driver took the trouble to holler across a Manhattan street that he had been waiting a long time for a look, and would now buy something else.
Indeed, a lot of people have had to wait for a look at the Town Car. That is because the cars are sitting by the thousands in parking lots around Detroit, waiting to be retrofitted with the fluted plastic side moldings that dress up the lower body and provide protection from flying gravel and other road hazards.
''Our supplier wasn't happy with the quality of the moldings as they were produced,'' Roberts said, ''and we decided we didn't want any cars to go out before they were right. It's going to take awhile.''
Despite the aero look, the 1990 model does bear a resemblance to its older kin, and the ''round Town Car'' is a reasonably conservative exercise in modern styling. But doors now wrap into the roof, and the softer look of the all-new sheet metal is complemented by flush glass.
There are opera windows in the rear pillars, and the six-passenger sedan is trimmed with bright metal. The powertrain remains conventional, too, with a 5-liter V8 driving the rear wheels.
All of that is to the good, given the Lincoln's conservative clientele. Roberts says the traditional customer's median age is 62, and 38 percent of those buyers are retired. Median income is $60,000, and one in five customers earns $100,000 a year or more.
A paper put out by Ford notes that the customers are far different from those who buy Lincoln's two other products, the sportier Mark VII coupe and the Continental sedan. The paper observes that Town Car buyers ''are less willing than Mark VII or Continental buyers to acknowledge prestige as a purchase motivation and attach less importance to technical innovations.''
The latter is also the reason given by the company for making antilock brakes an option, no matter whether the car is the basic model, the Signature version or the top-of-the-line Cartier. And it is probably just coincidental fallout for the accountants that a buyer who wants the safety afforded by ABS has to pay $936 extra.
Other options are few, as they should be on a car with a price ranging from $27,986 to $32,809, but they include such things as an electrically heated windshield and a locking differential to make the going better on snow and ice.
Whatever the weather, the car is a pleasure, particularly on the interstates. It is a cocoon that isolates the occupants from the reality out there, and the seating is all that could be asked, with more front and rear shoulder room than last year's car, and more knee room in back. Both driver and front-seat passenger have air bags for protection, should the unthinkable occur.
There is an electronic instrument cluster, and the car is easy to drive, although the four-speed automatic transmission might be smoother in its shifts.
The engine puts out 150 horsepower (160 in the Cartier, which has standard dual exhausts). That would seem insufficient in a 4,025-pound automobile. Oddly, though, you don't notice any lack of power, and the car performs effortlessly.
In fact, it feels very much like an American car of old - exactly what the buyers want.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES: Brighton Beach;
A Revised Proposal for the Baths Site

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
A CONTROVERSY over land use has taken a new turn in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn. Its roots are in history but the stakes are a community's future.
Back in 1955, the late Brooklyn builder Alexander Muss took a long-term lease on 21 acres facing the boardwalk in Brighton Beach as a choice location for development of high-rise oceanfront housing over the next five or six years.
He proceeded to use six acres on the eastern edge of the property to build two tall rental buildings, Seacoast Towers A and B, with 591 apartments, in the grace period before the city's 1961 rezoning took effect. The buildings conformed to pre-1961 zoning. They rented slowly in the competitive housing market of the time, however, and Mr. Muss deferred his housing plans. 
With the land came a successful business. The Brighton Beach Baths, as it was then known, had been operating on the property since 1919. Alexander Muss & Sons put in steam rooms and hot showers, added an 18-hole miniature golf course and three tennis courts, resurfaced 22 paddleball courts and continued to operate what by then had become the city's largest remaining private beach club. Later the property was renamed the Brighton Beach Bath and Racquet Club.
On the housing side, the developer's final project in New York City was a Manhattan co-op, 733 Park Avenue, in the early 70's. Then operations shifted to Florida.
NOW Mr. Muss's son, Stephen, owner of the Fountainbleau Hilton and the 800-unit Seacoast Towers in Miami Beach, wants to build in Brooklyn again. Having acquired title to the Baths property in 1980, he advanced a plan developed by the architectural firm of Beyer Blinder Belle a year ago to replace the beach club with 2,000 units of housing in six buildings called Brighton by the Sea. It would have meant 2.9 million square feet of new construction in two towers of 44 stories, two of 34 stories and two of 24 stories, plus ancillary facilities, on 15 acres.
By the time it had reached the City Planning Commission in its journey through the land-use review process it had been endorsed by Community Board 13 but battered as an overly dense inappropriate ''Florida-style'' development by an ad-hoc Committee to Preserve Brighton Beach and Manhattan Beach. Mayor Edward I. Koch, as well, had unfavorable words for it during the recent primary campaign.
In the end, Muss decided to withdraw the proposal and hired another architect, Costas A. Kondylis, to redesign the project. The revisions required a new environmental impact study, which was certified as complete this month, triggering the public six-month land-use review.
It is among the last of the major land-use proposals that is likely to be acted upon by the Board of Estimate before it closes for business next summer under the revised City Charter approved on Election Day. Projects that are certified for public review before the end of February are expected to complete the six-month ''old'' uniform land-use review process before a new Planning Commission and the City Council take over.
Brighton by the Sea, in its revised form, has been scaled down 27 percent, to 2.1 million square feet of construction on 15 acres. The residential component has 1,730 apartments in five buildings - one of 29 stories, two of 25 stories and two of 23 stories. There is also an 1,800-car parking garage, 82,000 square feet of commercial space - principally a 46,000-square-foot health club - and 19,000 square feet of medical offices. Development would proceed in phases, probably over not less than five years.
Looked at purely in local terms, the impact of Brighton by the Sea would be powerful. Assuming it were financed, built and successfully sold as a pure market-rate development, it would bring a large new population of higher-income occupants to oceanfront high-rises in Brighton Beach.
That would represent a remarkable turnaround for an area heavy with high-density prewar rental buildings that nearly fell collectively into city ownership during the dark housing days of the 70's. They owe their revival principally to the influx of Russian immigrants.
AN argument can be made that a new market-rate development - attracting families with incomes of perhaps $50,000 to $80,000 - offers the best long-term hope of sustaining that revival. On the other hand, if sales are weak for the first building, most of the site might languish vacant for years. The sales market for large-scale multifamily new housing in the location is largely untested.
The only recent experience has been provided by Seabreeze Plaza at 3111 Ocean Parkway, on a 35,000-square-foot beachfront site formerly occupied by Club 21. It is a 116-unit, 15-story building that was built last year and is almost 90 percent sold at average prices of $250 a square foot, said one of the owners, David Eshaghian. It benefited from the fact that there has been so little new beachfront development, he said.
To critics, the Muss plan is unacceptable on other grounds. The buildings seem out of context with their environment, a threat to the quality of life in the neighborhood and an abuse of zoning standards. ''It was too tall and too dense before, and it's too tall and too dense still,'' said Judith Baron, president of the Committee to Preserve Brighton Beach and Manhattan Beach, which primarily represents homeowners in the area.
The opponents also say that 1,730 new households would strain capacity at Coney Island Hospital; overload the already congested subway service on the D and Q lines during rush hours, and cause excessive traffic congestion. And they cite the Interstate Sanitation Commission for backing their claim that the Coney Island sewer treatment plant is already at or near capacity.
NEVERTHELESS, it is questionable whether the Baths site is appropriately zoned. Large private beach clubs on waterfront land are fading out as they grow economically marginal. On the East River in the Bronx, both the Shorehaven and Castle Hill beach clubs closed in the 80's, and a low-rise housing development is in construction at the Shorehaven site, on Clason's Point.
The zoning planners of the late 50's gave the Brighton Beach Baths land little elbow room for adaptation over time when they placed it in a category called C-3, however. This is designed mainly for boating-related waterfront activities with adjacent low-density residential use. The Baths property, with three swimming pools, has no ocean frontage and no opportunity for boat docking. Patrons reach the public beach by crossing the boardwalk.
The long-time manager of the Baths, Hyman Cohen, a Muss vice president, says that membership has dropped steadily in the 80's. Lack of parking space is one reason, he says. Four years ago he approached the Metropolitan Transportation Authority about allowing parking for 300 cars below the Brighton Beach elevated line, near the front door of the Baths.
The community board voted it down, but in retrospect he is not disappointed, he said. Membership has dropped to 2,000 from from 5,000 in 1981, despite a membership campaign in the mid-80's, he said, and he doubts now that even with parking facilities it would stage a comeback. In the 60's there were 8,000 members. The civically active Mr. Cohen has himself become a target of foes of the Muss plan, who charge that cronyism is advancing it. He was a member of School Board 21 for 11 years until his resignation under fire in November 1988, and is also a member of Community Board 13, though he has ''recused'' himself from the consideration of the Muss rezoning application. Nevertheless, teachers have complained that school district officials pressured them to support Brighton by the Sea and to write letters to the Planning Commission on school time to urge approval of the project. Mr. Cohen denies that he ever sought their support.
His opponents note that under C-3 zoning about 300 units of low-rise two- and three-story houses could be built. ''But Muss is a high-rise builder and he doesn't want to do houses,'' said Irwin Fruchtman, a former city Buildings Commissioner who is a director of the Committee to Preserve Brighton Beach and Manhattan Beach.
''I couldn't emotionally use the land for 300 units of low-rise housing,'' Mr. Muss conceded.
Can any appropriate alternative ''water-related recreational uses'' be developed on the Baths site? To build a modern 50,000-square-foot facility with a pool would probably cost about $6 million, according to Marc Sferrazza, vice president of Eastern Athletic Clubs, which operates health clubs at the St. George co-op in Brooklyn Heights and elsewhere. It would need about 5,000 members a year to break even, and perhaps 80 percent of them would have to live within walking distance.
MR. SFERRAZZA, who visited the Baths site at the request of the opposition committee, said he had not done a close enough study of Brighton Beach to know whether a new facility was a reasonable proposition there.
In the end, the use category provided by the 1961 zoning looks about as arbitrary as the manufacturing use proscribed for so much Manhattan land, which is too costly ever to be reused for modern, competitive manufacturing, warehouse or distribution facilities.
For planners to adjust without seeming arbitrary themselves, a master-plan overview is desirable. Gradually, New York City is developing this for its waterfront. But consideration of new zoning for a site as critical as the Muss tract in Brighton Beach need not await completion of a master plan. By carefully weighing community resources and needs, the commission should be able to determine an appropriate use for the tract.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: Investing Abroad;
American Developers Are Now Looking To Europe, East and West, for Opportunity

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH the recent attention focused on Japanese and European real estate investment in the United States has tended to obscure the parallel activities of Americans overseas, the internationalization of property ownership and development is becoming a two-way street.
So far, involvement by American development companies abroad is only a trickle compared to the flood of foreign activity here. But the numbers, while small, are growing, spurred, some developers say, by diminishing development opportunities in major commerical centers like New York, Los Angeles and Dallas and the growing economies of Spain, Italy and West Germany.
Department of Commerce statistics tell the story: In 1988, foreign direct investment in this country represented $328.9 billion. Of that, $31.9 billion was in real estate. Last year, direct American investment abroad was $326.9 billion, with $2.1 billion of the total in real estate. 
But that has begun changing. David S. Solomon, principal in Solomon Equities of New York, which hopes to open an office in London next year, put it this way: ''I feel the same excitement in some European cities now that I felt in New York 10 years ago. For the time being, there are fewer opportunities here, so I think you'll see more of us finding ways of overcoming the obstacles.''
Mr. Solomon, whose projects in New York have included Tower 49, a 600,000-square-foot office building at 12 East 49th Street that was sold to a Japanese concern three years ago, is planning three developments in Europe: a 25-story office tower in Brussels, a 35-story building, also in Brussels, and an 18-story office building in Milan. He said there is a good possibility that the company will be joined in those ventures by a European institutional investment partner, such as an insurance company or a pension fund.
Among the other office projects under way or being planned by real estate developers based in New York are the 70-story, 920,000-square-foot tower being built in Frankfurt by Tishman Speyer Properties in partnership with Citibank and Kajima Corporation, a Japanese construction company, and an office complex that Park Tower Realty is developing in London's financial district with the Greycoat Group, a British real estate company.
The involvement of American companies in foreign real estate projects is not limited to speculative office projects. The ITT Sheraton Corporation and Pan American World Airways recently closed on a deal with the Moscow City Council and Aeroflot, the Soviet airline, that will allow them to open the first American hotel in Moscow. And last year Tishman Realty and Construction Company, which is not connected to Tishman Speyer, formed a joint venture with Aoki Corporation of Japan to sponsor projects in Japan worth about $2 billion. Tishman is the first American construction company to be able to enter the Japanese development arena.
These and other projects are harbingers of the international future of real estate development and investment, industry observers say.
''Just as we saw during the 70's and 80's an internationalization of the financial markets,'' said Michael J. Bamber, chief executive officer of European operations for Richard Ellis International, an international property consulting and brokerage company based in London, ''real estate has been moving toward globalization. Now more Americans are joining in.''
Richard Ellis, a company formed in 1773 that now has 30 offices in 18 countries, earlier this year merged with the Lexington Company of New York and reopened an office in New York as part of its strategy for exploiting this trend. The new company will retain the Richard Ellis name and its offices in Chicago, Washington and Minneapolis.
WHILE some American developers say the plan of the European Economic Community to remove existing bureaucratic, legal and trade barriers among 12 member countries at the end of 1992 was not the catalyst for their interest in Europe, they believe the harmonization of the economy there will draw more American developers overseas.
From a practical standpoint, the plan is expected to make development easier and less costly when monetary exchange controls and foreign investment restrictions are removed and specifications for design and construction are standardized.
''But what is even more significant,'' said Mr. Bamber, who is based in Brussels, and who was in New York earlier this month to speak at a conference on worldwide property investment, ''is that the E.E.C. represents by far the world's largest trading partner. Together, the 12 participating countries represent a marketplace of 320 million consumers. That is nearly as much as the United States and Japan combined.''
Jerry Speyer, president of Tishman Speyer, said that while he expects the barrier-free market in Europe to accelerate growth and lower the cost of doing business there, his company is not in Europe because of it.
''We have been exploring opportunites in Europe for some time,'' he said, ' as part of a long-term strategy. We've also turned our attention toward the development of housing for America's aging population and we've started acquiring existing commercial properties like 1301 Avenue of the Americas, the former J.C. Penney Building.''
Although Mr. Speyer said the company will continue to seek other opportunities in Europe, it will concentrate for the time being on finishing its 850-foot tower in Frankfurt, which will be the tallest office building in Europe. Mr. Speyer expects to complete the tower, designed by Helmut Jahn of the Chicago architectural firm of Murphy/Jahn, by the end of 1990, and he and his partners will be looking to both German and multinational service companies as tenants.
''We've been looking around in several countries for the past few years,'' said Veronica Hackett, executive vice president of Park Tower Realty. ''The St. Paul's project in London had the ingredients we were looking for. It is a very visible site and it is important in the financial district from both a design as well as an economic point of view.''
Park Tower and Greycoat, which have a 242-year lease with the Church of England, the property's owners, will build on a 4.1-acre site next to St. Paul's Cathedral between Warwick Lane and Newgate Street. The project will be a complex of low-rise buildings to complement the cathedral.
While most American developers have limited their activity to Western Europe, ITT Sheraton is demonstrating that development opportunities exist farther east. It was the first to enter into a management agreement with an Eastern Bloc country with the Sheraton Sofia hotel, which opened in Bulgaria in 1986.
''THERE is a serious lack of good hotels in Eastern Europe,'' said Jerry Morin, a Sheraton senior vice president who is responsible for development in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. ''Now that travel restrictions are coming down, there is a pent-up demand. We have been having discussions with some of the Baltic states and now, with the political atmosphere changing by the day, it is impossible to see where the potential for expansion will end.''
Mr. Morin described Sheraton's 450-room Moscow project as an extensive renovation of an existing six-story building.
''We wanted to go with a new construction project,'' Mr. Morin said. ''But we were not able to get a site in a location that was acceptable to us. So rather than lose the chance to open in Moscow we went with a plan to redevelop an existing building.''
Mr. Morin hopes the $75 million Gorky Street project will be completed in 1992.

HEADLINE: Q and A

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:

Mixed-Use Mortgage
Question: I am trying to purchase a three-story town house in Greenwich Village. The building has a small storefront with a duplex apartment above it. The apartment would be my primary residence and I would relocate my retail business to the store space. I have just begun inquiring about mortgages and I have been steered in the direction of commercial loans. As the apartment would be my only home, I'm hoping to qualify for a home loan at a lower interest rate. Are there any banks that can help me? . . . L. W., Manhattan 
Answer: Maybe. But according to Lavelle Jackson, a princpal in Mortgage One Company, a Manhattan mortgage brokerage and consulting company, very few banks are willing to offer residential mortgages for mixed-use buildings.
''This town house is a borderline case,'' said Mr. Jackson. ''But in general most lenders would feel justified in offering only a commercial mortgage. The potential income from the storefront space would make the building an income-producing property.''
Mr. Jackson said that currently interest rates on commercial loans are generally two or three points above those for residential mortgages. It might be worth your time to continue making calls to banks or to find a mortgage broker; a broker will probably charge a fee, usually 1 percent of the loan value. In some cases, banks pay the brokerage fees as part of the points.
 
An Earlier Lord & Taylor
Question: The other day driving down Broadway we saw a building I never noticed before. It is on the southwest corner of 20th Street. What can you tell us about it? . . . C. C., Manhattan
Answer: It is the former Lord & Taylor department store, which opened for business there in 1870 as one of the department stores in what is now the Ladies Mile Historic District. According to the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission, which recently granted landmark status to the district, the building is a cast-iron structure done in the Second Empire style. Its architect, James H. Giles, specialized in cast-iron buildings. In 1914, Lord & Taylor moved to its present site on Fifth Avenue between 38th and 39th Streets. The Broadway building now holds the St. Laurie clothing store and a restaurant on the ground floor and commercial and residential lofts above.
 
A Rent Overcharge Claim
Question: I filed a complaint with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal concerning rent overcharges on my stabilized apartment about a year ago. I know there is a long waiting list for this, but is there any way for me to expedite the process? Is preference given to people because of their age? I am 82. . . . C. R., Manhattan
Answer: The agency does not automatically give priority to the elderly, though it would do so in response to a court order or in an emergency.
Unfortunately, even though much of the process has been computerized, according to Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for the agency, it takes an average of two and a half years for a complaint to reach the desk of a rent examiner. Once the examiner starts work, most cases are settled in two or three months. The agency blames a backlog it inherited from the Office of Rent Control and Conciliation and Appeals Board in 1984 and expects that once it is cleared up within the next few months, the entire process should be faster.

HEADLINE: IN THE REGION: Connecticut and Westchester;
A Strategy for Fairfield's Office Vacancies

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
IN the 20-odd years since Fairfield County was initiated into the wonderful world of office buildings, it has taken its lumps for overdeveloping and overpricing. But despite a third-quarter vacancy rate of 21.7 percent, according to Cushman & Wakefield Realtors of Stamford, the market survives.
''I think the confidence is there because it's now a mature market, able to sustain itself from within,'' said Jeffrey Sussman, president of the Louis Dreyfus Property Group in Manhattan.
The survival strategy is to rehabilitate the county's older corporate campuses and office towers, where there is a supermarket of low-priced space. ''By upgrading them we can produce the kind of modern, amenity-rich buildings that you would expect to find downtown in New York,'' Mr. Sussman said. 
When Dreyfus bought the 18-year-old Richardson-Vicks headquarters in Wilton earlier this year, it kept 70,000 square feet of the 220,000-square-foot building for itself and rented the rest to Deloitte-Touche of Manhattan. Dreyfus will seek site plan approval to build another structure, with 300,000 square feet of space, on the 60-acre tract.
Pickwick Plaza, built for the Xerox Corporation in 1974 in Greenwich, was bought by JMB Realty of Chicago four years ago and now, after a major modernization, is fully rented.
This year, Robert Martin, the Westchester developer who has several properties in Connecticut, acquired 2777 Summer Street, a 110,000-square-foot, 21-year-old building in Stamford, for $4.5 million.
Three years ago, Sunbelt Investment of Delray, Fla., bought Union Carbide's 1.2 million-square-foot, seven-year-old complex in Danbury. Union Carbide occupies 80 percent of the space on a leaseback, rents 100,000 square feet to Boehringer-Engelheim, a German pharmaceutical company, and has an additional 150,000 square feet available at $29.50 a foot.
Greenwich Plaza, at the Greenwich railroad station, ''was the first real office building in Connecticut,'' said Paul King, senior vice president at Grubb & Ellis Realty's Stamford office. ''It presents a tremendous image as you get off the train - overlooking Long Island Sound, with access to shops.''
It is also one of a dwindling number of buildings remaining in the hands of the original developer, the Ashforth Real Estate Group of Manhattan, along with some in Stamford built by the Connecticut companies F. D. Rich Company, Collins Development Company and Warwick-Malkin.
Some $4 million will have been spent when upgrading is completed in March on the Plaza's two glass-walled buildings. New lobbies, common areas, heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems, entryways and general repairs to the buildings and connecting outdoor plaza are included. Rents will remain at the current low $30's a square foot.
The project was a source of major controversy when it was proposed in 1969. Many townspeople were furious at the intrusion of a city office building that cut off their view of the Sound from the entire length of Greenwich Avenue, the main street.
THE town had asked for a donation from Ashforth to paint the old railroad station. Instead, it got a 300,000-square-foot office complex containing 30,000 square feet of shops, a movie theater and a brand new station built over the railroad tracks through an air-rights agreement with what is now the New Haven Division of Metro-North Commuter Railroad.
''Lately there has been a decrease in the size of new tenants,'' said Darrell Harvey, executive vice president at Ashforth's Stamford office. ''Businesses that have a lot of clerical and middle-management people go to eastern Fairfield County, where there is more access to cheaper housing. The small executive-intensive firms that can afford Greenwich homes are coming here - financial investment companies and consultants who communicate all over the world without regard to where they are located.''
Joseph Ercolano, vice president of the Southwestern Area Commerce & Industry Association in Stamford, believes that ''as Class B space is renovated up to Class A, it will add to the glut of Class A space.'' He noted that it could discourage ''a steady influx of smaller companies inquiring about 5,000 to 15,000 square feet'' and he predicted it will take up to four years for Stamford's 27 percent vacancy rate to drop to 15 percent.
Third-quarter figures compiled by Cushman & Wakefield Realtors indicate that 227,000 square feet of offices are still under construction in Stamford and 3 million square feet are available out of a total of 15.6 million square feet citywide.
''All the economic uncertainty in New York can only help Fairfield and Westchester,'' said John Goodkind, vice president at the Mendick Realty Company in Manhattan, owner of 12 million square feet of offices in New York and several Fairfield County buildings.
Among them is the 25-year-old structure at 1351 Washington Boulevard, where renovations estimated at $6.5 million are to be completed in February, including a new metallic exterior skin, new lobbies, climate-control systems, a cafeteria, windows on two sides of the building where none existed, and access to a nearby health club. Rents will be around $19.50 a square foot. ''With today's transportation and telecommunications systems, the guy who lives in Stamford, Greenwich or New Canaan doesn't need to waste an hour and a half commuting every day,'' said Mr. Goodkind. '' I think we'll see a tighter market in 16 months.''
Connecticut's first corporate campus, the 600,000-square-foot headquarters that American Can (now Primerica) built in 1970 on 155 acres in northwest Greenwich, was sold in 1986 to a consortium called Greenwich American Limited Partnership. Unable to market the property because the town prohibited leasing it to more than three tenants, the partnership sued the town. The State Supreme Court ruled in favor of the partnership in May.
''We are now negotiating with 100,000-square-foot tenants of Fortune 500 quality,'' said Paul Liles of Manhattan, a partner in the consortium. ''We can fill in with smaller tenants later. Within the Fairfield-Westchester market there is a lot of relocation going on, and we will renovate to suit.''

HEADLINE: Those Stay-Forever Sidewalk Bridges

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
TEN years after falling masonry killed a Barbard College student and inspired a rigorous new law governing the maintenance of building facades in New York City, vast expanses of Manhattan sidewalk have been covered by scaffolding and protective bridges in a surge of facade repairs.
The repairs, applauded by city officials and some civic organizations, are in many cases exceeding those mandated by Local Law 10, adopted in 1980. The law is intended only to insure public safety, requiring the owners of buildings taller than six stories to have their facades professionally inspected every five years, and to repair or remove anything that might fall off.
Now, having had their first detailed inspections in decades -- the first in 1982, the second in 1987 -- many of the city's older buildings are undergoing facade repairs that have more to do with structural quality than pedestrian safety. Windows are being replaced, bricks cleaned, cornices painted and terra-cotta ornaments restored. 
''The law has raised the consciousness of the city,'' said Walter Melvin, the principal in Walter Melvin Architects, a Manhattan firm, which specializes in facade work. ''People are looking up and becoming aware of things on their facades that they never knew existed.''
But while it is welcomed in some quarters, Local Law 10 is also extracting a high cost in esthetics and sidewalk congestion. Some find a grim irony in a law that is beautifying the upper stories of tall buildings but covering so much sidewalk with protective structures that the buildings' facades are hidden from view.
''We can't allow these sidealk bridges to stay up ad infinitum,'' said Charles M. Smith, the city's Commissioner of Buildings, whose department is reponsible for enforcing Local Law 10. He added that the city had been besieged with ''very legitimate complaints'' and was preparing to ''remedy the situation'' with legislative proposals.
Local Law 10 was prompted by the death of Grace Gold, a Barnard freshman who was killed in 1979 by masonry that fell from a Columbia University building at Broadway and 115th Street. Its enforcement gained impetus in 1981, when Mayda Alsace, a 28-year-old Legal Aid Society atttorney was killed by bricks that fell from 66 Court Street, near Livingston Street in downtown Brooklyn. No deaths or serious injuries have occurred since in that fashion, the Buildings Department said.
The scaffolding that is used in repairing facades has in some cases proven more hazardous than falling pieces on the facade. In the most recent case, on Oct. 3, a weight used to keep the scaffolding in place fell to the street from the 17th floor of the same Brooklyn building --66 Court Street -- killing John Dauway, a 48-year-old court officer. Though the sidewalk in front of the building was covered by a protective bridge, the weight bounced off a parapet on the 14th floor and landed in front of 62 Court Street, a neighboring building where no sidewalk bridges had been installed.
THE city now imposes no limit on how long the sidewalk bridges may remain in place. The companies that rent them out provide little economic incentive to perform repairs quickly, and repair decisions have been postponed by many building owners even after the sidewalk structures have gone up.
A result in some neighborhoods is that sidewalks have been covered for years, with little evidence that facade work is nearing completion.
''People on the first floor of our building haven't seen daylight in three years,'' said Malcolm Frouman, the art director at Business Week magazine and a member of the board of a 12-story co-op at 895 West End Avenue at 104th Street that remains surrounded by sidewalk bridges.
The building's problem is not unusual. After the bridges were erected for a minor facade repair in early 1986 more serious problems were found and the larger repairs were repeatedly delayed. With the bridges in place, the co-op board consulted architects and engineers, debated how to proceed and settled on a construction program in which damaged terra-cotta details on the facade are being replaced with ornately cast concrete, and other restoration work is being done the goes beyond the requirements of the law.
Mr. Smith said he had prepared a recommendation to the City Council to enact technical changes in Buildings Department procedures. If approved, the changes would allow the department to force the removal of some sidewalk bridges, but would not set a time limit in all cases.
Under current policy, property owners performing work required by Local Law 10 are granted a building notice by the city that lets them erect sidewalk bridges. The notice expires in 12 months, but is easily renewed. Problems in the facade that are deemed to pose an immediate hazard must be corrected within 30 days, or a maximum of 90 days if an extension is granted by the city.
But many problems are not considered urgent and property owners can take years to have the work done. When the owners also elect to combine Local Law 10 repairs with other facade improvements, their work schedules are stretched out even further, and the sidewalk bridges usually remain standing.
Another factor is that fees for the sidewalk bridges, which are rented out by more than a dozen New York City companies, sometimes encourage owners to keep them up a long time. The fees are high when the bridges are put up and when they are removed, but relatively low in the interim when they are left standing for months or years.
''Once a bridge is up, you want to make sure it stays up until every bit of work is done,'' said Richard Layman, director of construction for Crest Management, which has had a sidewalk bridge in front of 295 Columbus Avenue on a congested corner of 74th Street for more than two years.
Work on Crest's building, which originally was to have been confined to fixing a loose parapet, has since been slowed down because the company wants to replace its windows. And since it is in one of the city's historic districts, the design of the windows must be reviewed by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, where an application is pending.
Mr. Layman said his company paid $20,000 to have the bridges installed and the first three months rent in 1987. Since then, monthly payments have been reduced to $700. To have the bridges removed, he said, will cost more than $10,000.
Mr. Smith said the fee structure encourages property owners to delay repairs. He added that the many sidewalk bridges put up under the law, combined with those required at dozens of new construction sites, had covered more of the city's sidewalk space than at any time in memory.
The problems are more than esthetic. Around Times Square and elsewhere in West Midtown, awash in new construction and facade repairs, homeless people seek shelter, and drug addicts and street criminals lurk in the dank half light of the sidewalk structures.
SMALL merchants have been particularly affected because the sidewalk structures hide their signs, cast their display windows into shadow and create a menacing environment on the sidewalk that discourages shoppers.
''You hear horror stories,'' said Fran Leepers, owner of Little Leepers, a children's clothing store at 104th Street and Broadway, where a sidewalk bridge was being removed early this month.
Although the bridge was up less than a month in front of her store, she said other merchants had been robbed, litter had been strewn in front of their doors and a business had declined severely as their sidewalks were covered for months or years.
Mr. Smith said his proposal to the City Council is to require property owners seeking to renew their building notices - allowing them to keep their sidewalk bridges up more than a year - to submit an engineer's report on what work had been completed and a timetable for the remaining repairs. If the repairs are not completed by the end of the second year a sidewalk bridge is in place, property owners can be fined $250 a month under the proposal.
Some critics say Local Law 10 is severely flawed because its emphasis is narrowly confined to public safety and it gives many property owners the option of tearing off balconies, cornices, decorative garlands and other architectural details instead of having them restored and secured.
The potential implications became clear soon after the first round of inspections required by the law in 1982, when the owners of the Mayflower Hotel on Central Park West at 61st Street had its ornate, 60-year-old facade stripped of every detail. The work sparked a storm of protest from architects and preservationist groups.
Less dramatic changes in old facades have been widespread. The New York Landmarks Conservancy, a preservation group, estimated that the cornices and balustrades were removed from 10 percent of the buildings covered by the law on the Upper West Side between 72d and 96th Streets.
Still, even critics of the law say facade stripping is less prevalent than some had feared it would be when the law was passed in 1980. In part, they say, the public outcry directed at the Mayflower and the work done on some other buildings earlier in the decade has had an influence. More importantly, experts say, nearly a decade of experience with the law has made architects, engineers and property owners more aware of the value of details on their facades, which sometimes may appear to be only ornamental but have an important role in keeping moisture away from windows or performing other structural functions.
''Even though we've lost a lot of cornices and ornamental work, I am glad the law is in place,'' said Laurie Beckelman, executive director of the Landmarks Conservancy. ''People are becoming much more informed about their facades.''
The most ambitious facade work required under the law is being performed by the city itself on the Municipal Building, a richly detailed 80-year-old structure across from City Hall in lower Manhattan. The mandatory 1987 inspection found severe rusting of the steel structural beams supporting the building's facade, chunks ready to fall from its cornices and other problems.
The building has been all but hidden behind a sheath of scaffolding since late 1988. Work on the facade, budgeted at $39 million, is not expected to be completed until 1992.
Experts say one of the problems of Local Law 10 is that it created a boom in demand for the services of architects, engineers, masons, bricklayers, terra cotta crafts people and others who specialize in facade work. One result is that it has attracted companies with little experience into the business.
The law also has forced property owners and cooperative boards to make difficult decisions about the work to be performed, often with conflicting advice from different specialists.
''It is like getting bad news from the doctor,'' said Stephen E. v. Gottlieb, an architect and professor of preservation at Columbia University. ''People want a second opinion.'' The second opinion sometimes does little good, he said, because architects and engineers often recommend more extensive repairs than are necessary and ''somebody who isn't sure what they are doing is going to write a report to cover themselves.''
One co-op that encountered many frustrations is 450 West End Avenue, at 82d Street, where a sidewalk bridge was removed late in 1988 after being up more than two years. ''This has been a horrendous experience,'' said Alice Belgray, president of the co-op's board.
She said most of the problems resulted from delays or mistakes by Summit Waterproofing & Restoration Corporation of Long Island City, Queens, which has done work on many Manhattan buildings. Mrs. Belgray said the company's workers applied mortar improperly between bricks and had to correct their mistake, clogged up drainage holes in the lintels above the building's windows and at one point forced a broomstick, which they were using to unclog a drain, through the ceiling of a lower-floor apartment.
''If this building had a personality, it would have been moaning and groaning and saying what are these people doing to me,'' Mrs. Belgray said.
BRUCE WEISINGER, vice president of Summit, who said the company had been waterproofing New York City buildings for 15 years, acknowledged that there had been heated disagreements at 450 West End Avenue. Nonetheless, he said the company had corrected all mistakes it had made at the building and in the process lost money.
''We lost our shirt on this building,'' he said, adding that ''the question shouldn't be whether a contractor is perfect - it should be whether he comes back and repairs his mistakes.''
Mr. Melvin, the architect, said disputes involving building owners, architects, engineers and contractors have been widespread, and might have been expected because so much work has been required by the law.
''We are talking about very technical work, cooperative boards that aren't sure what is really required, and a lot of contractors moving into the business without much background or depth,'' he said.
Nonetheless, city officials maintain that the disputes are part of a learning process that is creating safer and better preserved tall buildings across the city.
Although he said the problems created by proliferation of sidewalk bridges had not been anticipated, Mr. Smith said the principal intent of Local Law 10 - protecting pedestrians from hazardous facades - has been accomplished.
An analysis of inspections by his department found that in the second round of inspections, 557 buildings reported facade problems that posed an immediate hazard; of those, 446 have finished corrective work and are deemed safe and 111 are being worked on, with the Department of Buildings monitoring the work.
In all, the city has 8,000 buildings tall enough to be covered by the law, the Buildings Department said.
Mr. Smith said he expected the number of hazardous conditions to continue shrinking after the next round of inspections in 1992, and that the greater awareness of the city's facades would continue to inspire improvements that go beyond public safety.
''This law has brought attention to the fact that buildings, like infrastructure, deteriorate,'' he said, ''and we can't just pay attention to the inside.''

HEADLINE: THEATER;
'Stand-Up Tragedy'At Hartford Stage LBy ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
IN its pursuit of eclecticism, Hartford Stage has been a study in extremes of late. Having opened the season with ''The Importance of Being Earnest,'' Oscar Wilde's perfectly escapist Victorian comedy of gentility and absurdity, the theater is now shaking up its subscribers with ''Stand-Up Tragedy,'' a tough and loud dose of contemporary urban reality, replete with street talk, rap music and break dancing.
Not only does the piece, which deals with inner-city education, represent a radical departure even for audiences accustomed to the theater's revisionist interpretations of classics and modern works with controversial themes, but it also marks the first time Hartford Stage is producing a play in association with another major regional playhouse: the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. This year, ''Stand-Up Tragedy'' evolved from workshops in February to a small-scale production at the Taper's second theater, Taper Too, in March, to a main stage production that had its premiere in May. 
During rehearsals in Hartford, where ''Stand-Up Tragedy'' opened on Friday and is to run through Dec. 16, the playwright, Bill Cain, and the director, Ron Link, went on making revisions in script and production. Six of the 10 Hartford actors are holdovers from the California company. A different production of the play is slated for the Arena Stage in Washington this season.
''The Hartford creative staff is building on the work done in Los Angeles,'' said Howard Sherman, Hartford's publicity representative. The work had a fast progression: Mark Lamos, Hartford's artistic director, heard about it on a Public Radio feature one morning. ''After friends from L.A. told us it was the best thing they'd seen in years,'' Mr. Sherman said, ''Mark asked for a script. We were all enthusiastic over it and didn't want it to end there. We're giving it a new life.''
The setting for ''Stand-Up Tragegy'' is a nontraditional fictional school named Trinity. It is modeled on the Nativity Mission Center on Forsythe Street on Manhattan's Lower East Side, where 10 full-time teachers work with a total of 50 students - an extraordinary ratio - from grades 6 through 8. The school operates daily from 7:30 A.M. to 10 P.M. It is run, but not financed, by Jesuits.
''It depends on fund raising - and begging,'' explained the 40-year-old Mr. Cain, who taught there for four years, from 1984 to 1987. The play is drawn from the extensive notes he took during that period. ''I'm a diarist,'' he said.
''It is a school that works,'' said Mr. Cain, who was also the artistic director of the Boston Shakespeare Company for seven years. ''Everyone makes a massive commitment. The teachers also live on the top floor.''
Before a recent rehearsal, Mr. Cain and Mr. Link discussed the form, content and implications of ''Stand-Up Tragegy,'' which has been described as a rap drama. They explained that the plot concerns two Hispanic students, Lee Cortez, a withdrawn mystic, as the playwright calls him, and Henry Rodriguez, a down-to-earth go-getter. As a survival mechanism, Lee retreats from reality, creating a mythological universe that is headed by Saga, a super hero whose mission is to create family peace - only he loses all the battles. Other characters of the play include a Catholic priest and a dedicated teacher. Mr. Cain said: ''Henry's family sells 'controlled substances at inflated prices,' as the principal says, and he's a charmer and already an entrepreneur. He can make money, but how can you keep him engaged - and free him from economic pressures?
''He's a visionary, but he can't cut it academically. When he arrives at the school, he isn't just illiterate, he's averbal, which is not even measurable. The school system and the family have failed him; he needs a shot at life that's not dominated by drugs and money.
''But Lee has no interest in drugs or money or school, only in holding his violent family together, and trying to keep them from killing each other. That's killing him.''
Commenting on the play's structure, Mr. Cain said, ''It was originally subtitled 'It's Just Like Stand-Up Comedy, Only Inside Out.' I've used the techniques of modern comedians, but ultimately this is not a comic view of life.
''This may be a genre play about teachers and students but it's not 'The Corn Is Green,''' Mr. Cain said. ''The form is nonlinear. The rappers function as a sort of Greek chorus. Lee has a series of monologues during which he plays all the people at home and we hear the horrific sounds of a family in explosion. And sometimes we see a class lesson, a rap number, a fantasy sequence and a kid playing basketball -all overlapping.''
Mr. Cain went on: ''The tragedy is that we accept evil, in terms of our lives, and we must oppose that. The evil of an affluent society is parallel to the evil of the streets. It's as if we need people - throw-away people - to fail, and we choose to make them invisible.
''We live in a booby-trapped universe,'' he said, ''and I call that the ecology of evil. It's a balance we are choosing to live with by accepting a certain level of evil as normal, and one of the teachers in the play tries to upset that balance by taking a boy away from his family. But one teacher can't save one kid. It's more complicated than that.''
Mr. Link, whose career as a director began in the Off Off Broadway theater of the 1960's, said: ''I was drawn to the play's social concerns - and its epic structure. I know it's an overused word, but we're all interconnected in some strange way.
''We seem to be admitting, even celebrating, a problem,'' he said, like the disasters we see every day on television, cheerfully reported by newscasters, - and not thinking that it's our problem, too, because we're removed and we're home. The play questions and provokes and we want the audience to ask, 'What can I do? How can I intervene?' ''
Mr. Link went on: ''The people who come to the theater are already involved. They said, 'I don't want to veg out in the house,' but we have to get them there.''
The play's visual elements include a backdrop representing a medieval warrior in comic book style, a drawing of Jesus and a dragon and a splash of graffiti. ''Multiple images are constantly crossing over,'' Mr. Link said. ''It's cinematic. nd at Hartford's wraparound stage, it's very Cinemascope.''

Parents Don't Really Care About Education

BYLINE: By Barry Edelson; Barry Edelson lives in Baldwin.

 BODY:
ON the eve of the President's recent education summit, my wife went to Back to School Night at the high school where she has taught English for more than 20 years. In this annual ritual, parents are invited to meet with their children's teachers.
If the President and our 50 governors really want to know what is wrong with education in America, they would have spent their time and our money far more wisely had they forgone the speechmaking and witnessed instead this very real exercise in frustration.
My wife is lucky. She teaches mostly honors classes of 10th and 12th graders, in which the students are generally motivated and have a responsible attitude about their schoolwork. She also has some average classes. By the second or third week of school, she can predict with uncanny precision how many parents will show up to learn about what their kids are learning. 
The 10th-grade honors classes draw the largest number of parents. By the time the top kids are seniors, however, parents no longer seem all that interested in the curriculum; fewer than one-third of them bothered to come this time.
The most telling, and most discouraging, turnout is among the parents of average and below-average students. In a junior satire class, for example, only two parents attended. This isn't likely to surprise anyone, but consider that when my wife went to her first Back to School Night a generation ago, there weren't enough chairs in some classrooms for all the parents. And in those days, she taught mostly average classes.
Sixty years ago, Alfred North Whitehead wrote these prophetic words about the English educational system: ''In the conditions of modern life the rule is absolute; the race which does not value trained intelligence is doomed.'' Unfortunately, the problem is that simple. The kids are merely bringing to the classroom the indifference, even hostility, to learning that is fostered at home, and in the society at large.
The Op-Ed pages and documentary television might lead us to believe that the leaders of government and industry are deeply concerned about public education. But all they really want is a labor force. If Asia and Europe weren't now commanding a sizable chunk of the world economy that the United States used to monopolize, few would care about the language and math skills of our workers, let alone what kind of citizens our schools are producing.
If you don't have daily contact with large numbers of high school students, you probably don't know that most of them on Long Island are already part of the labor force. Few of the students in my wife's school do notM have a job, even if they don't particularly need the money.
Mothers and fathers, virtually all of whom are working themselves, are more often than not pleased that they don't have to worry about where their children are and what they're doing. They also imagine that the kids are learning valuable lessons in responsibility and managing their money. They not only fail to voice their concern over these excessive work hours, they actually encourage it.
Ironically, the very business community that bemoans the diminishing skills of American workers is exploiting the labor of teen-agers who could be home studying. Typically, expediency wins out over long-term planning, and impressionable youth naturally follows the example set by its role models in the ''real'' world. For teachers, this growing trend in adolescent employment is a constant source of dismay and disgust.
What is a teacher supposed to do with an intelligent student who cuts class consistently, doesn't turn in assignments, works 40 hours per week, and whose parents, when called upon to straighten him out, actually fabricate excuses to cover for him? If disciplinary policies in a school district are weak, it is because the parents won't tolerate stricter rules to keep their kids on school grounds and force them either to attend class or fail. Many parents deem the school unreasonable if it detains a child and makes him late for his job.
Regrettably, I have become all too accustomed to hearing my wife on the telephone with parents, futilely attempting to alert them to their child's chronic absences or delinquent assignments. It is almost embarrassing to see how infrequently these calls make any difference.
If test scores are down, if the dropout rate soars, if America doesn't compete as well as it used to, it's easy to point a finger at rising taxes and complain about how little we're getting for our money. Statistics can prove anything. It's a lot harder to get your kids to study, especially when you and everybody else in the country are screaming the same hideous message from every television and radio and magazine: You don't really need school to get ahead.
The vast majority of teachers are prepared, informed and eager. But children cannot be molded like so much clay.
Like any other public institution, our system of education is a reflection of the society it serves. Whether we are able to make it better depends upon whether we have the courage to look long and hard at that ugly reflection without flinching.
The platitudes with which we were assaulted at the president's conference, if miraculously put into practice, would only exacerbate an already miserable situation. But if people already believe that teaching is mostly empty talk, they may be easily convinced that more empty talk will improve education.
That is why the President's conference is the best evidence yet that our nation as a whole truly doesn't care about education.

A Radical Idea: Baseball As It Used to Be

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
The Baltimore Orioles did not make it to the American League pennant last season, but they came close. If major league baseball offered awards for architecture, however, this team would win hands down. For the design for the Orioles' new 46,000-seat stadium in downtown Baltimore, which will begin contruction this spring and be finished in time for the 1992 season, is the best plan for a major-league baseball park inmore than a generation. If it is half as good as the models and renderings suggest, it will represent a return to baseball as it should be; a game played on grass, not turf; under the sky, not a dome; in the middle of a city, not out on an interstate highway. This is a building capable of wiping out in a single gesture 50 years of wretched stadium design, and of restoring the joyous possibility that a ball park might actually enhance the experience of watching the game of baseball. 
 The $75 million Baltimore stadium, to be built on the site of the old Camden rail yards at the edge of downtown, will have a structure of steel, not the concrete used in most stadiums of our age, and its facade will be a series of brick arches. It will thus look like a building from the outside, not like some vast feat of engineering. This radicaql idea - that a stadium should look like a building and not like a chunk of Boulder Dam - comes, of course, from the great ball parks that inspired this design, place like Fenway Park in Boston, the late Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, Tiger Stadium in Detroit and, most beloved of all,Wrigley Field in Chicago. There was always a special joy to approaching those building precisely because they did not reveal everything about what they were from the outside; the magical world within their gates always came as a tiny surprise.
 So, too, with the wonderful older stadiums and their neighborhoods interwove, the crowds swarming over the sidewalks, the buildings overlooking the field, the view from the upper decks accross a great swath of the city. There was always a certain eccentricity to them, determined in large part by the surrounding city; an odd street pattern could make for a short right field, simply because the land ran out on that side. Ball parks were not standardized like McDonald's or Holiday Inns; each one was a special place, with itw own special qualities.
 That is the goal at Baltimor: not a strained and self-conscious eccentricity, but just enough of a sens of the city to make it clear at every moment, from every seat, that you are under the sky of Baltimore and not inside some dome that is just like the one in Seattle or Minneapolis or Houston or New Orleans. There will be splendid views of the downtown skyline from the stadium, and the seats (modern armchairs, not old-fashioned stadium seats) will wrap around the playing field to assure greater intimacy and a tighter foul line.
 There is another special connection between the ball park and the architecture of the city here that is particularly enticing. The site is bordered on one side by a sumptious brick warehouse, eight stories high and as long as a train, that stands like a wall between this land and the rest of downtown. The warehouse is one of those noble and somber industrial buildins that once filled the downtowns of this country, and it would seem to have little to do with the goals of a modern ball park. But instead of tearing it down, the architects and planners, midful of both the importance of buildings like this to the urban fabric and the possibility that could enrich the design of the stadium, have decided to let it remain. The facade of the warehouse will preside over right field from a respectful distance, becoming as much a part of this ball park's identity as the stadium itself, and the interior will be converted into ancillary space for the stadium and new executive offices for the Orioles.
 Ther very phrase "urban fabric" would have been an anomaly in any discussion of stadiums until recently; urban fabric is for planners, historic preservationists and architects, and stadiums are for big business, politicians and sportsmen. The miracle here is how easily this contradiction has been proved false, and how naturally the goals of all sides have come together. This is a design that enriches baseball, the city and the region, all at once, and it makes every sprawling concrete dome sitting in a sea of parked cars look bloated, fat and tired.
 This new structure, which will replace Baltimore's Memorial Stadium, was designed by the sports facilities group of Hellmuth Obain & Kassabaum, with Joseph Spear in charge. Now, this is a huge national firm that has designed an ample share of the very concrete hulks this stadium has designed to get away from, and it is quite obvious that, skillful as the architects have been here, something else has must have been motivating them. That something else is the determination of the Orioles and the city of Baltimore to honor a set of values other than packing the most people into the bigges pile of concret in the middle of the biggest suburban parking lot. (That the Orioles are owned by Eli S. Jacobs, an investor with a longstanding amateur's interest in architecture, hasn't hurt: Mr. Jacobs has proved to be the rarest thing in professional sports, a client who knows something about urban design.)
 The stadium is being built by the Maryland Stadium Authority, which was created by the state legislature to improve Maryland's attractiveness to professional sports after the traumatic departure of the Baltimore Colts professional footbal team in 1984. The authority concluded that downtown Baltimore made sense as a site for this stadium, not only as a means of strenthening the city's economic base but also because urban stadiums are more accessible that suburban ones and, contrary to common wisdom, create fewer traffic tieups than their suburban counterparts. The Authority rejected the idea of a combined baseball and football stadium, realizing correctly that shared stadiums, like halls built to house symphonic concerts and opera, are compromises that fail to serve either tenant well.
 And thus came the idea of going back to baseball's essence, to its traditional urban ball parks, in search of design inspiration. In a sense, this project is the opposite of an exercise in sentimentality, for the real search here is not for the past but for a means of finding those fundamentals in the experiences of attending a sporting event that transcend time and place, and of connecting these thing to the realities of a particular site in the city of Baltimore.
 The ideas underlying this project are not, in the end. so revolutionary. Thinking about buildings as sensuous presences - in terms of how they feel - rather than as purely efficient, functional ones has been more and more the common wisdom in the last decade, as had the whole idea of thinking of the city as a complex set of interconnecting elements, and of realizing that no building, no matter how big or how important, can be thought of in isolation.
 What is revolutionary is letting these ideas set the tone for the design of a sports stadium. Even in Toronto, as enlightened a city as there is in urban planning, the new stadium is a concrete whale. Baltimore is not the first city to understand the virtues of urban design - but it is the first one to prove that they need not be incompatible with the pleasures of professional sports.

HEADLINE: For Cost-Wary Businesses: Leased Help

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
THREE years ago, when Brian O'Loughlin started an asbestos-removal company, only two people were on the payroll. But business was so brisk that in two years' time the company - New England Asbestos Control of Brewster - had grown to 10 times its original size in sales volume, and last year, Mr. O'Loughlin said, the company doubled in size again.
''We have 15 employees,'' he said, ''and of course I was glad to see the company growing, but I found I had to spend much more time taking care of paperwork. It took my wife at least 10, 15 hours at night at home a week working on the payroll, and we were also falling behind in our Workmen's Compensation payments, which is a big bill in this industry. We pay $15 for every $100 of salary a person, compared to 35 cents for the same coverage for a secretary.'' The cost for employee health benefits was also steep, Mr. O'Loughlin noted.
 
Time Was Misdirected
''I was spending more time comparing insurance premiums than I was thinking about the business.'' 
Mr. O'Loughlin said he was about to hire an office manager, though the company could not really afford one, when a friend told him about employee leasing.
''It sounded interesting so I got in touch with the International Charter Group in Rye. They market an employee-leasing company called United Staffing Corporation. And they showed me how I could get rid of the hassle of the payroll and get improved health benefits as well, by leasing. They figured how to take out Workmen's Compensation every week so we never got hit with a big bill, and they also set up a wraparound medical plan that gave us better benefits and cost $80 less a month per employee..''
 
A Growing Industry
Employee leasing is an industry that has grown dramatically over the last few years. The industry trade group, the National Staff Leasing Association, based in Encino, Calif., estimates that there are 450,000 leased employees nationwide, 100,000 more than last year. A report by the United States Small Business Administration described leasing as a significant innovation. It said employee leasing enabled ''small businesses to compete more successfully with large companies in the labor market by improving the employee benefits of small companies and reducing small business payroll-related burdens.''
While employee leasing may sound like temporary employment, leased employees are actually permanent full-time workers.
''The way employee leasing works is that a firm discharges all its employees, including the executives, and they're immediately hired by a leasing company like ours and leased back to the employer,'' explained Cleve Lynn, vice president of the Eastern region of International Charter Group, the marketing arm of United Staffing Corporation of America, which has headquarters in Perryburg, Ohio.
Employees do the same jobs and receive the same salaries as before, yet they are almost always better off under the leasing arrangement, Mr. Lynn said.
''It's the economy of scale,'' he said. ''Leasing companies such as ours have a larger number of employees than any single company. When a small company is able to offer the same benefits to employees as a large company, it gains a powerful recruiting and retention tool. It levels the playing field.''
 
Health Benefits Can Improve
Leased employees get better health benefits because the leasing company has such a huge payroll that it earns maximum discounts from benefits providers, Mr. Lynn said. ''We can also offer employee credit unions, employee discounts, 401K and flex-benefit plans - all services that are out of the reach of small companies with a dozen or so employees.''
Technology also helps leasing companies reduce costs. Sophisticated payroll automation becomes cost-efficient when a leasing company employs thousands of people.
Employee leasing companies earn their money by charging a management fee.
''Our major market is the small business,'' Mr. Lynn said. ''They benefit the most. Our management fee is 3 to 9 percent, based on the total payroll, but even when that is added in, the company usually saves money.''
 
It's Not for Everyone
But the employee leasing arrangement does not work well in every state, Mr. Lynn said. In Connecticut, for example, he said, a state service tax of 8 percent eliminates much if not all of the saving that companies New York-based companies realize.
''A Connecticut company with a weekly payroll of $100,000 would have to pay a tax of $8,000 a week. The tax might actually be more than our fee, which makes it unfeasible, although we do have a few Connecticut clients.''
Mr. Lynn, who opened the Rye office of the International Charter Group in July 1988, said he considers employee leasing his second career. He spent 30 years with United Airlines, becoming controller of United's eastern division in charge of financial operations at 50 airports.
''When United closed its Eastern division I didn't want to accept a transfer,'' he said. ''The employee-leasing industry is a really exciting one. It's where the temporary industry was 40 years ago, and its growth rate is phenomenal. By the year 2000, predictions are there will be 10 million employees leased in the United States.''
 
'Figured Out Everything'
Mr. O'Loughlin of New England Asbestos Control said: ''Employee leasing has put us on an even financial keel. The leasing company has figured out everything. All we do is fax the number of each employee's hours to headquarters. We have no paperwork and no paperwork costs. They not only issue the paychecks, they pay all taxes, insurance and health premiums and handle all employee-benefit claims. I've been free to take care of the asbestos removal business.''
While the trend in small companies is to rent employees, the trend in larger ones is to rent executives on a temporary basis. According to national labor statistics, temporary professionals make up the fastest-growing segment of the temporary employment market.
''There have been so many mergers and acquisitions that a lot of high-quality talent is available,'' explained Roger J. Preis, executive vice president of the Accountemps division of the employment agency, Robert Half of Westchester, based in White Plains.
''There's so much movement among corporations that clients have become applicants and applicants have become clients,'' Mr. Preis said. 
 
Temporary by Choice
While some of the professional temps are executives between jobs, others work on short-term assignments out of choice.
''They prize their independence,'' Mr. Preis said.''Many travel part of the year, and others like to winter in Florida.''
Professional temporaries, who earn $25 to $100 an hour, are usually brought in by companies for a particular project or assignment. There are firms that supply engineers, lawyers, accountants and general managers.
''Occasionally we get a call for a chief operating officer,'' Mr. Preis said, ''as was the case recently when a company moving to New Mexico from Westchester needed a chief executive officer to run the company in the county for six to eight weeks while the move was taking place.''
 
Helping in an Emergency
Professional temporary workers also fill important positions in emergencies.
For example, the assistant treasurer of a Fortune 300 mining company, who chose not to leave his home in Westchester when the company moved its headquarters from Manhattan to Phoenix, is now serving as temporary controller of one of the largest building materials companies in the nation.
The controller, who asked not to be named, said he was called in in June when the company's full-time controller suddenly left on medical leave.
''I'm looking for a permanent job and I find temporary assignments are a very good way to test the waters,'' he said. ''I'm managing the company's cash and all its bank relations on this assignment, and I'm enjoying it very much. I'm even helping them do the interviewing for someone to take the job permanently.''
When asked why he did not take the job himself, he said: ''Well, for the long term, I feel I have more skills than I'm currently using. And I also have a financial-consulting business, which I started in September 1987, just before Black October, so I wasn't able to gain a foothold. But I have some clients I'd like to expand that business to.''
The chief drawback of being a full-time professional executive temporary worker, he said, is lack of benefits. ''Unless you have a mate with good benefits, it's difficult.''

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT Q&A: JULIE D. BELAGA;
'Pollution Knows No Political Boundaries'

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
JULIE D. BELAGA of Westport, a Republican who lost her bid for governor in 1986, has been appointed Region 1 administrator for the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Government's top environmental post in New England with a staff of 575 people and offices in Boston.
The office has an annual budget of $365 million to enforce the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and supervise sewer repair and Superfund cleanup programs in the six New England states.
Mrs. Belaga, who is 59 years old, grew up in Boston, graduated from Syracuse University, and settled in Connecticut in 1965. She represented Westport in the State House of Representatives from 1976 to 1986, and was involved in issues of coastal protection, transportation of hazardous waste and solid-waste mangement. After her unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign, she worked as a commentator for WTNH-TV in New Haven and as an instructor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. Her new job will pay $78,600 a year. 
In an interview at her home, Mrs. Belaga talked about environmental issues but stressed that she was basing her remarks on her experience in the Connecticut legislature, since until her appointment is confirmed, probably early next year,she said she could not speak for the Environmental Protection Agency. Here are some excerpts from the conversation:
Q. Acid rain and low-level ozone are two problems Connecticut has but blames on the coal-burning plants of the Midwest and the industrial emissions of the New York metropolitan area. Should the E.P.A. be taking more of a regional perspective, rather than requiring cleanup state by state?
A. Frankly, one of the things I look forward to is meeting the other regional administrators, particularly from our neighboring regions. Pollution knows no political boundaries. And it's the same for clean water.
Cleaning up Long Island Sound is a major initiative, and it's something I've cared about since 1975 when Gov. Ella Grasso appointed me to a coastal area management task force.
You look at what's happening in Long Island Sound, and a lot of it is stuff coming down from the Connecticut River, and not all of that is from Connecticut. It's a very large regional issue. There are some close ties to our neighbors and some tough questions to address.
I can remember going to a legislative conference for the Northeast and wondering how anybody could not be tuned into acid rain, and then I met people from Pennsylvania who were coal miners and who have a lot of jobs at stake, and you begin to see the dynamics of some of these very difficult issues.
Q. For companies that say they cannot afford the best pollution control, should economics play a role in environmental issues?
A. I think what we need to do, as we move forward now that the public is with us, is to work cooperatively with business, to explain to them how they can meet these standards. I don't think we are really well served by a confrontational mode, and that's never been my style. I really believe in conciliation, and the only way we're ever going to make inroads on environmental issues is to make the environmental community and businesses friends and not enemies.
That doesn't mean I don't support tough enforcement, because that sends a message that we're serious about this, that there is a law and if you don't comply with that law, we're going to hold you accountable. But a lot of businesses get a bad rap because of one or two that are really grossly violating, and many businesses want to be good environmentally; they want to be good neighbors. I think they need to know there is an open door, that we look forward to working with them.
Q. Are people too concerned about environmental issues?
A. No, I don't think anyone is. But I can't tell you how wonderful it is that the public cares, because for a long time they didn't. In 1986 when I ran for governor I did a poll, and only 4 percent of the people in Connecticut cared about the environment. I was told, ''Julie, don't talk about those issues if nobody cares.'' Recently, there was a poll done and it ranked crime, drugs and the environment as the top problems.
This is a prime time to be an environmentalist, because the public cares. They're aware. They're willing to support an environmental initiative. It's a whole new mood now. There's a whole sense out there that ''Hey, let's do it.''
Q. A lot of business owners say that more harm is done to the environment by homeowners' dumping of paints and thinners into sewer systems or automobile drain oil into storm drains than by industrial effluents. How serious is that dumping?
A. I don't think it's ever a valid argument that ''I should be able to get away with it because someone else is getting away with it, too.'' I do think we can beef up and expand our program of household hazardous waste disposal. Nobody knew that stuff was dangerous. Everybody's going to have to pitch in, to play a role, but the thing is, now people care.
One of the things I did on television a couple of months ago was a piece on disposable diapers. I can remember when they were invented, and they were a nice little convenience. Now, we have this enormous problem in our landfills. A lot of young people were not aware of the long-term implications of filling our landfills with them. And a lot of them are rethinking the situation.
Q. With landfills filling up all over the country, why didn't the Federal Government take more of an initiative on recycling and source reduction?
A. I think you're going to see that. A very vital component of all our environmental concerns is going to have to be prevention. It's a lot cheaper to prevent it in the first place than to clean it up after it happens.
Q. In the 1960's everyone was convinced that landfills were the way to go. Now, we find that that contaminates ground water. Can environmental protection be effective when we know so little about the environment?
A. That's the nature of science. We're always trying to find some better way to skin that cat. Yes, we are going to find a downside, but because you make a goof, you don't just stop. What's fun about public policy is that it's a living, breathing thing, and it changes and you have to change along with it and learn with it.
I met with a woman in Washington last week who said environmental issues are becoming so complex and so technical and so highly refined that it's becoming more and more difficult to get people to work in the field for what the Government is willing to pay. There are a lot of talented people working in Boston who don't get a lot of satisfaction salary-wise, but they are dedicated, talented environmentalists.
That's going to be part of my challenge, to make sure those people feel good about what they do.
Q. A lot of attention has been paid recently to radon. As many as 10 percent of houses in some Connecticut towns have a problem. Is this something the E.P.A. should be taking the lead on?
A. That's a problem people have not been tuned into heavily. It is an enormous problem, a very high health risk, but it has been an invisible issue. What you will certainly see coming out of the E.P.A. is education of the public of how they can deal with this question and how they should protect themselves.
The numbers of people exposed to it are far larger than we expected. We now have a whole new problem. When I was at the legislature no one even knew about it.
Q. At a regional level, is there anything we can be doing about global problems like the greenhouse effect and the thinning of the ozone layer?
A. I am assuming there will be some interesting give and take between the environmentalists and the administrator in Washington and his counterparts internationally. Candidly, my role is going to be more regional, and I only look to have some input, through my conversations with the administrator as these national decisions are made.
Q What in your experience prepared you for this job?
A. I think the reason I was tapped as a viable candidate was because I have a unique array of experiences. My legislative involvement in environmental issues is right at the top of the list, but also simply understanding the process, understanding how government functions at the state level and, going back a few years, at the local level, has helped. More and more Federal initiatives are being implemented at the state and local level.
Q. What does this job mean in terms of your future in Connecticut politics?
A. Connecticut sure hasn't lost me. There is no way I would leave Connecticut. I will be commuting. I have family who live in Boston, so I will live with my family during the week and come back to Connecticut on weekends. But I would venture to say that it's highly unlikely I would ever run for office again.
This job is so tailor-made for my particular interests, but it is a very controversial seat to sit in. It tends not to be a stepping stone for political office.

HENRY ADAMS
By Ernest Samuels.
504 pp. Illustrated. Cambridge, Mass.:
The Belknap Press/Harvard University Press. $25.
Ernest Samuels' newly finished task was doubly unenviable. It must have been difficult enough to write the life of America's most famous autobiographer - to set up in competition with his subject, so to speak. But Mr. Samuels was also competing with himself. He is already the author of a three-volume, authoritative life of Henry Adams; it was completed in 1964 and won a Pulitzer Prize. This new book is a one-volume revision and abridgement. It is a complete success. Nowhere does it seem compressed or unintelligible (except where the fault is Adams's) or skimpy. Rather it seems both economical - not a word wasted - and ample - all relevant topics are thoroughly explored. It seems to be just the right length for its subject. In all, ''Henry Adams'' is a remarkable feat of the biographer's art. 
All the same, it is impossible not to dwell on the fact that a fine biography has been reduced by something like two-thirds. The necessary inference is that Henry Adams's standing is not as secure today as it was a generation ago, and after reading Mr. Samuels' new treatment, it is impossible not to see why. In 1989 Adams seems an unsympathetic character, less because of his numerous personal failings than because of the society, and class of society, to which he belonged.
Adams (1838-1918) was intolerably conscious of his privilege and burden in having been born into the United States' most distinguished political family and into the elite of Boston, for whom no other groups elsewhere in the world - not Virginians, not Europeans and certainly not New Yorkers - were quite dutiful and earnest and civilized enough; but what leaps to the eye nowadays is that this rich and cultivated gentleman never seems to have felt that he owed his fellow men any service. He lived across Lafayette Square from the White House for 40 years or so, sneering at every President in turn, dabbling in a little political intrigue when he could and coddling his sensibilities. He felt no call to carry on the work of the abolitionists, who had inspired his father's generation to heroism; he found the titanic energies that were going into building modern America vulgar and the era's politics merely corrupt. He was the embodiment of mugwumpery in an era when, as Theodore Roosevelt saw, mugwumps were little more than frivolous, indolent rentiers. Henry Adams came to disapprove of Roosevelt deeply.
Mr. Samuels, the Franklyn Bliss Snyder Professor of English, emeritus, at Northwestern University, is a biographer who sets nothing down in malice, but he also extenuates nothing; so he calmly makes it plain that Adams was a snob, was eaten up by egoism, was self-righteous and uncharitable and intellectually perverse and (what I found hardest to bear - no doubt Mr. Samuels did, too) was insistently anti-Semitic. Inevitably (for he visited France every year) he became an anti-Dreyfusard, but of greater historical interest is the fact that his anti-Semitism was wound about with a hatred for Wall Street and a belief in bimetallism, a monetary system based on silver as well as gold.
This son of Beacon Hill was enslaved to the same nexus of notions that characterized much of Midwest Populism. He was entitled to loathe the new America that was rising all about him, but he made no serious attempt to understand it, and that, in a professional historian and would-be prophet, is unforgivable. Instead he immersed himself in all the worst fallacies of positivism (he was much influenced by Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer in his youth) and tried to reduce history to the manipulation of statistics. He also tried to apply the second law of thermodynamics (that the entropy of an isolated system must increase) to human affairs, without apparently ever being sure whether he was using it as a suggestive metaphor or as a serious analytical tool. He soon submerged himself and his readers in a sea of confusion. Even his biographer is at last driven to plead for a little intelligibility and to comment that ''in spite of the prodigious effort of thought Adams still could not . . . either state his problem or wholly know what he himself meant.'' To the outsider it is all too clear what he meant: he wanted to prove that America was certain to go to hell because it would no longer consent to be ruled by the Adams family.
''What was the matter with Henry Adams?'' someone once asked Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. ''He wanted it handed to him on a silver platter,'' was the answer. Holmes had a right to such a view: he too was born into the Bostonian aristocracy, but he did not let himself be paralyzed by his silver spoon. He earned his fame by doing his country the distinguished service (in Holmes's case, on the United States Supreme Court) which Adams was too neurotic to attempt, and we can still turn to his reflections on American law and politics with profit. He was not a little man. That Adams was by comparison personally insignificant is no new discovery, but in the end it must be admitted that no one has ever cared, for he was also a writer of outstanding gifts. ''The Education of Henry Adams'' is not a wise book, and its last chapters are stunningly tedious; but the first 20 chapters, in spite of a certain affectation, still captivate readers by their wit and honesty. ''Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres'' is a book that no lover of France will leave unread. Historians and those who seriously enjoy history cannot fail to be pleased by the great work on the Administrations of Jefferson and Madison, and the political novel ''Democracy'' remains wonderfully amusing. All in all, the oeuvre is impressive, and its continuing vitality demonstrates the needlessness of biography, at least when the subject has led so quiet a life as Henry Adams did (his wife's suicide was just about the only thing that ever happened to him). Nevertheless I am glad that this brilliant, crotchety man has got a biography, and gladder still that it was written by Ernest Samuels.
 
THE BRAHMIN AS CRITIC
 Adams indulged his passion for stylistic criticism even in his private reading, and a burning trickle of comment would often run down the margin of the book. In Edmund Burke's Abridgement of English History, for example, he jotted down such editorial memoranda as: ''Strange assertion for a contemporary of Gibbon''; . . . ''This is very droll''; ''Curious want of critical capacity''; ''This is bad grammar, bad style, and bad sense''; and much more of the same, as if in imagination he were revising the text before him. To incite himself to a better performance he once proposed to young [Henry Cabot] Lodge that each write a review of Hermann von Holst's History. . . . ''I think it will give us both a spurt of emulation, so that we will do the most perfect work we can.'' Rigorous towards himself, Adams was equally rigorous towards others. . . . Lodge tells us . . . ''I rewrote [my first article] eight times before it passed muster.''

THE PLEASURES OF THE PAST
By David Cannadine.
Illustrated. 338 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $19.95.
One of the delights of the long literary review is having someone else read a book for us, so if it's an important but, well, somewhat inaccessible work, we can be informed about it without actually having to slog through the thing ourselves. And when a reviewer like David Cannadine knows just how to get to the heart of the book and reveal it to us with wit and eloquence - then a good overview can be a real treat in its own right. 
Such is ''The Pleasures of the Past,'' a collection of reviews of works on British history, most of which originally appeared in The New York Review of Books and The London Review of Books between 1981 and 1987. Reading Mr. Cannadine's reports of what scholars have said about England's past is like taking an eclectic survey course given by a professor who enjoys dazzling us with his enthusiasms for ideas and personalities. One week it's urban planning and architecture, the next it's economic history, followed by socialist interpretations of the lives of workers and criminals. We learn more than we imagined could be said in a short period about the changing nature of time. We hear about a variety of approaches to understanding the Industrial Revolution, the welfare state and the sex lives of the Victorian bourgeoisie, who ''cultivated their passions, like their gardens, behind high walls.'' The professor (Mr. Cannadine, who is British, does in fact teach history at Columbia University) especially likes biographies: assorted royals, prime ministers and other political figures are exhumed, examined, sometimes dropped back into their resting places with a thud, sometimes released to the company of angels - and are always presented in fresh historical perspectives.
Throughout his survey, Mr. Cannadine's own ideas always seem as interesting as those of the authors he reviews, often more so. This is the reason we read reviews of books that are no longer new - to enjoy the reviewer's individual perspective on their contents.
We also can't help admiring the elegant language with which this writer expresses his ideas. Mr. Cannadine is the master of sweeping, opinionated summaries. The British intelligence service, he tells us, ''seems not so much invincible and impregnable as incompetent and incontinent: a secret service which leaks its own secrets.'' Queen Victoria, he says, was considered by historians ''regina intacta'' until a new biography revealed her to be ''callous, insensitive, obstinate, outspoken, capricious and bigoted.'' And Britain's Victorian landed gentry, the object of so much nostalgia nowadays, were, he reminds us, the sort of people who ''favoured the death penalty for poaching.''
Mr. Cannadine reviews academics as well as their books, revealing the ways in which they have changed their approaches to history as they compete for eminence: ''The solitary scholar-gladiator of old, replete with lance and trident, was replaced by a new model army of research assistants, computer experts and applied economists who, under the guidance of a lab-coated field marshal, launched massive bombardments with all the scholarly firepower (and some of the strategic futility) of a Somme offensive.''
''A reviewer's job is to raise plausible doubts,'' he quotes one of the authors he reviews, and Mr. Cannadine soundly thrashes authors whose scholarship is lazy or whose prose is ''orotund to the point of flatulence.'' But he is full of enthusiasm for writers whose work is insightful and original. ''The Population History of England'' (not exactly bedside reading, though fascinating when sampled) is praised as ''a work of remarkable virtuosity, combining the panoptic vision of the parachutist with the meticulous scholarship of the truffle hunter.'' The same might be said for ''The Pleasures of the Past.''

HEADLINE: Japan, Weary of Barbs on Trade, Tells Americans Why They Trail

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 19

 BODY:
In one of the most sweeping critiques of the United States ever offered by an ally, Japan is telling the Bush Administration that it ought to upgrade schools, invest in scientific research, close the Federal deficit and take other drastic steps to improve American industrial competitiveness.
Japan's critique was presented in negotiations this fall as a reply to Washington's insistence that Japan open up its economy to more foreign imports and investment. The goal of the talks is to reduce the persistent trade imbalance aggravating relations between the world's two largest economies.
Japanese officials say their criticisms of the United States reflect Tokyo's view that American economic problems are rooted in years of mismanagement of the nation's industrial and educational systems. 
Under the negotiating ground rules, the specific arguments submitted by Japan have not been made public. But in interviews, Japanese officials disclosed details because, they said, the publicity surrounding the discussions has until now focused mostly on American criticism of Japan.
 
'Japan Alone' Cannot Close Gap
''If the United States wants Japan to change its system, the United States must be more ready to correct its own shortcomings,'' said a Japanese official involved in recent talks with Washington. ''We can't solve our trade imbalances looking at Japan alone.''
The Japanese critique will come as no surprise to Americans, since its basic elements have been debated throughout American industry, academic institutions and government. Nor is this topic new in Japan: Deficiencies of the American system have been discussed for years by Japanese officials, businessmen and scholars.
What is new is that for the first time, the informal Japanese suggestions have become the foundation of official Japanese policy, representing a consensus among the three most powerful ministries in the Japanese Government - the Foreign Ministry, the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. And the decision to make its views public is a further indication of Japan's increasing assertiveness on foreign policy after decades of postwar timidity.
 
More Saving, More Investment
Japanese officials said their critique, presented to American negotiators in written form in September in Washington and amplified orally early this month in Tokyo, makes these seven principal recommendations:
* The United States should reduce its Federal deficit and increase the overall American savings rate.
* American businesses should invest more in plant and equipment.
* American businesses should abandon the ''short-termist'' mentality of showing more interest in quarterly profits than longterm investment.
* Federal regulations inhibiting exports, such as the ban on exporting oil from Alaska, should be dropped.
* The United States should increase Government incentives for corporations, allowing them to collaborate or undertake independent research and development.
* Washington must subsidize and encourage exports, perhaps by setting up an export committee headed by the President.
* American business and government must vastly increase their support of education and training; the $30 billion spent each year by American businesses on worker training has failed.
 
On Math and Science
In the education sphere, Japan is calling for American high schools and colleges to upgrade the teaching of mathematics, science and foreign languages to make American industry more competitive.
It is also urging that American businesses improve their education and ''practical training'' programs for workers.
Japanese officials have requested an outline of the concrete actions being contemplated as a result of President Bush's recent ''education summit'' with the nation's governors. The request appears to indicate skepticism that the Administration will back up its verbal support of education with large amounts of money.
Several other issues place Japan even more explicitly at odds with the Bush Administration. For instance, Japanese officials are questioning the wisdom of President Bush's proposal to cut the capital gains tax. Instead, Japan suggests a gasoline tax to close the Federal deficit, which Mr. Bush opposes.
 
U.S. Makes No Promises
Bush Administration officials say the Japanese criticisms come as no surprise, since Japan was in effect asked during the recent negotiations to present a list of particulars on what the United States might do to improve its trade position.
But American officials refuse to comment on the Japanese specifics, saying only that they will be studied. Some American officials endorse a number of Japanese proposals, such as the need to improve private and corporate savings to provide the capital for future investment.
''I would like to have the U.S. savings rate increased, and I have been saying that for a long time,'' Carla A. Hills, the special United States Trade Representative, said in Tokyo last week.
Other officials say Washington will have to respond positively to at least some of the suggestions if it expects Tokyo to accede to American demands for more open markets in Japan.
But even if American officials agree with the Japanese suggestions, some of them might be extremely difficult to follow since they would involve changing practices that have become standard for American corporations. For example, Tokyo is criticizing the high salaries paid to executives and the focus on short-term profits, which are deemed necessary to fend off takeovers but have led busineses to curtail investment and modernization.
 
Antitrust Laws Criticized
Japan asserts that costly corporate takeovers financed by mountains of debt have wiped out the resources needed to develop new products.
The Japanese Government also wants the United States to ease anti-monopoly laws so that American businesses can pool their resources for research and development, with government assistance as a catalyst. This has been the development strategy followed by Japan since the 1960's.
American corporations have made tentative steps in this direction, notably in the development of high-definition television and in advanced semiconductors. But this argument comes at a time when many in the Bush Administration are resisting the notion of Federal guidance for corporate activities of any kind.
The United States trade deficit with Japan has remained at about $50 billion a year despite American trade retaliation on specific products, threats of retaliation on others, and the drastic decline in the dollar's value since 1985.
For its part, the United States is asking Japan to streamline its multi-layered wholesale and retail distribution systems, and to curtail the influence of its huge business cartels, industrial combines and monopolies, which Washington says have led to the highest domestic consumer prices in the world.

HEADLINE: U.S. IS CONSIDERING SHARP REDUCTIONS IN EUROPEAN FORCE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today that the Bush Administration is discussing proposals for troop reductions in Europe that would go well beyond the cuts now being negotiated in Vienna by NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
Administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said planning for more substantial troop cuts was preliminary. But one senior Administration official said the conceptual outlines for additional cuts in American and Soviet forces in Europe could be presented to the Soviet Union as soon as early December, when President Bush meets President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
The Administration has not yet agreed on a proposal for further troop cuts, but several officials interviewed today said their deliberations were being driven by the pressure to reduce the Pentagon's budget and by the pace of reforms in Eastern Europe. 
 
Soviets Are Slowing Spending
The Bush Administration's discussion of deeper troop cuts comes as American analysts have concluded that Mr. Gorbachev is beginning to carry out his pledge to slow overall Soviet military spending.
Mr. Cheney, appearing the ABC News program ''This Week,'' said the likelihood of a conflict between the United States and Soviet Union was ''at its lowest point since World War II.''
Mr. Cheney said he hoped the current talks, called Conventional Forces in Europe, or C.F.E., could be completed next year. ''There are now discussions about C.F.E. II, about what comes after this first round of negotiations.''
''Given the changes today that we see in Eastern Europe,'' he said, ''I think it's possible to contemplate the possibility over the next few years that we may indeed be able to reduce the level of our deployments in Western Europe.''
 
Possibly in Current Talks
And another senior Administration official said the White House has not excluded the possiblity of seeking greater troop cuts in the current Vienna talks, rather than in a subsequent round of negotiations.
Under the Western proposal now being discussed, the United States would make small reductions in its troops in Europe while Moscow would make massive cuts.
Mr. Bush proposed in May that the United States reduce Army and Air Force troop levels in Europe to 275,000 from 305,000, or about 10 percent. Under Mr. Bush's proposal, the Soviet Union would cut its force of about 600,000 troops to the same ceiling of 275,000, a cut of about 54 percent.
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the current Western proposal would provide savings of only about $2 billion, and some analysts believe the savings could be even less. Mr. Cheney has directed the military services to identify $180 billion in possible budget reductions in the years 1992 through 1994.
 
Greater Cuts Were Considered
Bush Administration officials had previously considered far greater troop cuts than those proposed by the President at the May NATO summit meeting. But the Joint Chiefs of Staff rejected the proposal, which called for a reduction of 75,000 troops in Europe, because they said it undercut NATO's strategy for defending Western Europe against the combined forces of the Soviet Union, East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria.
As a result, the Administration scaled back its proposed cut to 30,000 Army and Air Force troops.
But since then, political reform in Eastern Europe and growing pressure on the Pentagon budget have reopened the issue of further troop cuts proposals.
''There are those who think it makes sense to do more; that is where the money is,'' said a senior official today, who noted that this was not a unanimously held view.
Another senior official said: ''There is a growing recognition that C.F.E. I is not the end of the ball game, that if you want to achieve major savings you have to think beyond.'' This official said any new proposal should be presented after the current treaty is completed.
While some officials have expressed the hope that money could be saved through conventional arms control agreements, Mr. Cheney said further, painful cuts would be inevitable.
''We are going to have to make some cuts, some reductions in force structure, close some bases, terminate some weapons systems,'' Mr. Cheney said.
He said the cuts would have a detrimental economic effect on some areas and would draw protests from some members of Congress. ''It will mean, without question, some unemployment, and it means there will be great consternation on Capitol Hill because some of the things that will be cut members of Congress are very fond of,'' he said.
Mr. Cheney also indicated that the Pentagon was rethinking the costly program to build the B-2 Stealth bomber, which costs more than $500 million a plane. While saying the plane was needed, he added, ''How many we buy and at what rate we buy them is an open question.'' The Pentagon had said previously that it wanted to buy 132 B-2 bombers.
Mr. Cheney also suggested for the first time that the Pentagon might try to save money by ordering fewer than the 132 B-2 Stealth bombers it had previously said were necessary. He said the planes were needed, but added: ''How many we buy and at what rate we buy them is an open question.''
Mr. Cheney met at the Pentagon with Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to review proposals by the military services for cutting $180 billion from the budget from 1992-94.
 
No Decisions on Trims Yet
Mr. Cheney said today that no decision on how much to cut or which systems to cancel or reduce has yet been made. He added that he had directed the services to propose cuts after determining that the Pentagon would receive significantly less money in the future than had been previously planned.
''If you look at a realistic set of assumptions about how much money we're going to have,'' Mr. Cheney said today, ''then it leads you to the conclusion that we're going to have to spend significantly less than is currently programmed.''
A Pentagon official said today that planning is also going ahead for spending proposals for the 1991 budget and that Richard G. Darman, the Budget Director, wants the Pentagon to come up with 4.5 percent reduction, a total of $20 billion. That is a deeper cut than the Defense Department would like to make for that year, though Mr. Cheney is resigned to a reduction in spending for that year, once inflation has been taken into account, Pentagon officials said.
Meanwhile, the House today approved and sent to the White House $286 billion military spending bill for the 1990 fiscal year that began Oct. 1.

HEADLINE: Bush Vetoes Bill Including Aid to East Europe

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
President Bush tonight vetoed a $14.6 billion foreign aid bill that includes money for the new programs just approved by Congress to assist development of free-market economies in Poland and Hungary.
''I do not take this action lightly,'' Mr. Bush told Congress in his veto message, citing ''serious problems'' on constitutional issues and objections to a provision that would allocate $15 million for the United Nations Population Fund as his reasons for sending the bill back to Congress.
The United Nations agency does work in China, and abortion foes have opposed its financing on the grounds that China's population control programs include coerced abortion and sterilization. 
Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee, applauded the veto, saying, ''President Bush has sent a loud message to all population control organizations: If you trample on human rights by supporting compulsory abortion programs, you'll get no help from the U.S. Government.'' The House immediately laid plans for a vote on Monday to attempt to override the veto, but it is unclear whether members can muster the required two-thirds majority.
Mr. Bush is expected to sign the separate legislation that establishes three-year economic aid programs for Poland and Hungary. But none of the money envisioned by that legislation can actually get to Eastern Europe unless the foreign aid bill, which includes the actual spending allocations for the current fiscal year, is approved by Congress and signed into law by Mr. Bush.
The foreign aid bill allocates $492 million to help promote democracy and encourage private enterprise in Poland. About $80 million is allocated for similar purposes in Hungary.
Mr. Bush and Congress have been at odds for weeks over language in the bill that prohibits use of foreign aid money for ''futhering any military or foreign policy activity that is contrary to United States law.'' The language also prohibits the use of foreign aid money to solicit foreign governments or their agents for money to carry out activities contrary to United States law.
The prohibitions are outgrowths of the Iran-contra affair, in which the Administration attempted to evade Congressional restrictions on military aid for the Nicaraguan rebels. But Mr. Bush and his legal advisers have argued that the language sought by Congress would tie the President's hands in conducting foreign policy.
The provisions, Mr. Bush said in his veto message, ''interfere with my authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States.'' Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have challenged Mr. Bush's interpretation and have waged a bitter behind-the-scenes battle with White House lawyers.
Lawmakers have also argued that Mr. Bush's objections to the United Nations funding are groundless because the foreign aid bill requires the population agency to separate United States contributions from those of other countries and specifically forbids use of any American money for programs in China.
Delay in approval of the foreign aid bill also ties up money for Israel and Egypt as well as a host of other nations, including those where the United States is attempting to renegotiate military base rights.

HEADLINE: China Irate at Congress Sanctions

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 19

 BODY:
China expressed ''utmost indignation'' today at a Congressional package of sanctions approved last week to protest the crackdown on the democracy movement.
''History has testified to the fact that no economic sanctions can crush the Chinese people,'' the New China News Agency quoted a Foreign Ministry official as saying in a meeting with Ambassador James R. Lilley. ''On the contrary, such practice will only have the United States eat its own bitter fruit and see its own interests harmed.''
The American legislation imposes two years of sanctions, including a suspension of trade assistance and an end to insurance for American companies doing business in China. It also freezes exports of satellites, controlled munitions like helicopters and certain nuclear material and components.
The bill condemns what it calls the ''unprovoked, brutal and indiscriminate assault'' on the protesters and unarmed civilians, which it said left 700 dead. China has said 300 people died, but Western intelligence estimates put the number as high as 3,000.
The bill is part of a wide-ranging measure that authorizes funds for the State Department. President Bush has accepted the idea of sanctions, but his advisers say they will urge a veto of the package because of a provision unrelated to China.
The official Chinese protest was read on national television. No reason was given for the Congressional sanctions.
The agency also paraphrased Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu as saying: ''Since the Chinese Government put down the counterrevolutionary rebellion in accordance with the Chinese Constitution and laws, the U.S. Congress has meddled in China's internal affairs and stirred up an anti-China wave by adopting one resolution after another on this matter, which is purely the internal affairs of China.''

HEADLINE: Clamor in the East;
A Hungarian Gambles And Reclaims a Legacy

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, Nov. 19

 BODY:
From Budapest to Trieste to New York and Chicago, to Milan, Florence and finally back to Budapest, Peter Zwack's life has reflected the twists and turns, the ups and downs, the dreams and nightmares, of his native land.
Mr. Zwack is a distiller, like his great-grandfather, grandfather and father before him. He gives his age as 55, but his wife, Anne, says that he lies about it. A slight man with sharp features, he has managed to reclaim his 200-year-old family business here in Hungary from the Communists who seized it without compensation four decades ago in the turbulent aftermath of war. 
Nobody else has done anything like that, as far as anyone knows.
Peter Zwack sometimes seems utterly at sea in the modern world. Last summer, for instance, picking up some friends from the Budapest airport, he loaded them into his Alfa-Romeo, pressed what he took for the air-conditioning control and then, with a Magyar curse, hit the brakes as the trunk lid popped up instead.
And yet he is steely enough to have survived, indeed thrived, for 40 years as an exile. He is bold and imaginative enough to have gambled, when the winds of change now blowing through Eastern Europe were the merest zephyr, on the ability of a capitalist emigre to come home at last and do business with the Communists he hated.
 
A Role Model for Hungarians
So far, it has worked, and he has become a role model and a teacher for many in this country. Stand with him on a downtown sidewalk, and people he has never met will greet him, having seen him on television talking about the ways in which Hungary must change in coming years.
''People like you make the world a better place to live,'' a seemingly serious man told him the other day, much to his embarrassment.
Mr. Zwack guesses he gets that sort of reaction ''because people think I showed faith in Hungary when not too many others did,'' and because ''they had been fed this picture of a fat capitalist who smoked cigars and beat up the workers, and they saw me, a skinny guy who doesn't smoke, wears beat-up clothes and behaves more like the workers than the Communist bosses did.''
At first, his outspokenness got him in trouble. In an interview with a West German magazine, Mr. Zwack called the people who ran Hungary's economy ''bandits,'' and the workers' militia in his plant, the same one his father rebuilt after it was bombed in World War II, said they could not cooperate with him.
 
Outsmarting the 'Bandits'
But the workers' militias are going out of business, not Peter Zwack, and more ''bandits'' are losing their jobs every day.
As the country moves, seemingly inexorably, toward a market economy, the Zwack plant in Budapest is once again producing the authentic version of Unicum, a biting digestive liqueur distilled from herbs. Before too long it will also be making the rich fruit brandies and cordials on which Zwack & Company's reputation was built in the United States after World War I. Mr. Zwack paid $500,000 a few months ago for his 25 percent share of the company, and his Western partners, the German distilling company Unterberg, did the same thing. The Hungarian Government owns 46 percent, and a bank and an export company in Budapest each have 2 percent.
For the first time since 1948, new equipment is going into the distillery, and new export deals are being negotiated - including one with a big Japanese trading company, whose interest was piqued when both its president and a leading Japanese actress, here on visits, tasted Unicum and fell in love with the inky liqueur.
 
A Penniless Emigre in '48
Peter Zwack crossed the Yugoslav border in 1948, alone and broke, shortly before his father, Janos, was smuggled out of Budapest into Vienna on a Soviet truck whose driver had been bribed. The younger Zwack had to borrow change to phone a friend of his father's, a banker from Trieste, Italy, but father and son soon met in New York.
After an abortive first job selling vacuum cleaners in Queens (he couldn't get the appliances to work when he tried to demonstrate them), the younger Zwack went to work in the liquor trade, first in New York and later in Chicago, winding up as the manager of a wine-importing firm, marrying an American, fathering ''thoroughly American kids'' and gaining his naturalization papers.
In 1970 Mr. Zwack headed back to Europe. His father and uncle were making Unicum - the real thing - in Milan while the Hungarian plant was making something similar, based on a phony formula his uncle Bela had given to the new Communist management. Peter Zwack joined them, restarted brandy production in Vienna and eventually took over. While in Milan, he met and married Anne Marshall, an Englishwoman who writes on food and travel, mainly for American publications.
After a time, the Zwacks found themselves in Florence, living in the stables of a Renaissance villa overlooking the city. Then one day a call came from an old Hungarian friend who was visiting Budapest, reporting that Sandor Demian, the country's top marketing expert, wanted to talk to Mr. Zwack about coming back.
 
A Well-Timed Return
Talk the two men did, and in June 1988 the Zwack family headed north, supposedly for a year - parents, two children (Sandor, then 14, and Pinky, then 12), two cars, two birds, a horse, dogs and a guinea pig.
Why did they go? ''I'm Hungarian, first, and second, my father always wanted to get the company back, so I did, too, and third, I saw that I could make a profit - maybe.''
The timing could not have been more propitious. Mr. Zwack quickly made friends with fledgling politicians and businessmen and journalists as the country relearned the skills of a pluralistic society.
He resumed playing tennis with his old doubles partner from the junior national team of long ago. And the family found an apartment, modest but handsome, only three doors from the grand old Zwack house on Uri Utca, a street of Baroque splendor on Budapest's lovely Castle Hill.
''It's unbelievable,'' says this man who has lived several lives in one. ''Preposterous. Wonderful.''

HEADLINE: Indictment Clouds Deal That Saved a Steel Plant

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala, Nov. 17

 BODY:
What was once the South's biggest steel city has been shaken by Federal indictments charging that the USX Corporation secretly awarded fat pensions to union negotiators in exchange for the ground-breaking labor concessions that saved its steel works here in 1983.
The settlement, under which the union agreed to a host of job cuts, set a pattern for retrenchment in the steel industry at a time when foreign imports were squeezing American steel makers, scores of plants were idled and the union was scrambling to save members' jobs. In court depositions, the company was later to say that the agreement had saved it $24 million a year.
Now there is a sense of betrayal in the rank and file, though the United Steelworkers of America and many members stand behind the indicted union officials. As workers finished their shift at the huge Fairfield Works here on Friday, many said, ''We have been sold out.'' 
 
Not Guilty, Defendants Say
Both the company, through a spokesman, and the two union officials, through their lawyers, say they will plead not guilty to the charges, which were handed up on Wednesday. The Government says that the company illegally tried to influence the union officials by offering them pension benefits for which they were ineligible and that the officials illegally sought and accepted the benefits for themselves and five other union officials. And it says top company officials ordered their pension fund employees not to disclose the pension arrangement to anyone, in violation of Federal laws governing private pension funds.
The indicted negotiators are Thermon Phillips, 61 years old, the union's district director for several Southern states and a member of its international executive board, and E. B. Rich, 59, a subdistrict director for the union. The indictment also named but did not charge three former USX officials who were said to have helped arrange the deal. They were James Bruce Johnston, then executive vice president for employee relations; William Miller, vice president for labor relations, and James D. Short, vice president for benefits.
Frank W. Donaldson, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, said the two union officials could face up to 65 years in prison and fines of $3.2 million. The company faces fines of up to $6.6 million, he said. Mr. Donaldson said that the investigation was continuing and that there could be further indictments.
 
Union Defends Its Officials
The United Steelworkers of America, which has long been criticized by many members for agreeing to the concessions, says Mr. Phillips and Mr. Rich deserve praise, not indictment, for saving the jobs of union members. ''If there was a bribe, as the U.S. Attorney alleges,'' said the union in a statement from its headquarters in Pittsburgh, ''why do they indict the Birmingham union officials and allow the high-level corporate headquarters officials directly involved in the alleged payment to escape prosecution?''
William E. Keslar, a USX spokesman, said the company cooperated in the grand jury investigations and was ''extremely disappointed'' in the indictment. He added that the charges appeared to result from a ''strained interpretation'' of the events of 1983.
Those events marked a watershed in the steel industry, then under siege from economic recession and foreign competition. In Birmingham, the Fairfield Works had been closed since June 1982, its 3,500 workers laid off. The company had invested money in a mill to produce pipe for the oil industry, but declining oil production called that into question as well. In 1981 the company reported that Fairfield was losing more than $150 million a year and was a strong candidate for permanent closing.
But the day before Christmas 1983, as the company was preparing to announce layoffs and closings at plants around the country, the negotiating team headed by Mr. Phillips granted a host of concessions: job cuts, new manning arrangements, elimination of some incentives and the dropping of all pending grievances, among other things. In return, the company reopened a scaled-down Fairfield plant with about 2,000 employees and salvaged the pensions of 1,500 others.
In his recent book ''And the Wolf Finally Came: The Decline of the American Steel Industry'' (University of Pittsburgh Press), John P. Hoerr writes that the Fairfield agreement set a pattern for the industry in labor relations and new concessions by other local unions around the country. And a union official here, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said:
''It clearly saved the Fairfield plant, and it was a model in that other locals began to wake up to the need to negotiate such things as manning. It was the first time that the company had achieved a major breakthrough in negotiations with the union on manning levels.'' He emphasized, however, that such concessions varied widely from one local to another.
 
Dissension in the Rank and File
Many in the industry and the national union were unhappy with the agreement at the time, and there were allegations of collusion in the negotiations. A rank-and-file group in Birmingham sought to overturn the agreement, saying it was illegal and damaging to members' interests; its suit is still pending. And union officers who got wind of the pension arrangements went to court, seeking benefits similar to those granted Mr. Phillips and the others. Their lawsuits were dismissed.
Mr. Donaldson, the United States Attorney, said in an interview that the Government's case against what he called a conspiracy between the company and the two officials began with information from an informer. He would not give details of the investigation, but court papers in the pending civil suit and the decision to dismiss another give some insight into the 1983 negotiations.
In depositions, company officials admit that Mr. Phillips, Mr. Rich and five other union officials began getting pension benefits three months to a year after the Fairfield agreement. Those pension payments, negotiated separately from the labor agreement that kept the plant open, were a result of a policy change by the company to ''foster and promote the good will of former employees'' who became bargaining agents for the union.
The policy change altered the amount of time that national union officials could take leaves of absence from the company and maintain pension benefits. In 1984, USX specified in a policy memorandum and a letter to the president of the steelworkers' union, Lynn Williams, that the change would apply only to officials with bargaining responsibilities who had left the company for their union posts before 1978.
 
'Secret Negotiations'
But nearly three years later the company ended the policy, noting that some recent court decisions indicated it might be illegal. At that time it denied all pending requests for such pensions, but did not rescind those already granted. Court papers say Mr. Phillips, who received $55,319 between November 1984 and May 1988, Mr. Rich, who received $48,318, and the other five Birmingham officials were among those who kept their pension benefits. The pending suit says that the payments resulted from ''secret negotiations'' and that rank-and-file members did not learn of them until last year.
Plaintiffs in that suit say that for months their fellow workers criticized them for bringing the lawsuit, fearing that it could lead to the closing of the plant. But Lorenzo East, who has worked at the plant for 38 years, said that since the indictments, ''some of them are getting on the bandwagon because they see that the leadership is just taking our union dues and laughing at us.'' The union officials, he added, ''have sold us out and taken away what our daddies and granddaddies fought for.''
Other steelworkers do not believe the charges. Leaders of the city's locals say the indictments are political, the work of a conservative Republican Justice Department bent on undermining the labor movement.
But Barry Nichols, who has worked at Fairfield for 20 years, said most workers were cheered to see that USX was indicted as well.
''Most people have felt that the company was so rich they were above the law,'' he said. ''But this indictment gives them some hope and faith in the law.''
Not everyone is optimistic. Al La Pierre, executive director of the state Democratic Party, recalled a time when both the company and the union ''ruled this area.''
But he added that both have fallen on hard times since the 1970's, and he said of the indictment, ''This has hurt them more, I think.''

HEADLINE: Budget Crisis Dominates Race in Massachusetts

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
A wide-open race for Governor is getting under way this month under some of the most unusual circumstances in memory. For the first time in 30 years, the incumbent is not seeking another term.
Indeed Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who lost the Presidential election last year, has fallen so far from public favor that other Democrats are scrambling to stay as far away as possible from him.
But while the state is struggling with one of the worst budget crises on record as the regional economy slows, Republicans, who might otherwise be gloating over the opportunity to recapture the office, are having trouble getting their candidates to toe the party line on issues like abortion.
''We are in a unique situation,'' said Kevin B. Harrington, a former president of the State Senate, as a Democrat, and who now runs a political consulting and lobbying firm here. ''There won't be that many people voting for X, Y or Z on the Republican side. They'll be voting against the Democratic Party.'' 
 
Focus on Abortion and Economy
The election is a year away, but the major issues seem to be abortion and the economy. The most pressing for the 2.9 million voters, leaders of both parties say, is how to heal the ailing economy that only last year was being admired as the Massachusetts miracle.
On Tuesday, Governor Dukakis said in a speech that the miracle was no more. On Wednesday, Moody's Investors Service lowered the state's bond rating again, leaving it tied with Louisiana for the lowest. At least two economists have said the state is suffering a recession. Largely a result of declining revenues, the budget deficit has reached $1.2 billion for the current fiscal year, which ends next June.
''A year ago, the Democrats' greatest suit was that the so-called Massachusetts Miracle appeared to have reached its height under Democratic tutelage,'' said Paul Watanabe, the chairman of the political science department at the University of Massachusetts in Boston. ''Now that is perceived as their greatest burden.''
United States Representative Chester G. Atkins, the state chairman of the Democratic Party, said: ''The continuing deterioration of the state's fiscal situation has hurt all incumbents. I think the Democrats in the Legislature have now arrested that slide, and are doing a very difficult chore, trying to assess what the core functions of government are and what levels they need to be supported at and how to finance that.''
There are protests daily on Beacon Hill, where the Governor and the Legislature are trying to overcome the deficit with spending cuts and new tax proposals. The protesters say essential services like housing and human services were severely harmed by the first round of cuts in July when the deficit was $500 million. At a protest earlier this week, one man waved a placard that labeled the state ''Axachusetts.''
Jim Braude, the executive director of a lobbying group called Tax Equity Alliance for Massachusetts, said no candidate had offered voters real solutions to the crisis. ''Each is moving at breakneck speed toward a poorly defined middle,'' he said. ''What the people believe is that no one tells them the truth.''
The abortion issue has become a difficult one for the Republican Party. The front-runner for the party's nomination, William Weld, the former United States Assistant Attorney General, has declared that he favors abortion rights. The party's other candidate, Steven Pierce, the minority leader in the State House of Representatives, is an opponent of abortion rights.
''I don't think it will be a governing factor in the election,'' said Ray Shamie, the party's state chairman. ''On most issues, the party is fairly well united. We're toe-to-toe on defense and economic issues, but there is some diversity on social issues.''
Others disagree. ''A pro-choice position is the one that is most politically successful here,'' Dr. Watanabe said. ''This is a state in which a strong anti-abortion stance is a political liability.'' The wrong position on abortion, political analysts say, could cost a candidate either the party's nomination or the general election.
Otherwise, many consider that the 1990 election will give Republicans their best opportunity in many years. The last Republican Governor, Francis Sargent, was unseated by Mr. Dukakis in 1974.
The Democrats' first choices for Governor are not even announced candidates. A poll of 600 Democrats, published last week by The Boston Globe, ranked former United States Senator Paul Tsongas, who quit the Senate in 1984 when he was diagnosed as having lymphatic cancer, and Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d at the top of the list.
Mr. Tsongas said in July that he would not run, but he told The Boston Globe last week that he was reconsidering and would make a decision by January. Now a lawyer in private practice and the chairman of the State Board of Regents of Higher Education, he did not return telephone calls seeking comment from him this week. But several Democratic Party insiders said privately that they believed he was serious about running. Mr. Tsongas's health situation was unclear but would be a factor in his decision, analysts said.
 
Beacon Hill Is a Target
Chuck McDermott, the chief of staff for Representative Kennedy, said: ''Joe sees the governor's office as a very important job and one that could greatly affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in Massachusetts, but at this time, he is committed to what he's doing in Congress and trying to resolve some family issues.'' Mr. Kennedy and his wife separated last year.
Any candidate who is perceived as outside the present Beacon Hill circle would not be as easy a target of blame for the state's fiscal difficulties, analysts said. One declared candidate, Lieut. Gov. Evelyn F. Murphy, already appears to have been politically damaged by her association with Mr. Dukakis, with The Boston Globe's poll finding her popularity had dropped by 9 percentage points since July.
''If the election were held next Tuesday, goodbye any Democratic nominee, in my opinion,'' Mr. Harrington said. Others consider the Republican Party hampered by the lack of a strong statewide field organization and the Democrats' firm majority. ''In a state with two viable parties, I would say the Democrats would be in terrible shape,'' Mr. Corgan said. By CONSTANCE L.

HEADLINE: Yes, Toughen Ethics. But Not Quite Yet.

 BODY:
A new, tough code of ethics is causing turmoil in the Koch administration's waning days. Some New York City workers worry that the new rules, scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1, will prevent them from getting decent jobs in the private sector if they wait around to find out if Mayor-elect Dinkins wants to retain them.
Mr. Koch and Mr. Dinkins, worried about a mass exodus, want the City Council to delay implementation of the new rules for six months. That's too long, but a three-month delay would make sense. 
A change in the City Charter, approved last year and effective Jan. 1, builds on current ethics rules by imposing new limits on the work city officials may do once they leave government. The idea is to prevent former officials from later working on projects they dealt with in government.
The new code would permanently bar former public servants who worked closely with an applicant on a ''particular matter'' from appearing before a city agency on that same matter on behalf of that same applicant. The current rule includes a similar ban, but it is for three years rather than permanent, and doesn't refer to a ''particular matter.''
Supporters of the new version claim it is clearer than the old one, not necessarily stricter, but few people in and around City Hall see it that way. They're concerned that the new provision will be interpreted so broadly that they'll be unemployable. Their fears have hardly been eased by Mayor Koch's failure to appoint the new Conflict of Interest Board until last month - eight months late. Board members have yet to issue any interpretive guidelines or rulings. Delay would give them a chance to do so, and give city agency employees a better idea of where they stand.
Opponents of delay argue that postponement confirms unfounded fears that the rules are unfair and overly restrictive. In fact, they are fair and reasonable. And Mr. Dinkins, dogged by questions about his personal finances, must let the city work force know that he embraces regulations intended to improve government.
Arguments against delay have merit but don't outweigh the practical problems. Employees and their agencies are entitled to a clear understanding of the ethics code, and Mr. Dinkins is entitled to an orderly transition.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
The Hypersonic Plane

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
With a minimum of controversy and a major commitment of money, America has once again tossed its cap over the wall of space.
This time, we are embarked on the development of a 4,000-mile-an-hour National Aerospace Plane (NASP) that will zip past the French-British Concorde the way a souped-up Corvette passes an antique tin lizzie.
If all goes well with our X-30, we will enter the new millennium with a made-in-America aircraft capable of taking off from any major airport, zooming out into space and re-entering the atmosphere to land at any other airport in less than three hours.
This will not solve the world's transportation problems: it will take longer to drive downtown from Tokyo's Narita airport than it will take to fly from New York to Tokyo. 
But the National Aerospace Plane (the infelicitous acronym suggests a NASP in our bosom, and this is hardly the snake that killed Cleopatra) will thrust the United States into the lead in aerospace technology and give our economic competitiveness a much-needed boost.
The commitment of R.&D. money to this project is a fait accompli: although the Senate originally voted no funds for the spaceplane, the House aggressively adopted it in the President's defense budget request, and senators Friday night ratified a conference agreement to spend a quarter of a billion dollars in the next fiscal year to get NASP research off the ground.
How come this went through without a lot of hollering? Where were the old opponents of the SST, the anti-defense denigrators of Star Wars, the free-market stalwarts who want private enterprise to finance its own future?
Knee-jerk objections were finessed because a sound idea was presented on grounds that raise the fewest red flags.
The old debate about the supersonic transport centered on national pride versus commercial feasibility; our SST was turned down because it was felt, rightly, that it just wasn't the taxpayer's job to keep America's passenger aircraft the world's fastest.
The nation's aerospace plane, which leapfrogs the SST, was not sold strictly on economic competitiveness, although there was an underlying warning that ''if we don't do this, we'll be buying tickets on the Japanese plane.''
The taxpayer investment could not be justified on the basis of helping American industry alone; this Administration resists massive aid to television technology, semiconductors and robots for fear of weakening the lure to private capital. The combination of budget restraint and capitalist philosophy usually overcomes the force of nationalism.
In this case, the defense dollars had to be justified on defense grounds: in an era of arms control, sudden surveillance is needed for verification; in an otherwise pushbutton missile age, a recallable retaliation craft and a swift interceptor is a safety catch; as the threat of subpower terrorism increases, we should be able to knock down missiles from space, though this does not pretend to be a substitute for a space shield.
But the national defense steak has little sizzle; as a new weapon alone, NASP would never fly. What puts this across is a bid to regain space leadership: as a taxi for humans visiting space stations and satellites, as a test vehicle for research on new materials.
An array of former astronauts, gathered by the Rockwell Foundation's Gilbert Robinson, pressed the need for such a craft as a stimulus for NASA research. It's going to be fueled, for example, by hydrogen slush. (You never heard of hydrogen slush? Best slush around.) The competitive commerce point is thus a kind of fillip, an added advantage: a U.S. spaceplane, built by American technicians and workers, will shrink the planet to less than three hours between any points. That affects balance of payments, careers, and an intangible we call the national spirit.
The skillful orchestration of good arguments - defense, space, commerce - defanged the opposition, disarmed the skinflints, walled this off from more vulnerable defense research investments, and built support for a dream that was written off only last summer as impossible to sell to Congress.
The man who made it all happen, who got down there in that hydrogen slush and rescued the spaceplane from oblivion, is the chairman of the National Space Council.
He is Dan Quayle, the Underestimated Man. When he made speeches about a Bush commitment to space research, the Vice President was derided for not accompanying rhetoric with a willingness to do budget battle.
Despite defense cutting, the new dollars are there; the designers are working; watch that space.

Subway Service: Is It Any Better? Or Worth More?

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
A year ago, the Transit Authority revamped schedules and opened new stations in what it touted as the greatest number of service improvements since New York City's subway system opened in 1904.
Now, with the likelihood that the $1 fare will - by being raised - be reduced to a historical footnote, too, subway and bus riders are entitled to ask whether they are better off today than they were a year ago.
Statistically, while last year's promise was vastly overstated, service for many riders, though not all, appears to have improved.
''What we find is very mixed results,'' said Gene Russianoff, whose Straphangers Campaign plans to release its periodic survey of subway service tomorrow. ''They trumpeted improvement over all for the system, and that's true. But because of the homeless, crime and lack of reliability, it is still the city's most underutilized capital asset.'' 
Since 1984, average weekday ridership has grown modestly by 7 percent, surpassing 3.7 million last year for the first time since 1974. But this year, ridership has been flat, which officials say is largely because of the cooling local economy. A fare increase is likely to drive away riders.
Bus ridership has declined steadily. But other numbers point toward some light at the end of the tunnel:
* The mean distance between subway car mechanical failures soared from 8,479 miles in 1984 to 18,654 last year and 24,083 this year.
* The percentage of cars purchased or overhauled since 1984 climbed to 93.5 percent this year, from 88.6 percent last year, on the IRT division and to 64.1 percent, from 37.5 percent, on the IND and BMT divisions.
* The percentage of trains completing their runs within five minutes of schedule inched up to 82.6 in 1989, from 81.4 in 1988, during the evening rush hours and to 85.2 percent, from 79.8 percent, in the morning rush.
Even the troubled R line may be rallying. Before last December's revision of routes and schedules, the R's 400,000 daily riders faced a 24-hour on-time performance rate of 59 percent. By last summer, it had plunged to 48 percent. But last month, officials said, the rate had increased to 80 percent. The Straphangers Campaign found that while the percentage of late trains last summer declined modestly compared to 1988, morning rush-hour delays on Brooklyn-bound trains then still averaged close to 20 minutes.
Transit officials attribute delays on R and N trains to repairs on two East River tunnels, which are to be completed late next year, and to work trains that clog the route. Millard Seay, the authority's senior director of schedules, said that timetables were revised to better reflect actual running time and that additional trains were placed in service. Nonetheless, he acknowledged, the regular six-minute gap between Queens-bound trains during rush hour can easily double.
No wonder the prospect of a fare increase puts many riders in a purple rage.
New York's $1 fare is generally not comparable with rates in most other major cities, where fares often vary by zone and fees are imposed for transfers. The basic subway fare ranges from 75 cents in Boston to $1.25 in Philadelphia.
In New York, the fare was 5 cents until 1948, when it was doubled to a dime. It rose to 15 cents in 1953, 20 cents in 1966, 30 cents in 1970, 35 cents in 1972, 50 cents in 1975, 60 cents in 1980, 75 cents in 1981, 90 cents in 1984 and $1 in 1986. At that rate, coupled with the Transit Authority's projected deficit, an increase is overdue.
On Friday, the authority's president, David L. Gunn, cautioned that paying a $1.15 fare, one increase proposed, could require an unwieldy six coins on a bus. To ease congestion, he proposed a 25-cent increase. To cushion the impact, packs of 18 tokens would be sold for $20, reducing the rate to $1.11 for those who could afford to buy in bulk. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will decide in December.
Do mass-transit improvements justify a fare increase, let alone last year's immodest comparison to the greatness of 1904? ''It wasn't my slogan,'' Mr. Gunn said. But he does consider the subway system cleaner and more reliable. ''I've never had anyone write and say, 'Sock it to me and raise the fare,' '' he said, ''but you're certainly getting more value now.''
Not that a fare increase will be based on the extent to which rider satisfaction is expressed at public hearings next week. Whatever the overall statistics show, individuals will have to decide for themselves whether a subway ride is safe, reliable and convenient enough to be worth $1.11 or $1.15 or $1.25. And then they must ask themselves, compared to what?

HEADLINE: States Turn to Business To Help Build Highways

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEESBURG, Va.

 BODY:
Strapped and hoping to build a road from here to Dulles International Airport, Virginia decided to revive a Colonial-era solution: Let private business build the road and profit from the tolls.
Ralph L. Stanley took the offer. ''I love a traffic jam; they're all customers to me,'' said Mr. Stanley, president of the Toll Road Corporation of Virginia. He headed the Federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration in the Reagan Administration. 
His Leesburg-Dulles Airport toll road would be the first privately owned toll road built for the public in this country since the late 1800's, when most major roads were privately built.
Transportation experts say a 1987 Virginia law that encourages private ownership of toll projects may serve as a national model: Most states are hard up for money to build or repair their roads, bridges and tunnels.
 
Activity in Other States
California is trying the idea, A law passed last year encourages companies to propose four private toll roads, bridges or tunnels. Other states, including Pennsylvania and Illinois, are considering similar legislation or proposals. One private toll bridge has been built this year, linking Moorehead, Minn., and Fargo, N.D.
Private toll roads are a seductive concept. Private industry raises the money, takes the risk, and can complete the road sooner than most public agencies, which must follow time-consuming rules for competitive bidding.
After a company has earned a profit from the road, the state takes possession and can drop the tolls. The average motorist might never know the road was privately owned. It would be built to Federal standards and would be patrolled and maintained by state agencies under contract with the private owners.
There appears to be no alternative, some transportation officials say.
''With the unwillingness of the politicians to raise taxes and of the people to pay higher taxes, the alternatives are to build no highways or seek other sources of revenue,'' said Carl B. Williams, an assistant director of the California Department of Transportation.
 
Construction vs. Traffic
That department is soliciting proposals for private financing of toll projects, and 350 companies have shown interest. If this program is successful, Mr. Williams said, the state would probably encourage companies to build a ''substantial'' portion of all its new bridges, highways and tunnels.
The states need new and improved roads, but construction has not kept pace with automobile traffic, mostly because taxes linked to highway improvement have not kept up with the cost of improvements, Federal officials say. Most Federal and state highway money is from gas taxes, but tax revenue has risen only gradually as cars became more fuel-efficient.
The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials estimates that states should be spending a total of $80 billion a year to maintain existing roads and another $21 billion a year to build new ones. But, the association said, the states are only spending $66 billion a year.
''This nation has been unintentionally disinvesting in its surface transportation infrastructure since the 1960's,'' the organization said in a report in October.
 
Roads Virginia Can't Afford
Virginia plans to spend $10 billion on highways in the next decade, but by its own estimates it needs to build an additional $5 billion in roads it cannot afford. Pennsylvania, which temporarily ruined its credit in building highways in the inflationary 1970's, likes the idea of private developers taking the risk. Illinois may not be able to build a 450-mile toll road from Chicago to Kansas City unless private businesses participate. There are also strong opponents. The consumer advocate Ralph Nader said private ownership of roads was a ''terrible idea'' because corporations would charge exorbitant tolls and build only the most profitable projects, the ones easiest for states to finance. John Kenneth Galbraith, a Harvard economist, said, ''Private highways are a fraudulent substitute for the proper course of action, which is to pay for the roads through taxes.''
The American Automobile Association, which has 30 million members, opposes almost all toll projects, public and private. The main reason, said John Archer, an A.A.A. spokesman, is that bond financing makes toll roads several times more expensive than public roads that are paid for with taxes.
 
The Costs of Collecting
Another strike against toll roads is that collection costs alone devour over 15 percent of the tolls, he said. But the association does not oppose toll projects like the proposed Leesburg-Dulles Airport road, which provides an additional route for commuter travel.
This road proposal, in fact, has progressed with a stunning lack of public opposition. Landowners along the route donated land worth an estimated $100 million to make sure the road would be economically feasible. Most of them real estate developers who would benefit.
Mr. Stanley's proposed 14-mile, four-lane thoroughfare, the Dulles Toll Road Extension, would be built in a rural section of Loudoun County. Although traffic is expected to be light initially, it is expected to grow as the residential and commercial development in adjacent Fairfax County spreads outward from Washington. The road would tie into the 11-mile Dulles Toll Road, which links the airport with Interstate 495 and other major highways to Washington. Mr. Stanley said the road would reduce travel time between Leesburg and Washington to 45 minutes from 90.
The proposal faces only one more hurdle: The State Corporation Commission, which is expected to review the company's projected tolls and profit margins this month.
 
Company's Expectations
The company is looking for a relatively high rate of return, 16 to 18 percent, on the investors' equity as well as on the debt incurred to build the $160 million road. The company says this return is justified because of the risk involved in building a road before a region's traffic can support it.
Traffic on the toll road is not expected to be sufficient for the company to turn a profit until 2001. Tolls would initially be $1.50, or the same as the state's Dulles Toll Road, on a per-mile basis, and would gradually be increased to $3.25 by 2010. But toll increases would have to be approved by the state.
If the state approves the company's financial plan, Mr. Stanley and his partners plan to raise money for construction and operation of the road by selling about $25 million in stock to institutional investors and by borrowing about $135 million in the bond market.
Construction would take 24 months and could begin as early as next spring, Mr. Stanley said.
Mr. Stanley, meanwhile, has new projects in sight. He says he has become as fond of failing bridges as he is of traffic jams and is now offering to repair bridges at no cost to a city or state. All it takes, he says, is a temporary toll booth to collect the repair costs and his profits.

HEADLINE: U.S. Advances to World Cup

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Defying a sea of crimson shirts and a scoreless funk of two months, the United States scored the goal it needed today to reach the main round of the World Cup of soccer.
Paul Caligiuri, who had called this ''the biggest game of our lives,'' scored in the 31st minute to allow the United States to defeat Trinidad and Tobago, 1-0, and guarantee a trip to Italy next June.
The United States last reached the final round in 1950. In this eight-game qualifying round for next summer's final round, lack of scoring punch had put the Americans in jeopardy going into today's game. 
The team from the Caribbean republic that was founded in 1962 had stunned the giant nation with a goal in the 88th minute, to tie the United States, 1-1, last May. Because Trinidad and Tobago had a better scoring differential over the course of the qualifying round, it needed only a tie today to advance.
 
No Goals in 239 Minutes
The well-mannered young men representing the United States had not scored a goal since Sept. 17, or in 208 minutes of soccer going into today's game.
That streak was extended by 31 minutes with the home players showing their willingness to counterattack, to keep the Americans from swarming upfield.
Patience has not been an American virtue this year. Going into this game that would either take them to Italy or wreck many hopes and not a few careers, Bob Gansler, the coach, had told them: ''Simple things. Perfectly. As often as possible.'' The United States responded with a patient game. Caligiuri, a 25-year-old from U.C.L.A. who has played in West Germany for three years but has been injured for much of this year's World Cup chase, showed his professional skills in the middle of red uniforms.
 
'I Knew I Had the Space'
Inserted in the center of the midfield because he could handle the quickness of the home players, Caligiuri received a loose ball about 40 yards from the goal. He chipped it right-footed past one defender and then chased it down. His hard left-footed volley from 25 yards swirled hard to the right past Michael Maurice, the goalie, landing in the high right corner.
''We knew we needed a shot,'' Caligiuri said later. ''I knew I had the space. You have to take what they give you.''
By scoring, the Americans had taken the home team out of its first game plan. The home players seemed jittery until halftime and then mounted several good attacks down the left side. But the Americans showed more patience than they have all year, and Tony Meola smothered a few hard shots, particularly on screens in the 85th and 86th minutes.
''We just dropped back and I swept out all the garbage,'' said Mike Windischmann, the only survivor from the 1985 loss to Costa Rica in a game in which a tie would have taken the United States to the last qualifying round.
 
Red Clothes and Black Umbrellas
The goal also minimized the impact of the 30,000 fans, almost all wearing red outfits and many carrying black umbrellas, to create one of the most uniform and impressive sights possible in a soccer stadium, particularly only 100 yards from the glittering sea with green mountains jutting from the other side.
The republic of 1.2 million residents was hoping to become the smallest nation to qualify for the 1990 World Cup. It has never played in the final round, and although emotions were high, the fans were friendly.
''I told my players, 'Pretend they are cheering for you,' '' Gansler said. ''In a way, I think we took energy from the fans.''
There is no such colorful or noisy reception for soccer in the United States, which has been awarded the 1994 World Cup because of the vast corporate money that could be generated there.
 
Legacy of Betrayal
As host in 1994, the American team will automatically be included among the 24 finalists, but these players wanted to earn a berth on their own this year.
The road was made easier when Mexico was banned for falsifying the ages of several junior players and Canada was upset in an early round.
The American players never expected to have to come to this island needing to win to advance. The oil bust has hurt the local economy in the past few years and there has also been a legacy of soccer betrayal since 1973, when officials called back four goals to give Haiti a 2-1 victory. The sport's world governing body later banned the officials, but never ordered the game replayed.
Soccer stayed down here until two years ago when Everald (Gally) Cummings, a member of the 1973 squad and a former player in the North American Soccer League, was appointed coach.
 
Aggressive, Happy Style
Stressing national pride, Cummings installed an aggressive, happy style of soccer, based on the Brazilian ''calypso'' brand, always advancing the ball. He also asked a behavioral psychologist, Dr. Shirley Rudd-Ottley, to work with the team because ''I think Trinidadians function well in a family-oriented situation.''
The goal in the 88th minute in May had haunted the United States for the past six months, but today they slipped through 90 minutes untouched. The drums stopped in the stands, and the champagne began spraying in the Americans' locker room.
''I-ta-ly,'' the players chanted, along with other slogans, as the giant nation celebrated the victory over the tiny nation.
The United States will play three games in the first round next June, and will not be expected to do well, but today the players saved their program and maintained their careers by playing a rewarding and patient 90 minutes in the biggest game of their lives.

How Too Much Success Undid Speaker Jim Wright

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT

 BODY:

The Ambition and the Power
By John M. Barry
768 pages. Viking. $22.95.
In 1986, several months before James Claude Wright Jr. was formally elected Speaker of the House of Representatives, John M. Barry, a former Washington editor of Dun's Business Week, approached Mr. Wright and asked him for his cooperation on a book. Mr. Barry foresaw that Mr. Wright's speakership was going to be an extraordinary exercise of power, so he asked the Congressman for permission to follow him through his daily routine and even to sit in on his private meetings ''so that the book would truly reflect an insider's view of power.''
Against the advice of his senior staff, Mr. Wright agreed. Little did either of them know that the book would be the story of the future Speaker's fall from power. Yet Mr. Barry would make the most of his unique opportunity. Although flawed in several respects, ''The Ambition and the Power'' remains an overwhelmingly powerful story and one of the best political books to be written in several years. 
In it, Mr. Barry unfolds a nearly archetypal drama of hubris and nemesis. When Congressman Wright captured the speakership, he set out to exploit the power of the office as no one had done since Henry Clay in the early 19th century. And in Mr. Barry's view, he very nearly succeeded, surpassing even President Ronald Reagan's White House in controlling the legislative agenda as well as in influencing the course of Central American peace talks involving Nicaragua, the Sandinistas and the contras.
''No Congress in decades could even approach the record of the 100th Congress,'' Mr. Barry writes. ''It had addressed in major initiatives the environment, international trade, health care, the social fabric, economic infrastructure, civil rights. And it had brought peace. All of Wright's agenda had passed, all of it. Every law carried the policy stamp of House Democrats. It was a remarkable record.''
But in helping to compile it, Mr. Wright made bitter enemies. In reshaping the House of Representatives into an instrument of his will, he antagonized Republicans and left many of his own party feeling bruised and restive. And he had left himself highly vulnerable. In the process of his rise he had made errors of judgment that in the right hands could be exploited to his fatal detriment.
Representative Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, concluded: ''If Wright consolidates his power, he will be a very, very formidable man. We have to take him on early to prevent that.'' So the archconservative Republican undertook a calculated campaign built around what he saw as Mr. Wright's ethical lapses. Eventually, in the spring of 1989, it forced the Speaker to resign.
Such a summary, of course, does not even begin to suggest the sweep and detail of Mr. Barry's narrative, which goes back to Jim Wright's Texas boyhood as the lonely son of an itinerant salesman of business ideas, and explores layer by layer and deal by deal the development of the complex personality that lay behind the smiling mask.
We learn of the subtle disillusionment he suffered at one stage of his career, and of his turn to what he much later judged to be greedy practices. But by doing so we also come to understand the truth behind what Mr. Barry persuasively insists were the distortions and exaggerations of the case against Mr. Wright that caused the House ethics committee to vote against him. (For instance, Mr. Barry points out how Richard Phelan, who was hired as outside counsel by the ethics committee, quoted language that had been rejected by the Rules Committee to condemn Mr. Wright falsely for collecting excessive royalties on his book when he was actually taking advantage of a loophole in the rules.) In fact, so detailed is Mr. Barry's narrative that he is afraid to let it speak for itself. Instead he insists on hyping it with italicized phrases in the style of Tom Wolfe and Stephen King, repeated so often that we grow tired of reading phrases from such things as the Speaker's testament (''If they think they do not like me it is because they do not know me.'') or Representative Gingrich's pronouncements (''He creates himself when he acts.'') or Elias Canetti's theory of crowd behavior as enunciated in his book, ''Crowds and Power.''
Nor do the florid metaphors help (''His speakership began to resemble a great python trying to wrap itself about a sleeping tiger, preparing to wrap it in a death grip, the tiger just beginning to stir, one eye alert, preparing to lash out''), nor the author's attraction to cliches like Mme. Defarge knitting or Antaeus renewing himself with the earth, or the world's indifference to tragedy as expressed by W. H. Auden's poem about Icarus's drowning, ''In the Musee des Beaux-Arts.''
Still, it is a measure of Mr. Barry's accomplishment that these shortcomings are made to seem minor by his elevation to the level of Greek tragedy what to many eyes might have seemed an episode of political chicanery. In his final judgment, the Speaker erred by putting ''his shoulder against the edge of the law and the rules'' and pushing ''until he bent back a place'' for his conduct.
But this was hubris, not venality as the ethics committee concluded. If the Speaker was small in his concern for financial security, he was large in his ambition, ''his vision of his role was large, and what he was willing to do to achieve those things was large.'' Shortly before he gave his speech of resignation in the House, Mr. Wright spent a weekend in the Shenandoah Valley. He went for a walk. As Mr. Barry recounts it: ''It was warm. In the 80's. In the foreground was a barn, some hay. Behind them he counted range after range of ancient mountains, so ancient that the world had worn them down to little more than hills. He counted within his view five distinct rings of mountains and imagined the five sets of valleys between them. There was not a sign of men in them, not that he could see, except for the barn immediately before him. He thought for a moment that for all one's ambitions, all one could do was change the foreground a little. He had done that already. He felt at peace, his decision made.''

HEADLINE: Tax Writers Reach Pact to Raise Revenue

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Tax negotiators from the House of Representatives and the Senate have reached a tentative agreement on about $5.3 billion in revenue-raising measures as part of their contribution to a plan Congress is trying to fashion to reduce the deficit.
The agreement, which also includes about $2.2 billion in tax changes that would lose money for the Treasury, is tentative because the tax writers are waiting for more detailed revenue estimates before formally accepting the accord.
The revenue provisions mostly affect business but include a $3-a-ticket increase in the tax on international flights and a new $6-a-ticket tax on international cruises that would be paid for by consumers.
The lawmakers are still at odds over unrelated provisions dealing with spending for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, which fall under the jurisdictions of the tax committees. 
 
Rare Session at the Capitol
Called to the Capitol for a rare Sunday session, the lawmakers scrambled to complete their work on the deficit plan and to resolve the fate of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act so they can end their legislative year before Thanksgiving. But the Senate rejected a conference agreement to repeal the act, which is intended to protect 33 million older Americans from the high cost of extended illness. Their action means that the current law continues in effect.
The deficit-reduction plan, which has been under negotiation for weeks, is aimed at producing enough budget savings for this fiscal year so that Congress can lift the $16.1 billion in across-the-board spending cuts imposed by President Bush on Oct. 16. The cuts were required by Federal law because Congress and the President failed to agree on their own deficit-cutting plan by that date.
Mr. Bush has warned that he will veto the Congressional plan unless it achieves at least $14 billion in ''real'' deficit reduction without accounting gimmicks. Republicans in the House and Senate said the plan now taking shape falls at least $5 billion to $6 billion short of that goal.
 
Extensions on Tax Breaks
While lawmakers may need several more days to resolve that problem, the final tax measures are expected to remain essentially as the negotiators decided in a bargaining session that concluded in the early hours of Saturday morning. They include a one-year extension, through Dec. 31, 1990, of a dozen popular tax breaks that have either expired or are scheduled to expire at the end of this year.
The tax breaks include credits to companies for research and development spending, credits to employers for hiring economically disadvantaged workers and to investors in low-income housing. The breaks would cost the Treasury about $1.7 billion in the current 1990 fiscal year.
Despite his campaign pledge of no new taxes, President Bush agreed with Congress in the spring that at least $5.3 billion in revenue would be needed to help meet this year's deficit- reduction goals. While many of the revenue-producing tax changes contemplated under the negotiators' agreement can be classified as closing of loopholes, some, like the fees on international flights and cruises, are clearly tax increases. The airline and cruise taxes would apply to tickets bought after Dec. 31.
The corporate tax changes include a new tax on the production of ozone depleting chemicals, a speed-up in collection of payroll taxes withheld by employers, new restrictions on deductions available to banks that lend money to employee stock ownership plans and new restrictions on tax breaks for companies involved in leveraged buyouts. Tax writers also agreed to impose a 5-cent-a-barrel tax on oil producers to pay for cleaning up oil spills.
 
Biggest Help
The biggest revenue raiser is the payroll tax speed-up, which would bring the Treasury an estimated $2.4 billion in fiscal 1990. Effective Aug. 1, 1990, employers would be required to make payroll tax withholding payments to the Internal Revenue Service within a day of the time the amounts withheld from employee paychecks reach $100,000.
Under current law, most employers make withholding payments to the I.R.S. on a schedule that allows them at least three banking days before payments are due. Thus companies with smaller payrolls that do not reach the $100,000 withholding threshold would not be affected by the change.
Republicans protested today that the payroll tax change was an accounting gimmick, but Democrats asserted that it would produce real revenue.

Book Industry's Confidence Hurt by Shake-Ups and Cuts

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
For the first time within decades, the book industry is beset by a crisis of confidence. While heads of houses still exude optimism in their public statements, in private it is difficult to find a publisher of general-interest books who has not been shaken in the last year - and especially in the last few weeks.
This uncertainty was more noticeable than ever in conversations during and after the annual Literary Guild publishing party last week at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan. A number of publishing executives were still bewildered by the recent turmoil at Random House and Penguin USA and by the large write-off at Simon & Schuster. 
Many are concerned that the industry may be jeopardizing its long-term investments in books and authors for short-term financial gains.
The industry has its share of problems. Sales of general-interest books, known as trade books, have been in a slump for about a year. Sales of hardcover fiction were particularly poor last summer, falling an estimated 16 percent from a year earlier.
Adding to the pressures on profits are the huge advances that publishers continue to pay for big-name authors. Sometimes they know they will never earn the money back, but they pay it to keep authors from going to a competitor. And many smaller advances are being written off as well.
Book publishing has historically been punctuated by peaks and valleys, so publishers have tended to be optimistic even during prolonged downturns. Yet the current malaise and confusion are so striking, and so disturbing, because they appear to be caused by problems unrelated to the cyclical nature of publishing.
Even considered in isolation, the events of the last several weeks have been unsettling:
* Random House named Alberto Vitale to replace Robert L. Bernstein, who headed the company for 23 years. Mr. Vitale, the president of Bantam Doubleday Dell, is widely believed to have been called in to make Random House leaner and to increase the profits.
* E. P. Dutton's 137-year-old adult trade book division was eliminated, leaving it only an imprint within Penguin. And a few days later, the bearer of the bad news for Dutton, Robert G. Diforio, the chairman of the New American Library, was told by Penguin that his employment contract would not be renewed.
* Simon & Schuster, the largest American book publisher, said it was taking a $140 million pretax write-off against its earnings.
* And there was speculation that another large publishing house would report a significant write-off after its board meeting early next month.
What makes those events foreboding is that they appear to be related. The appointment of Mr. Vitale is widely thought to presage for Random House the kind of ''consolidation'' - that is, layoffs and retirements - that Peter Mayer, the chairman of Penguin USA, has implemented at E. P. Dutton and the New American Library. Mr. Vitale quietly took such steps at Doubleday and Dell in the two years since they were acquired by Bantam.
Simon & Schuster's surprisingly large write-off was the result of the general softness in consumer publishing and its mounting expenses, including the advances it paid authors for books that did not sell enough copies to earn back their investment.
What is sending chills throughout the industry is that Random House, Penguin and Simon & Schuster are among the industry elite - well-financed companies that often publish good books, often pay big money and presumably have the know-how to make a decent profit. Moreover, all three are international publishers.
So if their profit margins are not what they should be, or if sales of their general-interest books are less than robust, industry executives wonder what that portends for other houses? And if the leading houses feel compelled to close divisions, write off losses and trim staff, what does that say about the publishing assumption that bigger is necessarily better? Or that acquisitions and mergers would result in a stronger, more professional publishing industry?
Many publishing executives who once did not question the conventional wisdom are now having serious second thoughts. One question they are asking is not only whether it is bad for publishers to collect other publishing houses like some people collect baseball cards or stamps, but whether such takeovers are even all that good for the acquirers. Are the economies of scale that apply to manufacturing incompatible with book publishing, where editors acquire books individually and where most books are different from one another?
These executives are also asking whether big publishing enterprises are so burdened with debt that they have no choice but to slash the payrolls and often the number of titles published? Do big publishing enterprises stifle creativity by piling layers of management upon editorial staffs, sales forces and the other departments directly concerned with publishing books?
One chief executive argued that while general-interest book publishing was in a slump, other types of publishing were ''extremely healthy'' - especially in such areas as textbooks and children's books.
Still, the doubts and the worry are pervasive. One high publishing executive, who himself has figured in much recent speculation, suggested that the weaknesses underscored by the events in the last few weeks may be endemic to the industry.
Another top executive said business was fine at his recently merged company. ''But,'' he added, ''ask me again in six months.''
Perhaps the gloomiest recent assessment came from a publishing veteran who said that, for the first time, he was looking forward to his impending retirement. Why? Because he did not like the direction in which publishing has been headed, nor did he know how to change it.
And one executive - saying that he was being only slightly melodramatic - described the situation with a quote from Yeats: ''Things fall apart; the center cannot hold.''

HEADLINE: Data Are Signaling Bad Slump

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
With the release of each week's data, the message is growing clear: the United States economy is suffering from a severe downturn, perhaps the worst of the last seven years.
This month brings the seventh anniversary of the economic expansion that began after the 1982 recession, an unusually long period of prosperity that nevertheless was nearly interrupted by two earlier downturns, in 1984 and 1986. The current one began to show itself in late summer.
The economy bounced back quickly from the two earlier slumps, and most economists speak of a similar revival this time. But there is an undertone of uncertainty in their reassurances. 
''We lack the rebound potential of 1986 and 1984,'' said Nigel Gault, a senior economist at McGraw Hill-Data Resources Inc., which expects a rebound. Mr. Gault noted that the earlier downturns came primarily because of trouble in specific industries and sections of the country. ''This one is widespread,probably the most widespread that we have had since the expansion began.''
 
Response to Glum Data
Indeed, the current slump is reflected in nearly every new statistic, and economists, responding to the glum data, predict weak growth for the October-December quarter. Fifty forecasters, surveyed monthly by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, for example, say the gross national product, the total value of goods and services produced in the nation, will grow at an annual rate of only 1.2 percent.
''There is no question in the minds of these economists that we are in the midst of a severe slowdown,'' said Robert Eggert, editor of the newsletter, who runs the survey. ''The 1.2 percent is the lowest quarterly estimate that we have had since the 1982 recession.''
While a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of G.N.P. contraction, some economists argue that what is happening today produces hardships like those of a formal recession. ''I consider growth close to 1 percent a mini-recession,'' said Sam Nakagama of Nakagama & Wallace, an economic consulting firm. ''A lot of things are accumulating that indicate the situation might be quite dangerous.''
Until recently, the expectation was that economic growth would remain at 2 percent or more. Indeed, the G.N.P. grew in the third quarter at a 2.5 percent annual rate. Not since 1986 has there been a quarter with an expansion below a 2.5 percent rate.
 
Auto Sales Hurting
The deterioration shows up above all in auto sales and new-home construction, both lately at levels close to those of the 1981-82 recession. Real estate prices, which had risen for more than a decade, are flat now or falling nearly everywhere except the Portland-Seattle area.
Appliances, computers and other ''big ticket'' items are selling poorly, and while there is demand for clothing, toys and other ''soft goods,'' retailers say they can sustain sales only by cutting prices sharply. The price cutting even includes furriers and fast-food outlets.
Corporate profits have fallen since last winter. This decline is blamed partly on price cutting and also on production cutbacks as many businesses hold down new orders to avoid accumulating inventory they may not be able to sell. Whatever the reasons, fewer jobs are being created than early this year, and businesses everywhere are cutting back on spending, a tactic that ripples through the economy.
 
First Time Since '82
One ripple has hurt car rentals, which rely heavily on corporate accounts. Frank A. Olson, chairman of the Hertz Corporation, said that for the first time since the 1982 recession car rental revenue is growing at less than 10 percent throughout the country.
Another ripple has hurt Caterpillar Inc. and the Cummins Engine Company, which make engines for tractor-trailers, which transport most of the nation's products from factories, warehouses and docks to their final destinations. ''Our engine sales are off sharply, and that is a leading indicator that fewer goods are being shipped,'' said Don V. Fites, Caterpillar's president.
Finally, three forces that drove the economy in recent years are disappearing now. One is the boom in exports. Overseas sales are leveling off, partly because the dollar's value has risen this year, making American products more expensive abroad. In addition, the 48-day strike at the Boeing Company is expected to reduce exports until early next year, even if the strike ends this week. Boeing alone accounts for $1 billion a month in overseas sales.
 
Less Military
A second waning force is military spending, which is being cut back as East-West tensions ease and the Administration tries to reduce the budget deficit. ''All of the defense contractors in the West have announced staff reductions,'' said Jerry L. Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles.
Perhaps most important, until recently, steel, chemicals, paper, aluminum and other key materials had seemed in short supply. Demand for them had backed up orders, and factories were operating at full capacity. The situation has reversed today. Nearly every raw material is in oversupply, and the prices of some - for example, steel sheets - have fallen by as much as 20 percent.
''The weakness in the economy comes from a broadly distributed sense that supply has achieved dominance over demand,'' wrote Albert T. Sommers, a senior economist at the Conference Board.
The upshot is that inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, has fallen to an annual rate below 5 percent in recent months, from one well above that level earlier this year. With the decline in inflation, the Federal Reserve has allowed interest rates to decline, slowly at first but more rapidly since early October, to avoid a recession.
The central bank acknowledged as much on Friday, in the release of a summary of a policy meeting held in early October. Acknowledging a readiness to reduce rates, the summary stated that ''the risks to the expansion were more heavily toward a shortfall from current expectations than toward faster growth and greater inflationary pressures.''
 
Blaming the Fed
Many economists have said the current slowdown is primarily the result of the Fed's decision to push interest rates up sharply to fight inflation. With higher rates, the Fed tried to reduce the pressure on prices by discouraging spending based on credit.
The strategy apparently worked, and now that interest rates are declining, the hope of many economists is that consumers and business executives will spend again, and in so doing create a revival.
''Rare is the economy that declines in an environment of falling interest rates,'' said Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. Mr. Roach and others put their faith in consumers. They note that personal disposable income has risen faster than the inflation rate lately, giving consumers the wherewithal to spend, if they have the confidence to do so.
That confidence exists, according to the University of Michigan's October survey of consumer sentiment, released last week, although the survey says consumers today ''are apprehensive about the future course of the economy.''
 
Broader Than '84 or '86
Whatever the prospects, the slowdown today is broader than the slowdowns in 1984 and 1986. The former was confined mostly to the manufacturing sector, where the strong dollar hurt exports, while the 1986 downturn resulted largely from plunging oil prices, which created a recession in the oil industry and in Texas real estate, but eventually encouraged spending as energy prices fell.
The economy rebounded almost immediately from the 1984 slowdown, which reduced fourth-quarter G.N.P. growth that year to 1.7 percent. (The first quarter of 1985 was a lusty 4.9 percent.) The 1986 slowdown hit harder, with the economy contracting at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in the second quarter and growing at only eight-tenths of 1 percent in the third.
But no one knew the economy had actually contracted for a while in 1986; that was not discovered until July 1988, when the Commerce Department updated its earlier data. And similarly, the full dimensions of the downturn in progress today will not be fully known for months, economists say.

HEADLINE: Bid Is Raised To $3.8 Billion For Nekoosa

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
The Georgia-Pacific Corporation yesterday raised its offer for the Great Northern Nekoosa Corporation to $3.8 billion, or $63 a share, from $3.1 billion, or $58 a share.
In a terse statement, Great Northern acknowledged receipt of the revised offer and said its board would meet tomorrow to review it.
T. Marshall Hahn Jr., Georgia-Pacific's chairman, sent a letter to William R. Laidig, the chairman and chief executive of Great Northern, urging the rival paper company to accept the proposal and repeating his request for a meeting.
Georgia-Pacific, which holds 349,900 Great Northern shares, or less than 1 percent, said it was seeking a special meeting of Great Northern's shareholders to vote on a resolution approving the new offer. Under Great Northern's 1988 shareholder rights plan, Georgia-Pacific has the right to demand such a meeting. 
Georgia-Pacific made its initial offer on Oct. 31. Great Northern's board rejected the bid on Nov. 13.
 
Investors Expect Higher Bid
Great Northern's stock has been trading above the level of the original offer, indicating that investors believed a new, higher bid was in the offing. On the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, the shares closed at $61, down 12.5 cents.
''Our increased price makes an already fair offer even fairer,'' Mr. Hahn said in his letter yesterday. He denied Great Northern's contention that the combined company could not handle the debt it would carry if the merger was completed.
''The increased offer enhances the appeal to the shareholder to tender into our offer and to vote their proxies for our offer in the meeting we've demanded,'' Mr. Hahn said in an interview yesterday.
 
Antitrust Violation Seen
In rejecting the first Georgia-Pacific offer, Great Northern's board said it was inadequate and would violate antitrust laws. Great Northern, based in Norwalk, Conn., filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Bridgeport, Conn., seeking an injunction against the takeover on antitrust grounds.
Mr. Laidig has argued in a letter to shareholders that if the takeover was completed the combined company would be saddled with a debt load of $4.5 billion.
Mr. Hahn responded to Great Northern's assertions by attacking the company's defense tactics.
''Vexatious litigation and delaying tactics serve only to cause needless anxiety among your employees and to take value out of your shareholders' pockets,'' he said in his letter. Mr. Hahn also said he believed that the antitrust suit brought by Great Northern was an attempt to delay the offer but that the revised offer would win over the company's shareholders.
 
'Appeals to Shareholders'
''One of the reasons for leaving ourselves some room was to be able to negotiate a friendly transaction,'' Mr. Hahn said. ''Raising the price further encourages the Great Northern board to come to the table and it also appeals to shareholders.''
Georgia-Pacific, which is based in Atlanta, also announced that it would file an amended complaint in its lawsuit filed in Maine, which contends that Great Northern's board breached its fiduciary duty in rejecting the original offer, and in challenging the recent adoption of additional employee benefits and enriched executive compensation agreements, or golden parachutes.
The Georgia-Pacific bid for Nekoosa has shaken up the small almost gentlemanly world of the paper industry. Paper company executives said the takeover battle signals a more aggressive acquisition posture that some will have to adopt if they hope to grow.
 
Bleak Earnings Forecast
After two years of heady growth in the industry, many analysts are forecasting lower paper prices and bleak earnings during the next few years. In addition, some are predicting that as the paper market weakens some companies may begin to seek economies of scale by making acquisitions.
Shares of Georgia-Pacific closed up 62.5 cents, at $48.125, on Friday. Georgia-Pacific extended the expiration date of its buyout offer to Dec. 4.

HEADLINE: Greenspan's Lincoln Savings Regret

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
In late 1984, Alan Greenspan, then a private citizen, took on a consulting assignment for the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., and its owner, Charles H. Keating Jr. Five years later, Mr. Greenspan, as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is finding that four-month job a source of embarrassment and regret.
''When I first met the people from Lincoln, they struck me as reasonable, sensible people who knew what they were doing,'' Mr. Greenspan said in an interview last week. ''I don't want to say I am distressed, but the truth is I really am. I am thoroughly surprised by what has happened to Lincoln.''
Lincoln was taken over by Federal regulators in April in an action that is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion. Mr. Keating was removed from control. 
 
No Conflict Seen
To be sure, no one in Washington is saying that Mr. Greenspan has compromised either his integrity or that of his office. And they add that consulting work done when he was a private economist should pose no conflict in his current role as one of the nation's top banking regulators.
Members of Congress and banking analysts say the issue for Mr. Greenspan, a highly respected economist, is one of appearance. And his critics ask why he did not spot the germ of future troubles at Lincoln.
The Justice Department is investigating Mr. Keating, the failure of Lincoln and also the five Senators who accepted contributions from Mr. Keating. The Senate Ethics Committee has hired a special counsel to investigate the Senators' actions.
Mr. Greenspan concedes that he misjudged the ultimate intention of Mr. Keating and Lincoln's management. ''Of course I'm embarrassed by my failure to foresee what eventually transpired,'' he said. ''I was wrong about Lincoln. I was wrong about what they would ultimately do and the problems they would utlimately create.''
Mr. Greenspan's views in the winter of 1984-85 are being used now by Lincoln's past and present supporters in the fall of 1989 in their own defense.
In late 1984, Mr. Greenspan, head of an economic forecasting firm, Townsend-Greenspan & Company, was retained by the New York law firm of Paul Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison for four months. Mr. Greenspan says he does not remember how much he was paid but that it was at his usual rate.
 
Heavily Involved in Development
He was asked to conduct a study on real estate investment, known in the savings industry as direct investments, by savings and loan associations. Mr. Keating, Lincoln and its parent company, the American Continental Corporation, were heavily involved in real estate development.
He was also to study Lincoln's financial condition, and if he considered the institution stable, to write officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco supporting an application by Mr. Keating for an exemption for Lincoln to a bank board rule forbidding substantial amounts of such investments. Mr. Greenspan sent such a letter in February 1985. Lincoln did not receive the exemption.
A spokesman for Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and one of the Senators whose intervention with Federal regulators on behalf of Lincoln two years later, in early 1987, is the subject of the Senate and Justice Department inquiries, said that ''Senator McCain has cited the Greenspan study many times as a powerful force in his approach to Lincoln.''
The other four Senators involved in the inquiry are Democrats: Alan Cranston of California, the majority whip; Dennis DeConcini of Arizona; Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan and John Glenn of Ohio.
 
Same Conclusions Today
Mr. Greenspan says that if he had the same assignment today, confronted with the same evidence he had in 1984, his conclusions about Lincoln and about development projects in the industry as a whole would be very much the same.
The issue at the time was whether ownership by savings and loan associations in real estate projects and other commercial ventures posed excessive risk. Mr. Greenspan, long a proponent of deregulation, argued then - and does still - that the laws Congress passed in setting up the savings industry would eventually drive it into a crisis, because institutions would be making their money from interest on 30-year fixed mortgages while having to pay depositors interest rates that at times fluctuated wildly.
Mr. Greenspan and others argued that if the industry could diversify its mix of business by adding more short-term lending, like loans on development projects, savings institutions would be cushioned from the potentially disastrous effects of rising interest rates.
 
Limitation Was Planned
The Federal Home Loan Bank Board believed that such direct investments posed an excessive risk to the industry. In late 1984, when it was planning to adopt a regulation that would have limited those activities to 10 percent of an institution's activities, Mr. Greenspan was hired by the law firm on behalf of Lincoln.
He submitted his study on direct investment to the bank board, but it adopted the regulation limiting such real estate investments anyway. Then Mr. Greenspan wrote the regulators, asking that Lincoln be given an exemption from the new rule.
Mr. Greenspan described Lincoln's management as ''seasoned and expert in selecting and making direct investments,'' as having a ''long and continuous track record of outstanding success in making sound and profitable direct investments,'' as succeeding ''in a relatively short period of time in reviving an association that had become badly burdened by a large portfolio of long-term fixed-rate mortgages'' and that it had ''restored the association to a vibrant and healthy state, with a strong net worth position.''
 
View on Direct Investments
Asked last week about his view of direct investments, Mr. Greenspan said: ''What I argued then, and argue now, is that direct investments are risky. If you give me two institutions, one that has a mix of short-term direct investments and long-term mortgages properly capitalized, or the same financing structure but invested only in long-term mortgages, I would say the first institution may well be safer.''
The problem was that as the economy in the Southwest collapsed in 1986, so did the value of the direct investments made by savings and loan institutions, many of which have since failed. This summer, Congress passed a $159 billion 10-year bailout of the industry.
Although Mr. Greenspan's connections with Lincoln and Mr. Keating were raised at his confirmation hearings in 1987, they were of passing concern. Mr. Greenspan says he has met Mr. Keating twice, and has had no contact with Mr. Keating or Lincoln associates since early 1985.
 
Troubled by Assertions
What appears to bother Mr. Greenspan most are the assertions of the Senators that his letter to the regulators led them to believe intervention on Lincoln's behalf was warranted.
''How could anyone use any evaluation I would have made in early 1985 as justification more than two years later?'' he asks. ''No one ever called saying, 'Do you still hold these views.' It's almost as bad as saying, 'I just read a report written two years ago that Amalgamated Widgets is a good stock to buy.' It just doesn't make sense.''
Could Mr. Greenspan have seen the handwriting on the wall on Lincoln, particularly signals that Mr. Keating's plans for Lincoln were far too ambitious and risky, as some critics maintain?
 
Doubling of Size Cited
Bert Ely, a financial consultant in Alexandria, Va., who recently reviewed the Lincoln case, noted that during 1984 - the first year that Mr. Keating owned Lincoln - the institution's financial statements raised red flags. Lincoln doubled in size, from an institution with $1.1 billion in assets at the end of 1983 to one with $2.24 billion a year later. Its depositors' money was going to investments in raw land and unrelated businesses, which soared from $6.6 million to $308 million.
''Any time you double in size, particularly of that magnitude, that should be a warning sign,'' Mr. Ely said. ''Rapid growth is a very risky strategy.''
Still, members of Congress and banking experts doubt that the damage to the Federal Reserve's chairman will be great.
 
Mistake 'Now Meaningless'
''The possible mistake in judgment that was made in 1984 and 1985 is now meaningless,'' said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association. ''He has done a superb job as chairman of the Fed.''
But Clifford L. Brody, a financial consultant in Washington, warned that while the Keating involvement was not likely to hurt Mr. Greenspan in his conduct of monetary policy, it would make it harder for him to champion bold new deregulatory steps for the banking industry in general.
''I think you will find it will hinder him from being in the forefront of the debate,'' Mr. Brody said. ''Because every time banking deregulation is mentioned, he will be concerned that in the back of people's minds will be the ghost of Charles Keating.''

Electronic Niches Provide Growth

BYLINE: By Phillip H. Wiggins

 BODY:
DESPITE problems facing the $42 billion electronics components industry, some smaller companies in high-growth niche markets are showing significant earnings momentum.
The industry's troubles were recently underscored by disappointing third-quarter earnings reports from two corporate giants, the Zenith Electronics Corporation and Motorola Inc.
Still, Wall Street analysts see promise in selected smaller electronics companies serving growth markets, including local area networks, cellular telephones, medical equipment, airport security systems and military display systems. Some are trading at price/earnings ratios below the current stock market P/E of about 13, several analysts said. 
While large electronics companies also have operations in these niche markets, the bulk of their revenues is derived from slower growing or no-growth business sectors, analysts say.
Of course, some of the smaller companies with strong niche markets at present are potentially vulnerable to adverse factors, like technological breakthroughs that would make their products obsolete, future recessions and a possible inability to raise capital fast enough to finance growth.
Benefiting from the boom in local area networks - a faster, more efficient system that allows peripheral computers to share information without going through a mainframe - is North Hills Electronics Inc., of Glen Cove, L.I., which trades over the counter. The company manufactures baluns, or adapters, which allow incompatible computer systems to communicate.
Jerome Ballen of Fahnestock & Company said North Hills' earnings could reach 17 to 20 cents a share in fiscal 1990, ending Jan. 31, up from 13 cents a share in 1989. The stock closed Friday at $1.75, down 12.5 cents.
The Del Electronics Corporation, an over-the-counter company based in Mount Vernon, N.Y., makes power supply systems and components used by medical, industrial and military companies. In the medical industry, for example, Del provides high-voltage components used in laser surgery and CT scans.
Recently the company announced plans to acquire RFI Inc. of Bay Shore, L.I., a $10 million subsidiary of KDI Holdings of New York. Assuming that the RFI acquisition is completed, analysts estimate that Del Electronics will earn 40 to 45 cents a share in 1990, ending July 31, up from 30 cents a share reported in fiscal 1989. The stock finished the week at $4.25.
The Kent Electronics Corporation of Houston distributes electronic connectors, cable assemblies and related products. The company also serves the local area network market with interconnect products used in voice and data communications.
In its fiscal year ended March 31, Kent reported earnings of 69 cents a share, up from 60 cents a year earlier. ''Internal growth has been exceeding our expectations,'' said Mark Jordan, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. He said he expected Kent to earn 80 cents a share in fiscal 1990 and 85 cents a share in fiscal 1991, not reflecting the potential effect of acquisitions. The stock closed Friday at $8.25, up 25 cents, on the American Stock Exchange.
Paul Johnson, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., likes the Dallas Semiconductor Corporation. Dallas Semiconductor makes proprietary electronics products for original equipment manufacturers. Analysts say this approach limits the company's vulnerability to pricing volatility.
Mr. Johnson expects Dallas Semiconductor's earnings to grow 50 percent in 1989 and at a rate of 30 to 35 percent over the next several years. He said 1989 earnings should rise to 45 cents a share from 30 cents a share in 1988. He foresees another gain, to 60 cents a share, in 1990. The stock closed Friday at $6.875, down 25 cents, in over-the-counter trading.
The Nu Horizons Electronics Corporation, based in Amityville, L.I., has attracted the attention of some analysts. The company distributes both active components like memory chips and passive components like capacitors and resistors.
Ted Allocca Sr., at G. K. Scott & Company, a brokerage firm based in Plainview, L.I., expects Nu Horizons to earn 25 cents a share in fiscal 1990, ending Feb. 28, up from 17 cents the preceding year, and about 40 cents a share in fiscal 1991. The stock closed unchanged Friday at $2.125 on the American Stock Exchange.
''Nu Horizons has put together an explosive high-tech line,'' Mr. Allocca said. ''They have about four or five companies that have developed products that have the potential to make any of them another Intel.''

Canada's Dollar Defies the Trend

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
While the yen, the West German mark and other European currencies have fallen against a strong American dollar this year, the Canadian dollar has been the odd man out: it has risen in value.
In addition, Canada's dollar has outperformed the other ''high-yield currencies,'' which are attractive to investors because of their countries' high interest rates. These include the British pound and the Australian dollar, which have both declined this year.
But the strong currency is a mixed blessing for Canada. It is helping to slow inflation by making imports cheaper. At the same time, however, it is resulting in higher imports and lower exports, hurting businesses ranging from producers of wood products to oil companies and film production. 
 
Wider Deficit Expected
In the last year, Canadians have taken 30 percent more day trips to the United States, where their dollar now buys more and gasoline is cheaper. Because of this, economists estimate that Canada's current account deficit - trade in merchandise, services and investments - will widen by at least 50 percent this year.
The Canadian experience shows that a country's monetary policy, and the resulting interest rates, has a dominant effect on foreign exchange rates, economists say. In this case, negative factors like a rapidly deteriorating trade balance or a domestic budget deficit have not weakened the currency. And the impact of a nation's monetary policy is greater if the marketplace believes that the Government will hold to that policy.
At the end of 1988, the Canadian dollar was worth 83.9 cents in United States currency. On Friday, it reached 85.57 cents, up almost 2 percent for the year and just off its nine-year high of 85.76 cents on Nov. 9.
In the same period, the Japanese yen has fallen 15 percent in value against the American dollar and the West German mark has dropped 4 percent. Among the other high-yield currencies, the British pound reached its recent high against the dollar near the end of 1988, and is down by 13 percent so far this year. The Australian dollar, which reached its recent peak against the dollar early this year, has declined almost 9 percent.
The Canadian dollar has been strong this year because of the Bank of Canada's continued and determined effort, supported by the Government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, to slow the economy and lower inflation.
 
Battle Began in '87
This battle, which began in earnest in 1987, has lifted the Canadian dollar off the floor. It had begun to drop in 1976, when it was at par with the American dollar, and the fall stopped at an all-time low of 69 cents in February 1986. Since then, the Canadian dollar has risen 24 percent.
But the recently strong Canadian economy has been stubbornly growing, and the Bank of Canada has had to push key interest rates so high that they now exceed the customary spread of 150 basis points above United States rates.
With these key rates now above 12 percent, the spread is now more than 400 basis points, up from an already high 250 basis points at the beginning of this year. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.
This widening interest-rate differential is especially attractive for currency speculators, who want to take advantage of the higher interest-rate earnings.
The spread widened even more in the second week of November when the Federal Reserve in the United States took another step to ease interest rates as the American economy showed signs of slowing. But the Bank of Canada did not ease, sending the Canadian dollar to its nine-year high.
 
Dramatic Impact
The cumulative impact of this policy on Canada's trade balace has been dramatic. The current account deficit, which was $10.3 billion in Canadian currency in 1988, is projected to be $15 billion to $17 billion this year. But it may not be as alarming as a similar jump in the United States trade deficit, some economists said, because some negative factors could improve next year.
For example, Larry Greenberg, international economist at Ried Thunberg in Westport, Conn., said the Canadian trade figures have been skewed by a boom in capital spending, which has resulted in higher machinery imports. But these imports may be starting to moderate, economists say. In addition, a decline in wheat sales, because of last year's drought, is likely to be countered by sales from this year's harvest.
But a third negative factor is likely to continue next year: since nearly 80 percent of Canada's trade is with the United States, the slowing American economy has hurt Canadian exports.
For most economists and foreign exchange traders, the Canadian dollar's ability to sustain its strength has been the biggest surprise.
 
'Bank of Canada Was Tougher'
''People had expected the Canadian dollar to go lower,'' said Peter Frick, a foreign exchange economist at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. ''But the Bank of Canada was tougher than expected.''
John Grant, chief economist at Wood Gundy Inc. in Toronto, said the Bank of Canada and its governor, John Crow, had outwitted the market for now. ''We're not in a situation where the market will take a run at the bank and force them to prove themselves,'' he said. ''Crow's outgunned the market.''
Many Canadian economists expect their dollar to fall next year, however, because they predict that years of high interest rates will finally slow the economy, which is still growing at about a 3 percent rate. Some even expect an economic downturn.
But this scenario assumes that the Bank of Canada will soon ease interest rates. But that may not happen, because inflation remains a concern.
Economists including Bryan Griffiths, senior vice president for foreign exchange at the Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto, note that wage settlements are rising, not falling, coming in at 5.1 percent in the second quarter and 5.9 percent in the third quarter. And inflation, which declined slightly in 1988, is rising. The Canadian consumer price index is projected to rise about 5 percent this year, up from 4 percent in 1988.

Ads to Join Details in Congressional Quarterly

BYLINE: By ALBERT SCARDINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The ghost of Nelson P. Poynter floats over the offices of Congressional Quarterly these days with one eyebrow raised.
The magazine that Mr. Poynter founded with his second wife, Henrietta, in 1946 as a chronicler of the proceedings on Capitol Hill will begin to accept advertising in January, ending a 53-year tradition of giving readers just the cold, hard facts of legislative business.
Mr. Poynter, who also owned The St. Petersburg Times in Florida, died in 1978. In their offices overlooking Rock Creek Park, a few miles west of Capitol Hill, the men who now run the company often ask the ghost what Mr. Poynter would have thought about their decision to let others buy access to the magazine's audience to deliver commercial messages. 
 
An Expensive Alternative
"Have we tampered with something sacred?" asks Robert W. Merry, the managing editor of the company's Congressional publications, including The Weekly Report. "Subscribers used to read us with a pen in hand, but they don't have time for that anymore," he pleads with the ghost. "They need something different than a civics-class view of Congress, and producing an alternative can be expensive."
CQ, as the magazine is universally known in Washington, won a loyal following among librarians, journalists and Government staff members during the Poynters' stewardship by providing details about the performance of the legislative branch. As a market, those groups stopped growing in the last decade, so circulation stagnated at about 10,000 weekly.
To hold onto its subscribers, the magazine changed its appearance earlier this year by adding limited color and graphics. But its publishers see little room to raise more revenue by increasing circulation or the subscription price, already as high as $1,075 a year.
 
'Symbol of Editorial Integrity'
Producing a livelier, more analytical magazine requires a professional staff that must be paid more than the law students Mr. Poynter used to hire in the 1950's, says Neil Skene, the executive editor. "I know that the lack of ads stood as a symbol of editorial integrity," he says to the ghost, "but our competitors all take ads now. We think of it as a financial opportunity for us and a service for our readers."
Wayne P. Kelley, the publisher, comes to the conversations with the specter after doing his homework. "We've talked to hundreds of our readers," Mr. Kelley says. "They said they wouldn't mind as long as it did not interfere with the quality of the product. Besides, growth has been flat in the 80's."
Mr. Kelley's boss, Andrew E. Barnes, does not believe in ghosts. Mr. Barnes is the chairman of the Times Publishing Company, which owns The St. Petersburg Times and several business magazines, as well as Congressional Quarterly.
"Nelson thought you could provide an authoritative stenographic service on a low budget and charge a high price to a few subscribers," Mr. Barnes said. "The economics of doing that don't work any longer."
 
An Awkward Name
No one knows why the company and the magazine continue to have the word "Quarterly" in the title. The magazine became a weekly almost at the outset, carrying the awkward name Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report. "We thought about changing it, but what would we call it?" Mr. Merry said.
The 233 staff members who work in the Washington headquarters also produce newsletters and special research reports and organize conferences for private clients.
Last year, the company introduced Washington Alert, an electronic publishing service, to provide immediate delivery of much of the data now in the magazine - including the text of legislation, roll-call votes and the status of bills in committee.
Congressional Quarterly Inc. accounts for about 9 percent of Times Publishing's annual revenues of $225 million, or about $20 million. The privately held company does not release its earnings, but Mr. Barnes said the subsidiary has not earned its share of the profits in recent years.
"If the magazine is going to be vital, it has to make some money," Mr. Barnes said.
 
Money-Loser for 10 Years
 The Poynters did not place a high value on profits at Congressional Quarterly, at least not in the beginning. The magazine lost money for at least 10 years after its founding, according to company executives.
"It was started as a service for newspaper editorial writers who could not afford their own Washington bureaus," Mr. Merry said. "It wasn't until librarians and trade associations in Washington began to use it in the 1960's that it became a profitable enterprise."
By 1969 it had become a research tool indispensable for anyone responsible for tracking legislation through Congress. But that year, most of the editorial staff resigned to start a similar publication covering the executive branch, The National Journal.
In the early 1980's, The National Journal decided to broaden its appeal. The writing became more analytical, competing in many ways with the national weekly news magazines. Still, only a few thousand readers could pay the subscription price of several hundred dollars a year.
 
'We Tiptoed In'
John Fox Sullivan, the publisher of The National Journal, said his magazine decided then to accept ads from companies and trade groups.
"We went through our share of angst about how advertising might change the way our readers viewed us," he said. "When we finally decided to go ahead, we tiptoed in."
Mr. Sullivan remembers telling Mr. Kelley that he expected the competition to follow suit. "I said it wouldn't kill him to take ads," he said. "Poynter might roll over in his grave, but it's free money."
However free it may be, Mr. Kelley said it would amount to no more than $2 million a year. He said most of the ads would probably come from Government contractors and lobbying groups. The magazine will increase its size to include as many as 20 advertising pages in a 100-page issue.

HEADLINE: CONFEREES BACK MAJOR OVERHAUL IN MEDICARE FEES

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Tuesday, Nov. 21

 BODY:
House and Senate negotiators agreed on Monday to overhaul the way the Government pays doctors to treat the 33 million elderly and disabled Americans covered by the Medicare program.
The proposal is intended to address the wide disparities in fees that are said to discourage doctors from going into family practice. It would mean that specialists like surgeons and radiologists would be paid about 20 percent less by the Government than they are now, while general practitioners would be paid about 40 percent more. As a group, surgeons would still earn more than family doctors. 
Experts say the proposal could have a profound effect on the way medicine is practiced in the nation. They say the change in fees could reduce the incentive to perform surgery, radiology and other expensive procedures and could encourage preventive measures and office consultations practiced by internists and family doctors.
 
Changing the Rules
''Our current doctor payment system entices doctors to practice in high-paying specialty fields and to locate in high-cost areas like New York City and Miami,'' said Senator Dave Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota, who helped draft the plan. ''Our proposal seeks to change the way health-care services will be provided by changing the way we pay for services.''
The fee changes would apply only to the Medicare program. But private insurance companies follow the Government's lead in setting their own reimbursement rates, and many experts expect them to do so if the Government adopts these changes.
Agreement on the Medicare changes came as lawmakers spent a frantic day searching for consensus on the two major bills that stand between them and adjournment until Jan. 23.
At 1 this morning, House and Senate leaders announced that they and the Administration had reached agreement on one of them: the plan to reduce the Federal deficit by $14.7 billion. But the two Houses remain at odds over a separate Medicare program that covers the catastrophic costs of major illness.
Only days ago, the plan to overhaul Medicare payments, which had passed the House, seemed dead for this year. But with the support of the Bush Administration, it was revived in the final hours of the Congressional session.
Lawmakers say the plan would neither raise nor lower the deficit. In the long run, they hope that it will help control the soaring cost of health care. Support From A.M.A. The plan has been opposed by the American College of Surgeons, whose members would suffer the largest cuts in reimbursements. Lobbyists for the college have argued that the new system does not properly take into account the benefits of more extensive procedures.
But the American Medical Association, the major organization of physicians, supported the changes when it recognized that Congress was bent on overhauling the payment system. On Monday Dr. John S. Zapp, director of government affairs for the A.M.A., called the overhaul ''a very positive move, an appropriate reallocation for physician services.'' He added that it remains to be seen if the reforms actually redirect procedures and treatment.
Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, the West Virginia Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Medicare, said the changes did not mean that doctors will leave specialties, ''but rather that the financial disincentives for getting into family practice will be substantially removed.''
Doctors who treat Medicare patients are now paid by the Government on the basis of ''customary, prevailing and reasonable'' fees. The new system would be based on standardized fees. Medicare reimbursements to doctors would be determined by the time, training and skills required to perform a particular service, plus a doctor's overhead costs, like those for malpractice insurance.
Lawmakers on three Congressional committees, who have worked on the plan for nearly nine months, say the current system encourages doctors to follow costly procedures when less expensive ones may work just as well. For example, ulcers are often diagnosed by endoscopy, in which a tube is inserted into the stomach. The procedure takes 30 minutes and costs $350. Dr. William Hsiao, an economist with the Harvard School of Public Health who helped develop the fee system, said the same diagnosis might also be made by giving the patient a complete physical examination, which takes 45 minutes but costs only $75.
Under the new payment system, Medicare would pay considerably less than it does now for the more expensive procedure.
Negotiators agreed that the payment changes would carried out over a five-year period beginning in 1992 and that a model fee schedule, describing some of the affected services and procedures, would be published in late 1990 or early 1991 to help doctors and insurers begin to make the adjustments.
The cost-setting overhaul is a vast undertaking, involving 7,000 different services and procedures reimbursed by the Medicare program, hundreds of thousands of doctors, and variations in patient volume, population and general medical costs in several hundred regions. While the new system would still take account of regional differences, proponents say that it would give Congress and the Administration a more rational way of evaluating Medicare costs and making the yearly decisions on how much to raise or lower reimbursements.
Mr. Rockefeller noted that the agreement includes other measures aimed at protecting Medicare patients from unwarranted fee increases and at keeping overall Medicare costs in check. Starting in 1992, doctors could charge patients only 25 percent in excess of the payment they receive from the Government; in 1993, that amount would drop to 20 percent and thereafter to 15 percent.
As part of the package, negotiators established a major study to determine the costs and benefits of various treatments and services paid for under the Medicare program.
Final Congressional approval of the payment proposal hinged on adoption of the deficit reduction plan, to which it is attached.
President Bush threatened to veto the deficit reduction measure unless lawmakers found at least $14 billion in budget savings without relying on accounting gimmicks. The package announced this morning would produce $14.7 billion in deficit savings, including $4.6 billion that would be achieved by allowing the automatic spending cuts imposed in October to remain in effect through the first week in February.
The cuts, which affect a wide array of domestic and military programs, shave about $1 billion a month from the deficit.
At the Administration's suggestion, the negotiators agreed to eliminate about a dozen tax breaks three months earlier than planned; this would save some money and would also provide the President with a legislative vehicle next year for his proposal to cut the tax on capital gains.
But lawmakers remain at odds over the catastrophic coverage program, with some of the House negotiators still pushing for outright repeal and the Senate still trying to salvage some of the benefits while eliminating the surtax that was to finance them.

HEADLINE: U.N. Official Assails Curbs on Aid to Afghans

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 20

 BODY:
The United Nations official in charge of coordinating supplies of aid for Afghanistan expressed concern today that the United States and other countries are withholding donations in order to weaken the Soviet-backed Government in Kabul.
The official, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, said relief workers now enjoy their best access to Afghanistan in 10 years. But he said they lack money to start reconstruction projects in the war-ravaged countryside, although these would encourage the return of five million refugees from neighboring Pakistan and Iran. 
He said donors appeared reluctant to give more for fear this would help President Najibullah remain in power and because they wish to see a substantial return of refugees get under way first. He did not name countries other than the United States but suggested that a number of Western nations shared this approach.
 
A Way to Attract Refugees
Prince Sadruddin told a news conference that with most of the country's territory now in the hands of the rebels, the assistance he wants would go mainly to those living outside Government-controlled areas. Rebuilding villages, hospitals and schools would also encourage refugees to come back.
''With the possibility of a military solution to the conflict discounted and a suitable political formula not in sight,'' Prince Sadruddin wrote in his latest report on his agency's operations, ''it is becoming clear that massive economic and humanitarian assistance administered by the United Nations offers the best prospect of achieving the degree of socioeconomic stability from which a political settlement and a large-scale return of refugees may emerge.''
Although donors had pledged $991.5 million as of Aug. 31 toward last year's United Nations appeal for $1.3 billion in Afghan aid, most of what they are offering is in the form of food, medical assistance and supplies, and most of this has not yet been delivered. As a result, Prince Sadruddin said, he has only $17 million in cash to finance reconstruction inside the country, with 60 percent of this donated by Japan.
 
The Wider Disagreement
Officials and diplomats say Prince Sadruddin's complaints are part of a wider dispute developing over the last few months between the United Nations and the Bush Administration over policy toward Afghanistan.
Although the guerrillas have failed to capture a single Government-held city since the Soviet army completed its withdrawal in February, the Bush Administration apparently thinks they should strengthen their bargaining position by scoring new victories. As a result, the Administration is lukewarm toward any new peace initiative.
American officials did not deny that they were channeling aid through the guerrillas rather than the United Nations, but they stressed that a political compromise seems distant when the guerrillas refuse to deal with the Najibullah Government and enjoy substantial support among ordinary Afghans.
The United States channels roughly $100 million a year of humanitarian aid through the guerrilla groups in the hope of strengthening their position in the country, while providing only token assistance to Prince Sadruddin's agency.

HEADLINE: CLAMOR IN THE EAST;
In the 'New' Europe, Puzzling Out Roles

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Western diplomats and officials, considering how to encourage liberalization in Eastern Europe, say that the easy thing is deciding to give generous aid to Communist countries that move to hold free elections.
The hard part, it now seems, is deciding what the role of the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should be as change continues in the Soviet bloc and East-West arms reductions now being negotiated actually get under way.
In the wake of the European Community leaders' meeting in Paris last weekend, the difficulties are being felt most acutely in Britain, where they are complicated by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's disagreements with the 11 other members of the community on how tight their federation should be after a true common market is achieved by the end of 1992.
An official close to Mrs. Thatcher today criticized the American Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, for saying on television over the weekend that with the likelihood of conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union now being at its lowest level since the end of World War II, it was possible to contemplate even bigger reductions of American forces in Europe than those currently being negotiated by the two countries in Vienna. 
 
Mood Called Pro-NATO
''We know there is political and budget pressure to make bigger reductions, but to link them to what's happening in Eastern Europe is infelicitious,'' the British official said. ''The mood at the Paris meeting over the weekend was very pro-NATO. This kind of remark is all people like the Belgians and the Danes need to start demanding big reductions in NATO spending.''
A NATO diplomat in Brussels said Mr. Cheney's statement had also caused surprise at the alliance's headquarters there, although he said that the Secretary of Defense had apparently made clear that reductions in American military spending would be spread worldwide, not concentrated on forces in Western Europe.
A spokesman for the British Ministry of Defense added, ''Our general view is that these things are being discussed in the negotiations in Vienna and through NATO, and that if there are any reductions on our part, they'll follow that discussion.''
Mrs. Thatcher, who believes that it is unwise for Western countries to begin disarming until it is clear that economic change and democratization are going to succeed in the Soviet bloc, plans to travel to Washington to see President Bush on Friday at Camp David. Mr. Bush will meet the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in Malta on Dec. 2 and 3.
''At the Paris meeting we all agreed that Eastern Europe had come this far because we had all been following the right policy, firmness,'' a British official said.
 
More Aid Likely
He reported that the consensus at the weekend talks in Paris made it likely that the next European Community summit meeting, scheduled for Strasbourg, France, on Dec. 8 and 9, will decide on a larger aid package for Poland and Hungary than the $330 million the community's executive commission recommended in September. The American Congress has approved $852 million for Poland and $86 million for Hungary over the next three years, and West Germany alone has agreed to provide about $1.5 billion in export guarantees and loans to Poland.
British officials, in particular, fear that the postwar Western consensus on the need for a strong defense against the Soviet threat could unravel in West Germany if East Germany evolves into a Western-style democracy.
The bulk of the 317,000 American troops in Europe are stationed in West Germany, and a large part of the 555,000-strong Soviet forces in Eastern Europe are based in East Germany. NATO has proposed a negotiated reduction to 275,000 each for the United States and the Soviet Union.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl emphasized West Germany's commitment to the European Community and to the Western alliance at last weekend's meeting, which President Francois Mitterrand of France called after East Germany opened its Western border for all of its 16.7 million citizens.
''I don't know why he made such a song and dance about it,'' one of the British officials present said. ''Nobody really thought the Germans were about to leave.'' But Mr. Kohl said late Saturday after he emerged from Elysee Palace: ''The world has changed. It's a great hour for Germans, and we felt that here.''
American arms control specialists have been saying for weeks that success in the Vienna negotiations is bound to lead to further, non-negotiated reductions by the United States and other Western countries, in response to budget as well as political pressures.
They fear that NATO could then become fragmented by recriminations like those that distracted the alliance last spring, when Mrs. Thatcher and President Bush wanted Mr. Kohl to agree to let the United States modernize its short-range nuclear rockets in West Germany after the intermediate-range missiles are withdrawn next year. President Bush finally agreed to a compromise in May and put off the decision until after the West German elections next fall.

HEADLINE: Jobs Are Lost in Plant Shutdown, but So Is Foul-Smelling Air

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FRONT ROYAL, Va.

 BODY:
Some people said the odor that hung over Front Royal for almost half a century smelled like money. But that was just an old mill town joke.
Actually the smell was closer to rotten eggs. Worse, to hear safety experts and many residents of Front Royal tell it, too much of that smell could make you sick. 
But now the air is clean and clear here at the base of the Blue Ridge Mountains, 50 miles west of Washington, and the smell is gone. The rayon plant that caused the odor has been closed, shut down almost two weeks ago by state officials on the ground that the plant had become one of the worst and most recalcitrant polluters in the mid-Atlantic region.
The closing of the plant, operated by Avtex Fibers Inc. of Valley Forge, Pa., climaxed a five-year struggle that pitted Avtex against Federal and state agencies, with environmental advocates standing off to the side, alternately criticizing both sides for foot dragging. To many of the environmentalists, the struggle constitutes almost a textbook example of how political and economic concerns can slow progress in cleaning up the nation's air, water and soil. #450 Workers Lose Jobs More than 450 workers have been laid off as a result of the closing, with only a slim prospect that the plant will be reopened. State officals are concerned for the workers, but they argue that they had no choice but to close Avtex.
The plant's pollution, they say, went well beyond fumes coming out of the big brick Avtex smokestack that dominates the Front Royal skyline. They contend that Avtex also was a major polluter of underground water, that it repeatedly permitted toxic substances, including carcinogenic PCB's, to foul the nearby Shenandoah River and that it frequently ignored worker safety regulations.
According to state officials, Avtex has violated environmental and safety regulations more than 2,000 times over the past five years. Many of the violations, the officials say, came in direct contravention of court or government orders and resulted in the state's suing Avtex for almost $20 million, with about $8 million collected so far.
''Avtex showed a continuing contempt for the public as well as Virginia's environment,'' Richard N. Burton, the executive director of the state's Water Control Board, said after the board concluded Nov. 9 that the plant should be shut down because the company had repeatedly ignored regulations on discharging waste water.
 
'How Sweet It Is!'
David N. Crump Jr., the town lawyer for Front Royal's 12,000 residents, reached the same conclusion but expressed himself in more visceral terms.
''How sweet it is!'' he exulted after taking a deep whiff of the newly freshened air over Front Royal.
Still, Mr. Crump's view of Avtex, like that of many Front Royal residents, is a bit ambivalent.
''The company hasn't been a very good neighbor in recent years,'' he said. ''On the other hand, you don't like to see people put out of work. That hurts a lot, too.''
Avtex has said little about the closing. The company's chairman, John N. Gregg, charged in a statement released to the press that the Water Control Board's decision ''cannot be justified'' and was made so precipitously that it did not leave Avtex enough time to close the plant in an orderly, environmentally safe way.
''The action taken by the board has resulted in a complete and permanent shutdown and the attendant loss of hundreds of jobs,'' he added. ''It has accomplished absolutely nothing from an environmental perspective.''
State officials said Avtex was given every opportunity to make things right before the order went out.
Environmentalists contend that the company was given too many opportunities and that the plant should have been shut down years earlier.
 
'Negotiated and Negotiated'
''This is a classic case of state and Federal officials worrying more about jobs and the economy than about the environment,'' said Pat Lewis, whose home is on the banks of the Shenandoah, downstream from Front Royal, and who is active in an environmental group, the Commonwealth Coalition.
''I can't swim in the Shenandoah or eat its fish because of Avtex,'' she continued. ''They just negotiated and negotiated, and all the while the poisons were flowing out of the plant.''
At one point last year, Avtex moved to shut the plant on its own rather than carry out all the cleanup operations demanded by state and Federal officials. But then the Federal Government stepped in with a contract for a special type of rayon used in military and space rocket engines, a product made only by Avtex.
Environmentalists were infuriated. Since then, however, the Government has built up a stockpile of the special rayon and is now looking for a new contractor.
Once one of the country's largest rayon plants, Avtex is now something of a ghost site, its machinery silent, the liquid rayon left in pipes and tanks slowly hardening. And if the plant no longer spews pollution, its forced closing has struck a major economic blow to Front Royal. But over the long term many of the 450 workers who lost their jobs will probably be able to find work by commuting to the booming suburbs of Washington.
''We're hurting, hurting bad,'' said James V. Brinklow, an Avtex employee who also is business agent for the local unit of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union.
 
Chemicals Left on Site
State officials say that not only was the company not correcting faults but that it also left much dangerous material lying around when the plant was closed. In particular, the officials are worried about clearing a stockpile of volatile chemicals that went into the making of rayon, including carbon disulfide, which becomes a deadly gas when exposed to air. They say they have also found tons of toxic sludge and other byproducts scattered about the 400-acre plant site.
The plant, spread across bottomland next to the south fork of the Shenandoah, once employed nearly 3,500 workers. But in recent years, as the 50-year-old plant began to show its age, the work force steadily declined, dropping to fewer than 500 workers earlier this year.
''Avtex has milked that old plant for all they could,'' said William Poland, a former Avtex maintenance worker who lives across the river from the plant's sludge basins.
''They just took and took,'' he continued, ''and never put anything back in because the place had worn out its useful life after 50 years. They let the pollution get so bad that it poisoned the wells where I live and then the company had to buy out a lot of people or, in my case, had to agree to haul in water to a cistern every month.''
Mr. Poland does not know if his water deliveries will continue.
''But this much I do know,'' he said. ''I know that now I can get a fresh breath of air.''

HEADLINE: Two Sides of the Contemporary South: Racial Incidents and Black Progress

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Nov. 19

 BODY:
A rising tide of racial incidents across the South, including attacks and cross burnings, has provided a sour counterpoint to a decade of electoral progress by blacks.
Organizations that follow hate crimes and racial incidents say there has been a bewildering increase in racial incidents in the past year, and many experts say that what is happening here is part of a national trend that is as virulent elsewhere.
But others say the South, home of half the nation's blacks, remains the best baromoter of racial issues in the nation.
''We're finding a very great and vehement resurgence of racial incidents in the South,'' said Earl Shinhoster, the southeastern regional director for the N.A.A.C.P., whose office here was evacuated in August when a tear gas bomb delivered in a package went off. ''We're still putting out fires, still fighting the old battles over and over again, not because we want to, but because there's no choice.'' 
 
Bush Asked to Speak Out
Members of the Black Leadership Forum, composed of the heads of major black organizations, met with President Bush at the White House on Friday and expressed their concern about such incidents. The group, including Joseph Lowery, the head of the Southern Christian Leadership Council, and Coretta Scott King, asked the President to speak out on racial incidents, particularly those on college campuses.
Explanations of the incidents vary from one about increasing economic competition between whites and blacks in a slowing economy to others about the legacy of what critics see as the Reagan Administration's indifference to racial issues. Still, many of the incidents recall an earlier era in the South's racial history.
Clayton County, near Atlanta, has had eight incidents of vandalism or racial threats against blacks in the last few months. In Birmingham, Ala., several cross burnings last summer brought back memories of that city's bitter past.
Many of the incidents, like attempts to retain segregation at a swimming pool in Saluda, S.C., and a restaurant in North Augusta, S.C., received widespread publicity. Many others, including a fire in Florida where two wooden crosses were found at the house of a black family that was burned in Okaloosa County and the vandalism of black churches in Spartanburg, S.C., received only local attention.
Particularly alarming have been racial clashes at high schools in places like Little Rock, Ark.; Adamsville, Ala., and Valdosta, Ga.
 
Seen as National Problem
The increase in racial incidents is ''astonishing,'' said Morris Dees, who heads the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., which collects information on such incidents. There are no national statistics, in part because many jurisdictions do not keep records on such incidents.
But both Mr. Dees and Mr. Shinhoster see the problem as a national one, not a regional one, and no recent incident in the South has matched the killing of a 16-year-old black youth, Yusef Hawkins, in Brooklyn.
Blacks are often the most vehement in saying the racial climate of the North is every bit as troubled as that of the South. ''I'm not at all persuaded that race is closer to the bone in the South,'' said John Hope Franklin, a historian at Duke University. ''I've lived in New York, and it's awful in terms of race. I don't make any fine distinctions between North and South. When it comes to kicking blacks around, they can turn it into a fine art there as well as here.''
But others say that given the South's historic preoccupation with race and the fact that it is only two decades away from segregation, it flies in the face of history to think race relations would be the same throughout the country.
 
'Feelings Don't Vanish'
Charles Reagan Wilson, a professor of history and Southern studies at the University of Mississippi, said that because so much of the symbolism of the South has come to be associated with race - the Confederate flag, the white robes of the Ku Klux Klan and the antebellum world of the Old South - relations between whites and blacks are still extremely volatile. ''The South has gone through amazing changes in the last 20 years,'' he said, ''but the intensity of feelings doesn't vanish overnight.''
Similarly, Joel Williamson, a historian at the University of North Carolina whose book, ''The Crucible of Race,'' is regarded as one of the authoritative works on the subject in the United States, says the incidents occurring now are consistent with the racial history of the region.
He said social and economic change, like that buffeting the region, has often been accompanied by racial incidents. For example, he said, the election of David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, to the Louisiana Legislature in February from a district that is 99.6 percent white showed that racial themes still play a role in Southern politics.
''We're in a period of transition,'' said Dr. Williamson, ''and in the South when change breeds tension, the natural tendency is to point a finger at black folks. It's part of the psychology of the South that when things go wrong, we look to blacks as the cause.''
 
Unprecedented Electoral Gains
But the incidents also come at a time of unprecedented electoral gains by blacks in the South. In Virginia, L. Douglas Wilder's narrow victory made him the nation's first black elected Governor of a state, although it is still subject to a recount.
More than half the 7,226 black elected officials in the nation are in the South, with the largest numbers in Alabama and Mississippi, once the nation's bastions of segregation.
One need only see what is happening in Oxford, Miss., to see how much racial life in the South has changed. There the students, alumni and staff of the University of Mississippi, still remembered for the riots that attended the school's integration in 1962, have mobilized to raise money for a black football player, Lee Roy (Chucky) Mullins, who was left a quadriplegic by a football injury three weeks ago.
But the university is also a symbol of the region's crosscurrents. Only two months earlier, a white fraternity was suspended after a prank in which a member and a pledge were left naked, their bodies painted with racial slurs, at a nearby black college.
David Sansing, a history professor at the University of Mississippi, said the important thing about several racial incidents in the state this year that received widespread publicity was not so much that they occurred but that they generated so much criticism and official condemnation.
''The response is incredibly different from what happened before in Mississippi,'' he said. ''The battle against racism in Mississippi is never going to end, but, by God, at least Mississippi is battling it.''

HEADLINE: Rigid Ethics Code Is Urged In Los Angeles Government

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 20

 BODY:
In a move that supporters hope will be a national model for cleaning up corruption, a special commission proposed a new ethics code today for Los Angeles's city government, calling it the toughest and clearest such measure in the country.
The code would require all elected officials, high-ranking civil servants and even candidates for office to disclose fully all investments, including their homes, and list the names of their stockbrokers. It would ban all outside earned income and honorariums, place tough controls on lobbying by former government employees and set up a strict three-level enforcement mechanism. City employees and officials who are lawyers would have to give up outside practices if they are full-time government employees or have decision-making responsibilities. Part-time employees and lower-level workers who are lawyers would not have to give up outside work. 
The proposed code would also partly finance election campaigns with public funds, as New York City does.
The proposal comes against the backdrop of growing public outrage over ethical lapses by public officials. In Washington, five prominent senators have been linked to efforts to prevent Federal officials from shutting down a failing savings and loan company owned by Charles H. Keating Jr., a wealthy Arizonan. And criminal investigations have begun into allegations of corruption at the Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Ronald Reagan. Toughest in Any City? The panel says that, taken together, its recommendations would be the most comprehensive ethics rules in any American city.
In New York, 12,000 of the 369,000-member work force must file disclosure forms, the Los Angeles panel said. The 12,000 are those who make $49,000 or more a year or have decision-making responsibilities.
A new ethics code in New York would permanently bar former officials from appearing before a city agency on behalf of an applicant if they had worked closely with the applicant on the same matter while in office. The current New York code bars former officials in that situation from appearing before agencies for three months. The new code is to take effect Jan. 1, but Mayor Koch and Mayor-elect David N. Dinkins favor a delay of six months to prevent a mass exodus of employees between administrations.
Chicago requires 7,000 of 41,000 employees to file disclosure forms. Those affected are those who earn $40,000 or more a year. Unlimited honorariums are permissible and must be reported within five busineess days.
In Los Angeles, Mayor Tom Bradley has been under investigation for his personal financial dealings and alleged influence peddling by former aides. Several investigations are under way, but no criminal charges have been brought.
 
'Banish the Gray'
''We have sought to banish the gray - to eliminate those areas of uncertainty that have become loopholes for those who wish to avoid compliance, and have become confusing traps for those who wish to comply,'' said the chairman of the Los Angeles panel, Geoffrey Cowan, former chairman of California Common Cause.
The measure will be offered first to the City Council in the form of an ordinance. It is given a good chance of being adopted, even if the Council should try to water it down, because California permits voters to make law directly through the ballot initiative. The seven-member panel indicated today it would start a signature drive to put the code on next November's ballot if the City Council did not adopt the bulk of it.
Initial reaction was mixed. Mayor Bradley, who appointed the panel last April a day after he won re-election, said he would do ''everything within my power'' to have the City Council pass the code, and would support the ballot initiative if necessary.
Mr. Bradley's difficulties include conflict-of-interest questions raised about his serving as a paid adviser to two banks that did business with the city. Mr. Cowan said the new rules would clearly have forbade such outside employment.
The chairman of a City Council committee that is also developing a new ethics code, Michael K. Woo, was lukewarm toward the panel recommendations. He said the Council would consider the recommendations and possibly work them into its own proposals.
 
Money From Outside
Soon after Mayor Bradley appointed the panel, it reconstituted itself as a private body to insure independence. Funds came from the Bank of America, Warner Brothers, 20th Century-Fox and other private sources.
In addition to Mr. Cowan, the members are Rabbi Allen I. Freehling, senior rabbi at University Synagogue here; Antonia Hernandez, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund; Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angeles; Margaret M. Morrow, past president of the Los Angeles Bar Association; Gilbert T. Ray, a prominent lawyer, and Delbert E. Wong, a retired Superior Court judge.
Of the 30 recommendations, the one on financial disclosure is probably the most far reaching. Under the city's current vague and largely toothless ethics code, only 1,500 of the city's 45,000 employees are required to provide personal disclosure statements, and the statements require only limited information. No precise value of investments is required, and many items are excluded, such as companies or real estate that are more than three miles beyond the city limits.
One of the controversies swirling around Mayor Bradley concerns his partnership in a real estate venture in Riverside, Calif. One of his partners is Juanita St. John, appointed by him to head the city's Task Force for Africa/ Los Angeles Relations. That group received $400,000 in city funds, much of it unaccounted for. There have been no charges in the affair.
 
Drawing on Washington
The proposed code, drawing on a proposal by President Bush for Federal workers, would require city officials and full-time top decision-making employees to list the exact dollar amounts for all income and investments.
Any lobbyist who received more than $1,000 a year to influence lawmakers or city officials would have to file quarterly statements listing all money paid or received to influence official actions. City consultants receiving more than $10,000 or more a year would have to disclose ''relevant'' economic interests.
The code would ban top officials from taking any outside earned income or honorariums. Lower-ranking employees would be permitted to receive such income only when ''there is no reasonably foreseeable likelihood of a conflict of interest, loyalty or time.'' Moreover, top officials would have to divest all investments that might create a conflict of interest.
The panel urged that all former employees of the city be permanently barred from acting as lobbyists or advocates on the matters in which they were active while in government. Top officials would be prohibited from lobbying any department for one year after leaving city employment.
To enforce all this, a city ethics commission would be created and would be empowered to levy civil fines of up to $5,000.

HEADLINE: From Mere Defense to True Security

 BODY:
The Bush Administration seems to be verging on its most farsighted and momentous decision. Defense Secretary Cheney, with apparent White House support, has ordered the military services to produce projected spending cuts of $180 billion-plus in the early 1990's.
That won't amount to much if President Bush and Mr. Cheney are simply taking the services through a budget exercise. They may have no more in mind than pre-empting Congressional cuts that they may consider inevitable given the deficit and the changed military situation in Europe. Unbelievably, until the last few days Mr. Bush has been promising the services spending increases. 
But if Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney are really prepared for such large reductions, a creative policy transformation is at hand. At last, America's approach would change from preoccupation with defense defined strictly in military terms into a desire to meet the truest security concerns - like declining economic strength and the desirability of doing more to help nascent democracy in Eastern Europe. If the Administration has this broader concept of security in mind, then there's urgent need for three further elements.
Fast Planning. The Administration will have to move quickly, and make decisions now. Congress is about to approve Pentagon spending of $296 billion for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1. Mr. Cheney reportedly is willing to contemplate $10 billion less in fiscal 1991 and then cuts totaling $180 billion in the next three years. Congressional politics and service resistance will defeat this timetable unless he pushes hard this year.
Clear Strategy. The Administration needs to develop policy guidelines for each of the services. Otherwise, they will simply buy less of the same and Congress will have a field day chopping up the budget to fit its political needs. These reactions will produce the weakest possible forces at the highest possible cost. Containing these pressures will call for a persuasive strategy, focused on the primary threat to national security.
Is it still all-out conventional war with the Soviet Union? If so, the U.S. needs a thinned-out version of the existing services. Will future threats, more realistically, come from third world flareups? In that case, what's needed is compact forces ready to go in emergencies. In any event, the U.S. will have to eliminate redundant strategic nuclear forces like the B-2 bomber, at $500 million per copy.
Congressional Consultation. The Administration has to work with Congress immediately. Some legislators will want big cuts; others will resist them fiercely. Sam Nunn and Les Aspin, chairmen of the Senate and House armed services committees, can help create political support, if they're involved from the start in the planning of security strategy and legislative tactics.
World events present the Administration with an extraordinary opportunity to think big, and creatively. If Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney are serious about reducing Pentagon spending as reported, they can establish a new concept of national security.

HEADLINE: How to Reduce Military Spending

BYLINE: By Lawrence J. Korb; Lawrence J. Korb directs the Brookings Institution's Center for Public Policy Education.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
For some time now, there has been no mistaking the direction in U.S. military spending.
Since 1985, the budget for the Defense Department has fallen by about 15 percent, after inflation. Last week, the Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney, bowed to the inevitable and agreed to recommend cutting the fiscal 1991 budget by an additional 3 percent to 5 percent and to reduce military spending by about $180 billion over the next five years.
Also clear is the cause of the decline: Gramm-Rudman-Gorbachev. The huge Federal budget deficits, the perception of fraud, waste and mismanagement in the Pentagon and Mikhail Gorbachev's replacement of the Brezhnev Doctrine with the Sinatra Doctrine of national self-determination have combined to destroy the defense consensus. 
Not so clear is what type of strategy and force structure will or should emerge from this abridged military budget. Initially, the Pentagon tried to keep alive all the major programs by stretching out production schedules. But this approach, which greatly increases unit costs, has been harshly criticized.
To his credit, Mr. Cheney accepted the new fiscal situation and did attempt to kill some major weapons systems. But the failure of the Bush Administration to produce a national security policy has made it impossible for Mr. Cheney to present a coherent strategy to justify his reductions. Thus, his effort last spring to cancel the V-22 Osprey tilt rotor aircraft and the F-14D fighter was easily defeated by a Congress more worried about jobs than about a coherent and efficient military strategy.
Fortunately, the outlines of the post-containment era are already clear. We know enough about our military needs for the next decade to structure spending so that we gain greater security for less money. The outlines of this new era are contained in the proposals put forth at the strategic arms reduction talks and the negotiations on conventional forces in Europe.
At Start, both sides have agreed to reduce the number of strategic nuclear warheads to 6,000. Pending the completion of these talks, the U.S. should defer deployment of such systems as the rail-mobile MX missile, the single-warhead Midgetman ICBM, the B-2 bomber, additional Trident submarines and the Strategic Defense Initiative. It should continue research and development in these areas, however, as a hedge against a breakdown of the talks.
The research and development would consist of testing the 13 B-2 bombers already paid for, providing modest funding for the Midgetman, designing a new smaller ballistic missile submarine and continuing S.D.I. as a research program. Such a strategy could reduce projected defense spending by about $100 billion over the next five years.
Progress at the talks on conventional forces should allow the Administration to begin drastic reductions in forces defending Europe. Now, the U.S. is committed to having 10 divisions, 100 tactical air squadrons and a Marine brigade in Europe within 10 days of a Warsaw Pact mobilization. If the negotiations are concluded along lines already agreed to, the U.S. would have a minimum of three to four months to respond to a Soviet buildup. This extra warning time would allow the Pentagon to cut its active Army divisions and tactical air forces in half, while eliminating the amphibious lift for a Marine brigade.
Moreover, the more benign international environment should allow the Navy to reduce the tempo of its overseas deployments and return to a traditional force of 12 carrier battle groups, from 14 now.
Reductions of these land, air and sea forces would save relatively little in the short run. But by the middle of the 1990's, the savings would add up to about $50 billion a year in today's dollars. However, during this transition period, the Pentagon could save about $20 billion a year by slowing down modernization of land, sea and air forces.
Since the services just completed the most expensive and thorough modernization in history, there is no need to rush into expensive programs like the advanced tactical fighter at $100 million a plane, the Amraam missile at $500,000 each, the LHX helicopter at $35 million a copy, Burke class destroyers at $1 billion each and Sea Wolf submarines at $1.5 billion each. These programs could easily be kept in research and development, pending the outcome of the talks on conventional forces.
Together, these steps could save at least the $180 billion that Secretary Cheney hopes to save by 1994. But nothing will happen unless the Administration takes a tough stand.
Indeed, early indications point to a scramble by the military services to protect their own bureaucratic interests at the expense of the national interest. For example, the Air Force is reported to have proposed saving the B-2 Stealth bomber and the Amraam missile by stretching out production while cutting out purchases of the highly effective F-16 fighter.
Neither the nation nor the Pentagon can afford to stumble along trying to sustain a $400 billion military on a $300 billion and declining budget. Secretary Cheney has taken a bold and logical first step. He needs to follow this by imposing a coherent strategic vision and complementary force structure on the Pentagon.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
A President Beholden

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
By vetoing the foreign aid appropriations bill, President Bush has made clear his blind fealty to the right-wing zealots who he fears will turn against him if he retreats an inch - even an imaginary inch -from his cruel stand against abortion.
His veto also makes it clear that he has closed his eyes and his mind to the political trend running against the anti-abortion position - a trend underlined once again by three changed votes in the Senate.
In vetoing, moreover, one item in a bill containing many, he has sabotaged many of his own political interests. Included in the appropriations bill, and going down with the veto, were aid for Israel and Egypt, the emergency assistance for Poland just promised to Lech Walesa, and support for the hard-pressed Government of El Salvador, to which the Bush Administration has committed itself. Only special legislation, if it can be had from an angered Congress, can restore these items. 
So it's fair to ask: Is there no limit to what George Bush will do to placate the zealots peering over his shoulder?
Ironically, the bill he vetoed with such disastrous consequences did not contain even one dollar for abortion, in any country or under any circumstances. What produced Mr. Bush's veto was only $15 million for the U.N. Population Fund, which devotes itself to badly needed family planning -not including abortion - to help stem the worldwide population explosion.
Once, the United States was properly a leader in pointing to the dangers of rising world population, which threatens to overwhelm economic growth and an already endangered environment. But under Ronald Reagan, as obsequious as Mr. Bush in the service of abortion extremists, U.S. aid to the U.N. fund was cut off, as well as any aid that might go to abortion services anywhere.
That left Washington in an untenable position. It could not maintain the strong position, much less the lead, against mushrooming population growth that it once had taken if it was unwilling to spend any money for that purpose. To put an end to that dilemma, and to restore the nation to its rightful role in the population effort, the Senate voted earlier this year to renew aid - the $15 million -to the U.N. fund.
The fund, however, supports population programs in China, which authorizes abortion and sterilization -though none of the U.N. money is spent for those purposes. To avoid the false charge that the $15 million would support Chinese abortion services, even indirectly, the Senate provided that none of the U.S. money could be used to aid China; and that it must be kept in a separate account that Washington could audit at any time.
That did not satisfy anti-abortion fanatics to whom Mr. Bush listens; they charged that the $15 million was abortion money. In the House, Representative Christopher Smith, Republican of New Jersey, proposed an amendment to leave it to the President to determine whether the $15 million actually would be contributed to the U.N. Though that in effect gave Mr. Bush a line-item veto, the House voted 219 to 203 to accept the Smith amendment.
Proponents of family planning, notably the Population Institute in Washington, fought back; and the Senate, given another vote, defeated the Smith amendment, 52 to 44. Crucial help came from three changed conservative votes, cast by Senators Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Pete Wilson of California, Republicans, and John Shelby of Alabama, Democrat.
All had previously voted against the $15 million. All must have been well aware of the November election returns in three states that gave evidence of the pro-choice trend in American politics. Senator Wilson, significantly, will be running for governor of California in 1990.
The House then reversed itself and killed the Smith amendment, 207 to 200. By voice vote, it also added the strong provision that if any U.S. money was spent for family planning in China, or for abortion-related services in any country, the entire contribution to the U.N. would have to be refunded.
Family planning advocates, with good reason, believed Mr. Bush had been left no grounds for a veto. But they reckoned without his puzzling and shortsighted belief that right-wing zealotry is the dominant political force in America. Ignoring the demonstrable need for worldwide family planning, he declared the accounting requirements unacceptable, asserted without evidence that the U.N. Population Fund previously had violated U.S. restrictions, and wielded his veto stamp.
Was that prudence? Kinder or gentler? No, it was just outrageous.

HEADLINE: $3.9 Million, and Friends' Trust, Vanish in a Betrayal in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
Every neighborhood has its givers and takers. In the Canarsie and Flatlands sections of Brooklyn, for years Elaine Stouber was a giver. She dispensed political favors and hinted that she had friends in high places who could get things done. She ran a neighborhood charity and always seemed to be there when people needed help.
So, to many of her neighbors, it was unfathomable last month when the 62-year old woman and her 61-year old husband, Frank Aprigliano, admitted in Federal Court in Manhattan that for years they had secretly been takers, too.
The couple pleaded guilty to defrauding at least 200 of their friends and neighbors of at least $3.9 million in what prosecutors said was a fake investment scheme. They could be sent to prison for as long as 25 years when they are sentenced by Federal Judge Robert W. Sweet next month. 
In the Brooklyn neighborhoods that Mrs. Stouber worked in the manner of an old-style politician, ''Everybody was shocked at first and everybody carried a sense of disbelief because of who she was,'' said Herbert E. Berman, the City Councilman from the area.
But among the middle-class people who handed over tens of thousands of dollars of their savings to the woman who promised them as much as 200 percent a year in interest, disbelief has given way to more powerful feelings. These days, some of them said in interviews, they are coping with the knowledge that all their money is gone, and with it, some of their trust in people.
 
'Such an Actor, a Performer'
''I don't understand how somebody could be such an actor, a performer, to be so sweet and take away your livelihood with a smile,'' said Miriam Torren, a Brooklyn schoolteacher who gave Mrs. Stouber $76,000 and then persuaded relatives to put in another $70,000 so they they could share in the bounty that she felt sure was coming.
Their experiences, investigators said, provide a snapshot of the way confidence schemes work. But theirs is also a story of how, in the city of gilded shops and epic Wall Street deals, some New Yorkers feel sidelined in life's game of opportunity.
Eileen Drucker, a Flatlands housewife who coaxed nine friends to invest $250,000, remembers that Mrs. Stouber told her she had a special arrangement with an unnamed ambassador who was permitting her a once-in-a-lifetime chance to invest in a ''no risk,'' high-profit venture. The money would be used to rebuild the city of Brussels, she said. Brussels, the Belgian city, is in no particular need of rebuilding, and none of the investors interviewed mentioned hearing any further explanation.
Early investors received receipts and huge monthly interest payments that seemed to promise more. Only later did they realize that the money had come from other people's deposits.
When Mrs. Drucker worried, she said, Mrs. Stouber belittled her fears and told her the rich got rich with such inside deals. She warned her, Mrs. Drucker said, that if she told too many people about their special deal, it would end. ''They didn't want 'little people' in on it,'' Mrs. Drucker said, ''because this was how the rich stayed rich.''
Many of the would-be investors said they now know there was no ambassador. Part of the fault is theirs, they said, for wishing Mrs. Stouber's stories were true.
''I thought: 'Maybe it is too good to be true,' '' said Naomi Slomovitz, who lost $35,000 that she and her husband had saved in 28 years of marriage. ''But I said, 'Maybe this is the opportunity of my life.' ''
Mrs. Stouber's stories seemed plausible because of who she seemed to be, said some who were drawn into the scheme. For years, she was an aide to Abe Stark, the Pitkin Avenue clothing store owner who became City Council President and Brooklyn Borough President.
 
Abe Stark's Political Surrogate
When Mr. Stark died in 1972, Councilman Berman said, Mrs. Stouber became Mr. Stark's surrogate in the community. She ran Abe Stark Philanthropies, a charitable organization he had organized, and helped with political tasks at the Thomas Jefferson Democratic Club.
Often, she was at the arm of one politician or another as they made their way through the old-age homes and kaffeeklatsches of Brooklyn. In her living room was a large photograph of herself with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mrs. Drucker said, and Mrs. Stouber would often say she had a direct line to the Governor's mansion in Albany. A spokesman for the Governor, Darren Dopp, said Mr. Cuomo would not say whether he knew Mrs. Stouber.
The tale of the ambassador with his special deal seemed plausible, too, some of those who lost money said. Mr. Aprigliano, Mrs. Stouber's second husband, worked for 34 years at the United Nations until he retired in 1983. He would often arrange tours for neighbors. The neighbors were vague about what his job had been. Last week, the United Nations public information office said Mr. Aprigliano had been a clerical worker in its publications office.
Mrs. Torren said Mrs. Stouber had seemed to focus on the concerns of others. She had worried about a Canarsie woman with a disabled child. She had offered help to another who did not have enough money to repair her dilapidated house. ''She would take my face in her hand,'' Mrs. Torren said, ''and say, 'Don't worry.' ''
 
'We Each Had Our Dreams'
''We were stupid, we were naive, and a little bit greedy too,'' Mrs. Drucker said. ''But we each had our dreams and she knew the dreams that we each had and she played us like a fine violin.''
Many of those who see themselves as victims of Mrs. Stouber and Mr. Aprigliano are hoping the two get stern sentences when they appear again in court on Dec. 14. The couple have said they do not have the money to make restitution. They refused to be interviewed, but their lawyer, Kenneth J. Kaplan, said they were hoping for leniency because they, too, were victims.
He said they had been abused by confidence-scheme operators and loansharks, and he said their involvement with their neighbors had amounted to nothing more than borrowing and ''redistributing'' money.
The United States postal inspector who investigated the case, Gregory Rhatigan, dismissed the idea that Mrs. Stouber and her husband were victims, and he said the Government had no evidence that they had been involved with loansharks.
 
Joined Financial Fax Network
But he agreed with one point that Mr. Kaplan made. The lawyer said his clients had heard about the fortunes being made in deals in the early 1980's and had decided to join in the action. After Mr. Aprigliano retired, they obtained a fax machine and joined a network of people who passed information back and forth about huge commodity and currency transactions.
The idea, Mr. Rhatigan said, was to broker deals and make multimillion-dollar commissions. ''Frank and Elaine thought this was going to give them the gold ring,'' Mr. Rhatigan said.
While they waited from 1983 to 1987, Mr. Rhatigan said, they took money. Perhaps, he said, they believed at first that they would soon pay it back. But no deal ever came through. Mr. Rhatigan said that while he was working on the Stouber case he interviewed 20 other people involved with the fax network. None of them had ever completed a deal either.
Eventually, Mr. Rhatigan said, Mrs. Stouber and her husband invented the ambassador with his Brussels project and crossed the line into fraud.
The people who handed over their money and their trust are not likely ever to fully understand what happened. Mrs. Torren said that as the scheme was coming undone, she went to the woman she had always respected and asked her to explain her betrayal.
The answer from Mrs. Stouber, she said, was ''I was more desperate than you.''

Economy
Government help to the electronics industry is needed to avert dire economic consequences, two studies warned. The reports by the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors and the Economic Policy Institute said that the U.S. was falling behind foreign competitors in key areas of semiconductors and telecommunications and would suffer a loss of jobs as a result. [Page D1.] 
The International Trade Commission has ruled that American manufacturers of telecommunications equipment have experienced substantial damage because small-business telephone systems from Japan and Taiwan are being sold in this country at unfairly low prices. The ruling paves the way for countervailing duties to be imposed on the imports. [D1.]
Lawyers for the former head of Lincoln Savings and Loan tried to get the House Banking Committee to permit Charles Keating to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against compelled self-incrimination without appearing before the committee, but the overture was rejected, House staff members said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Behind the Military Stock Selloff

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
The outlook for military contractors has grown steadily dimmer since the Reagan Administration's arms buildup peaked in 1985. Still, the news over the weekend that the Pentagon is contemplating deeper spending cuts yesterday sent investors bailing out of virtually all aerospace, shipbuilding and military-technology stocks as Wall Street bet that from a financial perspective at least, the cold war might be over.
Stocks of many companies, including some that until now had been relatively resistant to the decline in military-related issues, fell by as much as 10 percent of their value, and analysts said there were few buyers even at the depressed prices.
Bond prices rose yesterday as traders viewed the reports of military spending cutbacks as a way to reduce the Federal deficit, which in turn would reduce the Treasury's need to issue securities to raise money. [Page D17.] Hardest-Hit Military Stocks Among the hardest-hit stocks yesterday were General Dynamics, which fell $4.875, to $44.125; Litton Industries, $8.125, to $76.50; Martin Marietta $4.50, to $39.50; Lockheed $3.625, to $35.875, and Raytheon $6.75, to $68.625. Northrop fell 87.5 cents, to $17.625. Other losers were Grumman, down $1, to $17.125; McDonnell Douglas $1.125, to $68.25; Rockwell International $1.50, to $21.375, and Tenneco, the parent of Newport News Shipbuilding, $1.25, to $58.25. 
The Standard & Poor's aerospace index dropped 15.06, or 4.1 percent, yesterday, to 348.60.
The only major contractor to buck the trend was the Boeing Company, which relies on commercial aircraft orders for more than 70 percent of its sales and which on Sunday reached a tentative agreement to end a nearly seven-week-old strike. Boeing was up $1.50 a share, to $59.50. The rise reflected Boeing's huge backlog of orders for jetliners.
Some analysts said that the market might have overreacted, and that a few companies continued to show promise in an age of rapid change in the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. For example, E-Systems Inc., a Dallas company that makes surveillance equipment used to monitor compliance with arms-reduction treaties, is widely believed to have bright financial prospects. But even its stock was dragged down with those of other contractors yesterday, ending at $29.75, off $4.
For the most part, contractors now face the likelihood that almost every major weapons project will be reduced in size or stretched out, with some programs facing the possibility of being canceled.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney indicated on Sunday, for example, that the Pentagon might be willing to buy fewer than the 132 B2 Stealth bombers it wants from Northrop. The B2 accounts for about half of Northrop's revenues.
Jerry Cantwell, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder, said that across-the-board cuts affecting the size or scheduling of most major weapons programs are more likely than any outright cancellations. Cancellation usually means ending existing jobs or forgoing the creation of new ones, something that most members of Congress strenuously resist when it comes to arms makers operating in their districts.
''Congressional district politics will have as much to do with the choices as national security needs,'' Mr. Cantwell said.
But keeping programs alive on a smaller scale or at a reduced rate of production also carries a financial penalty for the companies involved as they fail to reach the levels of manufacturing efficiency they had planned when making their original bids. Less-efficient production invariably means that the per-unit cost of a program also rises, meaning the Pentagon not only gets less but gets less for every dollar it spends.
Many analysts believe the Air Force will now scale back or further delay its Advanced Tactical Fighter program to build the next generation of fighter planes. A group led by Northrop and McDonnell Douglas is competing against a team led by Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics in the design and development stage of the program, with the winner to produce a fleet of fighters originally estimated to be worth at least $35 billion.
Both teams have invested at least $500 million of their own funds in the project, above and beyond the $691 million development contract received by each team. The teams have always known that one of them would lose despite the heavy financial investment, but now even the winner faces the prospect of a production contract that could be far less lucrative than once planned.
That risk and others that sent investors fleeing from military-related stocks yesterday have been apparent for months or years. But, as Wolfgang H. Demisch of UBS Securities said, ''This is a case of a variety of factors crystallizing.''
News that the Pentagon is drafting plans to slash its previously proposed budgets by 5 percent annually for three years starting in fiscal 1992 came after several weeks in which the postwar political system in Eastern Europe continued to go through convulsions, suggesting a fundamental easing of East-West relationships.
Moreover, Mr. Demisch said, the perils of military contracting were made clear to investors on Friday, when Lockheed announced a huge $300 million charge on a contract that is worth only $600 million.
And earlier, both the Ford Motor Company and the General Electric Company, both of which had been mentioned as possible acquirers of one of the major military contractors, took actions that suggested they are not interested in becoming bigger players in the industry. Ford moved to acquire Jaguar P.L.C. of Britain, and General Electric said that it would buy back up to $10 billion of its stock in coming years.
Most of the companies whose stocks were hit the hardest rely heavily or exclusively on Pentagon contracts. General Dynamics, for example, gets more than 80 percent of its revenues from military programs. Its most profitable program is the F-16 fighter plane, and the Air Force has already drafted budget proposals for 1992-94 that provide for a lower rate of F-16 purchases. Cuts in conventional forces stationed in Europe could also bring cuts in the company's M-1 tank program.
But even diversified companies like Rockwell, whose military business has been overshadowed in recent years by its electronics and other commercial businesses, and Tenneco, whose Newport News, Va., shipyard is a major builder of submarines, were tarred by yesterday's selloff.
Phillip R. Brannon of Merrill Lynch said that while the perception that military contracting is a troubled business is perfectly valid, the widespread selloff might not have been totally justified.
''Have things changed so dramatically from a week ago that stocks should be down so sharply, that you should mark off the value of Raytheon by 10 percent?'' he asked. ''I'm not sure, but it's possible the market is overreacting.''

HEADLINE: Supporters of a Trader Anger Industry Critics

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Testimony by past and present leaders of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in support of a prominent trader who faces disciplinary action has reignited a debate over whether the industry is too rife with cronyism to regulate itself as it does now.
The trader, Brian P. Monieson, a former chairman of the exchange, is accused of inadequately supervising two employees who in turn are accused of cheating customers. He maintains his innocence. The accusations against him are being considered at a disciplinary hearing by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the Merc and is pressing the cases against the two employees. The hearing resumes Tuesday.
 
An Unusual Arrangement
Among those who have agreed to testify on Mr. Monieson's behalf are Clayton K. Yeutter, the Secretary of Agriculture and a president of the mercantile exchange when Mr. Monieson was chairman, and Leo Melamed, the chairman of the exchange's executive committee. Jerrold E. Salzman, the exchange's outside legal counsel, has agreed to defend Mr. Monieson in what even exchange officials acknowledge is an unusual arrangement. 
The case has already led Thomas F. Eagleton, the former Missouri Senator and one of the mercantile exchange's most prominent board members, to resign in protest. In a rare public airing of dissent that is frequently only muttered, Mr. Eagleton said he was fed up because the futures exchanges are insiders' clubs with far too much leeway to regulate themselves.
''The Brian Monieson case proves that self-regulation is a 14-carat myth,'' Mr. Eagleton, now a lawyer in St. Louis, said in a telephone interview last week. ''It proves that when an insider gets in trouble, the other insiders will come to his aid and rescue.''
The case is only the latest source of trouble for the commodity futures industry. Earlier this year, an F.B.I. ''sting'' operation led to indictments against 48 traders on the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade. And the Board of Trade suffered another blow to its image when it intervened in the pricing of soybean contracts after a large Italian grain merchant appeared to have cornered the market. Critics charged that the Board of Trade was seeking to bail out powerful members who had entered into contracts that required them to deliver soybeans.
These cases have served to intensify criticism of the commodities industry that has been brewing for years among investors and economists.
The Monieson case has increased concerns on Capitol Hill about the industry's ability to police itself. Even before this case came up, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, has been pushing legislation that would mandate stricter oversight of the exchanges by Federal regulators.
Critics of the exchanges find it a conflict of interest for important industry officials, who under the futures industry's system of self-regulation are responsible for enforcing commodities laws, to testify in Mr. Monieson's defense. Mr. Eagleton particularly objected to permitting Mr. Salzman, who frequently advises the board on complex disciplinary matters, to defend Mr. Monieson.
At least one industry official who was scheduled to testify on Mr. Monieson's behalf has already canceled his appearance ''to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.'' He is Robert K. Wilmouth, president of the National Futures Association, which helps police the industry.
 
Propriety Questioned
Specialists in government ethics, including people who have not been involved with the case, questioned the propriety of Mr. Yeutter's testimony. They note that while the Department of Agriculture is technically separate from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, both agencies are part of the executive branch of Government.
''Why do we have one member of the executive branch undermining what another member is doing?'' asked Alan Morrison, director of the Public Citizen Litigation Group, a Washington-based public-interest organization, who was asked to comment. ''Either Yeutter shuts up and lets his friend swing or goes to the support of his friend and resigns his job.''
But the former and current mercantile exchange officials involved say they can justify their positions. Mr. Yeutter, who spoke through an aide, has said he is acting as a private citizen, testifying only to Mr. Monieson's good character. Mr. Melamed, who declined to be interviewed, has said he considers his testimony to be that of a private citizen acting as a character witness for a long-time friend. Mr. Salzman did not return a telephone call, but mercantile exchange officials have said that contrary to Mr. Eagleton's view, Mr. Salzman is not technically an enforcement official and therefore is free to defend Mr. Monieson.
 
Witnesses Defended
And Mr. Yeutter has backing for his decision to get involved. His testimony ''will support the legal process rather than undermine it,'' said Leonard Garment, a White House counsel under President Nixon who is now a Washington lawyer. Such testimony, Mr. Garment said, ''permits people to have a full defense, which includes character testimony.'' Mr. Garment added that there was considerable precedent. He noted that when Alger Hiss was tried for perjury in the 1950's, two Supreme Court justices testified as character witnesses.
Exchange officials have also raised questions about Mr. Eagleton's motives. One board member, who asked that his name not be used, said Mr. Eagleton had become a critic only this year, after more than two years on the board, when the possibility arose that board members might be sued by disgruntled investors concerned about Justice Department accusations of fraud on the exchange floor. In fact, this board member noted, Mr. Eagleton began showing up at certain exchange meetings with his own private attorney.
''Through April there was not a peep of a problem,'' the board member said, adding: ''Eagleton is trying to make much more out of this than it is. There is a strong record of people in important public positions acting as character witnesses.''
 
'Circling the Wagons'
Mr. Eagleton was so disturbed by the Monieson case that he released a resignation letter in which he accused the Merc board of ''rallying around the flag'' and ''circling the wagons'' to defend Mr. Monieson and of regularly engaging in ''non-Lincolnian decisions of insiders, by insiders and for insiders.''
He followed that with a blistering attack on the board, published on the Op-Ed Page of The New York Times on Nov. 14.
Mr. Eagleton said the Monieson was but the final straw.
Last spring, when a special committee empaneled to consider trading-practice changes issued its report, Mr. Eagleton released a separate conclusion calling for tighter Federal regulation of the futures business. In board meetings, he had already been an outspoken critic of the exchange's ''open outcry'' system of trading, which he viewed as inviting abuse, and of what he considered the exchange's lax training requirements for brokers and feeble enforcement efforts.
 
None Share Concern
At the board's meeting this month, Mr. Eagleton immediately voiced his concern about having exchange officials testify on Mr. Monieson's behalf. According to the former senator, none of the board members shared his concern.
Mr. Eagleton said he then attempted to learn whether the exchange was pursuing its own disciplinary action against either Mr. Monieson or his firm, GNP Commodities Inc. Board officials refused to comment.
Finally, Mr. Eagleton pressed the board on what he considered to be the most glaring conflict: permitting Mr. Salzman to defend Mr. Monieson. In Mr. Eagleton's view, Mr. Salzman was attempting to wear two hats, as an exchange prosecutor and as a defense lawyer.
 
Dissent Is Rare
In a business known for rarely breaking ranks, at least one industry executive thinks the mercantile exchange leadership has mishandled the case. ''The people who are responsible for exchanges and self-regulation have to be awfully careful not to get too closely attached to an individual,'' said James H. Lindau, president of the Minneapolis Grain Exchange.
But such dissenting views within the industry are rare. And one industry defender goes so far as to suggest that the Monieson case demonstrates how well self-regulation can work.
''The system works so effectively that they even get the heavyweights,'' said Philip McBride Johnson, a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission who is now a New York attorney, referring to Mr. Monieson. ''If the people who are prominent in the business were never touched by the regulatory process, I would be more concerned.''
Mr. Monieson could be banned from the futures business if the C.F.T.C. wins its case.
 
Started as a Trader
For years, the 53-year-old trader has been a prominent member of the mercantile exchange. A native of Chicago's North Side, Mr. Monieson started in the business in the early 1970's as a pork-belly trader with $50,000 in capital, just above the minimum necessary to trade. In 1973, he and a childhood friend, Myron Rosenthal, formed GNP and were soon dealing in virtually all the mercantile exchange's trading areas. In 1983, Mr. Monieson was elected chairman of the exchange and he served for two years.
Along the way, however, both GNP and Mr. Monieson have had run-ins with enforcement officials. The current C.F.T.C. charges relate to Mr. Monieson's supervision of two former GNP salesmen, Norman R. Furlett and Ira P. Greenspon. In brief, the commission charges that the two salesmen diverted profitable trades to their personal accounts while steering losing trades to customers and that Mr. Monieson knew about the wrongdoing but failed to stop it. Mr. Monieson, who denies the accusations, declined to be interviewed.
Earlier, GNP was reprimanded or fined on six occasions by the Merc's enforcement department for violating various exchange rules. And in 1986, Mr. Monieson's personal trading positions became so large that at one point the exchange fined him $10,000 for exceeding speculative limits. It apparently was the only time someone who had served as exchange chairman had been disciplined.

HEADLINE: Studies Ask Electronics Aid by U.S.

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Just as the Bush Administration is reported to be planning cutbacks in support for high technology, two studies issued today warned that the nation faced dire economic consequences unless the Government more actively helped the electronics industry.
The studies - by the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors and the Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit Washington research organization started by economists who favor Government involvement in industry - said that the United States was falling behind foreign competitors in key areas of semiconductors and telecommunications.
Both urged programs to develop consumer electronics products and nationwide high-speed telecommunications networks.
 
Loss of Jobs Seen
''The jobs of millions of Americans are at stake'' if the semiconductor industry is not preserved, said Ian Ross, chairman of the semiconductor advisory committee. The Economic Policy Institute estimated that the failure of American industry to participate in high-definition television and the related industries of semiconductors, computers and video displays, would result in a trade deficit from those industries alone of $225 billion in the year 2010 and the loss of two million jobs. 
The reports have long been in the planning and were not a direct response to the recent reports that the Administration was thinking of cutting Defense Department programs that support the development of high-definition television and semiconductors. It is not certain yet that those cuts will be made.
 
Opposition of Officials Cited
Still, opponents of such cutbacks think the studies will help preserve financing for high-technology initiatives. On the other hand, they acknowledge that the opposition of some key officials in the Administration to helping specific industries could mean that many of the more ambitious recommendations would be disregarded.
The National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors, a group of industry leaders and Government officials set up by last year's trade law, said in its report that the nation's computer chip industry was rapidly losing ground to Japanese competitors.
''Every trend you look at, if you read our report, is in the wrong direction,'' said Dr. Ross, the chairman, who is the president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's Bell Laboratories.
Even more serious, he added, was the condition of the many small companies that made the equipment and materials used to produce computer chips. Dr. Ross, who spoke at a Washington news conference that could be heard by telephone, said that the industry would fall a generation of technology behind the Japanese unless corrective action was taken in the next two years.
The committee's report was delivered to the White House earlier this month and not officially made public, although a copy of it was obtained and reported on previously. The lack of official release prompted critics to charge that the report was being suppressed because of Administration opposition to a Federal role in industrial development. But Dr. Ross denied that the report's release was delayed. He said he expected the report to prompt ''debate and discussion'' within the Administration.
The study calls for an effort to establish a Consumer Electronics Capital Corporation, which would provide low-cost, long-term capital to fledgling consumer electronics companies and technologies.
 
Billions in Commercial Debt
The capital corporation would raise hundreds of millions of dollars in equity from industry, institutional investors and state and local governments, and would also raise billions of dollars in commercial debt. The Federal Government would not contribute money directly, but would provide ''pledges of support'' to help the corporation get lower interest rates when borrowing.
Dr. Ross said such pledges might be loan guarantees or something less. Robert Cohen, a consultant to the committee, said the investment corporation might work like the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Student Loan Marketing Association, which are private entities with some implicit Government support.
The report also calls for increasing the financing of Sematech, the semiconductor research consortium, by $100 million a year immediately and by $800 million over three years. The purpose would be to step up Sematech's role in helping the developers of equipment and materials used in chip-making. Sematech's financing now amounts to $200 million a year, half of which comes from the Federal Government and half from industry.
 
General Steps Urged
The report also calls for various general steps to help reduce the cost of capital, to improve education and to transfer to industry some work being done by the National Laboratories related to X-ray lithography, a technique for making advanced chips.
The Economic Policy Institute said in its report that American telecommunications policies had been dictated more by antitrust and rate regulation considerations than by the concerns of international competitiveness.
The industry is fragmented, with different telephone companies and different state regulatory commissions making it difficult to plan nationwide improvements, it added.
''The existing policy framework impedes constructive responses to the challenges posed by foreign competition, the emergence of digital technologies and the convergence of computers and communications,'' said the report, which was written by Mr. Cohen, a New York-based consultant, and Kenneth Donow, an adviser to the National Center for Telecommunication and Information Policy. It urges creation of a national Department of Communications to coordinate policies.

HEADLINE: U.S. Securities Advance in Price

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose modestly in quiet trading yesterday, as market participants failed to follow-through on a rally that began during overnight trading in the Far East.
Activity in Japan and in the futures pits in Chicago was heavy Sunday night, as traders snapped up securities after news reports of huge potential cuts by the United States in military spending in the wake of developments in Eastern Europe.
As trading shifted around the globe, however, doubts about whether those cost reductions would have a beneficial impact on America's budget deficit began to surface. In the wake of those doubts, Treasury prices began to slide. 
''The Cheney bounce is over,'' one Treasury bill trader said, referring to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Mr. Cheney made public over the weekend plans to cut $180 million in military spending from the Federal budget from 1992-94.
''It is hard to believe that cuts in defense spending will translate into a dollar-for-dollar cut in the budget deficit,'' said Mike Tindall, an economist at the Discount Corporation of New York.
 
Traders Monitoring Funds Rate
Aside from speculation about military spending, traders were closely monitoring movements in the overnight Federal funds rate.
The Fed, which sent a clear signal to the market last week that it did not want the funds rate to dip below 8.50 percent, yesterday failed to enter the market to drain reserves when the funds rate was trading at 8 3/8 percent.
''The funds rate was at 8 3/8 percent and the Fed was not in the market,'' one government trader said. ''It makes you wonder if they didn't decide to do something at the Open Market Committee meeting last week.''
The funds rate subsequently inched higher, and in late trading was offered at 8 7/16 percent.
''They could be setting up for an easing move,'' the government bond trader said. ''Since the Fed is concerned about the manufacturing sector, Wednesday's durable goods report could influence their decision to move.''
While it may influence trading, market participants do not expect today's report on consumer prices to tip the Fed's hand.
 
Consumer Price Forecast
In advance of the report, most Wall Street economists were forecasting that consumer prices rose by about four-tenths of a percentage point in October, and a shade less excluding the volatile food and energy sectors.
In other developments, interest rates on short-term Treasury bills eased at the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills.
At the auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.61 percent, down from an average rate of 7.68 percent a week ago.
Six-month bills were auctioned at an average rate of 7.40 percent, compared with an average rate of 7.51 percent last week.
In the secondary market for notes and bonds, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 102 14/32 late yesterday, up 1/4 of a point, to yield 7.90 percent.
Meanwhile, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 1/8, up 1/32, to yield 7.85 percent. The 8 1/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 101 26/32, unchanged on the day, to yield 7.79 percent. And the 7 5/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 25/32, up 1/32, to yield 7.74 percent.
Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds was extremely slow, traders said. Prices of corporate bonds rose by about 1/8 of a point, participants said. Prices of most municipal bond issues were unchanged on the day.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Crude Oil Prices Advance; Taking of Deliveries Cited

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Crude oil prices advanced, bolstered by the large number of actual deliveries against the spot December futures contract, which expired yesterday.
Those not interested in taking delivery or in delivering the underlying product by expiration day usually roll over their contracts into the next delivery month, often paying a premium to do so. But there were only a relatively small number of rollovers into the January contract. 
The expired December contract settled on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $20.07 a barrel, up 16 cents on the day, after trading between $20.25 and $19.75. The contract's high was $20.67, set this past Oct. 13, and the low, $12.70, was posted on Nov. 17, 1988.
As for the new spot January delivery, it rose 16 cents, closing at $19.99, after trading between $20.02 and $19.75.
''Although January crude traded above the spot month at times during the session on strong investment-house demand, it wasn't enough to keep it there,'' said Bradford H. Hughes, energy products trader at Cargill Investor Services. ''Not even the two big buyers of the January crude, Shearson and J. Aron, appeared interested in bidding the new spot delivery above $20.''
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. is believed to be the largest futures trading house, while J. Aron is the commodity trading arm of Goldman, Sachs & Company.
 
Fire at Chevron Ignored
In the usual excitement that attends the expiration of a contract, the energy market ignored the fire last Friday that shut down a Chevron Corporation crude refinery in California, Mr. Hughes said. ''Besides,'' he added, ''there is plenty of crude in California, and the 135,000-barrel-a-day facility is expected to be back on line in a few weeks.''
Peter C. Beutel, energy specialist at Elders Futures Inc., said the market also ignored trade reports that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries plans to raise its collective output by a million barrels a day, to 21.5 million, on Jan. 1. ''Even if it were true, demand for crude tends to decline in the first quarter,'' Mr. Beutel noted. ''Barring any unexpected news from OPEC, the Northern Hemisphere crude market should now be focusing on heating oil.''
Heating oil prices tend to decline from mid-November to just before Christmas, Mr. Beutel said, mainly because November is a warmer month than March. After Christmas, heating oil prices reflect weather conditions but tend to soften by late February. ''But in early March, there is usually an upward spike,'' he explained. ''Why? Because heating oil stocks are down and refineries have begun to switch more facilities to gasoline production. So any cold spell in early March usually sends heating oil prices up temporarily.''
The spot heating oil contract for December delivery rose 0.81 cent a gallon, closing at 60.08 cents, while the same unleaded gasoline contract was up 0.27 cent a gallon, at 52.25 cents. Spot December heating oil and gasoline contracts expire on Nov. 30.
Copper futures prices fell sharply yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York as worries about the United States economy fueled a selloff that began last week.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's remarks on Sunday that there could be big cuts in military spending was also seen as a bad sign for copper. Copper settled 0.60 cent to 3 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in November at $1.062 a pound.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Mark Trading But Is Higher Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against European currencies yesterday but rose against the yen.
The central banks of several nations, including the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, sold dollars in an effort to halt the dollar's rise against the yen. While the dollar still rose against the Japanese currency, the intervention appeared to worry traders enough to push the dollar lower against the mark and other European currencies. 
Traders were also concerned about the possibility that United States interest rates might decline further.
 
Dollar at 144.67 Yen in Tokyo
The dollar rose to 144.35 yen in New York, from 144.25 late Friday. In trading earlier in Tokyo, the dollar had closed at 144.67 Japanese yen, up from 143.98 yen, and in London, it had closed lower at 144.50 yen.
Against the mark, the dollar fell to 1.8338 from 1.8410.
In its decline against European currencies, the dollar was hurt by signs of progress from Washington on budget cuts, said Jack Barbanel, a foreign exchange analyst with First Global Asset Management Inc.
Congressional leaders said yesterday that they were close to agreement on a bill reducing the Federal budget deficit, while Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was considering $180 billion in military spending cuts over the next six years.
 
More Possible Fed Leeway
Budget cuts might give the Federal Reserve Board some leeway to allow interest rates to fall, Mr. Barbanel said. If rates decline in the United States while remaining high overseas, the dollar would be less attractive to foreign investors.
In earlier trading abroad, the dollar was mixed. Dealers said the dollar initially rose on reports of planned military spending cuts, but the currency was unable to maintain its advance.
The British pound fell sharply against the dollar, prompting the Bank of England to buy pounds for dollars. Dealers said there was some nervousness about the October British trade figures due on Thursday in view of increasing deficits in recent months.
In London, the pound cost $1.5595, cheaper for buyers than late Friday's $1.5705, and in New York, the pound fell to $1.5582, from $1.5670 late Friday.
 
Late Dollar Rates
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.62975 Swiss francs, down from 1.6307; 6.2435 French francs, down from 6.2630; 1,350 Italian lire, down from 1,355, and 1.7105 Canadian dollars, up from 1.6945.
Gold bullion prices, meanwhile, continued the steady upward climb of the last three weeks, and dealers said they expected to see the $400 level tested soon.
In New York, the Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $398 for a troy ounce of gold, up $3.75. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce rose $3.60, to $398.20.

HEADLINE: Steady, Painful Transition To a Humbler Wall Street

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
These are nervous days on Wall Street. As cutbacks mount, more and more investment bankers, brokers and office workers face the year-end prospect of sharply lower incomes or no jobs at all.
The recent round of cutbacks at leading investment houses like Shearson Lehman Hutton and Drexel Burnham Lambert is not just a belt-tightening exercise. It represents a fundamental realignment on Wall Street, one that is likely to result in investment houses being smaller, more specialized and more humble in their aims.
Some firms, Wall Street executives and analysts said, will pare back costly operations, like vast networks of local brokerage offices catering to individual investors across America and international outposts in many countries. Other firms could drop out of certain securities businesses altogether. 
 
Glory Days Are Over
Today's retrenchment is driven by an underlying recognition that the glory days of the 1980's, when 26-year-olds commanded $300,000 a year and takeover deals flourished, are truly over. ''People are having to make some very tough decisions,'' said Peter A. Cohen, chief executive of Shearson Lehman. ''We're just emerging from one of the longest up cycles the industry has ever had.''
The transition to a smaller, lower-paid, less glamorous business is bound to be painful, both for the bright young stars who were drawn to the industry and for the New York region, which became dependent on it. Many bonus checks could be cut by 30 percent or more, some executives said.
Traditionally, Wall Street's fortunes swing up and down with the stock market. But today, small investors are retreating, corporate takeovers are getting scarcer and the market for high-risk, high-yield ''junk bonds'' is in turmoil. What especially worries industry executives is that business is depressed at a time when the economy is still holding up reasonably well and share prices are up more than 20 percent for the year.
 
Little Debate on Direction
''The industry is having problems before the economy even slows down,'' observed Sanford I. Weill, chief executive of the Primerica Corporation, which owns Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''What happens if there is a serious economic downturn?''
There may be uncertainty about the securities industry's final shape, but there is little debate about its direction. ''Today, people don't know how far down 'down' is,'' said Lowell L. Bryan, who heads the financial institutions practice at McKinsey & Company, a consulting firm.
One sign of the chastened tone on Wall Street is that several big investment houses are actually seeking the guidance of outsiders. McKinsey, for example, is advising four Wall Street firms on ways to reshape management and improve profitability, far more than in previous periods, Mr. Bryan said.

One sign of the chastened tone on Wall Street is that several big investment houses are actually seeking the guidance of outsiders. McKinsey, for example, is advising four Wall Street firms on ways to reshape management and improve profitability, far more than in previous periods, Mr. Bryan said.
The decline on Wall Street comes at an unfortunate time for the New York area, already suffering from a stagnant real estate market, an economic slump on Long Island and mounting fiscal problems. With pay scales two and a half times the city average, Wall Street has been responsible for 20 percent of the rise in private-sector income over the last decade.
In the early 1980's, the securities industry boomed, fueled by a surging stock market and a wave of huge takeovers. The industry responded by vastly expanding its foundation. Firms like Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley tripled or quadrupled their work forces, while the amount of capital the largest firms committed to the industry grew from $5.4 billion in 1980 to $27 billion at the end of last year.
 
Response to '87 Crash
The stock market crash in 1987 was the first blow to the industry, and in response Wall Street promptly shed about 24,000 jobs, or about 10 percent of the work force. But despite widespread predictions to the contrary, the economy remained strong and the takeover business, briefly quiescent, soon rebounded.
Starting this summer, however, Wall Street's two most lucrative fee-paying businesses - arranging mergers and underwriting junk bonds - turned sour. ''Clearly we and everyone else on the Street are under pressure,'' said Frederick H. Joseph, chief executive of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., whose business has been heavily dependent on mergers and junk bonds. Mr. Joseph confirmed that Drexel has not yet been profitable in the fourth quarter.
The havoc in the junk bond market has been caused by the fading fortunes of several of the big mergers financed with junk bonds and large amounts of bank debt. Heavily indebted companies like Campeau, Resorts International and Integrated Resources have had trouble keeping up with interest payments, scaring off potential junk bond investors. With investors and bankers skittish, the number of takeover deals in the works is falling off, and analysts say this newfound caution is not temporary, but reflects a deeper skepticism of the excesses of the past.
 
Dramatic Results
This turnaround in sentiment is already yielding dramatic results. Junk bond issuance in the second half is about 40 percent below what it was for the period last year. And the dollar amount of takeovers is almost 30 percent lower than it was last year.
Wall Street's profits have also been hurt by the market plunge of Oct. 13, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 190 points. Individual investors who had begun to tiptoe back into stocks scurried for cover, more convinced than ever that the market was not a place for them.
The turbulent stock market also dampened another key business on Wall Street: issuing equity for companies. When stocks began to climb earlier this year, many corporate treasurers took that as a sign that stability was finally returning and that it was time to line up to issue new shares or to go public.
''The Street was going to make a good piece of its money on equity offerings in the fourth quarter,'' said Michael W. Blumstein, an analyst at C.S. First Boston Inc. But he said, ''We're not seeing the same number of offerings since the 13th.'' And that business was already down 36 percent in the first 9 months of the year.
 
High-Stakes Bets
With profits disappearing in so many critical areas, many executives are now having to place high-stakes bets on which businesses will help them get through the next few difficult years.
At Shearson Lehman, for instance, Mr. Cohen is close to instigating a management shake-up he has reportedly agonized over for months. The changes, which will be announced in the next few weeks, are likely to include a reduced role for the firm's president, Jeffrey B. Lane, a longtime friend and colleague of Mr. Cohen. Mr. Lane is closely identified with the 1987 decision to purchase financially troubled E. F. Hutton & Company for nearly $1 billion, a move that vastly increased Shearson's army of retail brokers. And he has had supervisory responsibility for the firm's Boston Company subsidiary, which had surprising losses this year.
After the management changes are announced, a young group of investment bankers is expected to play a much larger role in the running of the firm, a shift that some executives said would result in a much closer scrutiny of the firm's retail business, and a re-examination of the goal to be a global enterprise. Already Shearson is taking a much tougher line, reducing commissions to its brokers for the first time in 15 years. And although the firm recently acknowledged that it was laying off 800 employees, executives close to the firm say the number is likely to be much higher.
 
All Things to All People
For its part, Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. is pruning back its investment banking effort, focusing it on areas where it has an advantage, rather than trying to be all things to all people. That marks a sharp reversal from 1986, when the firm, with great fanfare, announced ''Project '89'' - an initiative intended to boost the firm into the big leagues of investment banking.
George L. Ball, the chief executive, said this shift ''reflects a belief that investment banking revenue opportunities will be more difficult to come by than was the case in the early and mid-1980's.'' Indeed, one of the two authors of Project '89, Theodore V. Fowler, recently resigned from the firm, citing differences over direction. People close to the firm said Mr. Fowler had wanted to hire 50 or 60 more investment bankers.
Salomon Brothers also has plans to cut its investment banking force. Of the 100 executives the firm intends to lay off by year-end, at least 60 are going to come from the investment banking side, not sales and trading.
 
Reworking an Image
Some industry observers view that as a change in Salomon's strategy. For the last year and a half the firm has worked hard to convince the public that it is not simply a trading firm but a broad-based investment bank that can advise on mergers as well as the next one.
In recent months, though, Salomon's earnings have been won or lost by large trading bets it has made for its own account. Against that backdrop, industry analysts view the Salomon cutbacks in investment banking as a sign that trading is once again being recognized as the driving force at the firm.
Salomon's chief executive, John H. Gutfreund, denies that there is any shift in strategy. ''We are committed to investment banking and research, but we have to convert our commitment to profitability,'' he said. ''And we are not satisfied yet.'' Mr. Gutfreund said he would be willing to add more people in investment banking, but they would have to come at the expense of those at lower rungs.
 
Anxiety at Drexel
At Drexel, meanwhile, anxiety continues to mount. As the dominant firm in the field, Drexel is the most seriously affected by the decline in the issue of junk bonds and the trading losses that have afflicted that area this summer. Drexel tried to address its profitability problems earlier this year by selling its retail business and sharply reducing its commitment to municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities. But the recent downturn in deal making and junk bonds has sent the firm reeling.
Executives there talk of managerial turmoil and an almost desperate effort to scrape up fees. Rumors have been rampant that Drexel is considering selling its institutional equities business to the Nomura Securities Company of Tokyo, although Mr. Joseph dismisses such stories as ''baloney.'' But that such a rumor would even make the rounds indicates how far-reaching Wall Street's restructuring is likely to be. Only a few years ago, the thought that a major firm would give up a business as central as institutional equities would have been considered laughable.

HEADLINE: Greeks Agree on a Broad Coalition Until April

BYLINE: By PAUL ANASTASI, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATHENS, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Ending a two-week political crisis, the three main political parties set aside their differences today and agreed to a coalition government that will rule Greece until new elections are held in April.
After four days of difficult negotiations, the conservatives, Socialists and Communists issued statements saying that compromise was needed to address pressing economic problems and to avoid a new election immediately. Elections have been held twice since June, and no party gained a parliamentary majority in either. The parties said the new government will be established within a day, and that Xenophon Zolotas, an 85-year-old former governor of the Bank of Greece, will be Prime Minister. 
The leaders of the three main parties will not hold posts in the Government. Other major posts will go to technical experts and politicians in proportion to the percentage of the popular vote each of the three parties party won in the most recent election, on Nov. 5.
But the partners in the new Government made it clear that it would have difficulty tackling such major foreign policy issues as the American bases in Greece and the extradition to the United States of a Palestinian wanted on terrorism charges.
If the parties had failed to agree, Parliament would have been dissolved today and elections held in four weeks.
On Nov. 5, the conservative New Democracy Party won 46.2 percent of the votes, the Socialists 40.7, and the Communists 11 percent. The remaining 2 percent went to the Greens and smaller parties.
The deadlock in negotiations was overcome after Andreas Papandreou, the Socialist leader and former Prime Minister, withdrew a demand for a change in the electoral system. If his demand had been met, smaller parties would have benefited and the conservatives would have had little chance of coming to power. Mr. Papandreou also failed in an attempt to negotiate a coalition with the Communists.
Mr. Papandreou had governed for eight years until a conservative-Communist coalition was formed after the June election with the purpose of pursuing corruption charges against him and officials in his Government.
The three parties agreed to a statement of principles that focuses primarily on social and economic issues and avoids problem areas like foreign policy. But they agreed that they would try to address the issue of the American bases in Greece, although they have widely divergent views on the issue. The Communists want the bases removed immediately, the Socialists want a referendum and the conservatives want a negotiated settlement for their continued presence.
The five-year agreement on the bases, signed in 1983, has already expired and the installations are due to be removed by next May. But officials from all parties said an extension may be granted pending a final solution.
The parties said they would not deal with the American extradition request for Mohammed Rashid, a Palestinian who is wanted for a bomb attack on a Pan American jetliner in 1982. A final decision on Mr. Rashid's case is not expected until next September.
''We want Rashid to be set free, or in the worst of cases to be put on trial in Greece, not in the U.S.,'' said Harilaos Florakis, the Communist leader. ''We will not spare any effort toward this end. In the meantime, nobody can touch Rashid.''

HEADLINE: Clamor in the East;
Old Master Spy in East Berlin Tells Why He Backs Changes

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST BERLIN, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Among the artists, intellectuals, clerics and other former dissidents at the forefront of those in East Germany calling for changes, Markus Wolf clearly stands out.
A big, dapper man given to well-cut tweed suits, Mr. Wolf was for 33 years East Germany's master spy. In fact, he is one of the few East Germans who cannot take advantage of the new travel freedoms because his espionage coups in West Germany have made him a wanted man there.
But three years after his retirement from the Ministry of State Security, Mr. Wolf, 66 years old, has become a leading proponent of change, appearing on television talk shows and opposition panel discussions, and he was a featured speaker at the huge rally in East Berlin on Nov. 4. 
Now there is talk that the man who bedeviled the West German Government with his spies - including the celebrated Gunter Guillaume, who became a personal aide to Willy Brandt and whose uncloaking brought about the fall of the Social Democratic Chancellor in 1974 - may himself become part of a new party leadership selected when the Communist Party holds its congress next month.
 
Savoring the Limelight
Mr. Wolf denies any such ambitions. But after decades of toiling in the shadows, he seems to savor the limelight, and he is not unaware that spymasters in both superpowers have risen to the top - his ''good friend'' the late Yuri V. Andropov in Moscow and President Bush in Washington.
His own emergence as a reformer, he insists, was not a metamorphosis. His position in the East German Ministry of State Security, where he headed foreign intelligence, gave him access to information and license to ponder the growing problems in his homeland.
And his wartime years spent in the Soviet Union left him friends among Russians who later emerged at the forefront of perestroika and glasnost, including Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, the man President Mikhail S. Gorbachev chose to head the K.G.B.
Through Mr. Kryuchkov, he knew what was happening inside Mr. Gorbachev's Moscow. And through him, Moscow evidently kept abreast of what was happening in East Germany.
''A year ago I was telling the Russians we could still turn things around here in respect to glasnost and perestroika,'' Mr. Wolf said in an interview, casually acknowledging a close working relationship with Moscow.
He was saying the same things at home. ''From the beginning of this year I told all our leaders that this will happen,'' he said, reflecting on the dramatic demonstrations that had forced the Communist Party into retreat.
''I didn't know it would be so powerful, or that there was such pressure. But even a half year ago there was still a chance for the party to take charge of these events. As it turned out, it was impossible with the old leadership.''
 
Critical of Stalinism
Mr. Wolf's public debut as a reformer was a book published this year. Called ''The Troika,'' it described the lives of three families who lived together in Moscow before World War II and followed separate paths during the war - the families of Mr. Wolf's father, Friedrich, the American historian Louis Fisher and Wilhelm Bloch, who fought in Hitler's army and ended up a businessman in West Germany. .
The biggest sensation, however, was that the celebrated spymaster took a highly critical view in the book of Stalinism, a view then still taboo in East Germany, and of East Germany's policies in the 1970's, when many artists were purged. Mr. Wolf became an overnight celebrity, now as a champion of change.
''The huge interest in my book was not linked to its content, but to the new demand for the truth, not to hide past errors,'' he said. ''These demands were very strong in the party. Whoever I met demanded change - I never met anyone, in fact, who did not demand fundamental reform. But we were unable to act in good time.''
Mr. Wolf professes to be proud of the peaceful and disciplined way East Germans handled their quiet revolution.
''Gorbachev's was a revolution from above,'' he said. ''Ours was from below. To those who know the history of Germany, this is a phenomenon, that the people have been so wise, so reserved.''
 
Still Favors Communism
His great regret, he insists, is that this initiative did not come from the party. He repeatedly refers to the Socialist Unity Party, as the East German Communist organization is formally known, as ''my party,'' and when he talks of reform, he leaves no doubt that he is talking of changes that would preserve a Communist system.
''If we want to preserve socialism -and for that we'll fight - we must have a precise concept of how we should move ahead,'' he said.
Mr. Wolf said academics at Humboldt University in East Berlin were already at work on concepts for reforming the party and the economy, while the opposition, including New Forum, had no expertise in these matters.
''If the leadership of the party is capable of again taking charge of the party, I'm convinced the party will not disappear,'' he said.
In an interview with West German television on Monday night, however, Mr. Wolf acknowledged that the Communist Party might eventually be forced into opposition. ''Considering that most opposition groups are aiming at some kind of socialism, whatever they understand by socialism, we might have to say goodbye to the thought that the future of socialism has to be bound to one single party,'' he said.
Mr. Wolf does not exclude his former organization from the need for change. He outlined several changes he would demand, including examination of every reported violation of law by the State Security organization and compensation for its victims; a ''new thinking, especially in regard to dissidents,'' and tight controls over the security apparatus.
Rehabilitating the State Security apparatus stands to be a major challenge. The hated Staasi have been a major target of virtually every demonstration, and Mr. Wolf himself faced prolonged jeers when he rose to address the demonstration on Nov. 4.
''Workers of my former ministry must appear in public and fight for public confidence,'' he said. ''If the public believes that this organization really takes care of state security, and that the rights of individuals are protected, it should accept it.''

HEADLINE: A Union Folds Its Hand

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The new union agreement at the Boeing Company, ratified after a 48-day strike, shows that even under the most favorable circumstances the labor movement cannot win the clear-cut victories that were commonplace a decade ago.
The struggle at Boeing was significant because, for the first time in years, a union entered a major contract negotiation holding the best cards.
With record profits and a huge backlog of orders for jets, Boeing could not plead poverty. And commercial aircraft manufacturing is not automated; Boeing could not operate without its production workers. 
Nevertheless, the International Association of Machinists fell well short of its main goals. It had insisted upon an 18 percent wage increase over three years, but instead settled for 10 percent. It tried to get rid of bonuses that for the six previous years had been substituted for wage increases, but the strike ended after Boeing sweetened its bonus offer while holding firm on its wage package.
 
The Trend Continues
''The Boeing settlement failed to reverse a national trend toward flexible pay,'' said Al Bauman, a Labor Department economist. ''I thought that if anyone was going to get rid of bonuses, it would have been the machinists.''
American companies have been moving slowly away from fixed wage increases, which must be paid in good times and bad. Instead, bonuses and profit sharing are being substituted, and these can rise or fall as a company's fortunes change. Today, about 44 percent of the six million people covered by major collective-bargaining agreements - and many thousands of non-unionized workers - receive bonuses or profit sharing, or some form of flexible pay. Among union members, this is up from 31 percent in 1984, according to the Labor Department.
The Boeing settlement is likely to further the trend, says Willam Wallace, Boeing's chief research economist. ''The machinists' willingness, in the end, to accept bonuses is a reasonable basis for exploring profit sharing and for tying labor costs more closely to profits,'' he said. Boeing has been exploring the possibilities of a profit-sharing plan, Mr. Wallace added.
 
Timed for Christmas
Some of the machinists' national leaders had criticized the leadership of the unit covering Boeing's 57,000 workers for allowing the company to substitute bonuses for wage increases. But even George Korpius, the machinists' national president, acknowledged that Boeing's workers, the majority of them young people with less than six years at the company, had become used to bonus payments, which are strategically paid just before Christmas.
For months before the strike the machinists had used videotapes and lectures to explain to the members that bonus payments are not as valuable as wages - or as costly for the company - because they do not count in the calculation of overtime, sick pay, vacation pay and pensions. In addition, a worker's pay compounds with annual wage increases, but bonuses do not. ''There is a money illusion here,'' said Brian Turner, an A.F.L.-C.I.O. official.
Boeing played to this money illusion, structuring the bonus so that two weeks after returning to work, the machinists will receive a bonus equal to 10 percent of their gross pay this past year, which means $3,000 to $7,000 for most workers. Each worker gets a $500 advance on this bonus upon returning to work today.
 
A Consolation Is Seen
Despite the bonuses, the settlement that resulted from the long strike did advance labor's cause in some ways. Mr. Korpius noted that for the first time in more than six years the union gained ground rather than granting any concessions - a claim many other unions cannot make.
While the Communications Workers of America, for example, recently sacrificed on wage increases to get telephone companies to agree to pay health insurance premiums, the machinists won not only their first wage increases in six years, but improvements in health insurance, overtime rules, pension benefits and cost-of-living pay.
Boeing's production workers earned an average of $13.50 an hour going into the strike, compared with the national average of $10.54 an hour for manufacturing workers. The wage increase, 4 percent the first year and 3 percent in each subsequent year, only matched the average achieved in other major contract settlements this year, the Labor Department reports. The machinists' great leverage in the Boeing negotiations gained them no advantage on this score.
But the leverage did help improve the cost-of-living increase, which does raise wages. While the trend in the 1980's has been to shed cost-of-living clauses, the machinists improved theirs, getting Boeing to agree to raise wages nearly a percentage point for each rise of a point in the Consumer Price Index. This inflation insurance compares with an average coverage of 62 percent won by other unions this year, and with the machinists' 80 percent coverage under the old contract.
''They took a long strike to get very little,'' said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow and labor expert at the Brookings Institution. ''But with the cost-of-living and wage increase and bonus, they are doing twice as well as the typical American worker.''

HEADLINE: Albany Must Take Steps to Keep and Attract Manufacturing Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Every New Yorker should be concerned about the loss of more than 230,000 manufacturing jobs in our state in this decade. But despite the loss of companies and jobs, manufacturing remains the heart of the state's economy. It's no exaggeration to say that all our livelihoods ultimately depend on manufacturing. Investment, employment and growth in other sectors are based on a healthy, goods-producing base that demands - and pays for - services, construction and wholesale and retail trade. 
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the State Senate and the Assembly have done much in recent years to create a better environment for manufacturing. The effort to cut personal income taxes, changes in corporate taxes to encourage long-term investment and improvements in economic development programs are a few examples. Yet more must be done. The cost of doing business in New York is still too high. Despite tax reductions, New York remains at or near the top on national lists of high-tax states. And state policies on health benefits, unemployment insurance and workers' compensation drive those costs higher than in most other states.
Problems with solid-waste disposal, which have homeowners paying more for household trash pickup, are imposing tremendous cost burdens on manufacturers as well. The state must take decisive action to insure adequate capacity for getting rid of both solid and hazardous wastes.
Schools must do a better job of preparing students for higher education or the workplace. New York's industrial development resources should be increased and made more accessible locally. And product liability laws that needlessly inhibit development of new consumer products and services should be repealed.
Governor Cuomo recognized the importance of manufacturing in his 1989 State of the State Message, in which he called for a statewide conference on manufacturing, to be co-sponsored by the Business Council. That conference, set for next Feb. 13, will give manufacturers an opportunity to tell state leaders what policies are needed to promote manufacturing in New York.
New York is a good place to make a home and do business. But we can and must do better. Manufacturing matters to New York - more than ever before.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
Watershed for Europe

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
The impromptu dinner summit meeting of European Community leaders here last weekend can turn out to be a watershed: Western Europe at last pulling together to help Eastern Europe into the future. An extraordinary moment has arrived and it is about assuring the triumph of democracy. In principle at least, The Twelve accepted joint responsibility instead of waiting for somebody (the U.S., West Germany) to do something.
The Belgian Prime Minister, Wilfried Martens, said afterward, ''For the first time, we were sitting around the table discussing a political issue like a cabinet at European level.'' It can set the course for the rest of the century and beyond. 
When Secretary of State George C. Marshall made his Harvard speech in 1947 proposing U.S. aid for the reconstruction of Europe, there was no clear plan either, only words. But they were seized upon, hammered into specific projects, turned into actions that changed world history. And it is the fruits of that success that now bring the East to set a new direction.
In that sense, the Community is on the brink of a new Marshall Plan. That is fitting, for Europe should take the lead. The U.S. must be involved, of course. Now President Bush has something practical to offer President Gorbachev when they talk of the need for stability during the tremendous task of transforming Eastern Europe. It is to support and encourage the European initiative.
Horst Teltschik, Bonn's national security adviser, was in Washington last month urging the appointment of a small group of distinguished Americans to work with Europeans on a program. It was such a group that developed the Marshall Plan. But Washington wasn't ready to think ahead. The idea should be taken up, now. Even for short-term survival help to work effectively, it is urgent to devise a medium-term, concrete plan so that people can see the purpose of the sacrifices, or rather investments, that have to be made. The West has won the cold war, but as Jean Monnet said after World War II, now the question is how to win the peace.
Unfortunately, there is no Jean Monnet on the scene, but his ideas stressing institutions and coordination provide guiding principles. He insisted on turning words into deeds.
The first step should be for the Community, at its formal summit meeting in Strasbourg on Dec. 8 and 9, to ask the Brussels Commission to work out specific proposals for the Development Bank for Eastern Europe, stabilization funds, investment incentives and cooperation among prospective Eastern partners. They will need to consult all concerned, including the U.S. and the Soviets.
Max Kohnstamm, a Dutchman who worked closely with Monnet, points out that this has nothing to do with the Communist notion of command planning. ''For Monnet, a plan meant getting the right people around a table to look at details and work out the moves. No great enterprise can live without a view of where it's going.''
The Community should also set a date for negotiating decisions on economic and monetary union, to strengthen its cohesion and its capacity to deal with the changing East. The choice, as Mr. Kohnstamm put it, is a ''reinforced Community or German hegemony, and that wouldn't be good for the Germans, for Europe, for the world.''
Prime Minister Thatcher of Britain can't see that. She calls it ''undemocratic'' to pool national authority in this way. Probably the only person who could enlighten her on the importance of choosing the right turn at this critical crossroads is President Bush. He would be doing a service to America's as well as Europe's future.
Her stubborn opposition to further integration is provoking increasing impatience among her partners. They are beginning to say the only way to get Britain in, which the Common Market wanted from the start, is to go ahead without Britain. Then it will try to catch up. In any case, it is possible to organize the new structures needed for Europe without Britain, if it insists on lagging behind. It is not possible without Germany.
Mr. Kohl seems to be wavering, torn between the insights of his strategists and the technical reservations of his Finance Minister and the head of West Germany's Central Bank. He repeated in Paris that West Germany is determined to remain anchored in the Community and not let itself be tugged eastward. The stronger the Community, the better the anchorage.
The last words of Jean Monnet's autobiography are brilliantly topical. He wrote: ''The sovereign nations of the past can no longer solve the problems of the present; they cannot insure their own progress or control their own future. And the Community itself is only a stage on the way to the organized world of tomorrow.''

HEADLINE: Landlords Win Battle in Court Over Rent Rises

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Tenants in rent-stabilized buildings may be charged permanent rent increases if their landlords make major improvements, like new windows or heating systems, New York's highest court ruled today.
The State Court of Appeals, in a 6-to-0 decision, struck down a challenge from tenants who had argued that landlords should be allowed to raise rents only long enough to recoup the money they spent making the improvements.
The decision was seen by both tenant lawyers and landlord groups as a landmark because it put to rest the question of whether the cost of major improvements could be passed on to tenants as permanent rent increases. 
Since rent stabilization began in 1969, lower courts and state housing agencies had usually allowed improvement costs to be met through permanent rent increases. But the issue had not been fully addressed in law.
 
Nearly 900,000 Apartments
Today's ruling affects the nearly 900,000 rent-stabilized apartments statewide. Most are in New York City, though some are in Buffalo and Westchester County.
''There isn't much we can do,'' said David Ng, a lawyer for the tenants association that lost the case. ''I can understand the courts. Why should they change 20 years of what's happening?''
The case involved Ansonia Associates and its 500-unit building at 2109 Broadway, near 74th Street on Manhattan's West Side. In 1981, Ansonia Associates asked the state for a permanent 3.1 percent rent increase to pay for new storm windows that it had installed in all but eight apartments. The landlord said it needed that increase to get a sufficient return on its $339,000 investment.
The state Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which enforces New York's rent laws, granted a permanent 2.1 percent rent increase.
Tenants then sued, arguing that the rent increase should only be imposed for five years, until the owners regained the cost of the windows.
But the Court of Appeals said that the housing division's decision was in line with the state law. The court also said that landlords have more of an incentive to improve their buildings if they are able to reap a profit from those improvements.
John Gilbert, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a group run by landlords, said the decision would save thousands of New York City buildings from deterioriation.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Savings Unlikely to Be Spent Elsewhere

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
The reduction in military spending being contemplated by the Bush Administration will not provide much new money for domestic programs over the next several years, Government officials and economists say.
Many years from now, they say, the cuts could mean additional resources in areas like education, child care and environmental protection. But for the time being, in their view, nearly all the money saved at the Pentagon must be used to reduce the Federal deficit.
In the next fiscal year alone, they say, the problem in meeting the deficit level required by law is so daunting that the relatively modest cut planned for the military will be little help. The deficit is expected to be $110 billion this fiscal year, and the balanced-budget law mandates that it be no more than $64 billion in the next one. 
''Let's not sell it short,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, speaking of the Administration's long-term military plan. ''It's very substantial. But we shouldn't look at this as providing us with the wherewithal to meet all our problems.''
President Bush's budget director, Richard G. Darman, declined today to discuss the military cuts. But addressing the deficit for the fiscal year 1991, which begins next Oct. 1, he said the problem was ''every bit as big as anyone has ever suggested it might be.''
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has directed the military services to identify ways that the Pentagon budget can be cut by $180 billion below the expanded levels the Administration had originally planned for fiscal years 1992-94. That would mean an actual reduction averaging about 5 percent in each of those years after inflation is taken into account.
 
Closing the Budget Gap
The military budget for the fiscal year 1991 is now being put in final form, and officials expect Pentagon spending to be cut by less than $10 billion after accounting for inflation.
That is less than one-fourth of the more than $40 billion in budget reductions across the Government that must be made to cut the deficit to the ceiling set by the balanced-budget law for the next fiscal year. The gap can be closed only through deeper military cuts, which are thought unlikely, tax increases, reductions in domestic spending or a combination of those.
The law requires the deficit to be cut further in succeeding fiscal years until the books are balanced in the fiscal year 1993. After that, the Administration and lawmakers in both parties believe further spending cuts or tax increases will be necessary to offset money raised in Social Security taxes that is used to meet expenses outside the Social Security system.
Some scholars looking far down the road see an eventual shift from military to domestic spending as dramatic as the change after Ronald Reagan took office, when taxes and domestic spending were cut and military expenditures mushroomed.
''There could be a tremendous change in society, a change in what the Government supports and doesn't support,'' said Richard A. Stubbing, a professor of public policy at Duke University and an expert in the military budget.
 
No Fundamental Realignment
But most experts believe that prospect is barely on the horizon. ''We're not talking about a fundamental realignment of Government,'' said Charles L. Schultze, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Carter Administration. ''Most of the money must go for deficit reduction.''
In Congress, a few conservatives like Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, believe that lower spending by the military should lead to tax reductions. ''I don't think the benefits from winning the cold war should go to the Government,'' Mr. Gramm said.
Some liberals, mostly Democrats, would use the money to immediately expand social programs. ''It isn't communism that's threatening us,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan. ''It's our failure to deal with the problems of our cities.''
But the prevailing view is that the deficit overarches all other problems. ''We've got a fire-breathing monster staring at us,'' said Representative Les AuCoin, Democrat of Oregon. ''There's just not going to be much of a dividend here to be spent elsewhere.''
The economists and Government officials said the way the money was ultimately spent would depend in many respects on the political and economic climate. If international tensions continue to ease, they said, more military cuts might be in the offing. If there is a recession, more spending on unemployment insurance and other social programs might be needed.
In any event, the actual money that would become available in any particular fisal year from the Pentagon cuts is far from certain. In large part, it depends on what parts of the military budget are cut and when.
Military budgets are normally expressed in terms of the amount of money Congress allocates each year to the Pentagon. That ''budget authority'' is different from actual spending.
In some areas, like salaries and training, almost all the money is spent in the year that Congress makes it available. But in weapons procurement, for example, less than 15 percent of the money is typically spent in the year that Congress approves it, and the rest is spent over several years.
 
Parallel to After Vietnam War
By looking back about 20 years, when the Vietnam War was winding down, experts can track what happened the last time that military spending was sharply lowered. In constant dollars, the military budget was cut by 22 percent between 1968 and 1975.
Almost all that money was spent to expand social programs, especially Social Security payments and Medicare. The economy went into a recession, but almost no one blamed it on the military cuts.
Military contractors did not lose as much business then as might have been expected, because they were able to expand their sales abroad, particularly to Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries.

HEADLINE: President Seeks a Way to Adapt His Cool Persona to a Hot Medium

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
As George Bush's Presidential style comes to sharper focus on television screens, it is obvious that this chief executive is less interested in being another Great Communicator than in following the advice his mother used to give him: Don't brag; it's in bad taste.
After 10 months and one day in office, President Bush has shown an abiding aversion to grand public gestures, televised speeches, reflective ideological discourses and stage-managed media events intended to make him larger than life.
By this time in 1981, Ronald Reagan had given seven televised prime-time speeches. As President, he practiced his anecdotes for staff members in the Oval Office, coaxing tears from their eyes on one occasion as he read a story about a letter from a soldier's mother. 
Mr. Bush, who one associate said ''hates being compared to you-know-who,'' will deliver his second televised prime-time speech on Wednesday. He will rehearse with one or two people present to become accustomed to a Teleprompter, White House aides said.
 
'The Great Administrator'
''George Bush does not want to be the Great Communicator; he wants to be the Great Administrator,'' said S. Robert Lichter, an expert on the televised Presidency who is co-director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington.
''He is trying to deal with the public in the same way he deals with Congress: low-key without a lot of pretense,'' Mr. Lichter said. ''And he has that inbred sense that it is wrong to parade himself before the public.''
It is a reflection of Mr. Bush's position as Mr. Reagan's successor that this argument is being aired at all. Apart from Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was a master of the radio address, and the telegenic John F. Kennedy, modern American Presidents have not been masters of television, nor have they used it, as Mr. Reagan did, as a primary means of forcing policies into practice.
But some political strategists say Mr. Reagan changed the rules. They argue that Mr. Bush is still searching for his electronic Presidential voice and has suffered by appearing wooden or unfocused on camera.
Mr. Bush is not an adroit ad-libber. At times, he also seems to have trouble articulating his positions on tough issues like abortion, and he was widely criticized as not giving an enthusiastic enough response to the tumultuous events in Eastern Europe.
 
Blaming Speechwriters
Some critics of Mr. Bush's oratory blame his speechwriters, whose work can seem flat after the rousing convention and campaign speeches written last year by Peggy Noonan, who was a speechwriter for Mr. Reagan as well.
''With the proper guidance,'' said Myles Mertell, a former Republican political consultant who now specializes in corporate clients, ''George Bush may not be able to master TV as effectively as Ronald Reagan did, but he can certainly become far more effective than he currently is.''
But White House aides and other associates of the President say this is indeed the President's voice. They say it is as deep-rooted as that long-ago bit of maternal advice and is not likely to change.
Mr. Bush, they say, prefers small gatherings and is most effective in those settings. They note that he has high ratings in opinion polls despite a public image that gives him more of the exuberant gangliness of an Irish setter than the commanding, political terrier he is said to be in private.
Some critics say Mr. Bush's lack of television presence has left him open to charges of dull vision and has cost him a valuable forum for putting his programs into action. Again, he is often compared with Mr. Reagan, who seemed to have a knack for crystallizing national sentiment and expressing it on television.
But Robert Goodman, a leading Republican media consultant, argues that Mr. Bush is doing just that.
 
'People Want to Go Along'
''I don't think he has grand visions, but I don't think he's getting the message that the country is asking for a grand vision,'' Mr. Goodman said. ''This is a time when people want to go along, keep their kids safe, hope the school bus comes home on time, that inflation doesn't go up and we can make ends meet, and Bush does a nice thing with that mood.''
Clearly, Mr. Bush is not as commanding a television presence as Mr. Reagan was. Mr. Lichter, who calculates every minute devoted to Presidential coverage on the three broadcast networks, said there were 336 reports about Mr. Bush in his first 100 days in office, compared with 790 about Mr. Reagan and 906 about President Jimmy Carter.
But Mr. Lichter's analysis of Mr. Bush's television coverage in that period is revealing: 70 percent had a negative tone when it came to Mr. Bush's policies, while nearly as many, 61 percent, were positive when it came to the President as a person.
 
An Aversion to 'Handlers'
White House aides say Mr. Bush's approach to television speechmaking reflects an aversion to the ''handlers'' who exhort him to appear on television more often, to be more exuberant, to liven it up just a bit.
The speech, one official said, was conceived by the staff of the National Security Council ''as a way of showing U.S. and Presidential leadership on a historical happening - Eastern Europe - that has gripped the American people for weeks.''
Mr. Bush, the aide said, was no more widely enthusiastic about making this televised speech than he was about his previous prime-time address, a speech on his anti-drug policy in which he often appeared stiff and ill at ease.
''Bush hates to be cornered,'' said a longtime associate. ''Unless the stakes are high enough that he can suspend his aversion to television, one thing that has happened with him becoming President is that he now feels he can tell all the media handlers to shove off. He's the President, after all.''

HEADLINE: 5 Senators Struggle to Avoid Keating Inquiry Fallout

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Five Senators entangled in a fast-growing savings and loan investigation are struggling to devise a public relations and legal strategy to distance themselves from political fallout - and from each other.
The Senators - Alan Cranston of California, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, John Glenn of Ohio, Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, all Democrats, and John McCain, Republican of Arizona - are accused of intervening with banking regulators to protect a well-heeled campaign contributor, Charles H. Keating Jr. Political analysts and poll takers say that recent disclosures about the Keating Five, as they have been nicknamed on Capitol Hill, pose a political threat to the Senators, one that has grown particularly grave after last week's announcement of a formal investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee.
The Senators' efforts to deal with what even their closest supporters acknowledge is a political crisis are as different as the lawmakers themselves. 
 
All Seeking to Avoid Blame
Some are talking to the press; some refuse. A number have hired outside lawyers, while others see that as unnecessary, at least for now. All are trying to shift the blame to Federal regulators and to prominent figures in business.
Their strategies may have to be scrapped as more details emerge about their relationship with Mr. Keating, whose company, the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., collapsed earlier this year. The Lincoln bailout may cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion.
While the evidence of political damage from the Lincoln Savings debacle is still sketchy, statewide polls in Arizona have already shown a sharp drop in approval ratings for Senator DeConcini and Senator McCain.
In California, Michigan and Ohio, Republican organizers are not unhappy as Senators Cranston, Riegle and Glenn try to explain why they accepted such large campaign contributions from Mr. Keating and his associates.
 
Call From the Opposition
Last week, the Republican state chairman in Michigan, E. Spencer Abraham, called on Mr. Riegle to consider removing himself as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. ''The ongoing revelations and conflicting testimony erode his influence in the Senate,'' Mr. Abraham said.
The Republican chairman in Ohio, Robert T. Bennett, said even though the Keating investigation may not yet have ''sunk in'' among the state's voters, it eventually will.
In California, the poll taker Mervin Field believes Mr. Cranston is ''in deep trouble'' since recent Congressional testimony by elderly Californians who blamed the Senator for the loss of their life savings in Keating-related investments.
''The fact that real, live people will testify that they're impoverished by the failure of a savings and loan which Cranston is linked to, is devastating,'' Mr. Field said. Perhaps the most important tactical decision faced by the five Senators is how much to say in public about the Keating investigation, and when to say it. At one end of the spectrum, Senator McCain has decided upon what his aides describe as a campaign of full disclosure.
 
McCain Speaking Out
On Oct. 16, the Senator, whose reputation as a rising star in the Republican Party has been tarnished by the investigation, held a 90-minute news conference in Phoenix to answer questions about his efforts on behalf of Lincoln Savings.
''He's talked with all of the major newspapers, and he's spoken at some point with each of the television networks,'' said Scott Celley, a spokesman. ''The Senator is quite confident that the more people know about his role in this, the more comfortable they will be.''
For the other Senators, however, full disclosure carries the risk that, by responding to each new wave of allegations, they may provide news organizations and political opponents with a daily vehicle to keep the issue alive.
Senator Riegle has said relatively little about his relationship with Mr. Keating, refusing interview requests and ordering aides not to talk to reporters about the subject.
A Riegle aide who spoke to talk on condition he not be identified said the Senator thought it improper to discuss subjects under investigation by the ethics committee. And the Senator, the aide said, does not have time to address a barrage of reporters' questions. ''The No. 1 consideration is making sure the Senator can get his job done,'' the aide explained.
 
Riegle Begins to Respond
But the strategy has threatened to backfire on Senator Riegle, who has been forced in recent days to ignore the no-comment rule and respond to news reports that have documented closer ties between the Senator and Mr. Keating than had previously been known.
The Senators have also faced a delicate issue of whether to bring in outside lawyers to represent them in investigation now being conducted by the ethics committee and the Justice Department, which has convened a grand jury in Los Angeles to review criminal allegations against Mr. Keating.
Senate aides who asked not to be identified said that some of the five lawmakers had been reluctant to bring in private counsel, fearing that a decision to hire a private legal team could create the appearance of crisis.
Yet in recent weeks Mr. McCain, Mr. Glenn and Mr. Cranston decided to take the gamble and retained high-powered lawyers to deal with the Keating affair.
 
Glenn Hires Ex-U.S. Attorney
Senator Glenn has hired Charles F. C. Ruff, a former United States Attorney in Washington and Watergate prosecutor, to oversee Mr. Glenn's reply to a recent letter from the Senate ethics committee about his relationship with Mr. Keating. ''That's what he's there for - just to put together that response,'' Rebecca Bell, a Glenn spokeswoman, said of Mr. Ruff.
Even as Mr. Ruff maps out a legal strategy for the Senator, Ms. Bell and her counterparts elsewhere on Capitol Hill are conducting their own campaign in the trenches of public relations.
For Ms. Bell, formerly of NBC News, that has meant steering reporters to documentary evidence that tends to mitigate Senator Glenn's role in the Keating affair. The evidence is contained in notes of an April 1987 meeting at which Senator Glenn and his four colleagues discussed Lincoln Savings with a group of Federal regulators.
The notes, prepared by one of the regulators, show that Senator Glenn may have been far more cautious than the other Senators in defending Lincoln Savings, and that at one point he told the regulators: ''I'm not trying to get anyone off. If there's wrongdoing, I'm on your side.''
In the press offices of the four other senators, aides have been busy photocopying and distributing copies of a 1985 letter written on Mr. Keating's behalf by Alan Greenspan, an economist who is now the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Mr. Greenspan's letter described the management of Lincoln Savings as ''seasoned and expert'' with a ''record of outstanding success.''
In an interview, Bob Maynes, a spokesman for Senator DeConcini, said that Mr. Greenspan's assurances were ''significant in convincing Dennis'' that Lincoln deserved assistance. Within hours of his conversation with a reporter last Thursday, Mr. Maynes made sure that a copy of the Greenspan letter was in the reporter's hands. ''We're trying to get this information out,'' he said.

Lessons

BYLINE: By Edward B. Fiske

 BODY:
The New York City economy, which once boasted a prosperous manufacturing sector, has become almost entirely oriented around service industries.
In 1988, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the proportion of jobs held by people providing services, everyone from hairdressers to investment advisers, reached 87 percent. Big gainers include lawyers, accountants, data processors, registered nurses and teachers.
The shift raises an important question for public schools: Should they be turning out students with different skills than in the past? 
One person who believes they should is Audrey Cohen, a former social studies teacher who has developed what she calls ''a whole new way'' of educating people. ''Today's world has almost nothing in common with the world of 50 years ago,'' she said. ''It requires a different system of education.''
Ms. Cohen began thinking this way in the mid 1960's when she established a federally backed center in Manhattan to train poor women for paraprofessional jobs in the public schools, hospitals and legal aid agencies. She observed that these jobs and others then developing required fundamentally different skills from those needed for manufacturing.
''Manufacturing jobs tend to involve knowledge that can be learned and applied in rote fashion,'' she said. ''Jobs are specialized. People work in isolation from each other. They don't have to be creative or able to make decisions.''
By contrast, she said, many service jobs require teamwork and the ability to improvise. ''Most service jobs pose problems that have no set answers,'' she said. ''If you're asked to improve the morale of a hospital staff, you don't just follow orders.''
To Ms. Cohen, American schools reflect the old values. ''They cut knowledge into subjects that are unrelated not only to each other but to real life,'' she said. ''They teach information, but not the ability to use it. They foster competition and individual achievement, not cooperation and teamwork.''
In 1964 Ms. Cohen set out to build a school around her ideas, founding what became the College for Human Services to train disadvantaged women - and, four years later, men - for service jobs. It is now an accredited institution offering bachelor and master's degrees.
In 1983 the New York City Board of Education became interested in her approach. A College for Human Services Junior High School was established in East Harlem, and last year the idea was extended to six elementary and intermediate schools in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx and to an evening high school in Manhattan. Ms. Cohen is also working with a middle school in Pensacola, Fla. Since jobs in the service sector require working with people, often in teams, the programs emphasize learning in which students carry out assignments as groups.
One day recently, students in Gloria Carlson's sixth grade class at Public School 38 in Brooklyn were studying world hunger, and she asked them what they might be able to do about it. They then split into six groups to consider the problem and fill out questionnaires. Asked what was most surprising about the team approach, Jennifer Fortunato, one of the students, replied, ''We didn't fight the way we usually do.''
Instead of organizing classes around mathematics, social studies or other traditional subjects, the schools use categories like ''recognizing values'' and ''understanding self and others.'' Doing so while conforming to Board of Education curriculum guidelines is no small feat.
Teachers insist everything is covered, though recognizable lessons show up in the strangest places. A fire became the occasion for the junior high school students to learn statistics by analyzing and ranking likely causes for the blaze. They also combined art and mathematics by visiting landmark buildings, taking measurements and then building models to scale. And an examination of Caribbean paintings became the springboard for studying prisms and color.
''Successful schools revolve around kids' interests, and these schools show a real-world connection,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers.
The College for Human Services and the United Federation of Teachers plan to propose that Joseph A. Fernandez, who will become the New York City Schools Chancellor in January, expand the experiment to more New York City schools.
To Ms. Cohen, the overriding goal for her students is to ''let them know that knowledge has consequences for action.'' It is a goal that was not lost on one student in Ms. Carlson's class. As a recent visitor was leaving, the student presented him with a handmade flier that read ''Help us put a stop to hunger.''

HEADLINE: Potato Museum Seeks a New Home

BYLINE: By RUTH M. RICHMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
They may be lumpy, dirty and taken for granted, but potatoes have managed to provoke excitement among six states vying for a museum dedicated to their history and social relevance.
Meredith and E. Thomas Hughes, who run what they call the world's only potato museum from the basement of their Washington house, must relocate when their lease runs out next August.
Since news of their predicament was published a few months ago, the Hugheses have been contacted by interested municipalities, states and economic-development committees in Colorado, Idaho, Maine, North Dakota, Washington and Wisconsin, as well as the United States Agriculture Department. Why does the museum hold so much appeal? The Hugheses say their museum is unique in concept, as well as subject. ''There are endless museums devoted to wars, battlefields and weapons, but nothing about food,'' Mrs. Hughes told a recent visitor.' 
As for those seeking the museum, officials see it as a potential boost to the industry and community in which the museum plants its roots.
The Hugheses' two-room exhibit, which accommodates only one-fourth of their collection, includes hundreds of historical drawings and tools documenting potato production. An array of stuffed ''couch potatoes'' and a 4,000-year-old potato discovered in Chile are among the items that crowd the shelves and floors.
Begun as a classroom project when Mr. Hughes taught fifth grade in Belgium, the museum moved with the Hugheses to Washington in 1983. Since then, it has become an internationally known center for information about potatoes.
Open on an appointment-only basis, the museum attracted several hundred visitors last year, Mrs. Hughes said. The National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institution has selected the potato, along with maize, sugar, the horse and disease, for an exhibit on five items that have changed the American continents. Mr. Hughes is a guest curator of the exhibit, scheduled to open in October 1991, which will feature several items loaned from the potato museum.
Although the nonprofit, tax-exempt museum receives some financing from the International Potato Center in Lima, Peru, the Hugheses earn their money teaching and writing. They see their impending move as a chance to expand the museum into a food exposition they will be paid to run.
But the states who have contacted the Hugheses seem more interested in a museum solely about potatoes. The question of which state most deserves those riches has sparked some debate.
''We were producing potatoes when Idaho was still full of Indians and buffalo,'' said Bernard W. Shaw, Agricultural Commissioner of Maine, during a recent visit to the museum. ''We were the first in the land, and at one time the largest.''
Maine produced the most potatoes in the nation until the 1940's, when irrigation techniques allowed Western states to take the lead. Maine now ranks third behind Idaho and Washington. ''Maine potatoes are O.K. for boiling, but for baking they are waxy and don't taste good.'' said W. Rex Call, head of the potato exposition committee of the Blackfoot Economic Development Council in Idaho. ''With or without the Hugheses,'' he said, Blackfoot plans to build a ''tiny Disney World of potatoes.''
Representatives from Colorado, North Dakota, Washington and Wisconsin sound equally certain that their potato-growing histories and locations make their states ideal for a tuber museum.
The Hugheses, who call themselves ''potato neutral,'' said the location most accessible to tourists would be the best one. Two million tourists pass Blackfoot on their way to and from Yellowstone National Park, for example.
But Mr. Hughes worries that Maine, on the other hand, would put a museum in northern potato country, where ''even a lot of people from Maine have never been.''
That is why a recent call from a United States Department of Agriculture Research Center in Beltsville, Md., was of particular interest to the Hugheses. Situated near the District of Columbia, Beltsville ''could be used for a major museum,'' Mrs. Hughes said.
The Hugheses hope to find a site by March and will travel the country to find it. They remain open to all offers. ''We're all potato eaters,'' Mrs. Hughes said.
Meanwhile, the museum is still open to visitors. For an appointment, call 202-544-1558. Admission is free.

He Included Me
The Autobiography of Sarah Rice
Transcribed and edited by Louise Westling
181 pages. Illustrated. The University of
Georgia Press. $19.95.
In the oral history tradition of Theodore Rosengarten's ''All God's Dangers: The Life of Nate Shaw,'' which related the hardships of a black sharecropper in Alabama, Louise Westling's ''He Included Me: The Autobiography of Sarah Rice'' reconstructs the difficult but dignified life of a black woman in Alabama and Florida during a large part of the 20th century. It's a moving story that reveals a hidden corner of American life. 
Most one-day-a-week cleaning women, North or South, live private lives that are largely unknown to the families they work for. They leave their own children at home in the care of grandmothers or older siblings and do the laundry or prepare the meals for someone else's family. In recession or prosperity, this imbalance has existed in the social fabric of the country for a long time. The theme of black families struggling to break out of poverty demands not benign neglect but continuing disclosure and attention.
Fortunately, Sarah Rice and Louise Westling are well matched to meet the challenge. Mrs. Rice, who was born in rural Alabama in 1909 and now lives in Florida, served as a one-day-a-week house worker for Miss Westling's mother 30 years ago. They have kept in touch ever since. Miss Westling, author of books about Eudora Welty, Carson McCullers and Flannery O'Connor, is an associate professor of English at the University of Oregon. Mrs. Rice spoke into Miss Westling's tape recorder for months; together they edited the material for narrative clarity.
The first-person voice of Sarah Rice develops anecdotally, assuming the natural form in which memories are stored. She is a gifted storyteller who doesn't hold back the unpleasant details of her life and marriages. ''He Included Me'' reads like an older generation's version of Maya Angelou's ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' and ''Mary'' and ''Mary, Wayfarer,'' Mary Mebane's autobiographical sketches, though without their literary underpinning.
Sarah Rice's poverty was inherited; finding the next meal was frequently the goal of daily life in rural Alabama, for unemployed whites as well as blacks. Young Sarah's mother obtained work doing washing and ironing for strangers, and Sarah remembers developing a feeling of shame about herself and her mother:
''One day she told my brother Jim and me to stop by at a white lady's house to pick up a bundle of clothes. Jim and I thought of ourselves as the preacher's children, and we weren't going to walk through the streets carrying any clothes on our heads. We told Mama we were ashamed. I never will forget that; I can almost feel the pain now.''
Her mother lectured them: ''I'm going to tell you something. Your father doesn't make much money. You all need clothes, and you need things like other children. I thought if I did some washing that I could help supplement your Daddy's income so that you all could look like other children. It's no disgrace to work. It's an honor to make an honest dollar.''
Sarah and her brother wept. It was almost sundown, but they immediately ran down the hill to the white woman's house and ''strutted like those clothes were crowns on our heads.'' The lesson of retaining one's dignity despite poverty stuck with her when she grew up.
At the age of 17, Sarah began teaching in grade school. Some of the students were older than she. She lied to the school board about her age so she could get her first teaching assignment. In one of the outspoken remarks that appear throughout the book, she says: ''You were supposed to be 21. White people just kind of look at black folks and think they all look the same, so I could pass for 21 with them.''
She endured two unhappy marriages. Both of her husbands had wandering eyes and wanderlust. While she worked to support the family, they squandered her earnings. She left each of them in turn and returned to live with her mother, who was always supportive. Instead of continuing to teach, she became a domestic. Her spirits were sustained by studies at black colleges and by church and community work. The narrative occasionally becomes disjointed, between her changing jobs, husbands and boyfriends. But eventually she moves to Florida and is happily married to Andrew Rice, a devout companion until his death in 1983.
The religious tone of the title derives from a song, ''He Included Me,'' that her mother taught her about being grateful for life. Sarah Rice ends her story on a hopeful note:
''Just to think that from my grandfather not being able to read or write, or his wife either, and coming up from slavery, all this family grew. When the slaves were freed, they didn't have any direction or anybody to tell them what to do, so they were almost as bad off as during slavery. But now, here we were all together, all these branches of the family, including teachers and nurses and preachers and businessmen and musicians. Wouldn't Mama and Papa have been proud?''

Report on South Africa
Last spring, Lisa Drew, a senior editor at William Morrow & Company, and Robert Wedgeworth, the dean of the School of Library Service at Columbia University, spent 10 days in South Africa, asking writers, librarians and educators on both sides of the issue of apartheid how they felt about including books and educational materials in the cultural boycott against South Africa. The two were there under the auspices of the International Freedom to Publish Committee of the Association of American Publishers and of the Fund for Free Expression, a group of authors, journalists, lawyers, publishers and others.
Dean Wedgeworth reported back to the two organizations that by embargoing the sale and shipment of books to South Africa, Americans are unwittingly abetting the South African Government in its ''systematic starvation of young black minds.'' Last week the sponsors released the report of that mission: ''The Starvation of Young Black Minds: The Effect of Book Boycotts in South Africa.'' 
In it Dean Wedgeworth and Ms. Drew wrote that each of the more than 75 people with whom they spoke - including those who support economic sanctions and the general cultural boycott as it affects athletic contests, rock concerts and so forth - opposed the book boycott. They said that the African National Congress also opposes a boycott of books and other cultural products that ''enhance the struggle for democracy and promote democratic human values.''
The two recommended that the Association of American Publishers request the American Library Association, the African Studies Association and other interested educational and cultural organizations to support their call for the removal of books from the cultural boycott.
 
2 No. 1's for Guild
Both December main selections of the Literary Guild will be No. 1's on the New York Times best-seller lists this Sunday: ''Daddy'' (Delacorte) by Danielle Steel will head the hard-cover fiction list, while ''My Turn'' (Random House) by Nancy Reagan with William Novak will head the nonfiction list.
Robert P. Riger, the president of the Doubleday Book and Music Clubs Inc., which owns the Literary Guild, said the two best sellers represented the guild's first attempt to pair a fiction and a nonfiction title. ''In the past, our main selections have been almost entirely fiction,'' he said. Now, he said, he wants that mix to include about one-third nonfiction, because nonfiction books have always done well when offered as alternate selections, and it is increasingly hard to pick 32 compelling fiction titles a year. (The guild offers dual main selections 16 times a year.) But the change in emphasis is no doubt also prompted by what publishing executives say is a shortage of ''big books,'' especially ''big'' novels. Thus in competing for popular novels to offer members, the guild and its principal rival, the Book-of-the-Month Club, often find themelves locked in costly combat over a relatively small number of titles. By offering more nonfiction, the guild can offer a broader choice while lessening the financial pressures of having to win battles for the most popular fiction or settle for what's available.
 
3 No. 1's for Janklow
Morton Janklow, the literary agent, is also happy about next Sunday's best-seller lists. He represents both Ms. Steel and Mrs. Reagan, and he also represents Sidney Sheldon, whose ''The Sands of Time'' (Warner Books) will be the No. 1 paperback fiction title. ''I think this is the first time any agent has ever had three No. 1's on the list at the same time,'' Mr. Janklow said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Could Avert Recession

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
American consumers are laden with debt, but instead of staggering under the burden, they have plenty of borrowing power in reserve -enough, some economists suggest, to help ward off a recession.
This flies in the face of the common expectation that when consumers get deeply in debt they have to cut back on borrowing, weakening the economy in the process. No such cutback has happened yet, and now economists are revising their expectations. In fact, two new studies suggest that the consumer could, in theory, help prop up the economy. 
To be sure, Government data show the economy is weakening. Consumers have cut back on spending recently, not because they lacked the borrowing power to buy on credit, but because of ''apprehension'' about the economy's future, according to surveys of consumer sentiment.
''People see sluggish economic growth on the horizon and they are being more cautious about their spending,'' said Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's consumer surveys.
The new studies on borrowing power focus on the upheaval that in recent years has changed the structure of personal debt. The total debt held by individuals and households is $3.4 trillion today, higher than ever. But the repayment period has been so stretched out that a borrower's monthly installments barely rise with each new loan and use up a relatively small percentage of disposable income. What is more, Federal Reserve Board data show that most of the new consumer installment loans in the 1980's have gone to the nation's wealthiest households, and they have the income to handle repayment.
 
'The Consumer Is in Good Shape'
''The relentless story you keep hearing is that the consumer is tapped out; he can't borrow more and he is about to retrench,'' said James A. Wilcox, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, and the author of one of the new studies. ''But the debt service numbers tell a different story. They are remarkably stable, and they say the consumer is in good shape as a borrower.''
Many factors have led to the debt-stretching, which means, in effect, that a $240 loan over 10 years requires the same $2 a month to repay as a $120 loan over five years.
Car loans, for example, now average 4.5 years, up from three years in the early 1980's. Many fixed-rate mortgages are for 30 years today instead of the 25 years common a decade ago. And mortgages taken out at interest rates above 15 percent have been refinanced with rates at 13 percent or less. The lower rates reduce monthly payments.
Home equity loans, nonexistent until the mid-1980's, have become a major tool for stretching out debt. These loans, with payments stretched over 10 to 15 years, are often used to pay off loans with much shorter maturities, like credit card debt and revolving bank credit, which require repayment in monthly installments over only three years. Another reason for their growing use is that the interest paid on them is still fully deductible from taxable income.
Home equity loans are now held by about 5.5 percent of all homeowners, up from nearly zero in the early 1980's. The loans average $13,000, with most maturing in 10 to 15 years, according to the American Financial Association, a trade group.
 
Credit Cards Stretch Debt
Even credit cards have been used to stretch debt. Instead of presenting department store charge cards, which usually require repayment in one year, shoppers now often use a Visa or Mastercard, for which a three-year payoff is allowed.
''The result is that the ratio of payments to income has even declined since 1985,'' said Edward F. McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. Debt repayment consumed 17.9 percent of Americans' disposable income in 1985 - the decade's high - and has declined since to about 16.7 percent now, he said.
But a major reason consumers can take on still more debt with equanimity is that 45 percent of the more than $750 billion in outstanding consumer credit is in the hands of the wealthiest 20 percent of the nation's households, said Thomas A. Durkin, a Federal Reserve Board economist, in a recent analysis. That is up from 21.7 percent in 1970 and 36.5 percent in 1977.
 
Poorest's Borrowing Unchanged
In contrast, the poorest households, at the bottom 40 percent of income, account for 19 percent of borrowing, unchanged since the early 1970's.
''My guess is that the same trend holds true not only for consumer credit, but for total household debt, although the Federal Reserve has not run the numbers on this,'' Mr. Durkin said. The total debt of $3.4 trillion held by Americans includes mortgages, home equity loans, brokerage house loans, mobile home loans and the various forms of consumer credit.
Why are the wealthy such big borrowers? During the high inflation of the late 1970's, wealthy households realized the advantages of repaying debt in dollars whose value was being eroded by inflation, Mr. Durkin said. And interest payments were fully deductible then. In addition, as the American economy expanded in the 1980's, the wealthy stepped up purchases of appliances, computers, cars and other expensive durable goods normally bought on credit, he said.
At the same time, the wealthiest households are also the nation's biggest savers, and with deregulation of bank interest rates, the earnings on their savings deposits have risen. ''Since you can get a good return on savings today, the wealthy borrow temporarily rather than draw down their savings,'' said William Dunkelberg, a Temple University economist.
Using Federal Reserve data, Mr. McKelvey calculates that total household debt is roughly equal to 90.4 percent of people's annual disposable income, down just a bit from the record of 91.1 percent in last year's fourth quarter. But while the total debt-to-income ratio has risen from 88.4 percent in 1986, installment payments as a percentage of income have fallen in the same period, to the 16.7 percent today, Mr. McKelvey said. That is only half the repayment level that lenders say households could handle without getting in over their heads.
 
'Not Being Pinched'
''People are certainly not being pinched,'' Mr. McKelvey said.
But even if Americans can afford more debt, they might retrench anyway - for psychological reasons, said Mr. Curtin, Michigan's director of consumer surveys. Among their concerns, he said, is fear that a weakening economy might push up unemployment and endanger their income.
Indeed, consumers have pulled back on spending, a trend that showed up last week in the Commerce Department's retail sales report for October. Consequently, consumer credit is growing more slowly now than in the spring and summer, although this slowdown in growth has been largely offset by a rise in home equity lending.
Michigan's monthly surveys also show that rising interest rates earlier this year discouraged consumers, since such increases frequently precede an economic slowdown, Mr. Curtin said, adding that interest rates are now falling again, but that consumers remain skeptical. ''They see the country just muddling along,'' he said, ''and that can slow their spending and their borrowing even if they have the wherewithal to take out new loans.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Up By 0.5%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Sizable increases in the cost of housing and transportation propelled the Consumer Price Index up five-tenths of 1 percent in October from September, the biggest rise since May, the Labor Department reported today.
Even though the seasonally adjusted acceleration was a bit faster than expected and affected a broad spectrum of goods and services, most economists seemed to believe that inflation would be kept from reaching worrisome levels by the current deceleration of the economy.
A minority, however, took today's report as further evidence that the inflation rate will soon exceed 5 percent over a sustained period and said that the Federal Reserve would need to perform a nearly impossible balancing act - curbing price pressures while heading off recession.
Before rounding, the October increase was 0.4811548 of a percent, a figure that if maintained and compounded for 12 months, would produce an annual inflation rate of 5.9 percent. The Consumer Price Index posted an inflation rate of 4.6 percent over the first 10 months of the year, slightly more than the 4.4 percent rates recorded for both 1988 and 1987. 
 
Higher Than Producer Index
Today's report of inflation at the consumer level was slightly higher than the four-tenths of 1 percent increase reported 12 days ago for prices received in October by producers of finished goods. In addition, the producer price indexes for goods at the intermediate and crude stages of production reported at that time showed no inflation at all. Generally, changes in prices at the producer level affect consumers after various lags ranging up to six months.
A seemingly typical reaction to today's figures was that of Gordon Richards, an economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. He said various temporary or erratic factors, such as the end of discount-financing programs used to encourage automobile sales, exaggerated the true degree of inflation in October.
Nevertheless, he added: ''Even if the increase is overstated, these figures are not likely to provide much assurance to financial markets. There is little likelihood that interest rates will decline until there is stronger evidence of a slowdown in inflation.''
Inflation accelerated in five of the seven main Consumer Price Index categories last month, while slowing somewhat from previously rapid increases in the remaining two categories.
When the volatile food and energy items are removed, the remaining categories, the so-called core rate of inflation, rose at a five-tenths of 1 percent rate in October - also the highest since May - up from two-tenths of 1 percent in September.
One Labor Department specialist said he expected the Consumer Price Index to post average monthly increases of four-tenths of 1 percent in the current quarter, a result better than when food and energy drove the annual rate to 6.7 percent in the first five months of the year, but worse than during the summer, when energy and apparel prices tumbled and the rate was 1.6 percent.
In all, the official said, ''nothing stands out on the horizon'' to cause alarm.
 
Moderating Forces Called Weak
But Joel Popkin, a Washington consultant and former Labor Department inflation expert, has been pessimistic about prices for some time and said today's figures did nothing to reassure him. He contended that the forces that had been holding down inflation - the drop in oil prices, moderation in food, a strong dollar and even poor car demand - are now played out and that the inflation rate was headed to 5 percent or higher.
When asked about continued poor auto sales, Mr. Popkin said Detroit was responding to this so far with production cuts rather than a new round of price incentives.
Grocery store prices advanced five-tenths of 1 percent in October, the biggest increase since May, as the price of fruits and vegetables rose 1.2 percent after falling nearly that much in September. Apples and bananas rose sharply, and dairy products jumped by 1.8 percent, the biggest increase in more than nine years.
The housing component, accounting for 42 percent of the Consumer Price Index, climbed four-tenths of 1 percent in October as rental costs, which include hotels, rose six-tenths of 1 percent. Telephone service, however, fell eight-tenths of 1 percent.
In transportation, which declined in each of the preceding months, the overall increase of seven-tenths of 1 percent in October largely reflected a statistical adjustment to include a nine-tenths of 1 percent jump in the price of gasoline. Actually, the price of gasoline - often said to be the nation's most visible single price - was unchanged at the pump from the month before. The rise reflected in the report was to take into account the amount of the usual seasonal price decline in gasoline for October.
 
Higher Prices for Cars
The price of new cars rose six-tenths of 1 percent after five straight monthly declines. The higher prices of 1990 models, which accounted for about one-quarter of the survey, were included for the first time this year. Automobile finance charges rose 1.3 percent after four straight declines, while the price of used cars continued to fall.
Apparel rose sharply for the second straight month, following the introduction of new autumn lines, but analysts predicted clothing prices would ease in coming months.
In medical care, the seven-tenths of 1 percent October advance was slightly less than in September, but the medical inflation rate is still 8.8 percent over the last three months, and 8.1 percent over the last year.
Today's report also showed that the cost of commodities climbed six-tenths of 1 percent last month after falling slightly on average in August and September. The price of services climbed five-tenths of 1 percent, or as much as in August and September combined.
The Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers, which are 80 percent of the population, now stands at 125.6. This means that a hypothetical basket of goods and services that cost $10 in 1982-84 now costs $12.56.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Mark Shows Its Strength; Dollar Drops

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar dropped sharply against the West German mark yesterday, closing at its lowest level since early January. The dollar also fell against other leading currencies, including the Japanese yen.
Traders said the market action was a reflection of the strength of the mark and the West German economy more than a sign of weakness in the dollar. The mark also rose strongly against the yen, reaching its highest level since the end of 1987, and against the British pound, closing at its highest point in more than two and a half years. 
''This dollar weakness is better labeled Deutsche mark strength,'' said John Lipsky, director of international bond trading at Salomon Brothers in London.
In late trading, the dollar was at 1.8140 marks, down from 1.8337 on Monday. This is the lowest the dollar has been since Jan. 5, when it closed at 1.8003. The dollar's recent tumble against the mark, which began in earnest after the stock market fell 190 points on Oct. 13, has countered most of the gains the dollar had made against the mark this year.
At its 1989 high, when it was over 2 marks, the dollar was up more than 15 percent. But its gain is now just 2.5 percent for the year. In addition, the dollar is now well below the ceiling of 1.90 marks that the United States and its Group of Seven economic allies are believed to have set as an acceptable level.
 
Strong Against the Yen
The dollar still remains strong against the yen. At 143.55 yesterday, the dollar is still above the 140 level, which is believed to be the Group of Seven's ceiling against the Japanese currency. And the dollar's gain for the year still exceeds 14 percent.
One reason for the difference is that the Germans have aggressively raised interest rates and bluntly spoken of their desire for a strong mark, even if it meant a realignment of the European Monetary System.
The Japanese, with much less domestic pressure for higher interest rates, have not moved quickly to raise rates, and the yen has therefore remained weaker against the dollar. This has meant that the interest rate differential between the dollar and the yen is wider and more attractive to investors and speculators than the narrowing spread between the dollar and the mark.
With a wide differential, investors are more likely to buy securities denominated in the currency with the higher rates. As the differential narrows, investors tend to pull money back, which is what has pushed the dollar lower against the mark.
 
'Moving Into Other Assets'
''Interest rates are coming off on the short end,'' said Peter Frick, a foreign exchange economist at the Union Bank of Switzerland. ''People are moving into other assets. Until Christmas that will be the prevailing factor.''
Mr. Lipsky of Salomon Brothers said he could not point to a particular event that set off the dollar's decline yesterday. But most of it happened during European trading, before the markets opened in New York.
Factors that have hurt the dollar have been in play for weeks in the United States, he said, including the slowing of the United States economy and the expectation that the Federal Reserve will move again to ease interest rates to prevent the economy from sliding into a recession.
He added that some of the worries about West Germany's economy that had resulted from the opening of East German borders had subsided. With West Germany's economy growing strongly, demand for the mark has increased, reflecting expecations that the West German central bank, the Bundesbank, will have to raise interest rates again.

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
The Emerson Radio Corporation is engaged in a seemingly minor legal squabble in a Brooklyn Federal court that has shed light on a little-known insider-trading suit against the New Jersey company's top management that could have a serious impact on the once high-flying consumer electronics marketer. What has emerged is a story with famous names, allegations of managerial deceit and disgruntled shareholders.
The documents in the two-year-old insider-trading case have become public as a result of a conflict-of-interest dispute. In a court order signed two days ago, United States District Judge Jack B. Weinstein instructed Emerson Radio's outside directors, former Vice President Walter F. Mondale and a former Federal Reserve governor, Lyle Gramley, to determine whether it is a conflict of interest for Emerson to be defended in the insider-trading case by law partners of a Manhattan attorney, Jay M. Haft, who is also an Emerson director. 
Mr. Mondale, Mr. Gramley and Mr. Haft are not named in the insider-trading suit, but Mr. Mondale and Mr. Haft were on the Emerson board during the months when the plaintiffs say illicit stock trading occurred.
The case that has touched off this recent dispute was filed in December 1987 by four investors who had bought Emerson stock in March and April of that year. In the class action, the plaintiffs accuse Emerson Radio (which is not related to Emerson Electric) and seven top executives of conspiring in late 1986 and early 1987 to mislead the public about Emerson's prospects while they sold more than 775,000 shares of the company's stock. Emerson Radio and its senior managers have denied the allegations of insider trading.
The shareholders contend that Emerson's top managers knew at least by mid-December 1986 that incoming orders were shrinking and sales of video cassette recorders, a key product for Emerson, were softening. According to the complaint, the officers warned various friends and relatives of the impending problems but conspired to hide the news from the general public by continuing to make optimistic forecasts to shareholders and Wall Street analysts until late May 1987.
The delay, the plaintiffs contend, was aimed at keeping Emerson's stock price strong until the company could close on a pending loan, and until senior corporate executives were free to sell their own shares at a profit. The executives had exercised stock options in July 1986 and, under Federal securities law, could not reap a profit on stock sales for six months.
Trading records submitted along with the class-action complaint by the plaintiffs, represented by the law firm Coleman & Rhine in New York, show that seven of Emerson's top officers, 13 of their employees, and various neighbors, friends and relatives sold 1.3 million shares of the company's stock between December 1986 and April 1987, before the company announced the sales downturn.
According to the company's lawyers, the executives' sales were made chiefly for tax reasons, or were consistent with the executive's trading patterns in prior years. Further, the management defendants deny that they were aware that the company had undergone any ''material adverse change,'' as the securities code defines it, until after the disputed sales were made.
According to the company's lawyers, the slump in consumer electronics sales did not become apparent until six weeks or so before the company's fiscal year ended on March 30, 1987. The problems were reported to shareholders, along with the company's sizable gain in annual profits, on May 20, 1987.
Whatever the outcome of this most recent squabble, the pending shareholder lawsuit seems likely to be an increasingly expensive and embarrassing one for Emerson Radio.
For one thing, aside from the distraction the case may pose to management and any damages that might be owed if the company loses the case, Emerson is paying the legal fees for itself and 20 of the individual defendants - the officers, the employees and the company chairman's mother.
And the company's defense, that it did not become aware that sales were slumping until near the end of the 1987 fiscal year, is not particularly flattering to management, especially in light of internal sales documents recently made public because of the case.
As the company routinely tells shareholders in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, ''The ability of management to correctly anticipate and provide for inventory requirements is essential to the successful operation of the company's business.'' But the sales data filed with the court show that Emerson's net new orders began to fall behind the prior year's level as early as September 1986 and continued to shrink through mid-December, traditionally the company's strongest sales period.
When the company reported its results for the three months ended Dec. 31, 1986, its sales had climbed 32 percent from the corresponding period a year earlier. But an examination of those records, which were filed with the S.E.C. in early February 1987, shows that Emerson's inventory of unsold goods was 113 percent higher than a year earlier - typically a sign of trouble for any manufacturer since it indicates that retailers are not selling as much of the company's products as had been anticipated.
And tucked among the court papers filed in the Emerson case is a Sept. 16, 1986, memorandum by Marino Andriani, senior vice president for sales at Emerson, who warned the company's sales force of serious problems in the VCR market, an important line of business for the company.
The company's lawyers argue that order flow is not as crucial as the plaintiffs contend since orders are subject to change. But portions of a deposition filed with the court quotes Harold Falik, Emerson's chief financial officer, as citing a two-month decline in orders as the red flag that first alerted him to possible problems more than six months after the Andriani memo.
In any case, when the company released its fourth-quarter results in May 1987, with the warning of weaker sales ahead, its stock softened. When the first quarter of the company's 1988 fiscal year ended on June 30, 1987, the company reported a $5.8 million loss, and its stock tumbled even further.
''I'm not close enough to the subject to talk about it,'' said Mr. Gramley, the chief economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington, D.C. Mr. Mondale, now a lawyer in Minneapolis, did not respond to telephone requests to his secretary for comment.
The plaintiffs' charges are ''total nonsense,'' said Stephen L. Lane, president and chief executive of Emerson. ''It's unfounded and it will be proven so, hopefully,'' he added. ''It's not going to affect the company.''
Recently, Emerson Radio's stock price has gradually recovered, with a few analysts once again predicting a sharp climb in the company's future sales revenues as Emerson forges into the personal computer market. Those analysts' reports, however, do not mention the implications of the shareholders' lawsuit that is inching contentiously toward a trial.

Sony Wishes Upon a Star

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
ARE the services of Peter Guber and Jon Peters, co-chairmen of Columbia Pictures, the Sony Corporation's latest venture into the entertainment business, really worth a half-billion dollars?
Americans have grown accustomed to cleanup hitters who bag $50,000 per home run. And they have learned to take in stride the occasional corporate chief executive who pockets $50 million as an incentive to early retirement. But some may have a hard time swallowing the idea that the new heads of Columbia Pictures are 50 times better at their jobs than a run-of-the-mill tinseltown deal maker who could be had for $10 million. It is just possible that Hollywood has gotten the better of the good folks who brought you the Betamax and the Walkman. 
First, a brief recap of the big news for those who have been unaccountably distracted by events in San Francisco or Eastern Europe. In September, with the ink barely dry on its $2 billion contract to buy CBS Records, Sony agreed to pay a shade less than $5 billion for the least successful of Hollywood's major studios.
Now as everyone who has ever seen a Bette Davis movie knows, a film studio is only as good as the mogul who tyrannizes it. That is apparently why Sony was so eager to bring on board Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters, the executive producers of ''Batman'' and ''Rainman'' and the hottest movie-making team around. Sony bought their production company for $200 million, or about $60 million more than its market value. The Guber and Peters share of the proceeds: $55 million.
But the $55 million was only an appetizer. The new co-chairmen, along with three other executives as yet unnamed, will each receive a $2.75 million annual salary for five years, plus annual cost-of-living adjustments, plus a share of studio profits, plus slices of a one-time $50 million bonus, plus 8.08 percent of any appreciation in Columbia's assessed value. If, for example, Columbia earned $300 million in 1994, and the studio appreciated by $1 billion - hardly an ambitious return on Sony's $5 billion investment - the five executives would be entitled to $156 million.
What Sony apparently never anticipated, however, is that in order to win Mr. Peters and Mr. Guber it would also be forced to come to terms with Steven J. Ross, the head of Warner Communications and the one mogul who can make the diamond-dust twins look like monks in penitent garb.
Mr. Ross, a former Manhattan funeral director, recently pulled off the slick trick of convincing Time Inc.'s directors to reject an acquisition offer from Paramount worth billions to Time stockholders in order to go through with a deal to buy Warner. And, fresh from the triumph in which he personally netted $125 million, Mr. Ross was apparently in no mood to allow the Guber-Peters team to walk away from their commitment to make movies for his studio.
Last week Warner settled its suit with Sony for a half-interest in CBS's mail-order record and tape business, plus cable distribution rights to Columbia's television productions, plus the better part of a Los Angeles real estate swap. The estimated value of the package is between $400 million and $600 million.
Mr. Guber's and Mr. Peters' big winners in recent years will gross $2.5 billion. And while only a small fraction of those grosses will ever hit the studio's bottom line, Wall Street analysts say, it would not take many hits on the scale of ''Batman'' to reward Sony's extraordinary faith in the home team.
But there is obviously an element of luck in making movies, no matter who is putting the deals together. Before ''Rainman'' and ''Batman,'' Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters were responsible for such costly flops as ''Caddyshack II,'' ''VisionQuest'' and ''Clue.'' And as with stock-picking, the real genius in the movie business is to get the people who put up the money to remember the winners and forget the losers.
It is possible that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters have done little more than bet on the right horse the last few times out. It is also possible that they correctly intuited what people wanted to see on the silver screen - but that the muse of popular taste will desert them as mysteriously as it came.
Perhaps Sony believes that Mr. Peters and Mr. Guber really do know something worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Perhaps Sony is so flush with cash, and so proud of its new stake in the great American dream machine, that a billion more or less does not seem important. Or perhaps Sony is simply adopting the mores of American corporate culture - a culture in which the care, feeding and amusement of senior management matters as much as the return to the stockholders.

HEADLINE: Fight on Workers' Compensation in Texas

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Nov. 21

 BODY:
The Texas statehouse in Austin has seen many boisterous confrontations, but few can match the bitter standoff over measures to overhaul the state's system of compensating workers for their injuries.
Disputes over workers' compensation programs have become increasingly rancorous in recent years as insurers in a number of states have endured rising underwriting losses. But in no state has the issue become as charged as it is in Texas, where insurers over the last five years have paid out $1.41 in claims and expenses for every dollar of premiums paid by employers, compared with $1.22 for every premium dollar nationally.
Insurers in Texas expect to lose more than $1 billion this year, after $4.4 billion in underwriting losses in workers' compensation coverage since 1983. And employers in Texas will pay almost $4 billion in premiums for injured-worker insurance next year, compared with $1 billion in 1983. 
 
Limiting Medical Costs
But many Texas lawmakers, backed by insurers and employers, are trying to limit medical costs and the right to a jury trial. The proposals include restricting workers to two medical opinions on their ailments and a single set of medical tests to diagnose their condition. Current law permits unlimited opinions and tests. Also, costs for differing medical procedures would be limited to standards set by the American Medical Association. No cost limits now exist under Texas workers' compensation rules. The pro-business groups also want to raise benefits for severely disabled workers.
Opposing them are plaintiff lawyers and representatives of labor unions. They succeeded in blocking the proposed changes in two legislative sessions earlier this year. A third session, devoted solely to the workers' compensation fight, has been under way for a week, and top state officials have vowed to keep the session going until changes are made.
In the more than 75 years since all but a few states began requiring employers to carry workers' compensation insurance, most property and casualty insurers have usually found the business profitable.
But soaring medical costs, an expansion of the treatments covered under workers' compensation, legal haggling in claims disputes in some states and rising workers' compensation claims in areas where layoffs have been concentrated have been pushing costs sharply higher for employers and increasing losses among insurers.
The A. M. Best Company said insurers lost more than $3 billion on $29 billion in premium payments from employers last year, even after counting investment profits from cash reserves. Losses are expected to be even higher this year.
Primary insurers have reported deepening losses and requested large rate increases in Maine, Rhode Island, Florida and Louisiana as well as Texas. Requests for rate increases of 20 percent or more are being reviewed in Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas and Massachusetts.
In Texas over all, the average claim cost nearly doubled last year, to $13,300 from $6,800 in 1984, according to the National Council on Compensation Insurance. Nationally, the average cost per claim is expected to reach $10,000 in 1990, compared with $6,000 in 1980, the council said.
The General Motors Corporation said its premiums in Texas, where it has a large car assembly plant in Arlington, averaged $1,829 for each employee last year, compared with an average of $577 at 18 of its other American plants.
Texas employers pay the fifth-highest premium rates in the nation for the insurance, but the benefits received by severely injured workers rank in the bottom third of all states, according to the Workers' Compensation Research Institute, an industry-financed research concern in Cambridge, Mass.
But less severely disabled workers, those who can go back to work fairly quickly, receive comparatively high settlements, or 100 percent of their lost pay. ''We overcompensate minor injuries at the expense of serious injuries,'' said Joseph C. Gagen, the chairman of the state's Industrial Accident Board, which governs the system.
Texas is also where injured workers have freest access to a jury trial. In most states, injured workers can seek an appellate-court review, and only on the facts of how a state-appointed mediator reached a settlement. In Texas, the jury is not allowed to hear facts from a mediator's prior ruling on a settlement dispute, including the result of the ruling.
Lawyers represent injured workers in half of all contested cases in Texas, compared with an average of 8 percent in other states. Also, the lawyers' payment is set at 25 percent of a plaintiff's final settlement, compared with 15 percent in many states.
 
Manipulation of Courts
Insurers say lawyers for plaintiffs manipulate the court system by scheduling cases before juries more likely to make high awards, increasing the cost of the claim.
''The average cost of what should be a $280 claim has become a $1,200 claim and it is eating us up,'' said Keith Lake, an executive vice president at Kemper Financial Group, a major insurer in Chicago. ''In Texas, everybody gets a lawyer and everything gets appealed.''
But plaintiff lawyers and labor leaders have protested the proposals for change, saying benefits to injured workers should rise, not fall. They assert that many employers, particularly in the oil and petrochemical industries, have been lax in safety efforts.
They also say insurers abuse jury trials by using their financial resources to outlast plaintiffs and force them into inadequate settlements.
The collapse of the oil, real estate and financial sectors of the Texas economy has magnified the state's problems with injured-worker claims. High unemployment in 1986 and 1987 pushed workers' compensation claims higher. Many workers filed injury claims after their unemployment insurance ran out, a practice that is often fraudulent, insurance and business consultants say.
Many insurers in Texas have retrenched.

HEADLINE: American Savings Delays Voting on a Shift in Charter

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Facing strong opposition from shareholders, the management of the American Savings Bank yesterday delayed until Dec. 20 a special meeting of stockholders to vote on converting the bank from a Federal to a state charter.
The proposal also included provisions that, according to the proxy of the White Plains-based bank, could make removing management more difficult and could discourage takeover bids.
''This was a vote of no confidence in management,'' said Gerald Chase, a private investor and shareholder of American Savings who favors a management change and possible sale of the bank. ''The management proposal would have been turned down overwhelmingly, by 80 to 20.'' 
The bank's stock fell by 75 cents a share yesterday, to $9.125, on the New York Stock Exchange, well below its high of $18.625 late last year.
 
Assets Total $4.5 Billion
American Savings, with $4.5 billion in assets, has 39 branch offices in New York City and nearby counties. The bank had a $10.3 million loss in the third quarter. Much of the loss was from leveraged buyouts, including a $14.7 million loan to the Seaman Furniture Company in Uniondale, L.I.
Henry Salzhauer, who controls 9.2 percent of American Savings and opposed the management proposal, said converting to a state charter ''probably makes economic sense.''
But he added that other parts of the proposal ''make it more difficult for stockholders to be recognized by the company'' and would ''promote a lock-in of current management.''
Earlier this year, Mr. Salzhauer led an unsuccessful attempt to place three directors on American Savings' board and to appoint a committee to study the possible sale of the bank.
 
Cumulative Voting
Under a state charter, the bank would have been able to prohibit cumulative voting by shareholders in director elections, a feature that many of the holders dislike. Cumulative voting, which is required under a Federal charter, unless special dispensation is granted by regulators, is favored by dissident shareholders because it is easier for them to concentrate their votes and elect directors not nominated by management.
American Savings said in a statement that it might revise its proposal before the December meeting.
Robert J. Hughes, the executive vice president, declined to comment on how the bank might revise its proposal.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 7.25, to 2,639.29; Volume Up a Bit

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
With many investors on the sidelines in advance of the Thanksgiving Day holiday, blue-chip stocks made modest gains yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 7.25 points, to 2,639.29.
However, the broader market drifted downward, with 860 declines on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbering the 622 gains.
Although the Government reported that the Consumer Price Index rose five-tenths of 1 percent in October, which was higher than expected, the news had little impact on equities. 
While initially stifled by a weak bond market at the opening, stocks rose in the first half-hour of trading and moved to about a 10-point advance. The market then began to lose ground and continued a seesaw pattern until about 1:30 P.M., when it showed its biggest loss, about a dozen points. A half-hour before the close, the Dow bounced back to the plus side, where it hovered until the final bell.
''With corporate profits dwindling and the Federal Reserve Board unwilling to bring interest rates lower, stock prices, especially in this week of light volume, might come under light pressure,'' said Kenneth S. Hackel, president of Systematic Financial Management, an investment advisory firm in Fort Lee, N.J. ''Takeover activity has also slowed, shaving some of the premium off the equity market.''
Volume on the Big Board expanded to 147.9 million shares, from a skimpy 128.2 million on Monday.
Wider indicators than the Dow showed only fractional gains. The New York Stock Exchange composite index edged up a minuscule 0.02, to 188.05, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index tacked on 0.24, to 339.59.
Among individual issues, the Georgia Gulf Corporation plunged 6 1/8, to 46 1/4. The company, which has been a takeover target, said that it had preliminarily determined that a leveraged recapitalization would be the most beneficial course for its investors. Some analysts had expected the company to be sold for about $65 a share.
Witco fell 3 3/4, to 37 1/2. The petroleum and specialty chemicals company said it expected lower fourth-quarter earnings than a year ago.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index slipped 0.50, to 370.98, while in over-the-counter activity, the Nasdaq composite index dropped 1.57 points, to 454.14.

Spot Gold Ends Above $400 For First Time in 10 Months

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
With gold in strong demand, prices of precious metals continued to advance yesterday. The spot December gold delivery closed above $400 an ounce in New York for the first time in 10 months, following similar gains in Asia and Europe earlier in the day.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the active gold contract, December, closed up $5.10 an ounce, at $404.40; the expiring November contract rose $5.50, to $403.70. The December silver delivery soared 14.2 cents an ounce, to $5.845. Meanwhile, the spot January 1990 platinum contract closed up $4.70 an ounce, at $535.30, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
''A number of factors caused gold to cross the pychological $400 barrier today,'' said Ian C. MacDonald, manager of precious metals at Credit Suisse. ''But if we had to pick the main factor, we would say that the events of this past Oct. 13 ended the decline in bullion prices.''
A month before the sharp drop in stock prices on Oct. 13, gold was trading at a three-year low of roughly $350 an ounce, after declining from about $440 at the start of 1989.
 
Hedging by Managers Seen
''Since Oct. 13, many investment managers on both sides of the Atlantic have been hedging against another plunge in equity prices by adding gold to their portfolios,'' Mr. MacDonald said. ''With many economists and newspaper articles forecasting a recession, they have been adding to their bullion holdings.''
Other factors supporting gold, he added, included the still wobbly stock market, a weakening dollar, falling yields on dollar investments and strong hints of an upturn in inflation.
But Frederick R. Demler, metals economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert, offered a somewhat different view. ''What we are seeing in gold is a classic technical pattern, as well as the economic fundamentals,'' he said. ''Moreover, demand for physical gold by the jewelry industry is usually strongest in the fourth quarter. And the demand by jewelry manufacturers has indeed been very strong this year because of the relatively low prices of all precious metals.''
Mr. Demler said he was bullish on gold over the near term, but added, ''We have doubts about the metal over the longer term, unless the dollar falls precipitously or stocks take another dive or some other major economic disaster occurs.''
As for the silver and platinum markets, both Mr. MacDonald and Mr. Demler said those metals were ''playing catch-up'' with gold. Mr. MacDonald added that ''what happens to silver depends on when copper output peaks, which we think will be in 1992.''
Much, if not most, of the world's silver output comes from copper and other base metals mines. With copper prices in particular tumbling in recent months, metals analysts expect that many producers will once again shut copper mines or sharply reduce output early next year.

Factory Being Converted in a Depressed Area of Newark

BYLINE: By Richard D. Lyons

 BODY:
A VACANT light-bulb factory that shut down four years ago in an economically depressed section of Newark is being converted by a group of Manhattan investors into rental space for light manufacturing and distribution companies.
The investor group, which bought the factory and renamed it the Metro Industrial Center, expects the project to cost $4 million for the acquisition and renovations and to take a year to complete.
The group, J.I.M. Associates, consists of three partners with interests in the garment industry: Jacob Mendelsohn, Isaac Dabah and Michael Gross. Triad Realty Services Ltd., a Manhattan advisory and investment brokerage firm, has been retained by J.I.M. Associates to oversee the renovations and the marketing of the 482,000-square-foot structure. 
The building, at 40 17th Avenue near Irving Turner Boulevard, is about two miles from both the Newark Amtrak station and the Newark International Airport. Built as a series of eight interconnecting structures between 1908 and 1958, the factory served as the East Coast manufacturing and distribution center for the light-bulb division of the General Electric Company. In the 1970's as many as 2,500 workers were employed in the building, working three shifts, and the closing of the plant in 1985 added to Newark's economic problems.
Officials in Newark said the project is the largest renovation in 15 years in the Central Ward, one of the city's poorest areas. They expect it to help revive the economy of that distressed neighborhood.
Triad will subdivide the brick and concrete building into 11 units of 30,000 to 42,000 square feet. Space would lease for $2 to $4 a square foot depending on its location on the four floors. None of the space has yet been leased.
Each tenant unit in the building, which takes up 100,000 square feet on a five-acre site, would have truck docks, staging areas and elevator banks. The building has five main elevators and 23 loading docks. The number of docks can be expanded to 38. One unusual feature is an interior courtyard of 18,500 square feet.
Mark C. Rosenberg, a partner at Triad, said that since New Jersey had designated Newark an ''urban enterprise zone,'' tenants might be eligible for benefits like exemptions from or reductions in sales taxes. He said tenants might also be eligible for loans and loan guarantees under the state's Economic Development Administration.
Mr. Rosenberg also noted that the Newark Economic Development Corporation had been helpful in calling the availability of the building to the attention of prospective tenants.
Alfred L. Faiella, executive director of the development agency, said the building ''is in a rough neighborhood, and to find investor confidence in a multistory building in the area is extremely significant for the Central Ward.''
The Central Ward was the site of a series of civil disturbances in the summer of 1967, and a large-scale abandonment of both commercial and residential properties followed. Many buildings that existed then have been torn down by the city, leaving several dozen open and desolate blocks.
Mr. Faiella said the purchase price of the building had risen several times since it was initially put on the market by General Electric. It has been through three changes in ownership since General Electric sold it. This, he insisted, demonstrates that Newark, even the city's distressed Central Ward, is making a comeback.
''Ten to 12 years ago there would have been no buyers for the property,'' he said.
He added that many buildings in the area had either been razed or abandoned, and that the Metro Industrial Center would help point the neighborhood in a more positive direction.
Mr. Faiella also said that while development in the Central Ward has stagnated over the last decade, during that period more than 10 million square feet of industrial development has taken place in Newark itself.

HEADLINE: Yankees Sign Perez To a 3-Year Contract

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

 BODY:
The Yankees, who used 16 pitchers to staff a chaotic five-man rotation last season, plunged into the free-agent market with George Steinbrenner's bankroll yesterday and spent $5.7 million for three years to sign Pascual Perez, a pitcher with a losing record and a history of struggling against drugs.
It was the third major signing of this winter's free-agent market, which numbered 90 players when the deadline for filing passed last week, and the prices have soared. Kevin Bass signed with the San Francisco Giants last week for $5.25 million for three years, and Nick Esasky signed with the Atlanta Braves for $5.6 million for three years. And Mark Langston, Mark Davis and Robin Yount were being pursued with even bigger bucks as the superstars of the class. 
 
Joins the Sweepstakes
Perez joined the sweepstakes after winning 9 games and losing 13 this year for the Montreal Expos, bringing his record to 64 victories and 62 defeats in a career that began in 1980 with the Pittsburgh Pirates.
But he had a respectable earned-run average of 3.31 and he continued to pitch with the flair that has established him as one of the more colorful and provocative performers in baseball. He rushes onto the field, prowls round the mound, occasionally lobs a blooper pitch and frequently gets into confrontations or fights. Last season, he even threw a baseball into the Chicago Cubs' dugout.
Still, he doubled his salary of $850,000 and gave one more shot of inflation to a market that already has reached new levels. The Yankees would not give details of his contract, but a source familiar with the matter said the contract broke down this way: $1.2 million for next season and $1.9 million each in 1991 and 1992; plus a $500.000 signing bonus and a $200,000 relocation bonus.
The Yankees acknowledged that Perez came with questions.
''We are very aware of his past problems,'' said George Bradley, vice president for player personnel. ''However, he has been involved in a program with the Expos that has kept him clean and we will help him remain with that program.''
The problems, which included both alcohol and cocaine, have afflicted Perez for much of his career with the Pirates, the Atlanta Braves and the Expos. He seemed to hit bottom when he won 1 game and lost 13 for the Braves in 1985 and then missed the entire season of 1986. The Expos gave him a chance in 1987, and he responded by winning seven games without losing. But he missed all of spring training this year while undergoing treatment for drugs.
The Expos said they had hoped to sign him back, especially since they should become the worst victims of the free-agent ex odus. They have lost Langston and may lose Bryn Smith and Hubie Brooks. When the season ended, they offered $4 million for three years to keep Perez, but then Bass and Esasky triggered the explosion in the market and the Expos were told that Perez would now cost $5 million plus incentives.
''I hope the Yankees take good care of him,'' Dave Dombrowski, the general manager of the Expos, said yesterday from his parents' home in Chicago. ''He is a very fragile individual. He has a problem. ''I understand this is a big business. But for the good of the individual, I thought he'd stay with Montreal. I don't know how well he'd react to booing in New York.''
Dombrowski was asked the nature of the treatment program for Perez, and said: ''It's a very strong maintenance program. He'll be on it for the rest of his career.''
''They paid him a lot of money,'' Dombrowski said. ''Three weeks ago, I'd have said you're crazy to pay it. But the market's just gone wild.'' Perez was in the Domincan Republic yesterday and could not be reached for comment. Steinbrenner, who traveled last week to Los Angeles and Houston to pursue Langston and Davis, did not return telephone calls to his office in Tampa, Fla.
Langston's agent, Arn Tellem, said last night from Los Angeles that he didn't expect any decision for a few weeks and added: ''The Yankees are definitely in the picture. There is no location issue. He wants to be on a winner. We had a great meeting with Mr. Steinbrenner, and Perez is a sign that he is backing up his words.''

HEADLINE: Friendly Advice to a Shrinking Military

BYLINE: By John Kenneth Galbraith; John Kenneth Galbraith is emeritus professor of economics at Harvard University.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
In these last days, the newspapers and television screens have dealt fully and with wonderment with what is happening in Europe and its meaning for Europeans. Let no one doubt that there will also be great and enduring effects on us, especially on our military establishment. This is a word of sympathy, counsel and guidance for that establishment in what promises to be a difficult time.
The difficulty, needless to say, is the evident end of any plausible case for believing in Soviet expansionism - as regularly, and one thinks by some gratefully, it has been been called. And, additionally, there is the reduction in the Soviet armed forces in Eastern Europe and at home. 
From this comes a compelling thought: Is there any longer any serious likelihood of a Soviet armed thrust out of East Germany to the West? Would the Polish or Hungarian divisions, for example - perhaps even the Bulgarian divisions - be really stalwart on the march? They were cited as a threat a few days back by the Joint Chiefs.
To this are added earlier questions: Do the Soviets more than we yearn for the reciprocal destruction of a nuclear exchange? More distantly, in light of their own domestic economic trouble, could the Soviets really wish in any realistic way to take responsibility for running the highly sophisticated economy of Japan? If not, how necessary is the military umbrella we maintain at no slight cost over our distressingly effective competitor and rapidly emerging landlord?
From some public experience, I have, needless to say, no hope that the Pentagon or, for that matter, the larger foreign policy and intelligence bureaucracy will surrender easily to such conclusions. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney has, indeed, asked for a list of possible reductions; one cannot think that results will come easily.
Forty and more years of vested intellectual interest and bureaucratic commitment are involved and so, also, are a deep political resistance and a massive and widely distributed economic reward. The temptation, in consequence, will be to say, in the face of great change, that nothing has changed or to invent and depict the requisite enemy.
This is not good. We pride ourselves on being a down-to-earth, plain-spoken, forthright people who rise well above cant and evasion. Implicit in the foregoing effort could be an embarrassing element of fraud made worse by being both tedious and transparent. No friend of the men and women in our armed forces can welcome their association with this. Let us rest the defense of our military establishment and its supporting weapons industry on honest grounds, on amply established reality.
For generations now, numerous military bases around the country have been sustained not for their military need or purpose but because of their contribution to local employment, industry and community pride. The revolving door consultants at the Pentagon, we have long known, are motivated not by concern for the defense of the Republic but by personal economic interest and, if in lesser measure, the economic interest of their clients.
In recent weeks, a New York Times article from Bethpage, L.I., told of an agreement in Congress to build 18 F-14 fighter jets, unwanted even by the Pentagon, to buy time ''to reduce the Island's dependence on defense spending.'' The cost was estimated at about $1 billion.
A few days later, the House of Representatives passed a $305 billion military appropriations bill that included $195 million for 36 helicopters and $585 million for V-22 Osprey airplanes, which the Pentagon said it did not want. There was widespread comment on the reluctance of the Representatives to cut, as they were called, ''politically popular weapons.''
So one comes to the future. As the great changes of our time proceed and the military effect becomes evident, let us not have a mendacious defense of our military budget and invented danger.
Let us have a forthright defense, in the best of our traditions, based openly on the contributions to employment, earnings, political appeal and bureaucratic stability. That is the honest course. In the tradition of Dwight D. Eisenhower, let us see the military power as having existence and justification in its own right, independent of military danger.
There is, however, one further thought that does obtrude. These last days in Europe have seen an extraordinary celebration of freedom, one in which we have joyously joined.
In keeping with our national commitment to down-to-earth truth, there is a domestic reality to which, in these celebrations, we should perhaps turn our thoughts.
That is to the number of our own citizens who, not less than the East Germans in the past, are denied freedom. Nothing more inhibits expression, action, movement, personal liberty than oppressive, grinding poverty. Nothing so enforces silence unless it be illiteracy or deficient education.
Nothing, we all know, so enhances freedom as some money. And in our cities, we have some millions devoid of shelter, food, medical care and money who are so repressed. No East German in pursuit of liberty would go wisely to the South Bronx.
Perhaps some day, as in East Berlin and Leipzig and our own cities in the past, our deprived and now voiceless may also express their discontent. It would be an exercise in sensible conservative foresight to redirect some of our present military budget, serving urgent urban needs and so enhancing freedom here at home. It would show that, in anticipating unfortunate eventualities, we are wiser than the Communist leaders who denied both freedom and the future.

HEADLINE: Lebanon's Slain Pact

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 22

 BODY:
The ultimate target of the bomb that killed the new Lebanese President, Rene Moawad, 17 days after his election was the accord reached between Lebanon's Muslim and Christian factions last month in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
''It is an assassination of the whole Taif agreement,'' said Adel Malek, a Lebanese and Arab affairs expert in London, in a comment widely echoed by many other Middle East experts. ''Whoever did it may have succeeded in eliminating the last attempt to put Lebanon together as a unified country even if the accord stays alive on paper.''
The accord, signed by Christian and Muslim members of the Lebanese Parliament last month, was reached under the auspices of an Arab League peace plan. The plan received the most vociferous backing from the major powers, including the United States, France and the Soviet Union, all of which have special interests in Lebanon and a history of involvement with various parties controlling the country's destiny. 
''It strikes me as another page in the ongoing tragedy which typifies the last 15 years in Lebanon,'' Uri Lubrani, coordinator of Lebanese affairs in the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said in a telephone interview from Tel Aviv. ''But in Lebanon one doesn't ask why. The question is futile.''
But the questions echoed everywhere tonight after the news of the assassination: who did it, who suffers most from it and who stands to gain?
What is clear is that the killing follows a well-established pattern of assassinating Lebanese leaders almost as soon as they seem to abandon their partisan positions and start to speak of national reconciliation.
Among those were the leftist Druse leader, Kamal Jumblat, who was shot in 1977; Lebanon's Sunni Muslim Prime Minister, Rashid Karami, killed by a bomb in 1987; President-elect Bashir Gemayel, also killed by a bomb in 1982, and now Mr. Moawad, a Maronite Christian killed on the 46th anniversary of Lebanon's independence.
Lebanese officials said they would meet quickly to elect a new president. But the assassination in Syrian-controlled Muslim West Beirut has put off for a long time any serious hope of ending the 14 years of civil war.
 
Factions Opposed to the Pact
The search for the assassin is on, and in Lebanon, revenge always follows. But more important, even before the assassination, the Taif accord looked good mostly on paper. Despite Arab and international support, the agreement was strongly opposed by a number of factions in Lebanon.
Those included the great majority of the one million Maronite Catholics, who felt it would only lead to a permanent Syrian occupation of their country and Muslim domination of the only Arab nation where Christians have not been reduced to second-class citizens.
Shiites, who number well over a million, also opposed it vehemently as it failed, in their view, to give them a greater share in power than the Sunni Muslims.
Other minorities in Lebanon, most notably the Druse, also openly said the Taif agreement fell far short of meeting their hopes for a greater share of power.
 
Maronite Support for Aoun
The countries that support those factions also expressed displeasure with the accord.
Iran, a strong backer of Shiites, assailed the agreement, even though its close Arab ally, Syria, gave it its backing. Iraq, an archenemy of Syria, continued to supply the Christian Maronite armed forces of Gen. Michel Aoun with weapons, as did Israel, which has had a longstanding alliance with the Christians of Lebanon and which occupies a slice of the country's south.
Because of his strong opposition to the accord, General Aoun has been immediately identified by Syria as the person behind the assassination.
But it is far from evident in the view of Lebanese experts that he had any real interest in killing Mr. Moawad. Among other things, it had become evident that a great majority of Christian Maronites supported General Aoun. He continued to occupy the presidential palace in Baabda and successfully blocked President Moawad's attempt to draft Christian support in the formation of a new government.
 
'There Is No Prime Suspect'
Killing President Moawad could only weaken the General's position by opening the way to the Syrians to attack him and resume their assault on his forces. It also weakens his position within the Christian camp. ''The Maronites can say to Aoun, please leave now otherwise there will be a massacre,'' said Farid Trabulsi, a Lebanese journalist and editor here.
''There is no prime suspect,'' said Ghassan Salameh, a Lebanese professor at the University of Paris who is an expert on Arab affairs. ''Too many parties have an interest in blocking the reunification of Lebanon today.''
A number of Arab parties, most notably Iraq, point to Syria, which appeared to be one of President Moawad's biggest backers. They asserted Mr. Moawad was failing in efforts to take control from General Aoun or lessen his power. ''Killing Moawad gives the Syrians an excuse to keep their army in Lebanon forever,'' said a senior Iraqi official who asked not to be identified.
Lebanon experts saw little motivation for Iraq's involvement in the killing, in part because it had no reason to derail General Aoun's quiet supremacy on the Lebanese political scene.
Others point to Iran, which they say could not have acted without Syrian approval. And, still others say, it may have been Israel, which has an interest in keeping attention away from the issue of talks with the Palestinians and the rising pressure on its Government to engage in those talks.
It is almost certain that a meeting called by the Palestine Liberation Organization in Tunis on Saturday for Arab foreign ministers to discuss the peace process with Israel has been completely sidetracked by the assassination.
As for the future of Lebanon, George Corm, a prominent Lebanese economist and expert on the country, said tonight, ''The only thing to do is pray.''

HEADLINE: Transcript of President's Speech on Relations Between the East and West

 BODY:
Following is the transcript of President Bush's address to the nation last night as recorded by The New York Times:
Good evening. Like many of you, I'm spending tomorrow with family. And we'll say grace and carve the turkey, and thank God for our many blessings and for our great country.
This holiday also marks the adjournment of Congress. And I've worked with Congress, extending my hand across the party aisle, advancing legislation to free our streets of the fear of crime and drugs. We proposed ways to clean the air, the water and the land around us. And we've joined with the nation's governors to enter an historic compact to better our schools.
And especially touching is that so many Americans have answered the call for community service, the thousand points of light, by rolling up their sleeves and pitching in for the hopeless, the helpless - each volunteer, a beacon of light for someone who has lost his way. 
And this will be a very special Thanksgiving. It marks an extraordinary year.
 
Pilgrims to Freedom
But before our families sit down tomorrow, we'll give thanks for yet another reason: Around the world tonight, new pilgrims are on a voyage to freedom and for many it's not a trip to some place faraway but to a world of their own making.
On other Thanksgivings, the world was haunted by the images of watchtowers, guard dogs and machine guns. In fact, many of you had not even been born when the Berlin Wall was erected in 1961. But now the world has a new image, reflecting a new reality, that of Germans, East and West, pulling each other to the top of the wall, a human bridge between nations. Entire peoples all across Eastern Europe, bravely taking to the streets demanding liberty, pursuing democracy.
This is not the end of the book of history, but it's a joyful end to one of history's saddest chapters.
Not long after the wall began to open, West German Chancellor Kohl telephoned, and he asked me to give you, the American people, a message of thanks. He said that the remarkable change in Eastern Europe would not be taking place without the steadfast support of the United States. Fitting praise from a good friend.
For 40 years, we have not wavered in our commitment to freedom. We are grateful to our American men and women in uniform. And we should also be grateful to our postwar leaders. You see, we helped rebuild a continent through the Marshall Plan, and we built a shield, NATO, behind which Americans, Europeans, could forge a future in freedom.
For so many of these 40 years, the test of Western resolve, the contest between the free and the unfree, has been symbolized by an island of hope behind the Iron Curtain: Berlin.
In the 1940's West Berlin remained free because Harry Truman said, 'Hands off.' In the 1950's Ike backed America's words with muscle. In the 1960's West Berliners took heart when John F. Kennedy said, 'I am a Berliner.' In the 1970's Presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter stood with Berlin by standing with NATO. And in the 1980's Ronald Reagan went to Berlin to say, 'Tear down this wall.'
 
Imagining a New World
And now we are at the threshold of the 1990's. And as we begin the new decade, I am reaching out to President Gorbachev, asking him to work with me to bring down the last barriers to a new world of freedom. Let us move beyond containment, and once and for all end the cold war.
We can make such a bold bid because America is strong, and 40 years of perseverance and patience are finally paying off. More recently, quiet diplomacy, working behind the scenes, has achieved results. We can now dare to imagine a new world, with a new Europe, rising on the foundations of democracy.
This new world was taking shape when my Presidency began with these words: 'The day of the dictator is over.' And during the spring and summer, we told the people of the world what America believes and what America wants for the future.
America believes that liberty is an idea whose time has come in Eastern Europe. America wants President Gorbachev's reforms, known as perestroika, to succeed. And America wants the Soviets to join us in moving beyond containment to a new partnership.
Some wondered if all this was realistic. And now, though we are still on the course set last spring, events are moving faster than anyone imagined or predicted.
Look around the world - in the developing nations, the people are demanding freedom. Poland and Hungary are now fledgling democracies - a non-communist Government in Poland, and free elections coming soon in Hungary. And in the Soviet Union itself, the forces of reform under Mikhail Gorbachev are bringing unprecedented openness and change.
 
Drama in Berlin
But nowhere in the world today -or even in the history of man - have the warm hearts of men and women triumphed so swiftly, so certainly, over cold stone as in Berlin. Indeed, in all of East Germany. If I may paraphrase the words of a great poet, Robert Frost, there is certainly something in us that doesn't love a wall.
And when I spoke to the German people in Mainz last May, I applauded the removal of the barriers between Hungary and Austria, saying, 'Let Berlin be next.' And the West German people joined us in a call for a Europe whole and free.
Just yesterday, the West German Foreign Minister gave me a piece of the Berlin Wall. And it's on my desk as a reminder of the power of freedom to bring down the walls between people.
It brought back memories of seven years ago, when I went to Modlareuth, a small town in Germany also known as Little Berlin. A divided village, really, its cobbled streets were blocked by barbed wire and concrete - on the one side freedom, and on the other despair. And I talked with the townspeople, not a hundred and fifty yards from the specter of armed guards in towers.
And some day I'd like to go back to Little Berlin, and see families reunited, see neighbors once apart, coming together. How wonderful that would be. Change is coming swiftly. And with this change, the dramatic vindication of free Europe's economic and political institutions. The new Europe that is coming is being built - must be built - on the foundation of democratic values. But the faster the pace, the smoother our path must be. After all, this is serious business.
The peace we are building must be different than the hard joyless peace between two armed camps we've known so long. The scars of the conflict that began a half a century ago still divide a continent. So the historic task before us now is to begin the healing of this old wound.
 
Good News in Warsaw
During our visit to Poland and Hungary last July, I found new encouragement that we were on track, there was, at long last, the chance for a fundamental change. I saw firsthand acts of healing and reconciliation.
And it was in Warsaw at my lunch for General Jaruzelski and the leaders of Solidarity that I met a woman who had worked, at great personal risk, for the release of jailed Solidarity members. And she was asked, 'How is it possible, after such a short time, to break bread with the men who ordered those imprisonments? Why the absence of bitterness?' And she replied, 'Our joy at what is happening now is more powerful than memory.'
I wish you could have been there, for what we witnessed was extraordinary. The old antagonisms melted away as former adversaries stood up, often with tears in their eyes, and toasted the future. Our guests knew that history would judge them by how well they would cooperate.
Well, there is a spirit of cooperation in Eastern Europe. The result: Poland and Hungary are being transformed.
And they deserve our support, and they are getting it. We have matched our words with action: new loans and grants, teams of American economic experts working to help them adjust to a free market society, clearing the way for U.S. investment and trade with Poland and Hungary. Now the peoples of these nations can finally expect their hard work to lead to a better life.
 
Exceptions Near U.S.
These same winds of change are sweeping our own hemisphere, democracy transforming the Americas with stunning speed. Regrettably, there are some exceptions: Panama, Nicaragua and Cuba. And these last two are holding out against their people only because of the massive support of weapons and supplies from their communist allies.
And so when I see President Gorbachev, I'll ask him to join with us to help bring freedom and democracy to all the people of Latin America.
And so as we celebrate the events of Eastern Europe, remember that some walls still remain between East and West. These are the invisible walls of suspicion. The walls of doubt, misunderstanding and miscalculation.
It was while in Eastern Europe last summer that I decided to make a personal effort to break through these last barriers.
 
Proposals for Gorbachev
And back in May, I set down five steps that the Soviets should take that would inevitably result in improved relations with the West. First, reduce Soviet forces. Second, support self-determination in Eastern Europe. Third, work with us to end regional disputes. Fourth, achieve a lasting pluralism and respect for human rights, and fifth, join with us in addressing global problems, including the international drug menace and dangers to the environment.
Serious problems still remain, especially those regional conflicts. But the Soviet Union has made progress in these five areas that is undeniable.
With that in mind and the momentous changes in Eastern Europe, I invited President Gorbachev to meet me 10 days from now. And this is a first meeting, a time for exploration. It is not a time for detailed arms control negotiations best left for next year's summit.
I want President Gorbachev to know exactly where the United States stands. And let me be clear: America stands with freedom and democracy. We are not meeting to determine the future of Europe. After all, the peoples of Europe are determining their own future. And though there will be no surprises sprung on our Allies, we will miss no opportunity to expand freedom and enhance the peace. But to those who question our prudent pace, they must understand that a time of historic change is no time for recklessness. The pace, and the confidence, and the security of our friends in Europe - it's just too important.
We will seek President Gorbachev's assurance that this process of reform in Eastern Europe will continue. And we will give him our assurance that America welcomes this reform not as an adversary seeking advantage, but as a people offering support. Our goal is to see this historic tide of freedom broadened, deepened and sustained.
We find enormous encouragement in its peaceful advance and its acceptance by the Soviet Union. We can now raise our hopes on other issues: our common environment, our common war against drugs, as well as human rights and the regional conflicts that remain.
 
Consulting With Allies
Immediately after my visit with President Gorbachev, I'll go to Brussels to consult with our partners in NATO, the very alliance that has kept the West free for 40 years. I will assure them that no matter how dramatic the change in Eastern Europe or in the Soviet Union itself, the United States will continue to stand with our allies and our friends.
For in a new Europe, the American role may change in form but not in fundamentals. After all, the Soviet Union maintains hundreds of thousands of troops throughout Eastern Europe. Study the map, review history and you'll see that this presence, with the Soviet Union's natural advantage of geography, cannot be ignored. So even if forces are significantly reduced on both sides - a noble goal indeed - we will remain in Europe as long as our friends want and need us.
Off the island nation of Malta, Mikhail Gorbachev and I will begin the work of years. We can help the peoples of Europe achieve a new destiny, in a peaceful Europe whole and free. And I will tell President Gorbachev, the dynamic architect of Soviet reform, that America wants the people of the Soviet Union to fulfill their destiny. And I will assure him that there is no greater advocate of perestroika than the President of the United States.
When we meet, we will be on ships at anchor in a Mediterranean bay that has served as a sea lane of commerce and conflict for more than two thousand years. This ancient port has been conquered by caesar and sultan, crusader and king. Its forts and watchtowers survey a sea that entombs the scuttled ships of empires lost - slave galleys, galleons, dreadnoughts, destroyers. And these ships, once meant to guard lasting empires, now litter the ocean floor and guard nothing more than reefs of coral.
So if the millennia offers us a lesson, perhaps it's this: True security does not come from empire and domination. True security can only be found in the growing trust of free peoples.
It's been said that peace is not the work of a single day, nor will it be the consequence of a single act. And yet every constructive act contributes to its growth; every omission impedes it.
Peace will come, in the end, as a child grows to maturity, slowly, until we realize one day in wonder - the child's almost grown.
It is our hope that Malta will be such a constructive act, guiding brave pilgrims on their journey to a new world of freedom.
And so, on this Thanksgiving Eve, as I prepare for my journey to Malta, I wish you a good night, and safe travel. God bless you and your family, and God bless the United States of America.

HEADLINE: Phantom of Mayor's Race Is Talk of New Orleans

BYLINE: By FRANCES FRANK MARCUS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Here in the land of hot and spicy politics, the New Orleans mayor's race is sizzling with the usual rich language. But the dominant personality is only listening.
Former Mayor Ernest N. Dutch Morial has become the focus of attention, even though he is not a candidate - at least not yet.
So as the city faces its worst economic problems in years, the electorate is preoccupied not by issues and proposals for change but by the question of whether Mr. Morial will run. 
 
'Run, Dutch, Run'
As if to emphasize the point, a billboard above an elevated expressway on the way downtown urges: ''Run, Dutch, Run.''
Mr. Morial will not say what he will do. But his supporters have formed an ''exploratory committee'' to advance his candidacy. They say New Orleans badly needs strong leadership, a trademark of the combative man who became the first black mayor here.
The mayor's race comes at a critical time for New Orleans, when many people here are questioning the city's direction and prospects. Although there are economic bright spots, the depression that followed the collapse of oil prices is still all too evident. ''For sale'' signs on houses have become part of the landscape, along with ''for lease'' signs on offices. Hard times have spawned a rueful joke: ''At least the bankruptcy lawyers are prosperous.''
A newspaper advertisement placed by friends of Donald Mintz, one of the two official candidates in the nonpartison primary on Feb. 3, puts the issue bluntly: ''Is there hope for New Orleans?''
 
Incumbent Seeks 2d Term
Mr. Mintz says the economy here has suffered from a lack of leadership in the administration of Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, the incumbent, who is running for a second term. No other candidates have announced. The last day for qualifying is Dec. 15.
Mr. Mintz's ad called New Orleans ''the nation's most ailing city,'' a place that ''resounds with sad pessimism.'' It called Mayor Barthelemy ''a kind man overwhelmed by the demands of a city in the worst crisis of its life.''
Actually, times were probably tougher during Reconstruction. But there is no doubt the city has serious problems: widespread poverty, an exodus of residents to the suburbs or to jobs in other states, crime and drugs, packed jails and a city budget that is strained to the limit.
The good news includes a huge program to rebuild the port, a $114 million expansion of the Convention Center and a $40 million riverfront aquarium, both opening in 1991. But many more jobs are still needed to replace those lost in the oil crisis.
Pessimism is rife, dampening the joie de vivre that has defined New Orleans from its early days as a French outpost.
In recent years city budget gaps have been as certain as the potholes that pit the streets. Causes include cutbacks in Federal aid, low property taxes on homes and a state constitution that restricts local governments' taxation powers.
 
A Combative Personality
Soon after Mr. Morial took office in 1978, the city was flooded, literally, because of drainage problems. Budget problems came later, but he kept the city afloat, solved a police strike and won a second term. Many political analysts, including some now working for Mr. Mintz, say Mr. Morial's prickly personality overshadowed his record as one of the city's brightest, most competent mayors.
His combativeness played well among black voters, who are in the majority here, but voters still crushed his strong bid in 1985 to change the city charter to allow him to run for a third, consecutive term.
Voters in his own district later rejected his bid for a seat on the City Council. In the same election, Mr. Barthelemy became the city's second black mayor.
Mr. Morial has refrained from criticizing the incumbent, at least in public. The two men come from the same Creole culture that has produced many prominent politicians, but they are also old enemies. And sparks are expected to fly if Mr. Morial enters the race.
Mr. Mintz, an old friend of Mr. Morial's, is a civic and philanthropic leader who recently resigned as chairman of the New Orleans Port Commission. He and his law firm handled legal cases for the Morial administration. Mr. Mintz says he can bring jobs to the city and fill a vacuum of leadership.
Mr. Barthelemy is known as ''the gentle giant,'' in reference to his height, 6 feet 3 inches, and his mild manner. While Mr. Mintz has been lambasting the Mayor, Mr. Barthelemy has been garnering endorsements from former Mayor Moon Landrieu, ministers and social, civic and business leaders.
 
Difficult Times
His commercials say he is ''quietly getting the job done'' in the toughest of times. The incumbent ''has a very easy-going management style,'' said his political adviser, Jim Carvin. ''I hate to compare it to Reagan's, but the style probably is similar.''
Mr. Carvin says he is not worried that the polls show scant support for the incumbent. Such early polls, he says, ''could be influenced by the last TV commercial.''
''It's hard to run against a phantom like Dutch,'' Mr. Carvin said. But he added: ''we're prepared for him running and we're prepared for him not running. It hasn't kept people from contributing to us.''
Mr. Mintz's poll taker, Edward F. Renwick, said a recent opinion survey mainly showed that ''voters want change'' and ''are dissatisfied with the status quo.'' Mr. Mintz has found support among blacks and whites, including some of Mr. Morial's friends and former colleagues.
Mr. Morial's law partner, Fred Cassibry, said Mr. Morial's friends have been ''bombarded with inquiries'' from people who wanted the former Mayor to enter the race. Mr. Cassibry said a poll was under way to determine Mr. Morial's chances.
If Mr. Morial decides to run, ''he knows he can get into the runoff,'' said Joseph Logsdon, a friend who is a history professor at the University of New Orleans. ''The real war will be Sidney battling Mintz for the white vote. The more they bid for the white vote, the more black voters will go to Morial.''
Noting that Mr. Morial had become ''the story of the election'' without campaigning, Dr. Logsdon said, ''It just shows how clever he is.''

HEADLINE: Biotechnology Offers L.I. a Second Chance

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You report on Long Island's reassessment of environmental and other commitments in a time of economic slowdown (news story, Oct. 17).
The economic downswing in New York's Nassau and Suffolk counties has been triggered by massive reduction in Federal defense spending. This large cutback has adversely affected the Grumman Corporation, Long Island's largest employer, which is threatened with having to lay off an estimated 5,000 employees. (Grumman's future agenda includes scaling back its presence on Long Island and building up facilities in other areas of the country.) The window of future economic opportunity for Long Island lies in the biotechnology industry. It has been developing over the last five years in this region. There are some 80 companies, half of them created in the last three years, which provide employment to about 5,000 people. Our industry projections indicate that this component of the Long Island economy can grow to some 25,000 jobs by 1992 (the same Long Island employment figure as Grumman).
Nassau and Suffolk County government leaders and the area's business community should recognize this second chance. They should seize the initiative by offering a broad range of business, financial and tax incentives so that this seedling industry will be properly fertilized in order to blossom.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
Free at Last?

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
At no Thanksgiving since 1945 have Americans had such exhilarating reason to celebrate freedom. Overnight, as it seems, tyranny has lost its grip on Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Bulgaria. Czechoslovakia may follow. But there is something else in these events. There is the hope that our own country may be released from a great fear: the fear of Communism that has haunted American society for so long, distorting our law and marring our democracy.
To fear Communist totalitarianism is rational; Stalin's tyranny required vigilance of free people. But from the beginning the American response to Communism has gone beyond rational concern, to fear of ideas and the perception of danger in the feeblest radicalism. It has had the marks of paranoia. 
Within a year of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, fear had begun to mark our constitutional law. The case was Abrams v. United States.
In August 1918, anonymous pamphlets circulated in the Lower East Side of New York denounced President Wilson for sending troops to intervene in revolutionary Russia. Three anarchists and a Socialist connected with the pamphlets were convicted of ''sedition'' and sentenced to 20 years in prison.
In the Supreme Court, Justice Holmes said the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech protected what he called these ''puny anonymities.'' Certainly the pamphlets presented no conceivable threat to the Government. But Holmes's eloquent argument for ''free trade in ideas'' was made in a dissent joined only by Justice Brandeis.
Fear of Communism has marked the Court's approach to the First Amendment again and again in the years since then. In 1951 a majority found a ''clear and present danger'' that justified prosecutions of American Communist Party leaders, although the party by then was a pathetic raggle-taggle group.
The same fear led Congress to exclude foreign visitors who might have dangerous ideas: a foolishness that has repeatedly embarrassed us. The fear gave J. Edgar Hoover justification for his sick eavesdropping on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Paranoia about Communist spies leads the current Director of the F.B.I., William Sessions, to defend its program to monitor libraries and investigate uncooperative librarians.
Richard Nixon, Joe McCarthy, Pat McCarran and a dozen members of the House Committee on un-American Activities used fear of Communism to advance their political careers. They destroyed lives, menaced American liberty, sickened our culture.
Is there really a chance now that the United States can free itself of the fear? The habit of mind is so deeply ingrained that it will surely not be easy to overcome. Even now, fear of being associated with ''Communists'' leads Congressmen to support arms aid to murderers in El Salvador. But I think there is reason to hope.
An essential element in our long paranoia has been the vision of Communism as a worldwide conspiracy, controlled from a powerful center in Moscow. Not even the China-Soviet split was enough to end that assumption in many Americans. Indeed, some leaders told us that the apparent split was really a trick: a master stroke by the conspiracy.
Today it is increasingly difficult to see Communism in those terms. In Europe and Asia, Communist parties are heading in many different directions. The Soviet Union faces monumental problems, economic and political.
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney summed it up well the other day in talking about the realistic prospect of cutting U.S. defense expenditure. ''It doesn't make a lot of sense,'' he said, ''to spend a lot of time worrying about the Polish Army or the East German Army actively participating in an attack on Western Europe.''
In short, two things have happened. Communism has lost the ideological struggle with democracy. And the military threat of the Communist world is declining.
The hard question for the United States is no longer how to contain Communism. It is how to maintain a strong economy without the drug of military production. And how to build a better, more decent society.
The great changes in Eastern Europe happen to come at a time when our own political system is hardly working perfectly. Congress and the President seem equally stymied by the economic challenges of the 1980's. And the 1990's will require even sharper adjustments.
It is a Thanksgiving to celebrate. But not to be smug.

HEADLINE: Silk and Steel: Softening Hard Edges

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE

 BODY:
THREE years ago, when Connie Steensma and Richard Prins discovered they were going to have a baby after 15 years of marriage, they made the usual series of phone calls. First they called their parents. Then they called their architect.
''We wanted light and space, and we wanted to stay here 40 to 50 years,'' said Ms. Steensma, whose company, Accel Communications, trains executives in public speaking. Her husband is a partner at the Manhattan law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Both are 39 years old. 
Their architect, Patricia Sapinsley, transformed their four-story Upper West Side brownstone into a bold juxtaposition of fragility and indestructibility. The renovation exemplifies a new direction many architects are taking, retaining the industrial-inspired design elements and imagery of the last decade, but softening them. It is a style that might be dubbed ''silk and steel.''
The architectural elements - the steel staircase, exposed steel beams and curved steel wall - are hard-edged, delineating space in no uncertain terms. The gray terrazzo floors throughout are stark, tough and childproof. Each of the four floors measures 60 by 19 1/2 feet, and a 50-foot-high stairwell topped by a skylight cuts through the center of the structure.
''The idea of exposing the steel, of exposing the building material, was partly economics,'' Ms. Sapinsley said. It was cheaper, she pointed out, to put in a steel support system and leave it exposed. Even so, gutting the 10 small rental apartments into which the building had been carved, installing a new electrical system and a central air-conditioning system and furnishing the house from scratch cost $500,000.
What softens the 5,000-square-foot space is a lavish and inspired use of fabric. Windows are covered by 20-foot lengths of peach muslin swagged over white muslin curtains. A piece of hand-embroidered Moroccan silk is casually draped over a marble shelf. Moroccan and Turkish rugs are scattered throughout the house, sometimes alone, but often overlapped in groups of twos or threes so they stand out against the vast expanses of terrazzo. The rugs, shawls and tapestries are all part of Ms. Steensma's collection, which she has gathered all her life.
Even the front door, which is made of wrought iron and glass, is curtained in draped white muslin. After one enters, what first attracts the eye is the glint of steel. A large curved steel wall, which screens off Ms. Steensma's study, leads into the formal living room on the first floor. Sunlight pours down through the skylight, making the steel sparkle.
The house is flooded with light, but the quality of light changes according to the weather and time of day. ''Most brownstones get no variation of light,'' Ms. Sapinsley said. At night, the skylight, which measures 6 by 12 feet, is spotlighted from underneath.
At right angles to the fireplace, whose curve echoes that of the steel wall, there are French doors, which Sayzie Carr, a Manhattan stylist and painter, draped voluptuously in peach and white muslin.
Peach walls add yet more warmth to what could have been a cavernous house. First, a coat of white plaster was applied over the Sheetrock walls. Mr. Prins, who created the color scheme, mixed red watercolor paint with lots of water, and did the same with yellow paint. Then he washed the wall with a soft badger brush, painting red in one direction, then painting yellow in another. The result is a slightly dappled effect of broad streaks of peach, with glimpses of white underneath.
The staircase, which is made of the same stainless-steel grating used for commercial buildings, looks tough, industrial and perhaps even dangerous for a house with two small children: Richard, who is 2 1/2 years old, and Mark, who is 10 months old. But it is childproof. Ms. Steensma's father, Arthur, a retired engineer who lives in Wyckoff, N.J., bought sheets of clear plastic and clamped them to the railings. The plastic provides an almost invisible barrier that prevents the children from tumbling off. But when the children get older, it can be unscrewed, Ms. Steensma said. Guard doors were added at the top of each flight of stairs.
The first-floor living room, with its gray-suede Eileen Gray sofa and grand piano, is consciously elegant. The second floor, the family floor, is more informal; it includes another living room, the dining room and the kitchen. The sofa and easy chairs, which were designed by Alan Buchsbaum, are overstuffed and oversized. The chairs, covered in a white, peach and celadon cotton geometric print, are so wide that an adult and a child can nestle side by side in one. The windows at either end of the floor have the same peach and white muslin curtains and window seats covered in beige raw silk.
There is also a granite-sheathed bathroom dividing the living and dining areas. To contrast with the granite, Ms. Steensma hung a gold and white hand-embroidered Moroccan robe. A marble counter jutting out from a wall of the bathroom is draped with a piece of gold silk, on which sit a collection of pewter vessels.
The wrought-iron Art Deco dining room table and chairs, which were designed by Jean Michelet, date from the 1930's. ''You can rock back on the chairs and think at first you might tip over, but you don't,'' Ms. Steensma said. This is where she cradles her children when they wake up in the middle of the night.
On the third floor, there are two bedrooms, both with window seats, and two bathrooms, whose design departs radically from the rest of the house. ''It's noisy and lively,'' said Ms. Sapinsley, who designed a red, blue and yellow geometric-tile pattern in the white-tiled bathrooms that suggests the designs of Russian Constructivist artists.
The top floor, with three more bedrooms, is unfinished. Rooms are unfurnished, walls unpainted. But even among the sparseness, there is a little magic. ''At night,'' Ms. Steensma said, ''if you're up here and look at the skylight, you can see the stars.''

HEADLINE: Planning a Modern City, With Legos

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Onkal (Duke) Guzey used to have to ask his small children if he could borrow their Lego toys to build his model homes. Now, five years and half a million Lego pieces later, he has built his own city.
Mr. Guzey, an architect in Washington, has assembled a Visionary City of miniature churches, city halls, shops, homes and apartments entirely out of the plastic building blocks in bright primary colors. The 30-foot-long city went on display today at the National Press Building here (1331 Pennsylvania Avenue, at 14th Street) and will remain through Jan. 3. 
Lego trains and monorails traverse the construction, and ships ferry tiny passengers along the waterways. But for Mr. Guzey, what sets this city apart is not that it was constructed entirely out of Legos, but how it was designed.
''This is not simply a mock-up of a modern urban environment,'' said Mr. Guzey, who works for D.M.J.M., an international planning firm in Washington. Rather, its design incorporates the natural topography and resources of areas including San Francisco, San Antonio, and La Jolla, Calif. The city is intended to solve the most serious problems of urban living like pollution, traffic congestion and shortages of natural resources.
''There is a great urgency for us to think in terms of different kinds of transportation and living environments,'' Mr. Guzey said. ''As architects and planners, we have a duty and an opportunity to make the public aware that there could be solutions to the problems of urban living.''
Asserting that people waste a great deal of time commuting, he said the city districts are designed so people ''live, work and entertain themselves within their community.''
There are no cars in Mr. Guzey's city and he has designed public transportation to be accessible and appealing. The canals that encircle the downtown carry boats filled with commuters. Monorail tracks pass through apartment buildings. Trains run under waterfalls that provide electricity to power the city. George Marston, a local engineer, designed a computer program to keep the trains running, elevators operating and street lamps lighted.
To emphasize his urban-planning point, at one end of the giant structure Mr. Guzey has built a replica of a crowded city of Legos, complete with raised freeways and bumper-to-bumper traffic. In the middle of the freeway is a jackknifed truck with ambulances and rescue crews blocking all four lanes.
The crowds that gather around the Visionary City are mostly awed; a few are skeptical. ''I don't like the idea of a perfectly controlled, 1984-type city,'' said Melissa Robinson, who works for a Washington-based news service. ''I think the Legos just take the edge off the idea of a planned city.''
Mr. Guzey has no answers for those who want to know how his principles could be made economically feasible or how the ideas could be implemented. He said the project is simply ''a message to force people to think that there are better living environment possibilities.''

HEADLINE: Retailers Are Wary Of Season

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Perhaps more than in any year since 1974, when a severe recession started before Thanksgiving, the success of the Christmas shopping season that begins tomorrow is uncertain. But for bargain-hunting shoppers, opportunities may abound.
One negative portent for retailers is the profusion of stores put up for sale. These include Bloomingdale's, which was placed on the market by Canada's Campeau Corporation; the Bonwit stores, put up for sale by Australia's Hooker Corporation, and the Marshall Field, Saks Fifth Avenue, J. B. Ivey and John Breuner stores put up for sale by B.A.T. Industries of Britain.
Analysts and retailers say the planned sales of these stores could hurt consumer confidence. While some shoppers will buy elsewhere, some may simply buy less, they fear. 
 
Steep Discounts Possible
On top of this, other stores are suffering from a cash squeeze. Merchandise they cannot buy has been snapped up at steep discounts by healthier stores that can now sell it at prices 40 percent to 50 percent below normal. Such price cuts could well create a bargain-hunting shopper, which retailers consider an unreliable customer lacking store loyalty.
''It will be a very difficult Christmas selling period,'' asserted Walter F. Loeb, senior analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, New York. ''Consumers will hold back, and the situation will be complicated by considerable price competition in lots of cities. Because of the turmoil in the retail business created by mergers and selloffs,'' he continued, ''suppliers are hard-put and competitive, and they will be offering stores all kinds of brands and discounts, and that will make for a chaotic marketplace.''
For consumers, that all adds up to many opportunities for bargains. Retailers have reduced prices all year, and they are expected to continue. Indeed, the percentage reductions ahead could be higher, analysts said, which could leave shoppers with a reduced choice of goods by late in the season.
 
Traditional Optimism
Despite the uncertainties, retailers voiced traditional optimism over the period ahead, which, for many, is the most important of the year.
''The season has already started and we are optimistic because we have been running about a 9 percent gain in our stores that are at least a year old,'' said Robert E. Lawson, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Gottschalks Inc., Fresno, Calif., which operates 18 department stores and 26 specialty shops.
Despite their recent financial difficulties and delayed merchandise shipments, the Cincinnati-based Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores, also express confidence. The chain, which is owned by Campeau, exceeded third-quarter projected sales growth of 6 percent by an additional percentage point in its ''same stores,'' which is an industry term for stores owned for more than one year. James M. Zimmerman, president and chief operating officer, said he expected the same stores to gain at least 6 percent in the Christmas season, and that chain-wide sales in the period would be up 7.5 percent when the results of four new stores opened this year are included.
''The promotional climate will put pressure on profits, no doubt about it,'' Mr. Zimmerman said, referring to the atmosphere of price cutting, ''but we think our mix of merchandise and the franchise our stores have with the public will more than make up for that.''
 
New Toy Products
For Toys ''R'' Us Inc., the nation's largest toy retailer, based in Rochelle Park, N.J., ''it looks like a good season, partly because there are a lot of good new products on the market,'' said Michael Goldstein, vice chairman. He cited Game Boy, a new hand-held Nintendo video-game device; Tetrus, a Russian spy game, and Oopsy Daisy, a crawling and crying doll introduced last year that has had strong sales all year long. He said he remained optimistic, even though toy industry sales have been flat so far this year.
Nor are toys the only slack area. Three key merchandise categories, men's wear, electronics and household durables, have been slow, a trend, which if continued in the 31-day holiday season, could affect profits significantly.
 
Outlook in New York
In the New York metropolitan area, said the Touche Ross Trade Group, a research organization, retailers have a bleak outlook on the holiday season because of higher labor and overhead costs and sharp price competition.
''The retailers' mood is the most pessimistic we've observed over the last few years,'' said Harvey D. Braun, chairman of the trade group, ''The New York marketplace will be further impacted by retailers' concerns about the so-called troubled retailers in the region,'' he added. ''When you combine consumers' predictions about their holiday shopping plans with retailers creating a promotional environment, Christmas will be a flat season with minimal increases.''
For example, the announced closings of the B. Altman stores and the Alcott & Andrews chain in recent weeks has communicated a sense of unease not only among New York retailers, but also among consumers. As one shopper said this week: ''I put a deposit on a suite of furniture at B. Altman. But I can't get anyone there to tell me if I'll get it back. What can I do?''
Also, for the first time in years Christmas falls on a Monday, and retailers expect fewer last-minute shoppers with Christmas Eve on Sunday, than they would get on a Saturday or weekday.
''Consumers have few unmet material desires after the long United States economic expansion of the 1980's,'' said Sandra Shaber, economist with the Futures Group, a Washington-based economic research organization. ''It's a saturated market, and people are really determined to buy only when there are bargains.''
A good many retailers, apparently measuring these factors, decided to take early action. Many stores around the country began the start of the Christmas shopping season several weeks ago with vigorous price-cutting promotions.
 
Temptation to Slash Prices
''Warm weather slowed the apparel business in much of November, and the new cooler temperatures will show how retail sales perform in more seasonal weather,'' said Bernard Sosnick, senior analyst at the Deutsche Capital Bank, New York. However, many inventories of soft goods have backed up in stores in recent months, ''making retailers nervous,'' he said. ''If the season has a slow start, there will be a great temptation to slash prices and dump merchandise.''
Still, retail executives interviewed remain optimistic, some even ebullient, over seasonal prospects.
''It will be a good season with nothing to change the strong trend we have had so far this year,'' said Stephen Watson, executive vice president of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, Minneapolis, one of the nation's biggest retailers.
Robert J. Tarr, Jr., president of the Neiman Marcus Group, Chestnut Hill, Mass., said that the season ''will be O.K. but not a great one.''
''Consumers outside the major metropolitan areas are demonstrating caution and retailers have been somewhat hurt by the late arrival of imports,'' he said.
 
Double-Digit Gain
Mr. Tarr said that he expects the Neiman Marcus fashion stores to have a 6 percent to 7 percent gain in the season; the company's Bergdorf Goodman to ''enjoy a low-double digit gain,'' and the group's Contempo Casual apparel stores now in 30 states to ''continue to track at high double-digit increases.''
The Home Depot Inc., an Atlanta-based home-improvement chain of 107 stores, hopes for a continuation of the 15 percent gain in same stores it had in the third quarter, said Bernard Marcus, chairman and chief executive. Although the spring, summer and the fall seasons generally have higher sales than the Christmas season, he said, the company finds that it sells more power tools in the ChristConsequently, Home Depot, which is opening its first New York area store in East Meadow, L.I., next week, is attacking traditional gift-giving for men with such advertising lines as: ''Why give him a tie, when you can give him a saw or a drill?'' It works, Mr. Marcus claimed.

HEADLINE: A 'Prime Mover' in U.S. Banking

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Nov. 18

 BODY:
The stakes are mounting each day, but I. A. Long has yet to show any sign of sweaty palms.
Once again, his Southwest Bank of St. Louis has placed an aggressive and highly visible bet on lower interest rates in the expectation that the industry's giants will soon join in. If they do not, the 90-year-old man sometimes called the ''prime mover'' will by the end of the month be suffering one of his rare embarrassments. 
''Ninety percent of the time we have reduced the prime rate, the rest of the banks came along, normally within two weeks,'' said Mr. Long, the courtly, pipe-smoking chairman emeritus of Southwest, who still heads its asset and liability committee. [Pressure on the big banks to join Southwest increased on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve, in a surprise move, sent a signal that traders interpreted as approval for further easing of interest rates. It was right after the Fed last signaled a drop in interest rates in early November that Southwest lowered the prime rate.] Small but Significant Nobody pretends that a $400 million bank with only two offices and 125 employees is putting much pressure on the Citibanks and Morgans of the world, but that does not mean Southwest's Nov. 8 decision to cut the prime rate a half-point, to 10 percent, lacks significance as a harbinger of national interest rates. Moreover, being wrong costs Southwest a few thousand dollars a day as well as inviting fresh charges in the banking fraternity of grandstanding.
But Mr. Long, a lanky 6-foot-3 Virginia native who still spends five days a week at the office, is seldom wrong. In fact, he cannot remember when it last happened, perhaps not since the spring of 1979, when Southwest cut its rate to 11 1/4 percent and was forced to retreat the next month.
Defeat has its compensations, however, mainly in the good will even a temporarily lower rate brings from Southwest's borrowers, mostly small manufacturers and wholesalers in the St. Louis area, which the bank considers a good microcosm of American business.
''It certainly helps our image,'' said Andrew N. Baur, the bank's 45-year-old chairman, who serves on Mr. Long's committee. Southwest's eagerness to be the first to cut the prime - and to be seen as such - is thus ''no gimmick,'' Mr. Baur said, but part of a hardheaded strategy that helps yield the bank a 1.3 percent return on assets and 19 percent return on stockholders' equity.
Indeed, Mr. Long and his colleagues have a number of admirers, including John E. Barnds, first vice president of the $15 billion National Bank of Detroit. ''It's absolutely wonderful advertising at negligible cost,'' he observed.
Mr. Long, who considers himself a banker rather than an economist, pays close attention to traditional indicators like production, employment and inflation in determining Southwest's prime rate, to which about two-thirds of the bank's $315 million loan portfolio is tied. But he is concerned more with trends than with actual figures, and he supplements his trend watching with a hefty dose of intuition.
''We rely on our brains, not the computer,'' said Mr. Long, who began his career in the New York office of the Royal Bank of Canada just after World War I. He also tries to think along with officials at the Federal Reserve - an autographed picture of the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, hangs on the wall of his ground-floor office. It was no coincidence that Southwest's latest cut came immediately after reports that the Fed had conducted a special telephone conference to nudge down the banking system's overnight loan rate.
Although Mr. Long said he would not be surprised if the prime fell below 10 percent by the end of the year, he is a member of the ''soft landing'' school that thinks any near-term recession will be avoided.
Banks use the prime rate as a benchmark for how much to charge on a wide range of loans to consumers and businesses.
If the current cut by Southwest Bank turns out to be one of Mr. Long's infrequent errors, do not count on it attracting much attention. When the bank increases the prime, which it is never the first to do, it does so quietly, Mr. Long said, without any general announcement.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Up on Sign of Fed Easing

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday after the Federal Reserve Board signaled market participants that it might have sanctioned another modest drop in interest rates.
The Fed's action came as a surprise to traders, who were preparing to close their books early in advance of the Thanksgiving holiday.
That notion was temporarily abandoned when the Fed entered the market around 11:30 yesterday morning and aggressively pumped reserves into the banking system.
 
Easing Earlier in Month
At the time of the Fed's move, the closely watched rate for bank loans in the overnight Federal funds market was trading at 8 3/8 percent, or below the 8.50 percent level that analysts believe is the Fed's current equilibrium target. The central bank last eased policy in the first week of November. 
Most money market economists had been expecting that the Fed would either provide a modest amount of reserves or stay out of the market.
''The Fed's move has got a lot of tongues wagging right now,'' said Kristen Foster, a financial market economist at the Citicorp Investment Bank. ''The Fed knew that no one was expecting them to add reserves at this level. I think they are telling the market that it is O.K. for funds to trade at 8 1/4 percent.''
Following the Fed's operation, funds drifted downward until late in the day, when they were trading at 8 1/8 percent.
Analysts said the Fed's move yesterday probably reflected concerns about the current health of the economy. They added, however, that yesterday's report on durable goods orders during October, while weak, was most likely not the statistic that caused the Fed to act.
 
Concern on Layoffs Cited
''More than the durable goods report, it has been recent announcements of more layoffs that are upcoming that prompted this move,'' said Albert J. Gross, chief economist at Refco Inc.
Mr. Gross cited recent separate news reports that the General Motors Corporation and a number of financial services concerns, including Merrill Lynch & Company, the nation's largest, intend to pare their payrolls.
''The significant slowing in the economy is the Fed's most important priority right now,'' Mr. Gross said. ''And the fact that they have now moved to ease policy twice in one month, a very unusual occurrence, is one of the reasons I don't think we are going to go into recession.''
The Fed's move prompted a burst of early-afternoon buying that quickly tapered off as dealers began their preparations for the holiday.
 
Long-Term Bond at 7.87%
In the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds, the 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered late yesterday at a price of 102 27/32, up 1/4 of a point, to yield 7.87 percent.
Prices of shorter-term notes and bills, which are more sensitive to movements in the funds rate, posted gains as big or bigger.
By late in the day, the 8 1/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 102 6/ 32, up 10/32, to yield 7.69 percent, and the 7 5/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100, up 1/4, to yield 7.62 percent.
Treasury bill rates fell sharply in response to the Fed's move. In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.50 percent, down 12 basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bill rates dipped by 11 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.31 percent. And one-year bills were offered at 7.04 percent, down 10 basis points.
In other developments, the BT Securities Corporation, the investment banking subsidiary of the Bankers Trust New York Corporation, yesterday became the first securities subsidiary of a banking company to act as lead manager on a negotiated underwriting since last summer, when the Federal Reserve granted these subsidiaries broader underwriting powers.
BT Securities acted as lead manager of a sale of $100 million worth of Federal funds rate notes for the Chrysler Financial Corporation.
The notes, which mature Dec. 2, 1991, have a floating rate coupon of 0.23 percent above the daily average of the Fed funds rate, paid monthly.
The issue is rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal bonds was very light yesterday, dealers said.
Prices of most corporate issues rose by about 1/8 point. Buying activity was a bit more spirited in the municipal bond market, where market participants reported that prices of most issues rose by anywhere from 1/4 to 3/8 point.

HEADLINE: Survival Is Goal in Eastern Strike

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Almost nine months since beginning a strike against Eastern Airlines, many machinists and flight attendants who have stayed off the job have become deeply concerned about their economic survival.
Even the pilots, whose leaders yesterday voted to end their walkout, will have difficulty resuming their pre-strike lives: the airline says it may not have jobs waiting for them.
Strikers who were receiving unemployment benefits are seeing them expire, and the small weekly allowances provided by the machinists' and flight attendants' unions are falling well short of meeting their members' needs. A little more than 10 percent of the strikers have returned to work; many others - the number is not known - have retired or taken jobs elsewhere, often at far lower pay.
One of the strikers' last hopes of ending the dispute was dashed late Tuesday when President Bush vetoed legislation that would have created a commission to investigate and make recommendations to Congress on how the strike could be settled. The President said Congress had no business interfering in the contract and court disputes over the strike. 
Eastern praised the veto. But George Kourpias, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, noted that President Bush had recently ''embraced the Solidarity union leader in Poland, Lech Walesa, and praised his contribution to democracy.
''His praise for union workers in Poland does not extend to workers in America,'' Mr. Kourpias said.
 
Ideals vs. Financial Need
While for many the issues that led them to the picket lines are still worth fighting for, the need to pay the bills is becoming more pressing.
''I have to try to get something right away,'' said Steve Clundt, an airplane cleaner from Queens who in some years earned $31,000 with overtime at Eastern. ''My auto insurance is due. I have to pay child support.'' Mr. Clundt has not been able to find a job that he thinks pays well enough for him to take. Until several weeks ago he survived on $245 a week from unemployment and $100 a week from the machinists' union. Now the unemployment benefits have run out.
George Ratcliffe, a mechanic with Eastern for 20 years in the Boston area, said his savings ran out a few weeks ago. He had been able to live on the $100 a week he received from the machinists' union and odd jobs he did for neighbors. Massachusetts does not pay striking workers unemployment benefits.
''One hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far,'' he said. He is married and has four children.
Several weeks ago he got a job as a mechanic at a company that does contract maintenance at Boston's Logan International Airport. His salary is about a third less than the $20 an hour he was making at Eastern.
But he said he did not think the strike had failed. ''There is more general awareness of what these corporate raiders do,'' he said.
 
Rebuilding Under Bankruptcy
As the strike drags on, Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of the Texas Air Corporation, which owns Eastern, has been rebuilding the airline under the protection of the Federal Bankruptcy Court, using mostly nonunion workers, some of whom are paid far less than their unionized predecessors.
By using about $1.2 billion raised through the sale of Eastern assets, the airline expects by the end of the year to reach 80 percent of the size it was before the strike began on March 4. It hopes to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings early next year.
As strikers increasingly become forced to take jobs instead of manning picket lines, it will become more difficult for the strike to continue, workers say.
About 1,075 of the 6,000 flight attendants who struck are working again at the airline, which has about 4,000 flight attendants. About 300 of the 9,000 machinists' union members who struck - mechanics, baggage handlers and ramp workers - are now back on the job. The airline now has 2,400 mechanics.
The biggest loss of jobs has been among the ramp workers and baggage handlers, who had earned $15 an hour. Eastern has replaced virtually all of them with contract workers who earn about $6 an hour. The company plans to hire about 1,000 of these workers itself.
 
Weighing the Costs
Some striking Eastern workers have begun to wonder whether the strike was worth the cost. ''Both sides wounded themselves,'' said Mike Opitz, a striking co-pilot.
Mr. Lorenzo and his managers are struggling to rebuild the airline amid the uncertainties that come with bankruptcy. The unions are suffering because many older pilots and other less skilled workers in the machinists' and flight attendants' union are having a tough time getting new jobs.
Some workers did not wait as long as the current strikers before putting their own survival above fighting for the cause.
Many workers, particularly pilots, went back to work in August after some of the leaders of the Air Line Pilots Association declared to their rank and file that the union could no longer achieve its objective of forcing Mr. Lorenzo to sell the airline to an outside investor.
 
First Officer Returns
Among those choosing to return was Peter Clements, a first officer on a Boeing 727. He recalled that he joined the strike after having become convinced that the attitude of Eastern management was destructive and that there was no future at the carrier. Like many others, he hoped the strike would force Mr. Lorenzo to sell the carrier.
Although a sale to a group led by Peter J. Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner, was arranged in April, it fell through, and no other buyer materialized.
When Jack Bavis, the leader of the pilots, told his members on Aug. 4 that there was no chance for another buyer and that the best option was for the pilots to go back to work, ''I realized it was a lost cause,'' Mr. Clements said. ''You have to be able to accept defeat.'' (Mr. Bavis was subsequently recalled by the union's master executive council and replaced by Skip Copeland, who advocated continuing the strike.) Mr. Clements added that to his surprise he had found a marked change in attitude among Eastern managers when he returned to work. ''There is a real commitment to listen to what employees are saying,'' he said.
Mr. Clements said he had been able to make more money than under the old contract because he can now fly 100 hours a month under new work rules instituted by the company instead of 84 under the old rules. He has also been cleared to fly a Lockheed 1011, a bigger jet. He said he now makes about $85 an hour, compared with about $65 an hour before the strike.
 
Handling the Baggage, Too
The trade-off is that he is no longer protected by many of the old work rules. In September he and about 25 other pilots volunteered to load and unload bags from airplanes in Atlanta because the carrier was having problems with manning.
''That could never have happened under the old contract,'' he said.
But workers like Mike Pedano, who was a fueler at La Guardia Airport for 10 years, have little chance of getting back their jobs even if the strike is resolved.
Until several weeks ago Mr. Pedano, who is single, was making ends meet with the $245 a week he got from unemployment benefits, which have now run out.
He has tried to start a business selling small replicas of baseball and football helmets in Long Island bars and flea markets. While he has had some success, his house is filled with boxes of unsold helmets. Meanwhile, the $1,000 he charged on a credit card to pay for them is due.
''I haven't even begun to break even,'' he said. ''My house looks like the locker room for a midget baseball team.''

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Fund Yields Mixed Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market mutual funds surveyed by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed for the week ended yesterday, with tax-exempt funds up and taxables down for the second straight week.
Analysts at Donoghue's said the release of October's Consumer Price Index and durable goods orders earlier this week did not dramatically change the picture of a slowing economy or the outlook for lower rates. Money market funds influenced by Federal Reserve policy on short-term interest rates are also expected to continue to fall. 
Because of the length of time money fund managers hold securities in their portfolios, yields offered by money market funds change less often with daily rate fluctuations compared with certificates of deposit. In a lower rate cycle, money market funds are usually about a month behind the changes of bank C.D.'s.
Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money market mutual fund declined by 2 basis points, to 8.31 percent, while the 30-day yield fell by 4 basis points, to 8.38 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The assets of the taxable funds increased by $4.4 billion, to $361.6 billion. The analysts at Donoghue's said the cash flow into the money market funds might have been spurred by a weak stock market on Monday and by some pension fund managers, who temporarily parked cash in the money funds to lock in profits made this year.
The average days to maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios increased by a day, to 44.
 
Dreyfus Top Return
Among the general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million that are surveyed by Donoghue's, the Dreyfus World Wide Dollar Money Market Fund had the best return, with a yield of 9.26 percent.
Tax-exempt funds this week increased their assets by $300 million, to $70.7 billion, as the average seven-day compounded yield rose by 4 basis points, to 5.68 percent. The taxable equivalent for investors in a 28 percent tax bracket should be 7.88 percent, and for those in a 33 percent bracket, 8.44 percent.
The Evergreen Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund outperformed others in the category, according to Donoghue's. The fund posted a 6.41 percent return, or about 73 basis points better than the average.
By comparison, The Bank Rate Monitor's national index showed that the average yield for a bank money market account was down by a basis point, to 6.37 percent. The index also showed that the average yield for a six-month certificate of deposit was off by 2 basis points, to 8.09 percent.
Certificates with longer maturities were all down by 4 basis points. A one-year certificate fell to 8.12 percent, while two-and-a-half-year and five-year C.D.'s each dropped to 8.05 percent.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 17.49 Points, To 2,656.78

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices rose broadly yesterday in slow pre-Thanksgiving trading. The Dow Jones industrial average finished 17.49 points higher at 2,656.78.
Advances on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered declines by 888 to 565, while volume slipped to 145.7 million shares, from 147.9 million on Tuesday. 
''The market has absorbed a barrage of mixed economic news and 'doom and gloom' prophesies over the last six weeks,'' said Eugene E. Peroni Jr., chief technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.
''The apparent ability of equities to withstand these pressures and show an overall advance over the last five trading days indicates a resilient market tone that should establish a foundation for a formidable year-end rally,'' he added.
 
Pivotal Indicator
The pivotal Dow indicator was ahead about 10 points an hour and a half into the session. It had moved to a 16-point gain by 3:30 P.M. where it leveled off before the final bell.
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.32 points, to 341.91, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 1.16 points, to 189.21.
In economic news, the Commerce Department reported that durable goods orders for October fell a seasonally adjusted six-tenths of 1 percent, a drop far smaller than a 2.1 percent drop expected by many analysts. Large swings in military orders strongly influenced total orders in October and September, the Government said. Traders said the latest results had little impact on stocks.
Among individual issues, Texas Instruments soared 4 3/4, to 36 1/2. Traders said the company's shares rose on optimism over a patent it was awarded for all integrated circuits made, used or sold in Japan. They said the patent could raise the company's revenues by up to $700 million a year in the 1990's.
 
National Semiconductor
National Semiconductor rose 7/8, to 7 3/8. Traders said that a patent in Japan for an invention by a scientist at the Fairchild Corporation, a unit of National Semiconductor, has expired. Speculation that National Semiconductor could benefit from a similar patent spurred the rise in that stock, analysts said.
Cigna dropped 1 1/4, to 64 5/8. The company said it was discussing the possible acquisition of Equicor, a group insurance and managed health-care joint venture owned by the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States and the Hospital Corporation of America.
Merrill Lynch slipped 1/2, to 26 1/8. The company joined an ever-widening list of brokerage firms that have recently reduced their staffs. Merrill said in a letter to its employees that it planned a restructuring and would probably lay off some staff because of intensified competition and increasing risks.
Syntex rose 1 5/8, to 49 5/8, as the stock continued to rise after its report of significantly higher-than-expected earnings for the third quarter.
Among actively traded blue chips, Honeywell dropped a point, to 79 3/4; Philip Morris added 5/8, to 41 3/8; Bristol-Myers gained 1 3/8, 56 1/8, and General Electric rose 1/2, to 60 1/8.
On the American Stock Exchange, the Amex market value index added 0.74, to 371.72, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index rose 1 point, to 455.14.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Lower in New York As Traders Focus on Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar drifted mostly lower in sluggish, choppy trading yesterday, as traders remained preoccupied with the West German mark.
West German markets were closed for the day, and United States and Japanese markets were winding down for Thanksgiving holidays. 
Currency dealers are bullish toward the mark because West Germany may have to raise interest rates to keep its economy from overheating. It is widely believed that West German growth will accelerate as East Germans continue to come into the country.
Higher West German interest rates would raise returns on mark-denominated investments and spur demand for marks.
The dollar was quoted at 1.81275 marks late yesterday in New York, down from 1.81375 on Tuesday. It declined to 143.10 yen, down from 143.55.
In London, the pound rose to $1.5655, from $1.5645. One pound cost $1.56775 in New York, down from $1.56975.
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with Tuesday's late quotes included: 1.6110 Swiss francs, down from 1.6130; 6.1835 French francs, up from 6.1775; 1,337.00 Italian lire, up from 1,336.00, and 1.16875 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16995.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Hits $411.60 an Ounce; Highest Close Since Jan. 3

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold prices surged yesterday for the fourth straight day on New York's Commodity Exchange, where late buying put the market within range of a new high for this year.
Despite some profit taking earlier in the session and a downturn in silver prices, which normally move in tandem with gold, analysts said the gold market's five-week-old rally showed no sign of slackening.
''We're only now starting to reach a new leg of bullish enthusiasm,'' said Fred Demler, metals economist with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
 
Gains of $7.20 to $8.10
Gold settled $7.20 to $8.10 higher, with the contract for delivery in December at $411.60 an ounce and the lightly traded spot contract at $411. The close was the market's highest since Jan. 3, the first trading day of 1989, when the near-month gold contract finished at $413.40.
Silver finished 3.2 cents to 3.8 cents lower, with the December contract at $5.808 an ounce.
About a third of gold's gains occurred in the last half-hour of the session as traders who had earlier taken profits returned as buyers in anticipation of gains today on the European markets. The United States markets will be closed for Thanksgiving.
''I would want to be long, given the recent history of this market,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
Investment demand for gold continues to increase as prices rise and economic uncertainty chases investors from the stock and bond markets, analysts said.
 
Action on Other Market
Livestock and meat futures rallied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
After the close, the Agriculture Department released a monthly cold-storage report showing 40.2 million pounds of frozen pork bellies in warehouses as of Oct. 31. The number was slightly higher than expected.
Live cattle futures settled 0.10 cent to 0.42 cent higher, with December at 76 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.15 cent to 0.30 cent higher, with November at 83.45 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to 0.28 cent higher, with December at 51.25 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 0.20 cent to 0.60 cent higher, with February at 63.25 cents a pound.
Cocoa futures prices sank to new 14-year lows on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, reflecting the large supplies of cocoa. Cocoa settled $19 to $23 lower, with December at $918 a ton.
Energy futures finished mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Heating oil was up sharply after the American Petroleum Institute reported that distillate stocks had unexpectedly dropped 3.14 million barrels last week. Forecasts for frigid weather in the Midwest and the Northeast also spurred buying.
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 14 cents lower, with January at $19.82 a barrel; heating oil was 0.14 cent to 1.15 cents higher, with December at 61.09 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.29 cent lower to 0.10 cent higher, with December at 51.73 cents a gallon.
Soybean futures posted moderate gains on the Chicago Board of Trade. Wheat futures declined slightly while corn was little changed.

HEADLINE: Arnold Bauman, 75, A Former U.S. Judge And Litigation Chief

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK

 BODY:
Arnold Bauman, a former United States District Court judge, a prosecutor and a prominent New York litigator for many years, died of cancer Tuesday night at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 75 years old and lived in Mamaroneck, N.Y.
Mr. Bauman was named to the Federal District Court in Manhattan by President Richard M. Nixon in 1971 and took the bench in January 1972. The move capped a career in which he had served as assistant district attorney in Manhattan, chief of the criminal division of the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan and a member of the Knapp Commission investigating police corruption in New York City.
While on the bench, he presided over the tax-evasion trial of Aniello Dellacroce, a member of the Gambino crime family. He also was the judge at the bank robbery trial of Joanne D. Chesimard and Fred Hilton, reputed members of the Black Liberation Army, and presided at the prosecution of two members of the Jewish Defense League accused of bombing the Manhattan offices of Sol Hurok and Columbia Artists Inc. 
He served at the bribery trial of the New York lawyer Edmund Rosner - a case in which Robert Leuci, later the subject of the film ''Prince of the City,'' was the key witness.
 
Resignation Over Salary
Contending that it was ''economically impossible'' for him to remain on the bench, Mr. Bauman resigned in 1974. Later he remained active in the campaign to increase Federal judicial salaries.
Upon leaving the court, he became head of the litigation department at Shearman & Sterling, then New York's largest law firm. He stepped down from that position in 1985, though he remained a partner at the firm and continued handling cases.
Mr. Bauman was born in Manhattan on July 25, 1914. He attended James Madison High School, St. John's University and the New York University Law School. Upon completing his law studies in 1937, he found his first job as special assistant to Thomas E. Dewey, then New York City's special rackets prosecutor. He became part of the illustrious team of young lawyers known as ''Dewey's Boys.''
Others in the group included Frank Hogan, later District Attorney of Manhattan; Murray Gurfein and Whitman A. Knapp, both later Federal judges in Manhattan; William P. Rogers, President Nixon's Secretary of State, and Charles D. Breitel and Stanley Fuld, both Chief Judges of New York.
 
On District Attorney's Staff
When Mr. Dewey left the post the following year to become District Attorney of Manhattan, Mr. Bauman accompanied him as an assistant.
After four and a half years in the Navy during World War II, from which he was discharged as a lieutenant commander, Mr. Bauman returned to New York in 1945 and spent two years working under District Attorney Hogan. He spent the next four years in private practice and then, in 1951, was named chief counsel of a committee headed by Senator Matthew M. Neely of West Virginia, which investigated crime and police corruption in the District of Columbia.
In 1953 Mr. Bauman was named an assistant United States attorney in Manhattan in charge of the criminal division. Among those he prosecuted were Joseph P. Ryan, former president of the International Longshoremen's Association, who was convicted of taking payoffs in violation of the Taft-Hartley Act.
Mr. Bauman was a past president of the Federal Bar Council, a member of the American College of Trial Lawyers and was active in the City Bar Association in New York.
He is survived by his wife, the former Bernice Rechtman; a daughter, Jane B. Phillips of Berkeley, Calif.; a son, William K., of Van Nuys, Calif., and a grandson.

HEADLINE: Worries About Reaction in U.S., Japanese Assess Investment Policy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Fearful of an American reaction to the recent surge of Japanese acquisitions, business and Government leaders here are reassessing their strategy for investing overseas.
They worry that the door to the United States market may be closing, and in corporate board rooms, Government ministries and in the press, a debate has erupted over how to handle America: whether to ease up on the investment spree in hopes that the furor will pass, or to plunge ahead confident that the United States will decide it can no longer afford to live without Tokyo's money.
The Japanese seem taken aback by the severity of the American reaction which is played back nightly here, often in amplified and alarmist tones.
 
A Favorite Topic
Television talk shows these days frequently take up the topic of whether Japan's latest buying binge is turning the country into a financial pariah, or whether America is reacting to a gut fear that a foreign power, particularly an Asian one, is gaining influence over its economy. 
More than at any time in recent memory, the United States is being portrayed here as an emotional, often irrational ally that foolishly puts its choicest assets on the auction block for quick profit, then blames the buyer for snapping them up. Yotaro Iida, the president of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, seemed to reflect that view when he compared America to a bullying husband who ''tends to behave badly when he is drinking'' but who ''believes that his wife will never leave him.''
Yet the Japanese are concerned that the critical words they hear from American executives, trade officials and man-on-the-street interviews on television may be translated into restrictions on investment in the United States. Last week, a bill was introduced in Congress to limit investment in the United States by any country that has barriers to American investments, an outgrowth of T. Boone Pickens's futile attempt to get seats on the board of a Japanese automotive parts maker in which he is the largest shareholder.
In addition, some American officials have hinted that the United States may be moving toward a far broader interpretation of ''national security'' - the chief rationale for blocking foreign investment at present - to embrace economic matters as well as military defense.
The debate over Tokyo's investment policy represents a new chapter in the long-running economic conflict between the United States and Japan. For a decade, Japan has grown accustomed to seeing other nations take steps to curb Japanese exports. So in the last few years, Japanese industry has shifted to buying and building factories, high-technology companies and property, especially in the United States, rather than shipping goods abroad.
That strategy is deemed good politics, as well as good business, since every Japanese auto plant or building development abroad means more jobs for foreign workers.
Accordingly, many Japanese are now confused by what they hear of American fears about Japan's recent purchases in the United States, which include Columbia Pictures, control of Rockefeller Center, a Houston office complex and a handful of biotechnology and electronics companies.
''It would be one thing if these were hostile takeovers,'' said Makoto Utsumi, the Vice Minister of Finance. ''But I am not aware of a single investment that the United States did not invite, are you?''
Invited or not, Japanese direct investment in American assets has accelerated remarkably in the last couple of years. Direct investment refers to purchases of physical assets, like plants and real estate, as opposed to financial assets, like stocks and bonds. Japan's direct investment in the United States, analysts estimate, will reach a total of $75 billion by the end of this year, up 40 percent since 1988 and double the level just two years ago.
The Japanese investment position in America still trails that of Britain, but Japan is catching up quickly. Last year alone, Japan's investment in the American manufacturing sector, for example, increased by $7 billion, more than its total investment in American manufacturing in the previous four decades. Japanese investment in American real estate nearly doubled last year, while spending to acquire and set up banking and finance operations boomed as well.
 
Contradictions Are Seen
The Japanese reaction is heavily influenced by the fact that the voices it hears from America are almost all angry ones. Television here has shown Mr. Pickens, the Texas investor, declare that a six-month moratorium should be imposed on Japanese investment in the United States. Mr. Pickens has been frustrated in his attempts to get seats on the board of the Japanese company, the Koito Manufacturing Company.
Japanese television viewers have also seen Lee A. Iacocca, the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, telling an American interviewer, ''I just can't believe that we are sitting here going into debt more and more every day, and let the Japanese buy Rockefeller Center.'' The Japanese attitude toward America, he said, is ''we're better than you guys are, and you better make up your minds and roll over and play dead.''
The American reaction strikes many Japanese as xenophobic, so much so that recently the United States Ambassador to Japan, Michael H. Armacost, began cautioning Japanese audiences against ''thinly veiled suggestions that criticism reflects racism.'' Such a view, ''deflects criticism from the real sources of concern,'' he said.
Those concerns, he said, are the slowness of Japanese companies that have American operations to put Americans in management positions, hire minorities or give local producers a chance to compete with Japanese suppliers.
 
Attempt to Ease Tensions
Such talk has come as a surprise to some people here because Japanese industry has long assumed, with encouragement from the Government, that investment in the United States would ease tensions by diminishing the trade deficit, thus reducing the pressure on Japan to import more.
Moreover, such investments deepen the web of interconnections between the two economies, sometimes creating jobs and often pumping Japanese capital back into American industry.
Some believe that strategy is still sound and that Congress will balk at placing restrictions on Japanese investment once it understands the economic consequences.
One possible consequence has been called Japan's ''second strike capability,'' a term that is gaining currency in the Japanese business world. The phrase has nothing to do with nuclear weapons; it refers to scenarios in which Japan responds to a closing of the American market by reducing its financing of the United States budget deficit and its private corporate borrowing. The result could be a sharp rise in interest rates and perhaps a recession.
A signficant concern among the Japanese is the possible broadening of the ''national security'' restriction on foreign acquisitions in the United States, beyond military contracting industries.
 
Warning From a Regulator
Several weeks ago the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Gerald E. Corrigan, hinted during a conference with Japanese executives here that the United States may begin reviewing foreign acquisition of banks in cases in which a country ''has an over-concentration of assets.'' That was seen as a clear reference to the fact that Japanese institutions now control about a quarter of all the bank assets in California.
Yoshitoki Chino, the chairman of Daiwa Securities, one of Japan's biggest securities houses, quickly agreed. ''We have to be careful about a financial overpresence,'' he said.
Mr. Armacost, while telling the Japanese that their money is still welcome under most circumstances, said recently that the Sony Corporation's $3.4 billion acquisition of Columbia Pictures last month ''has broadened the debate to include the potential loss of valuable cultural assets.''
Elliot L. Richardson, a former Cabinet official often hired by Japan, is telling Japanese clients that new rules promulgated by the Treasury Department ''cover far more transactions than necessary.''
The rules involve the Exon-Florio Amendment to the Defense Production Act, which gives the President the right to block foreign investments that threaten national security. The Treasury's rules are written so broadly, Mr. Richardson says, that they could cover joint ventures, minority stakes in companies and the acquisition of one overseas company by another if either had a United States subsidiary.
So far, the Bush Administration has interpreted the law narrowly. No foreign acquisitions have actually been denied, though some companies have dropped out of bidding contests and, in one recent case, an American company was forced to relinquish a contract to make triggers for nuclear weapons before the company could be acquired.
Some Japanese companies say the prospect of intense Government scrutiny has already deterred them from making acquisitions in areas that might raise new concerns.
 
Government Urges Caution
The Japanese Government itself seems divided on whether it should help suppress overseas investment, and the result has been a set of mixed signals. The Government has informally advised companies here to ''use caution,'' but that has been interpreted to mean that companies should avoid attention-getting acquisitions, like buying military contractors or well-known properties. When the Mitsubishi Estate Company bought control of the Rockefeller Center Group last month, that advice was apparently ignored.
In recent weeks, however, the debate has begun to take a new turn, focusing less on what Japan buys and more on how Japanese companies act once they are operating in the United States.
The criticism heard most often is that few Japanese subsidiaries in the United States are really run like American companies, with American decision-making and American senior executives. An official Japanese study done last year said that of Japanese-affiliated companies operating in the United States 85 percent of them were run by a Japanese chief executive. Only about 20 percent of American-affiliated companies in Japan were run by Americans.
 
A Promise From Sony
Sony seemed particularly sensitive to this point when it purchased CBS Records early last year and Columbia Pictures last month. ''You won't see a lot of Japanese faces going through the door,'' promised Akio Morita, Sony's chairman.
But such assurances seem difficult to keep once management problems set in. Last week, the Bridgestone Corporation, which purchased Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in March 1988, said its chairman, Teiji Eguchi, would move to Akron, Ohio, next year to ''expedite decision-making within North America.'' The move was widely interpreted by analysts here as reflecting dissatisfaction with the company's American managers.

HEADLINE: China's Frontier: The Search for Development

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LANZHOU, China

 BODY:
This is the ''other China,'' a land of poor peasants and occasional smokestacks, where for some households upward mobility means nothing more grand than moving out of their cave and into a house.
As China develops, the caves are giving way to brick or mud homes, and most people in northwestern China have basic clothing and enough food to eat. But there is still none of the sense of economic vibrancy and rapid change that permeates the coastal areas of southeast China.
The peasants here in Gansu Province earn an average of just $100 a year, the lowest of any province in China. Their basic needs have mostly been met, but economists and other analysts say that the people of Gansu have probably benefited less than other Chinese from the restructuring of the last decade. 
''In recent years, the country has had a policy of regional favoritism,'' said Chai Zhuqing, an official of the provincial planning commission. ''The coastal areas developed very quickly, with the help of the state and foreign investors. But we're in the hinterland, with long distances to transport goods.''
A recent survey suggested that the gap between China's rich and poor areas is continuing to grow. In the first half of this year, the survey found, per capita incomes of peasants were $49 higher than a year earlier in southern Guangdong Province, the wealthiest part of the country. In the poorest parts, like Gansu and Tibet, incomes grew by just $5, compared with those of a year earlier.
''The gaps have increased and I can't see that trend changing anytime soon,'' Nicholas Lardy, a China scholar at the University of Washington, said in a telephone interview. Professor Lardy said that the central government is no longer redistributing resources among regions the way it once did, and that this will limit Gansu's ability to bridge the gap.
Under Mao, China's economic planners milked rich areas such as Shanghai for the benefit of other parts of the country. The planners also tried to build up the industrial capacity of the interior, partly for national security reasons, so that the country could continue to produce if it were attacked.
Even so, China's industry is geographically lopsided. Of the nation's 500 largest industrial enterprises, 111 are either in Shanghai or in northeastern Liaoning Province, while only 25 are in the six provinces and autonomous regions of China's west.
The Government in recent months has expressed increased concern about the plight of the hinterland, and there is no longer as much conviction as there used to be that some areas should get rich first and then spread the wealth to the interior. But there is still not much of an economic strategy for China's interior.
''Opening the door on the northwest frontier'' read the headline of a front-page editorial in the semi-official China Economic News last month, but the article contained few specific ideas for how to develop the frontier. While rich in mineral resources, the northwest lacks the entrepreneurial tradition of coastal areas, as well as their wealth of overseas relatives and other links.
The People's Daily and other official publications have recently called for developing overland trade with other Asian countries and even rebuilding a ''land bridge'' to Europe. This revived form of the old Silk Route will take shape around the end of next year when China completes a rail link across its northwestern border with the Soviet rail system.
Officials here in Gansu Province are optimistic that the rail link will allow them to export their products to European ports, so that Gansu too can participate in the opening to the outside world that has left the coastal region so flush with wealth.
Much of China is now alarmed at the prospect of recession, because of an economic retrenchment, but Gansu seems less worried. In September, industrial production in the province was 8 percent higher than a year earlier, while in cities such as Shanghai production actually fell. Officials note that the local economy was never particularly overheated, so the slowdown will not be very painful.

HEADLINE: Diplomats at Japan's Embassy Worry About Anti-Tokyo Sentiment in U.S.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
The Japanese Embassy here is modest, quiet and plain. The unadorned three-story building on a tree-lined street does not look like the outpost of an economic superpower.
Its appearance gives no hint of the anxiety inside, where diplomats worry about anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States. Nor does it give any clue to the intense struggles among diplomats representing different agencies of the Tokyo Government.
What follows is a snapshot of life inside the embassy, a world seldom penetrated by American visitors. Other nations maintain large, active embassy staffs in Washington, but the Japanese have a style all their own, characterized by a passion for detailed information, a willingness to work around the clock and a combination of modesty and politeness that often disarms American officials. 
J. Michael Farren, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, said Japanese diplomats ''often sidestep confrontation by conducting themselves with great politeness and formality, so it's very difficult to get mad at them.''
''As a U.S. Government official,'' he said, ''I grudgingly admire their effectiveness. They have done a phenomenally good job of serving Japanese interests by calming the waters at key times so there will be only a minimal U.S. response to trade problems with Japan.''
The embassy has become increasingly important as dozens of disputes strain the vast web of relations between the two nations. It serves as the hub of Japanese efforts to track American policy, to monitor the American economy and to influence decisions by the executive branch and Congress, which can have an immense effect on ties between Tokyo and Washington.
 
A Hard-Working, Well-Educated Staff
Japanese diplomats delve into the remotest corners of the Federal bureaucracy, assiduously cultivate mid-level officials, extract information, line up allies in the United States Government and deftly deflect pressure on Japan to change its trade practices or other policies. While Congressional criticism of Japan is common, it rarely results in concrete legislative or executive action against Tokyo.
Operating in orbit around the embassy are a bevy of lawyers, lobbyists and consultants whose activities are, from time to time, influenced or coordinated by the embassy. At the center of this network is a team of career diplomats led by Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga, who has just wound up a four and a half-year assignment here.
Embassy employees normally start at 9:30 A.M. and often work past midnight. Shinichi Nishimiya, the first secretary for economic affairs for the last three years, said that as he returned to his home in suburban Bethesda, Md., he often passed commuters driving in the opposite direction just before dawn.
Nearly all the senior diplomats at the Japanese Embassy have graduate degrees from Harvard, Yale or Princeton, and a few studied in England, at Oxford or Cambridge. They include some of the best of Japan's professional bureaucrats and diplomats. They come not only from the Foreign Ministry but also from the Finance Ministry and the powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
After years in which they insisted that there were no serious problems between Japan and the United States, senior diplomats at the embassy now speak with a sense of foreboding, a premonition that relations between Tokyo and Washington may deteriorate before they improve.
''The perception of the American public that Japan is a potential threat to the well-being of the United States is alarming and problematic,'' said Koji Tsuruoka, a first secretary in the embassy's political section. ''That is something that worries us, regardless of whether it is right or wrong.''
The deputy chief of mission, Yoshio Karita, who polished his English while studying politics and economics at Oxford 30 years ago, said: ''The fact that we have been able to settle all problems in the past shows the degree of efficiency with which this embassy functions. But the problems are becoming chronic, more aggravated and serious.''
With about 200 employees, the embassy is Japan's largest. The State Department lists 103 people with diplomatic rank and privileges at the embassy. Saudi Arabia has 116, Israel has 42 and the Soviet Union 118.
Outsiders often see the embassy as a monolith, but employees say there are intense intramural rivalries, reflecting the different priorities of the Government ministries for which they work. If, for example, a commercial officer gets an advance copy of a Congressional report on a pending trade bill, he may send the text to Tokyo before the political section has a chance to see it.
The deep-seated rivalries among Japanese agencies give the diplomats a keen appreciation for disagreements among Federal agencies here. Michael B. Smith, who served as deputy trade representative in the Reagan Administration, said Japanese diplomats were eager ''to find inconsistencies in the positions of different U.S. agencies and to drive a wedge in there.''
 
Different Messages From Different Agencies
Nathaniel B. Thayer, a professor of Japanese studies at Johns Hopkins University, said, ''Each Japanese ministry and agency has its own representation in Washington.'' The rivalry among units of the embassy is so intense that Administration officials and Congressional aides say they are sometimes confused about the position of the Japanese Government.
''The Foreign Ministry tells me something different from what the Construction Ministry tells me,'' said Jamie Boucher, an aide to Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska. ''There is a myth of a homogenized Japanese negotiating position. But much as we have interagency spats in our foreign and trade policy, it's the same at the Japanese Embassy. This creates confusion about where the embassy stands on any given issue.''
The embassy is an elaborate information-gathering machine. A State Department official said: ''The Japanese diplomats build up mounds and mounds of facts and detail. Like a vacuum cleaner, they suck it up wherever they can. Sometimes they come to the State Department and ask: 'How do you decide what's real? How do you analyze it?' They are better at collecting information than at analyzing it.''
Mr. Smith, the trade negotiator, recalled that Japanese diplomats ''sometimes repeated a question four times just to make sure you gave the same answer.'' Such aggressive curiosity irritates some American officials, but Mr. Smith said: ''It made our job a lot easier. The worst thing is to go into negotiations and have big surprises.''
A half-dozen Americans work at the embassy as ''senior clerks,'' helping Japanese diplomats analyze political trends, economic policy-making and legislative developments in the United States. The clerks include Kate Taylor, who used to work for the National Republican Senatorial Committee; John Tobe, former Midwest political coordinator for the Democratic National Committee, and Luanne M. Chapman, a former aide to Representative Thomas J. Ridge, Republican of Pennsylvania.
''The Japanese are very detail-oriented,'' said Ms. Chapman, who prepares a weekly report on Congressional activity. ''They are eager to know the nitty-gritty details of the legislative process.''
 
Links With Congress And Private Sector
Members of Congress often denounce Japan as an unfair trader, express alarm about Japanese investment in the United States and prod the Bush Administration to pry open Japanese markets. But behind the scenes there is a cordial, steady exchange of views between members of Congress and Japanese diplomats.
Each month a half-dozen Congressional aides meet with a half-dozen people from the embassy to discuss trade and other issues. The luncheons are arranged by Steven R. Saunders, a trade consultant retained by the embassy. In 1981 and 1982, Mr. Saunders was the assistant United States trade representative for Congressional relations and public affairs.
More than 120 law firms, lobbying groups and public relations companies have registered with the Justice Department as agents of Japanese companies, but only 12 report working directly for the embassy. They include Mike Masaoka, who publishes a newsletter for the embassy every two weeks; H. William Tanaka, a trade lawyer, and Allan S. Mostoff, a former official of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who has advised the embassy for 12 years on the intricacies of S.E.C. regulations.
Mr. Farren, the Under Secretary of Commerce, said the embassy ''makes good use of the private sector'' to multiply its message on selected issues. For example, he said, in 1987, when Congress was considering legislation to punish the Toshiba Corporation for selling restricted technology to the Soviet Union, the embassy was like ''a coach on the sidelines,'' urging Japanese companies to lobby against the sanctions.
''You often get a cohesive story line out of the whole Japanese community here,'' Mr. Farren said. ''The Japanese Embassy does a good job of coordinating it.''
The embassy enhances its influence through several outposts loosely affiliated with the Tokyo Government. The embassy finances the Japan Economic Institute, a research center that compiles statistics and publishes weekly reports. Under a contract signed in April, the embassy is paying the institute $863,239 this year and is entitled to supervise its activities.
 
Trade Ministry Has Strong Role
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which often gets credit for engineering Japan's postwar economic achievements, has three diplomats at the embassy here. In theory, all report to Nobutoshi Akao, the embassy's economic minister, who holds a master's degree in international relations from Yale. But he said they often bypassed him and sent reports directly to ministry headquarters in Tokyo.
The ministry, known as MITI, also supervises the Japan External Trade Organization, or Jetro, a commercial intelligence service with offices in New York and six other American cities. Jetro says its main functions are to conduct market research and to promote imports into Japan. In fact, American officials say that several employees of the New York office are high-powered special emissaries from MITI who operate outside normal diplomatic channels.
The emissaries include Hajime Furuta and Nobuyuki Kodaira, who have registered with the Justice Department as Jetro researchers. But on their business cards, each is identified as a ''special representative'' of MITI. An American official said they had been ''very active in Washington, hobnobbing with the State Department, the Defense Department and the American trade representative during talks on semiconductors, steel and other sensitive issues.''
MITI's top man at the Japanese Embassy is Eiichi Ono, the commercial minister, who has a master's degree from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
When asked to describe his relationship to the MITI office in New York, Mr. Ono laughed and said: ''The division of labor is unclear. Theoretically and organizationally speaking, MITI does not have its direct representatives in the United States. My Government operates on the principle that foreign policy should be a unified policy and should be conducted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.''
''Before World War II,'' Mr. Ono said, ''the military conducted its own independent diplomacy outside the Foreign Ministry, and that led to disaster.''

HEADLINE: Flint Journal;
G.M.'s Company Town Goes on Downhill Drive

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich.

 BODY:
This is a city with a dependency problem, one that is destroying livelihoods, forcing people from their homes and contributing to pervasive crime.
The addiction has nothing to do with cocaine, although plenty of that can be found here too. The dependency, for better and for worse, is on the General Motors Corporation, which has been the biggest employer here for half a century.
Flint is the birthplace of General Motors and the biggest G.M. company town in the world. It is also ground zero for unemployed auto workers, a growing subclass of the nation's jobless. 
The unemployment stems from American makers' shrunken share of the automobile market. General Motors has produced about a million and a half fewer cars annually in the last decade than it did in the late 1970's. That has meant the shutdown and consolidation of dozens of plants all over the country. Flint has borne the brunt of this retrenchment: employment here has fallen from a peak of about 80,000 in numerous plants scattered around the city to just over 50,000.
''We have depended on G.M., all of us,'' said Shirley Prater, community service director for Local 599 of the United Automobile Workers. ''We never knew they would shut down so much.''
This year Ms. Prater has counseled 3,890 families of unemployed G.M. workers on matters like eviction, attempted suicide, lack of food, lack of money for heat and electricity. ''The people sit back,'' she said, ''and they wait and wait, thinking G.M. will come back. And then everything is gone.''
Some jobs are available here, but for nowhere near the wages that workers earned in the auto plants. And while General Motors provides job training benefits to those whose plants are shut permanently, the benefits go only so far in easing the transition to a new life.
Marcia McGee, a G.M. spokeswoman here, compared the once-perennial certainty of getting work at G.M. to ''an entitlement program, not unlike government entitlement programs.''
''But G.M. has been very direct,'' she said. ''We've told many people, 'Your jobs are never coming back.' ''
Flint has recently acquired a bit of national notoriety as the setting for ''Roger and Me,'' a documentary film by a native of the city, Michael Moore. In a humorous but unflattering way, the film explores the troubles of Flint and the auto maker and how they are being addressed by politicians, economic development officials and G.M. management, particularly Roger B. Smith, the company's chairman. ''Roger and Me'' - the title refers to Mr. Smith - received wide acclaim when it played at film festivals last month, and Warner Brothers has bought it for commercial distribution.
Understandably, officials of the city and the company are not pleased at the prospect that national movie audiences will be entertained at Flint's expense. From the reviews they've read, they say, the film sounds as if it offers a distorted picture of their hometown. The Mayor, Matthew S. Collier, believes a G.M.-bashing movie can only jeopardize efforts to persuade the auto maker to expand its activities. Still, the company did recently open a new engineering center here that will employ 1,500 on the site of an old Fisher body plant that hired 7,000 in its heyday and 3,300 when it closed in December 1987.
Mr. Collier's tack has been to rebut Mr. Moore's film by accentuating the positive aspects of the G.M. relationship. True, he concedes, the unemployment rate is high, 12 percent, virtually all of it accounted for by laid-off auto workers. But it is half the rate of a few years ago, when G.M. shut the Fisher and other plants. And while the crime rate is also bad, the Mayor said, it has been improving for almost two years.
''We've got six campuses, including a campus of the University of Michigan and over 23,000 students enrolled,'' the Mayor said. ''We've got some great assets. But we're looking for some niche. We're almost groping for it, quite candidly.''
For the moment, as short-term relief, Mr. Collier wants G.M. to attract automotive suppliers and allied automotive trades. For the longer term, ''I'm committed to diversification,'' he said. ''People shouldn't get the lackadaisical attitude that G.M. is always going to come back.''

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Changing World Implies Changes for the G.O.P.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
It is beginning to dawn on many Republicans that the changing world order and a shifting public sentiment could spell major political problems for their party.
Republican electoral success over the last decade has been built on two basic promises: a strong defense against Soviet expansion abroad and reduced government to promote economic expansion at home. Both seem to be running out of steam as voting issues.
It is hard to fight the evil empire when the empire is quickly taking itself apart. Support for military spending is crumbling even faster than the Berlin Wall. That alone is causing Republicans a major readjustment - and internal divisions, as the Bush Administration tries to get ahead of public opinion and conservatives warn against making too many cuts too fast. 
But for all the political problems posed by the cold-war thaw, the economy threatens double trouble. If it stalls out, as many economists believe it is about to, President Bush and other Republican candidates will suffer. Meanwhile, even if the recovery goes on, political analysts and Republican poll takers see problems.
Voters have begun to take for granted basic stability, economic and geopolitical, and are looking now at problems that pound relentlessly at the quality of life in America: drugs, the compromising of the environment, the homeless, even the state of roads and bridges.
All this creates a new political playing field on which the Democrats should have better footing, if they can avoid tripping on their laces again.
Republicans say their Presidential administrations deserve credit for the disintegration of the Soviet empire and the longest economic recovery of the postwar period. Perhaps so. But they know, too, that voters don't reward past success so much as they weigh the chances of future fulfillment.
The point has not been missed at Republican headquarters or at the White House. Mr. Bush is moving with uncharacteristic swiftness to prepare cuts in the military budget. It is true that this will free billions of dollars for him to offer for domestic desires. But Democrats should have less trouble going toe to toe with Republicans on how to spend domestic dollars than they have had during the years when Pentagon spending was the top priority.
The trouncing of Republicans at the polls this month was at first attributed to bad candidates, bad campaigns and the power of a single issue, abortion, which came up suddenly in midseason. Now some Republicans are detecting deeper problems.
Kevin Phillips, a Republican analyst celebrating the 20th anniversary of his book ''The Emerging Republican Majority,'' says he thinks that the Republican coalition assembled two decades ago is coming unraveled, that the glue holding New York investment bankers in the same party as evangelical Christians in Texas is coming loose.
Mr. Phillips recognizes that it is dangerous to prognosticate from the scattered elections of an off-off year. Yet he sees an important trend. Republicans are misreading the 1988 election, he suggests: rather than gloating over their fifth victory in the last six Presidential contests, they should consider 1988 as an election ''they could have lost.''
And this month's defeats drove home the point. ''What the Nov. 7 returns do forecast,'' he said, ''is that some issues the Democrats harnessed in 1989 - from abortion to the environment - should be effective again next year, while the G.O.P.'s flag, crime and tax approach is showing signs of staleness.''
So a warning cry is beginning to go out. Vice President Dan Quayle told the Republican Governors Association last week that the party could no longer rely on its old issues for future success. A new message is needed, he said, one that says Republicans are ready to deal with the nation's social problems without resurrecting big government. His suggestion, prepared for delivery to the League of Cities next Monday: ''If we go to the 90's as an aggressive reform party, inspired by the principles of opportunity and responsibility, I think we'll become the majority Republican Party.''
That may or may not be the Republicans' new message. But they increasingly understand they need one.

HEADLINE: NO RISE IS FOUND IN VOLUNTARISM

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
Despite President Bush's emphasis on the ''thousand points of light'' and the community service they symbolize, the level of charitable giving and volunteering has not increased measureably, a new Gallup Poll shows.
''It may be too early to see a trend or the message may not be getting through to people,'' said Dr. Diane Colasanto, a sociologist who is senior vice president of the Gallup Organization.
But the Bush Administration says the public seems responsive to the President's appeal. ''Our sense in the Administration is there is an increase in the number of Americans willing and ready to respond to community needs by serving others,'' said Clark Ervin, associate director of policy for the White House Office of National Service. 
The President proposed the concept of community help in a campaign speech and developed it in his Inaugural Address, likening community organizations to ''a thousand points of light, spread like stars throughout the nation, doing good.'' Mr. Ervin said the White House plans to establish a ''Thousand Points of Light Foundation'' early in 1990 to encourage community service.
 
Slow Rise in Volunteers
The poll found that the level of voluntarism is about the same now as it was before the President took office. The 41 percent in the latest poll who said they were involved in ''charity or social service activities'' was statistically indistinguishable from the 39 percent measured by Gallup in December 1987.
The Gallup Organization began questioning Americans about their charitable habits 10 years ago. Polls since then showed the number of people working without pay in their communities has tended to increase gradually, Dr. Colasanto said. ''But we found no evidence of an increase since the poll two years ago.''
In the present poll, 1,230 people age 18 and older were questioned by telephone from Nov. 9 to Nov. 12 in a nationally representative sampling. The margin of sampling error for the poll was plus or minus three percentage points.
The report found 7 in 10 people said they contributed money to a charitable organization in the last 12 months and 6 in 10 gave money to their church that was earmarked for charitable activities. Seventy-four percent of those interviewed said they donated food, clothing or other property to organizations helping the needy.
Four in 10 reported they did unpaid volunteer work for charities in the last 12 months, with the average worker giving 6 hours in the past month. Eighty-four percent said they gave money, time or property directly to a person in need, not through an organization. About half said they helped a needy relative, neighbor or friend, and a third said they gave directly to a homeless person.
The Gallup survey found that people who attend churches or synagogues were more likely to be involved in charity. Non-whites were more likely to give personal assistance to needy people than whites.
 
Effort to Change Behavior
The responses on giving and volunteering are consistent with a poll also done by Gallup in March 1988 for the Independent Sector, the country's largest philanthropic coalition of foundations, corporations and nonprofit organizations. In 1987 the coalition began its ''Give Five Campaign'' to encourage Americans to contribute 5 percent of their income and five hours a week to volunteering.
In cities where early and intensive drives in the campaign have been conducted, there has been a substantial increase in giving and volunteering, said Virginia A. Hodgkinson, vice president for research for the Independent Sector. ''But giving and volunteering campaigns have to be seen as long-term undertakings,'' she said. ''You don't change behavior patterns quickly.''
According to recent polls in the Denver area, the first area to report on its progress, annual household donations to charitable causes increased from $715 in 1986, when the drive began, to $815 two years later. The level of volunteering did not change significantly, but 77 percent of Denver residents questioned in 1986 said they favored volunteering as against 91 percent this year.
Both the Independent Sector survey and the recent Gallup poll found a correlation between giving and volunteering: givers volunteer and volunteers are givers.
 
Women Give More Time
The new Gallup study concluded that women give more time and property to organized charities. Forty-five percent of the women interviewed said they were involved in some unpaid volunteer work in the last year, while only 38 percent of the men volunteered.
The implication for charities as more women join the labor force is that they will have to adjust their schedules to attract volunteers, Dr. Colasanto said. Many offices looking for volunteers have discovered they have to stay open evenings, she said.
More young people are also volunteering as some high schools and colleges require them to serve in the community.
''What we sense is a potential for people to increase giving,'' Dr. Colasanto said. ''Almost everyone is involved now and helping in many different ways, giving their time, money, food and clothing to people in need. A well-directed appeal should be able able to build on this commitment.''

HEADLINE: Hot Air and the White House Effect

 BODY:
Fearful that waste gases may alter the world's climate, European countries have proposed a deadline for limiting worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide. The Bush Administration was heavily criticized when it resisted that idea at a recent international conference. The criticism is partly deserved: despite President Bush's campaign pledges, Washington is still months away from developing a policy on global warming. 
But the White House has reason to hesitate. The computer models that predict global warming are still rudimentary. The President's science adviser, Allan Bromley, was chided when he said the models' predictions keep changing. But because of the vast economic consequences of setting a limit on carbon dioxide emissions, Dr. Bromley has a particular duty to keep the argument honest.
The forecasts of global warming will remain uncertain for several years. But there's every reason to take the greenhouse effect extremely seriously. Computer models aside, the earth's climate has been closely related to the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over the last 60,000 years, as judged by ice cores from Antarctica.
Carbon dioxide is increasing steadily, and a warming effect seems inevitable at some stage. When proof of the warming finally arrives, the climate will already be locked into a significant temperature rise, one that could alter crop patterns and sea level. Washington should already be taking out insurance. Banning coal-fired electric plants would be a drastic remedy. But there are many actions to reduce carbon dioxide that are worth taking for other reasons. Chief among these reasons is the need to improve energy efficiency.
The United States still uses energy recklessly compared with Europe and Japan. In America, oil is very cheap; abroad, it is heavily taxed, inducing conservation. The fear of greenhouse warming alone might not yet justify a carbon-based tax or a tax on oil or gasoline, since such levies would curb economic growth. But there are other compelling arguments for such a tax.
A tax on gasoline, for example, would reduce dependence on foreign oil and the military costs associated with keeping the oil flowing. Each cent of a gas tax would produce about $1 billion in revenues, funds that could be used to reduce the Federal deficit.
The Administration's greenhouse insurance plan also ought to include incentives for forms of energy that don't produce carbon dioxide, like solar and a new generation of safe nuclear power plants. The Departments of Energy and Transportation are both working on energy policies, but separately and with no apparent sense of urgency.
''Those who think we're powerless to do anything about the 'greenhouse effect' are forgetting about the 'White House effect.' As President, I intend to do something about it.'' So said Mr. Bush during his campaign. Do what? ''In my first year in office, I will convene a global conference on the environment at the White House . . . We will talk about global warming . . . And we will act.''
Mr. Bush hasn't met, talked or acted. His environmental chief, William Reilly, gave a nod last week to the idea of a global conference. But nods and nonchalance will not redeem Mr. Bush's greenhouse pledge. A gas tax, if Mr. Bush could but reconsider his no-taxes pledge, would ease the deficit, enhance national security and buy serious insurance against the possibility of global warming.

HEADLINE: East German Change Owes No Thanks to Us

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In responding to the remarkable changes in East Germany, American politicians and news commentators have reveled in self-delusion and unwarranted self-congratulation. As a result, the American people have been shielded from a more genuine understanding of the events leading to the collapse of the Berlin Wall and beyond.
It is ironic and arrogant that the United States should claim credit for prompting East Germany's move toward democracy. But except for the positive United States participation in the 1971 four-power agreement on Berlin, the American impact on East Germany has been marginal. United States actions have more often served to retard than to advance the course of East German reform. 
Without exception, periods of United States bellicosity toward Central Europe have encouraged repressive measures against East Germans, interrupted the drive for economic progress and seriously undermined the fervent efforts of reform elements within the East German Communist Party. The reformers are winning -despite the many obstacles created by American intransigence.
For more than a decade, reformist ranks have been growing in East Germany. By the mid-1980's, a broad segment of responsible party members, leaders in many segments of public life, had created an agenda for reform. Mikhail S. Gorbachev's bold vision for the Soviet Union and his hopeful assessment of change in Hungary and Poland provided vital moral support. Yet it took the daring and spontaneous street demonstrations to sweep away the braking mechanism personified by Erich Honecker and his small clique of cold war veterans.
The changes under way may well be a victory for democracy. But since we can scarcely claim to own this notion, we cannot claim victory for America. Nor is it a victory for capitalism. East Germans know too well the dark side of capitalism, and they watch with dismay the careless Hungarian rush toward capitalism, with its surge of inequality, its bag ladies, its working-class husbands needing two jobs just to stay even with rising prices.
The new leaders and the people of East Germany have no intention of following Hungary, much less Poland or the Soviet Union. Nor do they intend to follow West Germany, much less the United States. There is a dogged self-assurance that leads East Germans to believe that they can chart a middle way. If there is a model to follow, it is Sweden - only a Sweden with a socialist, not a capitalist, foundation. An enlightened welfare state, with a peaceful and neutral role in world affairs.
We are witnessing the East German people's victory. Let us congratulate them, not further delude ourselves.
If there is one Western statesman who merits our acclaim and the gratitude of the East German people, it is not George Bush or Helmut Kohl -and certainly not Ronald Reagan. It is the courageous former Mayor of West Berlin, Willy Brandt. As the West German Foreign Minister in 1965 and as Chancellor in 1969, Brandt created the accommodating ''Eastern policy.''
Later known as ''transformation by drawing near,'' Brandt's policy relied less on threats and more on rewards and patience toward his East German counterparts. As a result, the Berlin Wall first cracked open in 1972, and contacts have grown ever since. The result was not to weaken East Germany, but to strengthen its most progressive internal forces.
It has been suggested that the Berlin Wall be preserved as a monument to the folly of Adolf Hitler and the folly of two generations of cold warriors. I see a Berlin Wall, with its gates flung open, as a fitting tribute to Willy Brandt.

HEADLINE: It Was a Prosperous Summer on the Jersey Shore

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Business along the New Jersey shore rebounded sharply last summer after a slump in the previous two years caused by reports of medical waste on bathing beaches and garbage slicks floating offshore, a new study reports.
About 5.7 million people visited the shore between Memorial Day and Labor Day, slightly fewer than the six million who vacationed in 1987 but far more than the 4.8 million who showed up in 1988, when public confidence was at its lowest.
The study released by the state's Division of Travel and Tourism said vacationers spent $7.4 billion this year, a 37 percent increase over the $5.4 billion last year and higher than the $6.2 billion spent in 1987. The biggest increases were for rentals of rooms and for gifts and souvenirs. 
 
Back From the Dead
''We've come back further than we had any right to hope,'' Gov. Thomas H. Kean said. ''We can report the resuscitation of an area that many had given up for dead.''
The Governor said, however, that overdevelopment along the shore could bring a return of pollution problems, and he used a meeting with reporters in his office to call again for enactment of legislation to control growth along the beachfront.
''If we don't do something to control the construction of condominiums along the coast,'' Mr. Kean said, ''the future won't be as sunny as the present.''
The report of the shore's economic rebound was based on telephone interviews of 1,006 people conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation of Princeton between Sept. 6 and 19. The people interviewed live in New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, eastern Ohio and in New Jersey counties outside the shore area. The interviews were compared with similar surveys during the last two years.
Noreen Bodman, director of the Division of Travel and Tourism, said the study had revealed that Cape May, the state's southernmost resort, was the most popular destination for both season-long vacationers and overnight guests, while up the coast Atlantic City, with its casinos, was the greatest attraction for those who visited for just the day and returned home.
 
Decline in Overnight Guests
Of the 5.7 million visitors last summer, 1.1 million spent the full season, 2.5 million took trips that included at least one overnight trip, and 2.1 million took day trips. The number of season vacationers has remained fairly stable, while a decline in overnight guests that began two years ago continued. The number of day-trippers was up sharply over 1987, when there were 1.1 million, and exceeded the total in 1988, when there were 2.9 million.
Season rentals of rooms and houses accounted for $2 billion this year, compared with $1.2 billion last year; daily rentals totaled $2.7 billion, compared with $1.7 billion in 1988; boardwalk rides and attractions accounted for $658 million, compared with $453 million a year ago; gifts and souvenirs, $279 million, compared with $191 million; beach fees, which were rolled back in some areas because of pressure by the New Jersey Public Advocate, took in $33 million, compared with $43 million a year ago.
Visitors spent about the same over the last two summers on parking and transportation to the resorts, slightly more in restaurants and slightly less on nightlife. One big change was the amount of money spent on groceries -$495 million this summer, down from $657 million a year ago.
 
Increased Efforts Pay
Mr. Kean attributed the improvement in business to increased efforts this year to track medical waste, patrol offshore waters, clean trash from beaches with prison labor, test the water quality in bathing areas and publicity reflecting these efforts. Without the $3 million ad campaign that went on most of the summer, the results might not have been so good, the Governor said.
''It would be like winking at a girl in a darkened room,'' he said. ''You know what you're doing, but no one else does.''
Robert J. Hunter, the owner of the Clam Hut Restaurant in Highlands, was among a number of resort businessmen who came to the Capitol to learn the results of the study. ''The water along the shore is getting cleaner every year, and people aren't frightened anymore,'' he said. He added that the clean water had brought an unusual complaint from some fishermen who go offshore looking for tuna.
''They told me the water is so clear, the tuna can see their lures, and it's making it more difficult to catch them,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In New York, 4 Large Cities Are Growing a Little Smaller

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Upstate New York's four big cities - Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Albany - all showed population losses from 1980 to 1988, according to estimates released by state and Federal officials.
The big loser during the nine-year period was Buffalo, New York's second largest city. Estimated population declined 12.4 percent, from 357,870 to 313,570. 
The 1988 population estimate dropped Buffalo's rank in the list of the United States' most populous cities. In 1980, Buffalo was the 39th largest city; in 1970, it was the 28th largest city. Based on the 1988 estimate, it is now the 50th largest city, smaller than Newark, Omaha, Toledo, Ohio, and the resort city of Virginia Beach, Va.
The estimates also show that Albany dropped under the 100,000 population mark, that Rochester's population losses were recent and that Syracuse's population is down while surrounding Onondaga County's is not.
 
'Still Feeling Difficult Times'
The figures, which are based on births, deaths, tax returns and immigration statistics, were released this week by the United States Census Bureau.
According to Bob Scardamalia, chief demographer for the State Department of Economic Development, the figures show that Buffalo is still recovering from an economic downturn in the 1970's and early 1980's.
''Some areas of the economy have turned the corner from a total reliance on manufacturing, but clearly, it's still in a difficult state,'' he said.
Erie County, which includes Buffalo, also showed a population drop, from 1,015,472 in 1980 to an estimated 958,700 in 1988. ''There is a segment of Erie County - Amherst particularly - that is showing growth, but in general, the rest of the county is still feeling difficult times,'' Mr. Scardamalia said.
 
Onondaga County Stable
Rochester was the 49th largest city in the United States in 1970, with 295,011 people. Its rank dropped to 57th in 1980, with 241,741 people, and to 66th in 1988, with 229,780 people.
Mr. Scardamalia said the estimates show that in 1984, Rochester actually had slightly more people than in 1980, 242,560 compared with 241,741.
Syracuse was the 66th largest city in the country in 1970, with a population of 197,297. In 1980, its rank was 86th and its population 170,105. According to the 1988 estimates, the city's rank is down to 109th and its population is 153,610.
The population in surrounding Onondaga County, however, has been relatively stable throughout the 1980's, according to Mr. Scardamalia. The county's population in 1980 was 463,920; the 1988 estimate is 461,500.
Albany is not on the Census Bureau's most recent ranking of cities with populations of more than 100,000. Mr. Scardamalia said Albany met the criterion in the 1980 census, with 101,727 people. In 1988, however, the estimate is 94,450.

Computer Graphics Aiding Jurors' Recall

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Jurors hearing a lawsuit over the supposed merits of a new dog food were recently taken, via three-dimensional computer animation, on a journey inside a Labrador retriever's leg to see how its muscles, bones and joints function.
Once the preserve of advertising agencies and science-fiction movies, such visual aids are increasingly being used in the courtroom as exhibits in cases from airplane crashes to medical malpractice.
In the suit involving dog food, Alpo Pet Foods, part of Grand Metropolitan Inc., took issue with advertising by the Ralston Purina Company asserting that its puppy chow could lessen the severity of a potentially crippling hip ailment. Alpo, which contended that the advertising was false, presented colorful graphics to show the jury that the illness could occur anyway. Several veterinarians and radiologists also testified at the trial. The jury later awarded Alpo $10.4 million in damages, and Ralston Purina has appealed. 
Clear, simple graphics help jurors, who typically retain only 10 percent of what they hear, to increase recall by nearly 10 percentage points, said Gregory J. Mazares, the president of the graphics unit of Litigation Sciences Inc. in Los Angeles, which produced the puppy chow videotape.
 
Seeing Is Really Believing
''We're a switched-on, tuned-in, visually-oriented society, and jurors tend to believe what they see,'' Mr. Mazares said. ''This technology keeps the jury's attention by simplifying the material and by giving them little bursts of information.''
Industry officials, including Mr. Mazares, acknowledge that these ''little bursts of information'' are highly selective and possibly manipulative.
''We're looking to develop a complete graphics strategy that will focus the jury precisely on the facts and arguments on which we want them to base their verdict,'' Mr. Mazares said.
Critics warn that such slick packages raise issues precisely because of their effectiveness and the high cost of production, which makes them virtually inaccessible to poorer litigants. The price tag for three-dimensional productions runs from $10,000 for a simple 30-second exhibit to $250,000 for a complex 45-minute piece.
 
Advantage to the Rich
''High-tech computer exhibits may cause a jury to be persuaded for the wrong reasons - because the graphics are colorful or entertaining, and not because the facts are convincing,'' said William J. Genego, a professor at the University of Southern California Law School. ''Moreover, access to this technology may be dependent on someone's economic resources, so they allow only those with the bigger budgets to make use of them.''
The most expensive computer animations involve recreations of airplane crashes, which Forensic Technologies International, a San Francisco-based company, specializes in. ''It's a very powerful tool in the courtroom because it can clearly show a very complicated case in a very short period of time,'' said Marjorie E. Weingrow, an engineering manager with Forensic Technologies.

Japan's business and Government leaders are reassessing their strategy for investing overseas. They are fearful of an American reaction to a recent surge of acquisitions and worry that the door to the U.S. market may be closing. [Page A1.]
The U.S. said 99 Japanese construction companies had agreed to pay $32.6 million to settle accusations that they rigged bids on projects at a Navy base. It was the first time the U.S. has successfully struck back against the ''dango'' system, in which construction companies consult in secret before submitting bids. [D1.] 
The award of a Japanese computer chip patent to Texas Instruments is probably not a sign that the patent system will be streamlined, experts say. U.S. companies have contended that the sluggish Japanese system is rigged against them. [D1.]
Debt-reduction talks with Venezuela could turn out to be the most difficult to date under the so-called Brady Plan. Many bankers contend that in contrast to the three countries that have completed debt agreements, Venezuela does not need significant debt reduction or much assistance. As evidence, they cite the state-owned oil company's recent agreement to buy half of Citgo Petroleum for $675 million. [D1.]
The president of Argentina's central bank resigned. Javier Gonzalez Fraga cited differences over policy with Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli and said a two-time former central bank president, Egidio Ianella, would replace him. [D6.]
Britain's foreign trade deficit narrowed last month, easing pressure on Prime Minister Thatcher. The small drop was greeted with cautious optimism in London's financial markets. [D2.]
OPEC officials predicted that demand for the group's oil would average 21.5 million barrels a day next year, well under the members' current level of production. [D4.] Canada is inviting petroleum companies to explore for oil in the Arctic Ocean for the first time in nearly two decades. [D4.]
Chinese banks will lend $27 billion to state-operated enterprises that need cash, although the Government's tight credit policy will remain in effect, a central bank official said. [D4.]
 
 
 
Companies
Eastern's flight attendants were told to return to work by union leaders, a day after the pilots' union abandoned its nearly nine-month-old walkout. That leaves only the machinists on the picket lines in what has become the longest strike at a major airline. Eastern, which is trying to reorganize under bankruptcy protection, says it has no immediate need for the returning strikers. [D1.]
Caterpillar is learning that the costs of thinking long term are high. A six-year modernization program meant to increase its competitiveness has cost $1.5 billion, caused ill will on Wall Street and lowered its stock price. [D1.]
 
 
 
The Economy
When the House and the Senate adjourned early Wednesday, they left behind a formidable agenda of unfinished business to take up after they reconvene on Jan. 23. The remaining issues range from child care to the Clean Air Act to the more fundamental deficit reduction that many lawmakers had hoped for this year. [A1.]
The deficit-reduction package approved by Congress is built around $8 billion in measures that will raise several taxes. [D2.]
The Turnaround Management Association has been struggling to sort out a mess of its own. The director of the association was forced to resign in February when his past as a felon and disbarred attorney came to light. This month, a settlement was reached in which he would return more than $100,000 to the association. [D5.]

HEADLINE: Thinking Long Term Is Costly to Caterpillar

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill.

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc., the nation's largest producer of earthmoving machinery, is learning that the costs of international competitiveness are high: $1.5 billion, ill will on Wall Street and a few dollars off its stock price.
Trying to fend off increasing competition from overseas rivals, led by Komatsu Ltd. of Japan, Caterpillar began a six-year modernization program in 1986. With the $1.5 billion plan, the company aims to reduce production costs by one fifth at 32 factories that make its bright-yellow bulldozers and other equipment.
But recently, estimates of the cost of the program have been revised upward and the time required for it to pay off has lengthened. In response, Wall Street analysts have scaled back their earnings estimates and Caterpillar's stock has dropped, closing at $58.25 a share on Wednesday, well below its 52-week high of $69. 
''At this point, no one is challenging Cat's strategic initiative to become a world-class manufacturer,'' said Eli Lustgarten, the heavy-equipment analyst at Paine Webber Inc. ''But we are finding out just how expensive that is to do.''
George A. Schaefer, Caterpillar's chairman and chief executive, brushes aside such concerns of Wall Street analysts. It ''doesn't bother us a bit, because we are absolutely convinced of the payoff in the long term,'' Mr. Schaefer said in an interview at the company's headquarters here. ''We have to play the long-term game because the competition is playing the long-term game.''
Indeed, some industry veterans say Caterpillar's experience is a classic confrontation between Wall Street's often-criticized fixation with short-term profits versus the need for American corporations to make long-term investments.
 
Response to 'Global Realities'
''Seeing an American company like this respond to global realities is pleasing,'' said Kirk Landers, editor of Construction Equipment, a trade journal. ''So I sure hope Cat is not pressured into producing short-term results.''
Yet the issue seems more complicated than a choice between profits today or competitiveness tomorrow. Analysts do not criticize Caterpillar's strategy, but there are doubts about how successful the company will be in executing its plan. And Caterpillar may face difficulties in the future, even if the cost-cutting modernization program works: Not only is the economy weakening, but a structural change in the demand for earth-moving equipment is underway.
Reduced demand from oil-rich Middle East countries, debt-burdened third world nations and a budget-minded American Government have trimmed the worldwide market for Caterpillar's bread-and-butter products - the mammoth earth-moving machines used in mining, road building and construction of dams, bridges and other large public works.
The action now is in smaller equipment, like the backhoe loaders used by independent home builders. Caterpillar has added the smaller machines to its product line, but they are less profitable. And even if demand for the big machines picks up, the stiffer foreign competition means continuing pressure on profit margins.
''Most people whom you talk to in this industry say you will never see the same type of demand in terms of product mix and, therefore, in terms of profit,'' said Frank Manfredi, an industry consultant based in Buffalo Grove, Ill., outside Chicago. ''You might see the same level of revenues, but never the same level of profits.''
The prospect of a permanently tougher market, company executives say, gives added urgency to Caterpillar's modernization program, known formally as the Plant With a Future project. It includes installing flexible machine tools that can produce a variety of parts; not just for bulldozers but for excavators, off-highway trucks and other earth-moving gear.
New inventory systems are also being introduced to trim the cost of materials. Machines that cut, bore and remove burrs from metal are being grouped so one worker can produce an entire part. And plant layouts are being revised to place related processes together.
 
Champion of Survival Strategy
The program is the survival strategy championed by Mr. Schaefer, a 61-year-old former accountant who has spent almost his entire career at Caterpillar. He became chief executive in 1985, one year before the modernization drive began.
Caterpillar learned about the need for global competitiveness the hard way. In the early 1980's, when the strong dollar made imports cheaper, Komatsu and other foreign manufacturers grabbed footholds in the United States market and took sales from Caterpillar overseas as well. In 1984, Caterpillar lost $428 million on sales of $6.6 billion.
Since then, the dollar has weakened and Caterpillar has been streamlined drastically, enabling it to recover. Last year, the company reported earnings of $616 million on revenues of $10.4 billion. But the recent improvement has not reduced Mr. Schaefer's belief that Caterpillar must become a lower-cost and more efficient producer if it is to weather the global competition and currency swings of the future.
If the modernization is successful, he said, ''we can stay ahead of the competition and be effective in either a weak-dollar or a strong-dollar environment.''
Wall Street analysts like that idea; they just do not like the price. Zacks Investment Research, a New York firm that tracks analyst sentiment, reported recently that most analysts expect Caterpillar to earn about $5.79 a share this year, down from the $5.81 a share estimated in a survey one month earlier. That was down from $6.28 a share that the analysts were predicting in a survey 12 weeks before that, and from $6.35 a share in a survey 13 weeks before that. As the estimates have fallen, so too has the company's stock price.
The company has also sent different signals to analysts about the costs and benefits of the modernization. A year and a half ago, for instance, Pierre C. Guerindon, a Caterpillar executive vice president who heads the Plant With a Future, or P.W.A.F., program, told analysts that the program would cost $1.1 billion. He has since raised that to almost $1.5 billion.
He has also increased his estimate of the annual start-up costs associated with the program from $100 million more than a year ago, to $150 million last summer, and to $200 million in a recent interview. In that interview, Mr. Guerindon also pushed back, to the end of 1990, the time when the program's benefits would begin to exceed its costs.
''We have lost a little ground but not much, and the promise of P.W.A.F. is still quite good,'' Mr. Guerindon said. ''On balance, it is still a very, very attractive proposal.''
The plan could add a huge amount to Caterpillar's financial results. On $10.4 billion in sales last year, Caterpillar reported manufacturing costs of just over $8 billion. Mr. Guerindon figures that modernization can cut that by nearly $1.6 billion, or 20 percent, which would flow directly to the company's bottom line. Such cost-cutting is crucial because Caterpillar's rival, Komatsu, has comparable manufacturing costs and is working hard to reduce them.
But to achieve that, Caterpillar is having to overhaul virtually every square foot of its 32 factories. And it is having to do so while maintaining production. The job, company officials say, is roughly equivalent to continuing to live in a house while it is being completely renovated.
Through careful planning, Caterpillar appears to be pulling it off. At a transmission factory in East Peoria, Ill., for instance, construction contractors are installing electrical lines and plumbing for new computer-controlled machine tools while, just a few feet away, Caterpillar employees are still using their old manually operated machine tools.
One result of such changes has been a sharp reduction in the number of unassembled parts that sit on the floor, in some cases, for weeks.
At one plant, production time on certain parts has been cut to five days from five months. That has enabled Caterpillar to have less finished inventory of these parts: two weeks' worth versus three months' worth.
''That's where the value is,'' said G. Kenneth Dawson, the plant's engineering manager.

HEADLINE: Attendants Halt Strike At Eastern

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The leaders of the flight attendants' union at Eastern Airlines told the members yesterday to return to work, a day after the pilots' union abandoned its nearly nine-month walkout.
That leaves only the machinists union on the picket lines in what has become the nation's longest strike at a major airline.
While the decisions by the pilots and flight attendants to end their strikes seem to be a victory for Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of the Texas Air Corporation, which owns Eastern and Continental Airlines, there is no certainty that Eastern will recover and flourish.
 
Competitive Advantage
On the plus side, should Eastern survive it would have a younger and lower-paid work force than many airlines, giving it a competitive advantage. Only America West Airlines, Midway Airlines and Continental would have lower costs than the new Eastern, said John V. Pincavage, a partner of the Transportation Group, a small investment banking firm specializing in airlines. 
But the strike has sullied Eastern's image for customer service and imposed $400 million in extra costs on an airline that was already losing money heavily. The strike also resulted in Eastern seeking the protection of the Federal Bankruptcy Court. As part of its reorganization, Eastern has sold some valuable assets, including its Boston-New York-Washington shuttle and its operations in Philadelphia.
''I don't think there are any real victors,'' Mr. Pincavage said. ''Both sides had the ability to hurt each other a lot.''
The machinists struck on March 4 after they rejected demands by Texas Air that they agree to $150 million in concessions on wages and work rules. The pilots and flight attendants struck in sympathy. Five days later, Eastern filed for bankruptcy.
The airline has said it expects to emerge from bankruptcy early next year at 80 to 90 percent of its former size. But it says it has no immediate need for the returning strikers.
Eastern has hired nonunion replacements, who work longer hours and for lower pay. And because they are new, they have earned no vacation time.
The airline says it will place the returning workers on a preferential recall list and not pay them until jobs become available.
Eastern, whose schedule was crippled when the strike began, is now flying about three-quarters of the flights it did before the strike.
 
Bush's Veto
The pilots and flight attendants decided to return to work after President Bush, on Tuesday, vetoed a bill that would have created a bipartisan commission to investigate the dispute at Eastern. In his veto message, Mr. Bush said the Government should not interfere in a labor-management dispute.
The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents 8,500 machinists, baggage handlers and other ground workers at Eastern, vowed to remain on strike at least until early next year, when Congress returns from its recess. The union said it would lobby to have the veto overturned.
Eastern is also negotiating to sell its Latin American routes and a few other assets to American Airlines. After breaking off in August, the talks resumed nearly three weeks ago, as American agreed to drop its demand that Continental abandon a $1 billion lawsuit against American, a person involved in the negotiations said. The suit contends that the computerized reservation system that American offers to travel agents lists other carriers' flights unfairly.
 
Not the First Time
Th Eastern bankruptcy filing was not the first time that an airline controlled by Mr. Lorenzo has sought such protection.
In 1983, he placed Continental Airlines under bankruptcy protection, and was able to cancel the airline's union contracts and later hire back the striking employees at much lower pay.
Mr. Lorenzo was able to rebuild Continental by cutting fares because other carriers were slow to respond with fare cuts of their own.
But Continental has not posted profits, said George W. James, the president of Airline Economics, a consulting firm in Washington, in part because many flyers have viewed its service as inferior since the strike. Eastern now shares that image, Mr. James said.
And Eastern's rivals have aggressively countered the airlines efforts to win back customers as it has gradually resumed its flights.
Changes in the Federal Bankruptcy Code have prevented Mr. Lorenzo from canceling the contracts of Eastern's pilots and flight attendants. But Eastern's management was able to cancel the machinists' contract because the National Mediation Board declared an impasse in February in the negotiations and a 30-day cooling-off period ended without the two sides reaching an agreement.
 
Pilots' Advantages
Because they still have a contract, striking pilots who resume flying at Eastern will have full seniority and salaries that averages $72,000 a year. But Eastern has replaced half the pilots with new people who, although covered by the union contract, make $27,500 a year because they have no seniority.
Eastern is also paying its new flight attendants $1,110 a month compared with the $2,300 earned by the average attendant before the strike. And it has cut the pay of baggage handlers and other unskilled ground personnel by more than 60 percent, to $6 an hour from $15.60.
Eastern said the return of the flight attendants and pilots would make little difference because it already had enough employees.
''If this had happened three or four months ago it would have been cause for rejoicing, but the course is pretty much set now,'' said Jim Ashlock, an Eastern spokesman.
 
Strike Ended in Tears
For many striking employees, a labor action that began with euphoria and unity ended in tears. ''I got a real knot in my stomach and swelled with emotion and cried,'' upon learning of the Presidential veto, said Donna Feldman-Carboni, an Eastern flight attendant with 17 years of seniority.
The biggest questions, company and union officials agreed, concern how many jobs will be left for the striking employees and who will fill them. About 870 of the 3,600 striking Eastern pilots and 1,600 of the 6,000 striking flight attendants crossed picket lines before their union leaders voted the return to work, a person close to the company said. They have joined about 800 newly hired pilots and 1,600 new flight attendants.
Eastern also has 200 more pilots and 250 more flight attendants in training and has asked a Federal judge in Miami to rule whether the trainees can become permanent employees.
The Air Line Pilots Association has said that under the Railway Labor Act the trainees should be dismissed because they have not begun flying passengers - the standard for dismissal established in some other lawsuits.
 
Question of Seniority
Yet even if Eastern does dismiss the trainees there will be many more returning strikers than job openings. The pilots' union and the Transport Workers Union, which represents the flight attendants, have argued that the jobs available should be awarded on the basis of seniority, while a person close to Eastern said the company would seek to hire back only those employees, particularly pilots, already experienced in certain types of aircraft.
In addition to their dismay with President Bush's veto, the pilots' leadership had other reasons for asking their members to return to work, said pilots' union and Eastern officials who asked not to be identified.
Among them were doubts that the pilots' union members would vote to continue strike benefits at Eastern. In the last referendum, a continuation of benefits was approved by 54 percent of the members voting.
The other reason was that Wednesday was the deadline for pilots to bid for new flight assignments that begin on March 3, two Eastern pilots said. The leadership was concerned that if the return to work was not ordered, more pilots might cross the picket lines to insure that they would fly choice flights at convenient times instead of difficult schedules that would keep them away from their families.

HEADLINE: Venezuela's Offer for Citgo Gives Bankers Indigestion

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
When Venezuela's state-owned oil company announced this month that it would spend $675 million to purchase the 50 percent of the Citgo Petroleum Corporation that it does not already own, the announcement got the attention of more than the oil industry.
Venezuela's bankers, to whom the country owes more than $21 billion, were stunned. Here, in the midst of already difficult negotiations with a Government pushing for significant debt reduction, it suddenly appears that that same Government can afford to spend more than half a billion dollars for an oil company. And no banker failed to note that the $675 million price tag was just a little more than the $600 miilion interim loan the bankers granted Venezuela at the end of September.
 
Good Deal, Bad Timing
''The timing was horrendous,'' said one banker involved in the negotiations, although he acknowledged that the deal itself was not a bad idea. 
Venezuela is the fourth country to go to the negotiating table under the Bush Administration's new third world debt strategy known as the Brady plan for its author, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. The strategy emphasizes debt reduction as a way to deal with the developing world's $1.3 trillion debt burden.
These negotiations could turn out to be the most difficult to date and will test the commitment of the Bush Administration, the flexibility of the commercial banks and the savvy of the Venezuelans.
 
Need for Debt Cut Questioned
A big difference in the Venezuelan negotiations from those completed with Mexico, the Philippines and Costa Rica, is that many of the bankers involved really do not think Venezuela needs significant debt reduction or much assistance. Venezuela disagrees.
''We still have to convince them of the need,'' Miguel Rodriguez, the minister in charge of the negotiating team, said in an interview in September, acknowledging the difficult job he faced.
While bankers felt pressure by the United States and other Governments in the Mexican negotiations, there was, nevertheless, a financial argument bankers could acknowledge. But in Venezuela's case, many bankers argue that the only claim for debt reduction is political: The new Government of Carlos Andres Perez needs to win an important victory to back its economic reform program, and the Bush Administration put Venezuela on the list of Brady plan candidates after riots rocked the country last February, killing 300 people.
 
Political Need Noted
''From a financial point of view Venezuela does not have a financial need,'' said a banker deeply involved in the negotiations. ''But politically it does.''
Any successful agreement, bankers said, will require a new approach, although it may borrow ideas from several of the pacts already negotiated. What needs to be worked out, one banker said, is a proposal that bridges both the dispute over Venezuela's needs and the differences among the banks over new loans versus debt reduction and the levels that are fair. The bankers admit they are still looking for the solution.
Most likely, this solution will mean a much broader range of options for debt reduction and new loans than in the Mexican agreement. These options may include regular buybacks of Venezulean debt offered voluntarily to the banks - a feature not in the Mexican plan. In addition, any set level or levels of debt reduction may be tied to a sliding level of guarantees to make larger debt reduction more attractive. These guarantees would give banks more choice but may make the outcome for Venezuela less certain.
 
Angry Bankers
''It is clear that a country like Venezuela wants, at the least, what Mexico got, and that is what is infuriating the banks,'' said another banker. The banks agreed to accept a 35 percent reduction in the value of Mexico's existing debt, through either a reduction in principal or a cut in interest rates. The third option was for new loans equal to 25 percent of a bank's current exposure.
In addition, a lot of bankers, having curbed their emotional dislike of the Brady plan in Mexico's case, are now likely to unleash their anger in the Venezuelan talks.
Several bankers said they feel that they were not consulted as the Brady plan was developed, and they are annoyed because they believe the Mexican debt reduction was mandatory for the banks, not voluntary.
 
Philippine Deal Cited
''Somehow the debt reduction element in the Mexican plan is not really voluntary, but the buyback in the Philippines is,'' said one American official supporting the Venezuelans, who asked not to be identified. He was referring to the Philippine negotiation in which no debt reduction level was set. Instead the Philippine Government offered to buy back the bank loans at 50 percent of value.
And the bankers argue that the banks and their stockholders are being asked to make the sacrifice needed for a policy that has insufficient Government support. Government loans to debtor nations have not been subject to debt reduction, and that really irks them. Also, some major banks have significantly increased their reserves for losses on third world loans, a move that can make them tougher at the negotiating table.
''There is anger,'' one banker said. ''It is very heavily emotional. The conclusion will clearly be impacted by all this. I am not sure what we will do for Venezuela.''
 
Shifts by Venezuelan
For its part, Venezuela has been working - the Citgo episode aside -to smooth the way to a settlement, despite the apparent tensions. In a striking move in September, the Government dropped its demand for 50 percent debt reduction alone and shifted to a menu of debt reduction and options for new money that should be more palatable to the banks.
This menu includes a range of options that offer more attractive guarantees of interest and principal in exchange for more debt reduction.
At the same time, the bankers finally agreed on the $600 million interim loan, which Venezuela used, along with some of its own reseves, to catch up on its interest rate payments to the banks, a move that pleased the bankers.
 
Reform Program Pursued
Mr. Perez has also continued to pursue his economic reform program, which is aimed at opening the economy and includes changes in trade practices and the privatizing of some state-owned businesses.
Some bankers see some progress. ''I say there is a change toward a better perception of reality on the part of the Venezuelans,'' one banker said.
But, at the same time, he added, there continue to be troublesome splits among the banks about Venezuela's needs and what should be offered in any package. Some of the banks, bankers said, are ready to do some debt reduction but some are not.
 
Differing Bank Goals
More importantly, some banks are willing to negotiate a package that sets some levels for debt reduction and new loans. But other banks want more flexibility. Some want an agreement that waives the existing clauses that prevent Venezuela from making separate individual deals with banks.
Another banker minimized the divisions among the banks, noting that they always seemed to be sharply divided at the beginning of a negotiation and then moved closer together.
One official said that since September the bankers had appeared to move closer to agreeing that Venezuela needs some long-term assistance but that they are still about $600 million short of Venezuela's estimates.
 
Venezuela's Projections
The Venezuelans, with the backing of economists at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, maintain that they need about $1 billion a year in relief through the mid-1990's.
One banker characterized Venezuela's projections as politically, rather than economically, necessary. He argued that the country wanted the larger amount of assistance so that it could grow well economically in the 1990's. This year the economy is projected to decline by 5 percent to 10 percent, partially because of the Government's economic policy changes.
''The banks' view is that Venezuela should be happy with zero or negative economic growth for the next few years,'' countered an American official who supports Venezuela's position in the negotiations.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A Master Plan For Military Cuts

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE Bush Administration's decision to start planning for deeper cuts in military spending has come partly in response to dramatic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and partly as a result of domestic budgetary and economic pressures.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's order to the military chiefs to submit plans to cut $180 billion from the budget for 1992 through 1994 came as an enormous surprise to all three services and was, as one military analyst put it, ''a culture shock of the first order.''
Mr. Cheney was under pressure from President Bush and the director of the Office of Management and Budget, Richard G. Darman, to come up with a plan to scale back military expenditures. The President had accepted Mr. Darman's argument that military spending provides the only big ''pot of money'' for reducing the budget deficit without steep increases in taxes. 
Mr. Darman, analysts close to the budget office said, is seeking bigger cuts than Mr. Cheney and the service chiefs would prefer. It is not clear how deep cuts will be, and in what areas of weapons, personnel, research, development testing and evaluation, and in operations and maintenance, they will be distributed.
But officials at the Office of Management and Budget say they have scrutinized the strategic plan for cutting military spending prepared by William W. Kaufmann for the Brookings Institution, and they say it falls within the O.M.B.'s range, but ''at the low end of our scale.'' The Kaufmann plan calls for cutting military spending, which is set to run at an annual rate of $300 billion in the fiscal year 1990, in three stages: to $265 billion in 1994; to $251 billion in 1997, and to a range of $195 billion to $160 billion in 1999, all measured in constant 1990 dollars.
The first stage of the Kaufmann plan would ''halt the rush to produce a next generation of weapons now in the acquisition process'' at a cumulative saving of more than $117 billion. It would also delete $48 billion in cumulative growth planned by the Bush Administration for 1990 to 1994.
The original Bush plan called for an annual growth rate in military spending of 1 to 2 percent above the inflation rate; the proposal announced by Mr. Cheney last week is described by other Government officials as calling for a real reduction of 5 percent a year between 1992 and 1994.
The second stage of the Kaufmann plan might overlap the first; former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara has urged acceleration of the second stage. It would stem from a successful completion of treaties to reduce strategic and conventional forces in Europe. The third stage of the Kaufmann plan can, he says, be visualized for the end of the century. It would include reduction of strategic offensive forces by both the Soviet Union and United States, cuts in conventional forces on both sides and a trading-off of American carrier battle groups for Soviet nuclear attack submarines.
While the stock prices of many military producers dropped sharply in reaction to news of Mr. Cheney's proposal to cut spending, most American economists consider the cuts likely to strengthen the economy by reducing interest rates, stimulating real investment in plants and equipment and in research and development, and by increasing the growth of American productivity. The shrinkage of the budget deficit would also be likely to strengthen the nation's foreign trade position.
In preparation for his coming summit conference with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the waters near Malta next month, President Bush is moving to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the Soviet reduction in military spending and the reduced tensions in Eastern Europe.
The threatened economic collapse of the Soviet Union, which lies behind the Gorbachev arms reductions, creates significant military and economic gains for the United States.
If arms control agreements can be reached with the Soviet Union, they will offer a way to reduce a good part of the cost and dangers of sustaining a military balance in Europe and easing the economic burdens on this country. But they will not, in the near future, eliminate either the need for such a balance or the need for the European countries to assume a greater responsibility for sustaining that balance.

HEADLINE: OPEC Expects Demand to Fall Short

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: VIENNA, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Officials of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries predicted today that demand for the organization's oil would average 21.5 million barrels a day next year, well under its current level of production.
Subroto, the Secretary General of OPEC, released the forecast after a special monitoring panel met.
Ministers of OPEC's 13 member nations agreed to meet privately on Friday before opening OPEC's winter conference on Saturday morning. 
The ministers will try to come up with a new arrangement that will halt cheating on production quotas and keep crude oil prices firm.
With higher output in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, OPEC produced nearly 23.5 million barrels of crude a day last month, analysts have estimated.
That is considerably higher than the fourth-quarter ceiling of 20.5 million barrels a day that it agreed to.
Despite the surge, prices have been fairly strong.
Dr. Subroto said the average price of crude oils monitored by OPEC was $17.16 a barrel from January through the third week of October, when it reached $17.76. OPEC's target price is $18 a barrel. A year ago, the same crude oil averaged $12.34.
Futures prices for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark American crude, have been running about $20 a barrel.
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been cheating openly, pumping as much as double their individual quotas of about a million barrels a day, analysts said.
Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer and the world's largest exporter of crude, recently joined in the overproduction, a move seen by analysts as a negotiating ploy before the talks.
At a September meeting, Iran offered a proposal to cover the demands of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. The plan received considerable attention but failed to gain quick approval by all nations.
In his economic report, Dr. Subroto said OPEC expected an increase in world economic growth of 3 percent next year, a bit under the 3.3 percent pace of 1989.
Total demand for oil - excluding such centrally planned economies as the Soviet Union - was estimated at 51.8 million barrels a day in 1990, up from 50.9 million barrels this year.
Once the ministers set a production ceiling, they will have to divide the total among member nations.
Iran's September plan called for lifting the overall ceiling to 21.5 million barrels a day to meet the demands of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates for larger shares of the total. Gabon and Ecuador would also get more.

HEADLINE: Argentine Bank Head Quits

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Nov. 23

 BODY:
The president of Argentina's central bank, Javier Gonzalez Fraga, resigned today, citing differences over policy with Nestor Rapanelli, the Economy Minister.
Mr. Fraga said President Carlos Saul Menem would replace him with Egidio Ianella, 68 years old, a two-time former president of the central bank now working in the private sector. 
''I am convinced that an economic team must be homogeneous,'' Mr. Fraga told reporters shortly after his resignation was accepted. ''If the central bank is not independent to set monetary and exchange policies, it makes no sense.''
Argentina's currency market had operated nervously in the last two weeks amid reports of a rift between Mr. Fraga and the economic team of Mr. Rapanelli, currency dealers said.
Argentina's currency, the austral, has lost more than a quarter of its value against the United States dollar this month in the unofficial exchange market. Today, it fell 5.2 percent, to close at 965 australs to the dollar. It had opened at 915.
Mr. Fraga was a critic of Mr. Rapanelli's policy of keeping an official exchange rate fixed at 652.5 australs to the dollar. He said that on Tuesday he had proposed to Mr. Menem an alternative program suggesting a free exchange market, but that it had been rejected.

HEADLINE: SCI Debt Extension

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DENVER, Nov. 23

 BODY:
The investor George N. Gillett Jr. has been forced to extend the restructuring of $507 million in high-yield ''junk bonds'' for SCI Television Inc. because of a weak response from Wall Street, the company and investors said Wednesday.
SCI said that almost none of its bondholders had agreed to an exchange of their high-interest debt for a nonvoting stake in the company. If all bondholders agreed the size of their stake would total 39 percent.
The company said investors holding $37,000 of the $507 million in debt had agreed to Gillett's offer. SCI extended the deadline until Dec. 4 and said further extensions were possible. The company is continuing talks with a bondholders' committee and other debt holders.
If the restructuring fails, Gillett Holdings Inc., which owns 55 percent of SCI, could forfeit its $100 million investment in the company, which it owns with Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the New York buyout firm.
SCI owns television stations WSBK in Boston, WJBK in Detroit, WJW in Cleveland, WITI in Milwaukee, KNSD in San Diego and WAGA in Atlanta.
Mr. Gillett, who also owns two ski resorts, had proposed extending some loans and cutting the interest rates on publicly traded SCI bonds in exchange for the nonvoting stake in the company, but bondholders have said they want more equity and faster repayments.
Last week, three SCI bondholders filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against SCI at the end of a 30-day grace period after Mr. Gillett failed to meet an Oct. 15 interest payment.
A Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition would require the company to sell assets to satisfy creditors. The company has 20 days to respond to the petition.

HEADLINE: A Capital Idea for Eastern Europe

 BODY:
Westerners are exhilarated by the drama of Eastern Europe but puzzled about how to help. The West cannot alter the fact that it's Eastern Europe's job to break the chains of centralized control and to wean consumers from subsidized prices and producers from guaranteed sales. But the West can ease this painful process and modestly improve the chances for success. 
An idea proposed last week by France's President, Francois Mitterrand, deserves support. He wants Western Europe to create a development bank that would extend loans and other financial assistance to Eastern Europe in exchange for democratic reforms. A detailed plan will be drawn up in time for the European Community summit meeting in Strasbourg next month.
Teh idea is for Western European governments to contribute capital that could be loaned directly for modernization projects. Even better, the bank could use the capital as the basis for borrowing vastly larger amounts from international markets, thereby making even greater funds available to Eastern Europe.
The bank would make little impact unless the U.S. and Japan participated. Felix Rohatyn, the New York investment banker, estimates that such cooperation could create an investment pool of $15 billion even if no single country contributed more than $1 billion. He offers a tantalizing prospect. Capital-starved Eastern Europe gets desperately needed funds; yet no Western country risks very much. The money could be for public or private projects, perhaps at below-market interestrates.
Skeptics will ask why Western governments need to be involved at all. Won't attractive investment projects in Eastern Europe lure private money? Mr. Rohatyn has a shrewd response. Hungary, Poland and East Germany have little experience with copyright, patent or other protections for private foreign investment. The proposed development bank would centralize the task of negotiating adequate safeguards, thereby eliminating cost and risk for everyone.
A development bank would solve one other important problem. Normally, East European countries would be forced to compete against one another for Western loans. That might maximize the West's profit. But it could deny funds that individual countries need to preserve their fragile experiments with political democracy and economic reform. A centralized development bank could help target assistance to the most needy.
Eastern Europe will need more than development loans. Debt relief and subsidies will also be required. Nor can the West be sure that its loans won't be squandered. Where markets are primitive or nonexistent, the task of discriminating productive from wasteful investment can be herculean. Witness the investment fiascoes in Latin America and Poland during the 1970's.
Yet the creation of a development bank is a wise start. Without subjecting any Western country to large financial risk, it would give East European reform a modest but vital boost.

HEADLINE: A Lok at the Session: What Congress Accomplished

 BODY:
ECONOMIC POLICY Budget: Enacted a $14.7 billion deficit reduction plan that relies heavily on automatic spending cuts and measures viewed as accounting gimmicks to achieve the reduction. Plan also includes a 9-month extension of expiring tax breaks.
Savings and Loan: Approved a $159 billion bailout over the next 10 years to shut down and sell off more than 700 savings and loan institutions and reconfigure Federal regulation of the industry centralizing power with the F.D.I.C. and the Treasury Department.
Minimum Wage: Raised the minimum wage to $3.80 an hour next year and to $4.25 an hour in 1991, the first increases since 1981. 
Section 89: Repealed a provision of the 1986 tax law the prohibits discrimination against low-wage workers in employer-sponsored health benefit plans because the provision was considered too complex and burdensome to administer.
 
DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICY
Nicaragua: Under a bipartisan agreement with the President, appropriated $49.7 million to provide food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies to the contras through February 1990. To get Democratic support for the package, the Administration agreed that no aid may be disbursed after Nov. 30, 1989, unless key Congressional leaders and committees give their consent. Congress also provided $9 million to help opposition parties in the election next February and to support international observers.
Poland and Hungary: Approved a $938 million package of aid over the next three years to Poland and Hungary, twice what President Bush requested. More than 90% of the aid is directed to Poland.
Military Spending: Passed a $286 billion military spending bill that contains the first budget reduction in the ''Star Wars'' missile defense plan and a cutback in the stealth bomber program.
 
SOCIAL POLICY
Abortion: In both the House and Senate, mustered enough votes to provide Federal financing for abortions for victims of rape and incest, money for a United Nations fund for family planning activities, and to allow the District of Columbia to spend its own money for abortions. But the two chambers were unable to override Presidential vetoes of their actions.
Catastrophic Cost of Illness: Yielded to the complaints of many older Americans and voted to repeal a far-reaching Medicare expansion designed to protect retirees against being bankrupted by a catastrophic illness. Originally signed into law just 16 months ago.
Disaster Assistance: Approved a $4.15 billion relief package to finance earthquake recovery efforts in Northern California and help the victims of Hurricane Hugo.
Medicare Payments: Overhauled the physician reimbursement system under the Medicare program. Specialists like surgeons and radiologists to be paid about 20 percent less by the government than they are now, while general practitioners to be paid about 40 percent more.
Child Care: Failed to pass landmark child care bill because of jurisdictional and philosophical disputes, but leadership committed to moving quickly next year.
Drugs: Approved $8.8 billion for anti-drug law enforcement and drug abuse prevention and treatment programs in fiscal year 1990. Totasl represents increases of $900 million over the amount requested by President Bush and $3.2 billion over the fiscal year 1989 level.
 
MISCELLANEOUS
Lobbying: Prohibited Federal contractors and Federal grant recipients from using any Federal money to lobby Congress or executive branch officials.
Airline Smoking: Banned smoking on all flights in the continental United States and all other domestic flights of six hours or less.
Oil Spill Liability: House passed legislation that consolidates Federal oil spill liability laws, raises the limit on liability for those responsible for oil spills, and provides for a $1 billion Federal trust fund to cover cleanup costs and damages not paid for by private parties. Senate passed similar legislation. Conference expected early in 1990.
Offshore Oil: Passed legislation continuing and expanding moratoriums on oil and gas leasing in specified areas off the coasts of California, Florida, Massachusetts, the mid-Atlantic states and Alaska.
Arts: Agreed to restrict Federal money for art defined as obscene by a 1973 Supreme Court decision. But to be restricted, such artworks must lack ''serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.''
Pay and Ethics: House approved a plan to raise salaries of House members, Federal judges and top government employees by at least a third by 1991 and tighten the lawmaker's ethical rules. Senators chose smaller pay increase for themselves, but retained, at least for now, their outside speaking fees, which would be banned in the House.
Flag Protection: Passed a bill that makes it a crime punishable by a fine and imprisonment of up to one year for a person to knowingly mutilate, deface, burn or physically defile any United States flag.

HEADLINE: Organic Farms: Agriwisdom

BYLINE: By Richard Rhodes; Richard Rhodes is the author of ''Farm.''

DATELINE: Cambridge, Mass.

 BODY:
At a time when we celebrate the bounty of our farms, we might give thought to farmers.
 
My friend Tom
Bauer, who farms 1,000 acres of deep prairie loam out in central Missouri, east of Kansas City, applies nitrate fertilizer and chemical herbicides to his grain and soybean fields before he plants them. Although he hasn't used pesticides for 10 years, many of his neighbors do. ''The label said to burn my work clothes afterward,'' Tom told me recently, ''and I just decided I didn't want to be around anything that deadly.'' 
Such practices alarm city people, who worry about contamination of their water supply and toxic residues in their food.
In fairness, we ought to place the blame for chemically intensive agriculture where it belongs: in Washington, with the politics of farm subsidies. The National Research Council concluded in a recent report that changing Federal programs to encourage farmers to farm more organically would be better husbandry for all of us in the long term, improving the quality of the nation's soil and water and protecting the purity of its food supply.
Neither Congress nor the Bush Administration has rushed to implement the council's recommendations. Doing so would shift farming away from dependence on chemicals and artificial fertilizer, profitable inputs that large agribusiness corporations - chemical, grain and oil companies - supply.
The farmers I know are just as concerned with their health and their stewardship of the land as the rest of us. They'd like to work toward a more renewable agriculture. But agribusiness is collectively the largest industry in America, with corresponding political clout, while there are fewer than five million Americans left living on farms.
When I was a boy, living on a farm outside Independence, Mo., studying vocational agriculture in high school, I wondered why farm subsidies were based on limiting the number of acres a farmer could plant. Aggressive technological innovation was on the horizon in the early 1950's. My classmates and I were taught to admire the ingenious new chemical technologies whereby a farmer could boost his per-acre yields.
If old-fashioned Farmer Jones managed to grow 100 bushels of corn per acre by traditional methods, we learned, Farmer Smith down the road, alert to technology, could push his yield on similar land to 150 or even 200 bushels by pouring on the chemical fertilizer, by planting his corn rows closer together - so close that he couldn't cultivate by machine any more but had to apply herbicides to keep down weeds - and by using pesticides to eliminate bugs that thrived in his crowded fields.
It was obvious even to a 15-year-old that these acreage controls encouraged intensive farming practices that weren't necessarily good for the land in the long run, nor did they reduce surpluses. If we really wanted to limit surpluses, it seemed to me, we ought to limit not the number of acres a farmer could plant but the number of bushels he could sell at supported prices.
I understood that the farm subsidy program was illogical, but I was too innocent of politics to understand why. The reason why is encapsulated in an unkind saying that came into vogue a few years ago among organic-farming advocates: ''A farmer is someone who launders money for a chemical company.'' In fairness to the Tom Bauers of America, I would add that the farmer does so under economic compulsion. Sally Bauer's accounting books illustrate the point.
The Bauers grossed $152,090 in 1986, a typical recent year. Their largest single expense was feed for their cattle and hogs. But fertilizer and chemicals took second place at $22,345. Add $17,910 more for machinery repair and fuel, and the Bauers' purchases from agribusiness are the biggest overall expenditure.
In exchange for idling about 10 percent of their land, they earned some $11,000 in Government subsidies. Agribusiness pocketed all of those dollars and $29,000 of their unsubsidized gross income besides. The Bauers cleared only about $19,000 for their year's labor.
Government programs skew farming in another direction as well. The No. 1 rule for any farmer who wants to survive economically in farming today is to keep up his crop base -never to plant less acreage to a given commodity that he planted in previous years, a number on which his subsidies are based. If he planted 100 acres of corn each year for the past three years and plants only 95 this year, then his subsidies will be correspondingly reduced. He is effectively penalized for growing less surplus than he has grown in the past.
On the other hand, one of the best was to reduce pest infestations and to prevent depletion of soil nutrients is to rotate crops - to plant a field in different crops from year to year, renewing the land biologically rather than chemically.
Conservation-minded farmers like Tom Bauer recognize the benefits of crop rotation: Tom applies the practice to keep pests down without pesticides. But they understandably draw the line at encroaching on their crop base; rationally enough, they put economic survival ahead of conservation practices. Conservation correspondingly suffers. Many farmers with robust crop bases have given up crop rotation entirely.
If the independent farmer were on his way to extinction, then furthering the industrialization of farming with Federal subsidies to agribusiness might make sense. In fact, the 1980 census discovered only 7,140 corporate farms in the United States, only a small fraction of the nation's total. The rural depression of the Reagan years drove hundreds of thousands of farmers out of business, and about one-fourth of those left are in serious trouble today. But the more numerous three-fourths are finding themselves in better shape than they have been for a decade, with a better debt-to-asset ratio than most industries.
A Federal farm program directed toward sustainable agriculture would limit production of surpluses, encourage soil and water conservation and begin moving farming toward less dependence on chemicals and more reliance on crop rotation, mechanical cultivation and biological controls. Such a program would help farmers make a living, as current programs do. But because a larger share of transfer payments would end up in farmers' pockets, it would cost less.
Subsidizing agribusiness makes little sense, especially when farmers have had to take the rap for the damage to natural resources that such subsidy promotes. Competitively, agriculture is one of the last world-class industries left in America. Tom Bauer and his neighbors will keep it that way organically if we let them.

HEADLINE: THE TALK OF FIFTH AVENUE;
Altman's Last Sale: Every Memory Must Go

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY

 BODY:
In the early morning yesterday, when most of Fifth Avenue was still largely deserted - the steel vault doors in front of Tiffany & Company still tightly shut, a lone man shoveling snow in front of Cartier's - a crowd had already gathered in front of B. Altman & Company.
Clapping their hands against the cold, stepping over patches of ice and pressed close together behind police barricades, shoppers said they had come in hope of a bargain. But many more said they had come to witness the end of one of their favorite stores.
Pamela Gordon, hugging her mink coat around her, said she had come from Savannah, Ga., to buy something, though nothing in particular, just because the 124-year-old department store was closing. 
''This is nostalgia,'' Mrs. Gordon said. ''I got an account here right after the war in 1946, and I thought it was the most exciting, incredible store. I just wanted to be here.''
By noon, Fifth Avenue was up to speed, the going-out-of-business sale at Altman's only part of the bustle on the day after Thanksgiving, the traditional opening of the Christmas-shopping season. Everywhere tourists peered at luxurious window displays and tired, hungry children demanded to be carried.
But this year, perhaps more than any other since the recession of 1974, the season's success is uncertain.
In recent months, several department stores have been put up for sale, including Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth Avenue and Bonwit Teller. Analysts and retailers say the chaos in retailing could upset consumers' patterns, sending some searching for new places to shop and causing others to cut back on spending.
B. Altman & Company will close because after a month on the auction block it was unable to attract any acceptable bidders. Last week, a bankruptcy court decided that six of its seven stores, including its flagship at Fifth Avenue and 34th Street, would be shut down after the sale that began yesterday and is scheduled to last through Jan. 29.
When the building's richly paneled doors opened at 10 A.M., the hundreds of people who had stood waiting for more than an hour let out a mild cheer. Then they poured inside in such numbers that the escalators and elevators overloaded and stopped working.
Pools of people gathered in front of them, and the ground level became so congested that some customers waited as long as 20 minutes to move, pressed chest to chest with strangers.
Facing such a crush, many turned and left only minutes after entering, including Susan Pezzella and her daughter, Tara King, who said they would try Macy's instead.
''It's a zoo in there,'' said Mrs. Pezzella, who lives in Queens. ''And 20 percent off is no bargain.''
Others braved the onslaught and came out with a look of victory on their faces.
''I have my goodies,'' said Tamara Smith of Manhattan, who bought fruit cakes and nuts as presents for her relatives. ''I'm happy.''
Eventually the fire department deemed the store overcrowded, and security guards held the crowds back at the front door. They waited for 50 people to leave before allowing another 50 in.
Inside the store, some display cases were empty. But the essential lushness - the glitter of the crystal chandeliers, the wide carpeted aisles - remained intact.
Some who shopped yesterday talked of the end of era.
''This was one of the few stores left where they were polite to you,'' said Robbie Bullen, a retired teacher from Manhattan, who said that most everything she was wearing had been bought at Altman's.
 
Winds and Windows
While the windows of B. Altman bore red and white ''Everything Must Go'' signs, the ornate mechanical Christmas displays could be seen at the Lord & Taylor department store at Fifth and 37th.
As in past years, part of the sidewalk was roped off to allow for the orderly passage of people lined up to march by the windows.
But the weather, which offered frigid winds, seemed to be particularly vengeful toward the crowd.
The sun melted the snow on the store's evergreen awnings, so most viewers, forced to file under them, were treated to gusty winds and a shower of icy droplets.
For many, this meant rearranging hats, pulling up scarves and hunching shoulders.
But 5-year-old Tria Chang took a more original route. She walked through with a folded vest on top of her head and a pretzel in her mouth.
''She is mesmerized,'' her father, Eddie Chang, said. ''It doesn't bother her at all.''
 
March of the Minks
Passing by some of the world's finest fur coats on display both in and out of the stores, hundreds of animal-rights advocates marched down Fifth Avenue from 59th to 24th Street.
Led by Bob Barker, the host of the game show ''The Price is Right,'' they chanted slogans like ''Warm hearts don't wear fur.''
Occasionally a surprised pedestrian wearing a fur coat would be surrounded by the demonstrators shouting, ''Shame, shame, shame.''
Martha Brinkman, who was in a white mink, politely took the leaflet the demonstrators handed her and tried to go about her business.
''Where do you draw the line?'' she asked. ''We wear leather shoes, eat meat. I wear the coat because it's warm.''
But other fur coat wearers were angered by the confrontations. One woman, in a brown fur, chanted back: ''Give back your lamb chops. If I had any more money, I'd buy another coat.''
Animal-rights advocates also demonstrated in dozens of other cities including Harrisburg, Pa., Corpus Christi, Tex., and Syracuse. End of Carriage Trade? At Rockefeller Center, from 48th to 51st Streets, the horse-drawn carriages did a brisk business, charging about $20 for a half-hour ride around midtown.
A new law, passed recently by the City Council, could make this the last season for the rides through the streets. The law, which the carriage industry has said it intends to challenge in court, would restrict the carriages to Central Park while raising fares.
Many carriage customers were treated to an earful of complaints by the drivers and became converts.
''I think this thing is a bummer,'' Clair Simpson Schroeder from Westchester said of the law. ''These rides are a part of New York's tradition. It's not fair.'' ''We will fight them to the end,'' said Basil Northam, the driver of her carriage. ''These animal-lover types don't understand at all. Horses work much harder on a farm. Look at my horse. He's fat.''

HEADLINE: 2 Say Company Failed to Recall Crib-Death Monitors Suspected as Faulty

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Two former employees say a com pany that makes devices intended to prevent crib deaths failed to recall units it suspected were faulty.
The former employees, Neal F. Nordling and Theodore F. Nash, said in separate interviews that they were not aware of any deaths or injuries as a result, and the company, Aequitron Medical Inc., says the machines are safe.
Their comments come as Federal investigators seek to determine whether Aequitron told the Federal Food and Drug Administration of all reports of infant deaths that might be linked to the monitors.
Mr. Nordling and Mr. Nash said Aequitron, based in Plymouth, Minn., learned in 1983 that some infant monitors might fail in high humidity. The company makes monitors for babies susceptible to apnea, a sudden stoppage of breath. 
The former employees said the company issued no warnings, made no recalls and fixed only those machines that were sent in for repairs or service.
 
Official Denies Allegations
But David B. Morse, an Aequitron director, disputed their accounts and said the machines in question were safe. He described the two men as disgruntled former employees.
Mr. Nordling and Mr. Nash said they had not spoken out before because they had only recently become aware of allegations that faulty Aequitron monitors were linked to infant deaths.
Mr. Nordling and Mr. Nash left Aequitron separately, Mr. Nordling in 1986, and Mr. Nash last year. Both have been involved in disputes with Aequitron, Mr. Nash in a challenge over unemployment benefits and Mr. Nordling in a lawsuit over trade secrets.
Mr. Nordling and Mr. Nash were among a number of former Aequitron employees, interviewed by telephone in a recent days, who painted a picture of a company that worked hard to develop high-technology machines. But Mr. Nordling and Mr. Nash said Aequitron was at times slow to acknowledge equipment problems.
 
Use by 150,000 Infants
Last year, for example, Mr. Nash said, Aequitron employees removed from view certain problem monitors that were undergoing repairs so F.D.A. inspectors would not see them. Mr. Morse, the company official, said he could not comment because he had no knowledge of any such incident.
The Aequitron apnea monitor is intended to set off an alarm when an infant's heartbeat or respiratory rate becomes erratic. Although most infants with apnea revive when awakened or shaken, a few require mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Aequitron officials say about 150,000 infants have been monitored successfully by company units.
Parents and others have asserted that 24 children died because Aequitron home monitor alarms failed to sound, company officials said. Aequitron officials dismiss those allegations and assert that the machines involved worked when tested. Also, several medical experts said that a child's being on a monitor that sounds an alarm is no guarantee that the child will survive an attack.
Mr. Nordling and Mr. Nash said Aequitron became aware of problems with its model 8200 monitor in early 1983, soon after the device was first marketed. Although the machines first appeared to operate normally, Mr. Nordling said, researchers discovered after several weeks that high room humidity caused some monitors to malfunction.
 
Lack of Plastic Coating
Mr. Nordling, a former Aequitron research and development manager, said the reason for the problem was that the circuit boards of early model 8200 machines did not have a protective plastic coating. As a result, he said, electrical problems could develop within the machine so it might give normal readings, even when a child was in distress. Mr. Nordling said Aequitron routinely corrected the problem in all machines sent in for repair or service. But he said the problem was not corrected in many machines because the company did not notify owners or users of the situation. He estimated that several hundred machines might have been affected.
Mr. Nordling and Mr. Nash, a former manufacturing engineer, said they knew of no death or serious injuries related to the monitor problem.
Mr. Morse, the Aequitron director, said that the machines were safe and that there was never any direct proof that high humidity affected the devices. He also said that none of deaths allegedly involving Aequitron devices occurred under conditions involving high humidity. But he acknowledged that in mid-1983, Aequitron, at Mr. Nordling's suggestion, began coating circuit boards. Mr. Morse said Aequitron officials believed that a recall of the affected units was unnecessary. ''We had no evidence that indicated it was a significant hazard to anyone,'' he said.
Mr. Morse said Mr. Nash was unhappy with Aequitron because the company had unsuccessfully challenged his request for unemployment benefits.
Mr. Nordling resigned from Aequitron in early 1986 to start his own company, Nonin Medical Inc., also based in Plymouth, Minn. In late 1987, Aequitron filed suit against Nonin accusing it, Mr. Nordling and three other former Aequitron engineers of misappropriating trade secrets. Mr. Nordling said he and his associates denied the allegations.

HEADLINE: Arts Complexes Are Thriving in Their Maturity in the East and West;
Los Angeles Music Center, at 25, Is the Cities Cultural Hub

BYLINE: By ALJEAN HARMETZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 24

 BODY:
The birth of the Los Angeles Music Center 25 years ago is being celebrated with fanfares and flourishes this fall.Three months of celebration will culminate on Dec. 6, the exact anniversary date, with 25 high school bands and an audience of 5,000 singing ''Happy Birthday.''
When the center opened in 1964 -built at the considerable cost of $34 million - it was seen as a bold attempt to revitalize a decaying downtown and to breathe artistic life into a city that didn't seem to have any.
There is little doubt that the Music Center has fulfilled its role as the cultural hub of Los Angeles. Six companies now call the center home: the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Joffrey Ballet L.A./N.Y., the Los Angeles Master Chorale, the Center Theater Group/Mark Taper Forum, the Center Theater Group/Ahmanson and the Los Angeles Music Center Opera. 
The center's three auditoriums -the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the Ahmanson and the Mark Taper Forum - have a combined annual operating budget of $80 million. Approximately two million people attend performances every year at the center, while another two million attend programs presented as far away as Palm Springs by the orchestra, the opera and the theaters.
 
The City Sprawled Away
Yet in 1964, it was considered a dangerous gamble to build three theaters downtown on seven acres of Bunker Hill. Physically, the city had long since sprawled away from downtown, with the richest suburbs a dozen miles to the west.
''The whole place was such a cultural wasteland when my husband and I came here in 1958 that we said we would stay a maximum of three years,'' said Claire Segal, director of public affairs for the Music Center from 1979 to 1987.
The mandate of the Music Center was to create a showcase for the serious arts that would give the city cultural credibility.
''It's certainly the center of establishment music in Los Angeles,'' said Robert Winter, professor of music at the University of California at Los Angeles. ''The Los Angeles Philharmonic is our one world-class orchestra, and it's one of the more adventurous major orchestras in the country.''
''But in a curious way, the music center doesn't have a lot of flavor or character,'' Mr. Winter continued. ''There's a lack of real identity. The Master Chorale hasn't dominated the choral scene. The Ambassador series in Pasadena does a better job of bringing major visiting groups here. In a city as sprawling as Los Angeles, however, it's probably not fair to expect any one site to dominate the musical scene.''
 
Opera Is in Fourth Season
The Philharmonic is indeed counted among the nation's major orchestras. The opera, the center's youngest venture, opened its fourth season in promising fashion in September with Placido Domingo conducting a well-received production of ''Tosca,'' which starred Maria Ewing.
For serious theatergoers, the Mark Taper Forum, under the direction of Gordon Davidson, was for years the only game in town. If the Taper has received mixed reviews in recent seasons, it nevertheless paved the way for other serious theaters, including the Los Angeles Theater Center, the South Coast Repertory, the revitalized Old Globe in San Diego and the La Jolla Playhouse.
In contrast, the Ahmanson has struggled for credibility. An awkward theater with bad acoustics, it has gone through many changes of management. The Ahmanson, which has been inhabited by ''Phantom of the Opera'' since May 31 and probably will be until the spring of 1991, is presenting its 1989-90 subscription season at the Dolittle Theater in Hollywood. It led with ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,'' starring Glenda Jackson and John Lithgow.
 
Economic Stimulus
If the center has helped rid the city of its ''cultural wasteland'' label, its effect on the downtown area it overlooks is more complex.
Financially, it has helped stimulate economic development. According to Esther Wachtell, the center's chief operating officer, the value of the original seven acres of land was $2 million. A parcel of the same size donated to the center two years ago by Los Angeles County was valued at $50 million.
The center's stately hilltop plaza, adorned with a dancing fountain surrounding a Lipschitz sculpture, is isolated from the city below. But the center's presence has encouraged the establishment downtown of the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Temporary Contemporary, the Children's Museum, and the Los Angeles Theater Center.
''When the Music Center was put up, there was very little significant nighttime activity downtown,'' said Richard Sherwood, past president of the Center Theater Group and current chairman of its executive committee. ''It's still not necessarily a place you want to be wandering on foot outside of the cultural centers, but the restaurant business is now quite lively.''
 
A Business Attraction
Mr. Sherwood, a partner in O'Melveny & Myers, one of the oldest and largest law firms in the city, believes the center ''attracts businesses to Los Angeles, a place that is seen to have major theater, major music and major art.''
Speaking of the opera's decision to start with opulent, expensive productions, Mrs. Wachtell said: ''We can't sell anything to Los Angeles audiences unless it's world class. That's the only way to succeed here. And then you work out the financial picture.''
The Music Center was the creation of one woman, Dorothy (Buffy) Chandler, who used her social and political influence as the wife of the publisher of The Los Angeles Times and her considerable powers of persuasion to raise $20 million and to talk Los Angeles County into putting up $14 million.
Anybody's money was welcome, and her true value, says a promotional book published by the Music Center on its 10th anniversay, was her ability to size up donors for what they could afford to give, not what they wanted to give. In the book, Mrs. Chandler is quoted as saying that she went after ''new money, the Hollywood group, new leaders in aerospace and oil and savings and loans and a substantial Jewish community.'' Previously, culture had been considered the province of WASP families from Pasadena and Hancock Park.
 
New Hall for the Philharmonic
What will the next 25 years bring? Lillian Disney, the widow of Walt Disney, gave $50 million in 1987 for construction of a concert hall across the street. The Philharmonic will move to the new hall in 1994, leaving the Chandler Pavilion to opera and dance.
The center is trying to broaden its appeal to the city's changing population. For several years the Mark Taper has done one or two pieces of nontraditional programming annually. A recent example was ''Sansei,'' a play about third-generation Japanese Americans, created by the rock band Hiroshima and financed by an Asian volunteer group.
Mrs. Wachtell sees the opening of Walt Disney Hall as an opportunity for the center to bring such attractions as Grand Kabuki and Hispanic cultural offerings to the Chandler Pavilion.
''We are probably already the largest multi-cultural community in the United States,'' Mrs. Wachtell said. ''Approximately 86 languages are spoken in Los Angeles schools. We will have to bring diverse populations into the Music Center artistically and on our boards of directors.''
