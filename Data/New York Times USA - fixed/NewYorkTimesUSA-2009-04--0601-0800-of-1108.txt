HEADLINE: Regulate Me, Please

BYLINE: By TOM WILSON. 
Tom Wilson is the chief executive of Allstate.

 BODY:
THERE are plenty of people singling out causes for the collapse of the financial markets, and conveniently, the source of the problem is usually someone else. But accountability lies with all of us -- the insurance industry, regulators, banks and credit rating agencies. The insurance companies that wrote credit default swaps were happy not to be regulated. Insurance regulators didn't expand their oversight to ensure the solvency of these companies. Banking regulators, banks and credit rating agencies did not properly assess the strength of issuers and readily accepted these complex derivatives. 
 My company, Allstate, serves more than 17 million American households. While we played only a small role in unregulated insurance markets, we have a duty to help stabilize the financial system. It was, after all, an insurance product that contributed to the risk that almost brought down the global economy. 
 Insurance is defined as coverage by contract in which one party agrees to indemnify or reimburse another for loss. The credit default swaps written by American International Group are clearly insurance since they are a contractual obligation by A.I.G. to pay should there be a default on a security. It should be no surprise that a big insurer like A.I.G. would be a major issuer of credit default swaps. What is surprising is the claim that insurance did not contribute to the recent market failures, and therefore insurers don't need to consider how to prevent them from happening again. 
 Unlike banks or investment houses, insurance companies are not regulated by the federal government. Instead, they are regulated by individual states, which lack the expertise to properly oversee rapid innovation or systemic risks. Business leaders must work with the government to create a new regulatory structure. All companies that create risk for the financial markets need to be in ''the pool'' of federal regulation, including companies like Allstate. A good start would be for Congress to eliminate the hodgepodge of state regulatory systems by establishing a federal regulator for national insurance companies.
 Such a sophisticated federal insurance regulator would oversee the financial stability of large companies. We should also consider expanding private insurance to protect personal savings from systemic risks. And we need to establish a federal agency that would be empowered to deal with any large failing financial institutions, outside of bankruptcy. We must all accept responsibility for our current situation, and work together to broaden the scope of federal regulation to protect both consumers and financial markets.
 Business and government leaders must avoid the trap of diminished expectations and continue to demand the best of ourselves and our fellow Americans. Millions of hard-working families are counting on us to get this right.

HEADLINE: Lenders Thwart Ohio Law Intended to Limit High Interest on Payday Loans

BYLINE: By BOB DRIEHAUS

DATELINE: CINCINNATI 

 BODY:
An Ohio law intended to cap interest rates on payday loans at 28 percent has been thwarted by lenders who have found ways to charge up to 680 percent interest, according to lawmakers who are preparing a second round of legislation. 
 The law, the Short-Term Loan Act, was enacted last spring and upheld in a statewide referendum in November. It decreased the maximum annual interest rate to 28 percent, from the previous 391 percent. Loans typically had terms of two weeks and were secured by a postdated check and proof of employment. 
 But more than 1,000 stores have obtained licenses to issue short-term loans under different laws that permit higher rates, according to a report by the Housing Research and Advocacy Center in Cleveland, which has worked to lower interest rates.
 Using one of those laws, the Mortgage Loan Act, some lenders charge interest and fees of $26.10 on a 14-day $100 loan, which amounts to a 680 percent annual interest rate, the center said. Others used another law, the Small Loan Act, to charge up to 423 percent on a $100 loan. Some of the more creative approaches included issuing the loan in the form of a check and charging to cash it in the same store and charging for credit checks.
 ''This is just more deceptive gouging behavior from an industry that is known all too well for getting people into a cycle of debt,'' said Bill Faith, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio, which is working with state officials to lower interest rates and eliminate fees on short-term loans. Mr. Faith's group, which is based in Columbus, found that the average customer got 13 loans a year and was continually saddled with high interest payments.
 It is not unusual for lenders to find ways to avoid new state regulations, said Uriah King, a spokesman for the Center for Responsible Lending in Durham, N.C., which supports rate caps. Georgia, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania had to pass a second round of legislation or aggressively enforce regulations after their initial reform efforts, Mr. King said.
 ''Payday lenders are very aggressive about circumventing the law,'' Mr. King said. ''It takes real will of the regulators to ensure that the will of the legislatures are met.''
 Representative Matt Lundy, a Democrat and chairman of the consumer affairs and economic protection committee in the Ohio House, has studied other states' experiences, and he said he was preparing a bill aimed at ''plugging the loopholes.'' The bill would create a minimum six-month term for loans of $1,000 or less and eliminate all fees that would effectively push interest rates above 28 percent.
 ''We have a clear mandate from the voters to make sure that their will is enforced,'' Mr. Lundy said. ''They wanted the payday lenders reined in.'' 
 Community Financial Services Association of America, a Washington group that represents lenders, said most businesses were charging less than 628 percent interest. More typically, it said, they are charging 159 percent for a $300 or $600 loan. 
 The group said lenders turned to alternative ways of doing business rather than closing their doors, as they would have been forced to do under the 28 percent rate cap.
 ''Bottom line is during the 2008 legislative debate over payday lending in Ohio, lenders were encouraged to operate under the Small Loan Act. Now they are doing just that but being accused of operating under a loophole,'' said Lyndsey Medsker, a spokeswoman for the association.

HEADLINE: How To Raise Our I.Q.

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Poor people have I.Q.'s significantly lower than those of rich people, and the awkward conventional wisdom has been that this is in large part a function of genetics.
 After all, a series of studies seemed to indicate that I.Q. is largely inherited. Identical twins raised apart, for example, have I.Q.'s that are remarkably similar. They are even closer on average than those of fraternal twins who grow up together.
 If intelligence were deeply encoded in our genes, that would lead to the depressing conclusion that neither schooling nor antipoverty programs can accomplish much. Yet while this view of I.Q. as overwhelmingly inherited has been widely held, the evidence is growing that it is, at a practical level, profoundly wrong. Richard Nisbett, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, has just demolished this view in a superb new book, ''Intelligence and How to Get It,'' which also offers terrific advice for addressing poverty and inequality in America. 
 Professor Nisbett provides suggestions for transforming your own urchins into geniuses -- praise effort more than achievement, teach delayed gratification, limit reprimands and use praise to stimulate curiosity -- but focuses on how to raise America's collective I.Q. That's important, because while I.Q. doesn't measure pure intellect -- we're not certain exactly what it does measure -- differences do matter, and a higher I.Q. correlates to greater success in life. 
 Intelligence does seem to be highly inherited in middle-class households, and that's the reason for the findings of the twins studies: very few impoverished kids were included in those studies. But Eric Turkheimer of the University of Virginia has conducted further research demonstrating that in poor and chaotic households, I.Q. is minimally the result of genetics -- because everybody is held back. 
 ''Bad environments suppress children's I.Q.'s,'' Professor Turkheimer said. 
 One gauge of that is that when poor children are adopted into upper-middle-class households, their I.Q.'s rise by 12 to 18 points, depending on the study. For example, a French study showed that children from poor households adopted into upper-middle-class homes averaged an I.Q. of 107 by one test and 111 by another. Their siblings who were not adopted averaged 95 on both tests. 
 Another indication of malleability is that I.Q. has risen sharply over time. Indeed, the average I.Q. of a person in 1917 would amount to only 73 on today's I.Q. test. Half the population of 1917 would be considered mentally retarded by today's measurements, Professor Nisbett says.
 Good schooling correlates particularly closely to higher I.Q.'s. One indication of the importance of school is that children's I.Q.'s drop or stagnate over the summer months when they are on vacation (particularly for kids whose parents don't inflict books or summer programs on them).
 Professor Nisbett strongly advocates intensive early childhood education because of its proven ability to raise I.Q. and improve long-term outcomes. The Milwaukee Project, for example, took African-American children considered at risk for mental retardation and assigned them randomly either to a control group that received no help or to a group that enjoyed intensive day care and education from 6 months of age until they left to enter first grade.
 By age 5, the children in the program averaged an I.Q. of 110, compared with 83 for children in the control group. Even years later in adolescence, those children were still 10 points ahead in I.Q.
 Professor Nisbett suggests putting less money into Head Start, which has a mixed record, and more into these intensive childhood programs. He also notes that schools in the Knowledge Is Power Program (better known as KIPP) have tested exceptionally well and favors experiments to see if they can be scaled up.
 Another proven intervention is to tell junior-high-school students that I.Q. is expandable, and that their intelligence is something they can help shape. Students exposed to that idea work harder and get better grades. That's particularly true of girls and math, apparently because some girls assume that they are genetically disadvantaged at numbers; deprived of an excuse for failure, they excel.
 ''Some of the things that work are very cheap,'' Professor Nisbett noted. ''Convincing junior-high kids that intelligence is under their control -- you could argue that that should be in the junior-high curriculum right now.''
 The implication of this new research on intelligence is that the economic-stimulus package should also be an intellectual-stimulus program. By my calculation, if we were to push early childhood education and bolster schools in poor neighborhoods, we just might be able to raise the United States collective I.Q. by as much as one billion points.
 That should be a no-brainer.

HEADLINE: Immediate Attention, or Not?

BYLINE: By CATHERINE SAINT LOUIS

 BODY:
UNTIL the economy brightens, some parents are postponing their children's orthodontics. Several experts, including Dr. Raymond George Sr., the president of the American Association of Orthodontists, were asked which problems need immediate action. 
 WHERE TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE Overjet, when the top teeth flare outward, represents a ''risk of trauma,'' said Dr. David Cordes, who teaches at the University of Connecticut School of Dental Medicine. If children fall or are hit with a ball and crack a tooth, then a root canal and a crown may be required. 
 MILD TO MODERATE UNDERBITE When the bottom jaw is out in front of the upper, it's a skeletal problem that's correctable with braces at 7 or 8 years old, said Dr. Benjamin Burris of Arkansas. But if you wait until your child is older, jaw surgery could be in store.
 IMPACTED TEETH Losing baby teeth early can cause back teeth to drift into spots where adult teeth are meant to come in. Then they become impacted. Braces can create room for those teeth to grow out, Dr. George said. 
 CASES WHERE WAITING WON'T HURT Parents often ask Dr. Burris if their child needs orthodontics. ''Orthodontics is not a need,'' he tells them. ''Food, shelter, those are needs. Orthodontics, by and large, is a want.'' Dr. Cordes said mild cases don't demand quick action if they are cosmetic rather than trauma risk, or a functional issue where chewing is troublesome. Many orthodontists offer free consultations, he said, so why not check?

HEADLINE: OPEC CUTS FORECAST FOR OIL DEMAND

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its estimate for global oil demand for 2009 as a slowing global economy eroded consumption. OPEC said demand would drop by 1.37 million barrels a day in 2009, to an average of 84.2 million barrels a day. Demand is falling fastest in the developed nations that are part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to OPEC. The cartel, the source of more than a third of the world's oil, has now joined the International Energy Agency and the United States government in lowering global oil demand forecasts in recent weeks.

HEADLINE: China Sees a Slight Lift In Spring Factory Orders

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China 

 BODY:
Chinese manufacturers say orders are starting to recover from their steep plunge over the winter, but demand from Europe and, especially, the United States remains anemic.
 Although exporters here for the opening of Asia's biggest trade fair cited a small uptick in orders for the coming months, the overall Chinese economy slowed in the first quarter of this year mainly because of slower exports. The National Bureau of Statistics announced on Thursday morning that the economy grew 6.1 percent in the first quarter, roughly in line with expectations.
 The first quarter growth rate means that the Chinese economy expanded much faster over the winter than any other major world economy, although more slowly than many in China have come to expect, and slower than its 6.8 percent pace in the fourth quarter. 
 China's slowdown has been felt most keenly by export-oriented factories and their workers, which are heavily concentrated in the Shanghai area and here in Guangzhou, in southeastern China. China's industrial output was 8.3 percent higher in March than a year earlier, half the pace of early last year because many export factories have closed and others are operating with reduced hours. 
 By contrast, ''domestic consumption has been holding up very well,'' said Frank Gong, an economist in the Hong Kong offices of JPMorgan, with auto sales showing particular strength. Retail sales jumped 14.7 percent in March from a year earlier, the government said Thursday.
 Chinese banks are pumping out loans at a record pace to stimulate domestic investment and consumption, and the government is spending heavily on new railroads and other projects. But the big question hanging over the Chinese economy is when overseas demand for Chinese goods will recover.
 As buyers and suppliers gathered here from around the world Wednesday for the opening of the Canton Fair, almost no one said that sales had recovered to the levels of a year ago. Instead, retailers who drew down their inventories to almost nothing over the winter are reluctantly buying the minimum quantities of goods needed to keep shelves from becoming bare.
 And while exporters to Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia described clear rebounds in orders compared with the depths plumbed in December and January, Chinese exporters to Europe and particularly the United States were much more glum.
 Still, compared with the last session of the Canton Fair in late October, there was a clear sense that the worst fears of a collapse in global trade had not been borne out.
 ''October was the month when we could not see a future,'' said Lin Minli, the sales manager of a Guangzhou trading company that sells tricycles and other children's toys, mainly to South America and the Middle East.
 Mr. Lin's sales are still down more than 30 percent from a year ago, but that is a big improvement from the 75 percent drop in October. The improvement ''is because the inventories of our clients have been depleted,'' he said, adding that ''with the recent rise in raw material prices, some customers also started putting in more orders because they were afraid prices would rise.''
 Chris Sun, a sales manager of Hangzhou Xinweiye Tools, a maker of saw bits in Hangzhou, said that while exports were still down 30 percent, that was an improvement from the winter. Orders in the last several weeks suggest further recovery ahead, she added. ''February and March were not good. April does look good; I think the world economy is getting better,'' Ms. Sun said, adding that ''the United States market is not so good, but Europe is better.''
 Export-dependent countries in Asia in particular have suffered heavily from the global economic downturn. Many Western retailers halted orders over the winter and drew down their stockpiles instead; even exporters that did have orders often ran into difficulty finding trade financing because of the global credit crisis.
 Both of those problems now appear to have eased, so the inventory-led plunge in exports appears to be abating. 
 China announced last week that its exports had fallen 17.1 percent in March from a year earlier, a steep decline by most standards but better than the drop of 25.7 percent in February. 
 But Dong Tao, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Credit Suisse, said it was much less clear whether consumer demand for China's goods had really rebounded. ''Whether this pickup in demand is sustainable, I'm a little more skeptical,'' he said.
 In interviews with managers from more than a dozen Chinese companies in a wide range of industries, clear regional patterns of demand were apparent.
 Industrialized countries have tended to lead the world out of previous recessions. But in a reversal of the usual north-south split, it seems as if emerging markets, often dependent on commodity exports to China, are faring better this time.
 Jet Power International, which makes paper-towel dispensers and other bathroom products in Dongguan, China, is faring poorly because it relies on the American market. Sales are still falling as American building managers buy the minimum number of products they need for replacements while new construction remains weak, said Alex Yu, the company's marketing manager.
 Jet Power just laid off 100 of its 300 workers, and another 50 have been placed on unpaid furlough that could last until June, Mr. Yu said, adding that he was skeptical that other exporters to the United States were doing much better. ''Those optimistic ones, they are telling lies,'' he said.
 Pessimism among exporters to the United States is consistent with a report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday that retail sales fell 1.1 percent in the United States in March. 
 Hotel room rates in Guangzhou are down 40 percent compared with the spring session of the Canton Fair last year, but rates for the four- and five-star rooms occupied mainly by Americans and other Westerners here are down even more on very weak demand.
 Exporters to developing countries were more upbeat Wednesday. Fujian Yuandong Electric Motor Group in Fuan, China, has seen a recovery in demand for its electric pumps in Africa, Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia in the last month, said Orchid Chen, the company's sale's director. Sales had been down 40 percent over the winter compared with a year earlier but are now down 20 percent, she said.
 Chinese exporters may be benefiting to some extent from a global version of the ''Wal-Mart effect,'' in which customers turn to lower-cost vendors during times of economic distress.

HEADLINE: Choose Your Weapon: Exotic Martial Arts

BYLINE: By MANDY KATZ

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to the popularity of judo, tae kwon do and other combat disciplines, the math says it all: Asian martial arts studios in the United States outnumber Dunkin' Donuts outlets by more than three to one. Black Belt magazine counts some 20,000 studios nationwide and estimates that perhaps two million Americans practice Eastern fighting disciplines weekly or more, said the executive editor Robert Young. Whether for sport or self-defense, Asian martial arts are about as alien as, well, glazed doughnuts. 
 But there are a handful of esoteric styles that are not nearly so common. While anyone can try them, they seem to attract experienced martial artists seeking higher levels of skill and understanding. These disciplines can tweak conventional notions of athletic prowess. Masters of the Zenlike Japanese archery called kyudo, for instance, stress the target's unimportance. In the Filipino street-fighting arts known as arnis and kali, bettering oneself is as important as besting an opponent, said Rich Acosta, an instructor in Manhattan and New Jersey.
Perhaps no fighting cadre mastered as diverse an arsenal as Japan's samurai warriors, who handed down some half dozen disciplines melding agility with mental focus. In addition to swords, samurai learned to fight with jo, or four-foot oak staffs; bow and arrow; and long wooden staves called naginata. 
 Whether based on mayhem or meditation, most martial arts offer physical benefits, said Pete McCall, an exercise physiologist with the American Council on Exercise. Their ''explosive'' lengthening and contracting of muscles -- ''like a spark plug in an engine'' -- improves strength and dynamic flexibility, he said, while ''using a number of different body segments at one time, moving and shifting your center of gravity,'' builds core strength. 
 Martial arts themselves can strengthen out-of-shape participants, but elite practice usually requires outside conditioning. ''The ancient program for the Chinese military was to be able to run 90 kilometers in a day and be able to crawl through infested areas,'' said Stanley Henning, who has taught Chinese combat traditions for 40 years. 
 Here are some of the best fighting arts you may never have heard of, all taught in and around New York City.
 Kyudo: It's Not About the Target
 It can be surprising in Japanese archery to see a shooter taking aim a mere bow's length from her target. While that distance can stretch, kyudo is not about the bull's-eye. ''You have to have this awareness of what you're doing but not be judging it,'' explained Vivi Spicer, a Maryland curator, as she trained in her yard. Indoors, she popped in a video profile of Kanjuro Shibata, her school's master, who looks like a Japanese Jack LaLanne but sounds like a mystic. ''A master does not try to hit the target,'' Mr. Shibata intoned, adding that ''if he has a good heart, he will hit the target even if he is blind.'' 
 Kyudo is more stillness than action. ''Every movement of the hands, of the body, of the feet, is prescribed'' by sequences analogous to iaido's kata, Ms. Spicer said. Even releasing the arrow is less a decision than something ''that happens when the movement is right, like fruit dropping.''
 ''It's a standing meditation,'' added a visiting instructor, Jim Boorstein, an architect who practices kyudo in New York. Kyudo can improve posture and maintain strength, Mr. Boorstein said, but more important, it helps ''heighten your ability to notice, and that's what we're all trying to do in our lives.'' 
 Mr. Boorstein's practice group's site is tokokyudojo.org. Kali, Arnis and Eskrima: A Filipino Solution
 Of all the disciplines covered here, the arts of kali, arnis and eskrima, from the Philippines, are perhaps the most vigorous, employing an almost balletic violence to prepare for rough nights on the town. It's no accident that their weapons -- rattan sticks, wood daggers and the hard side of one's hand -- can be approximated by items you might have on hand, like umbrellas, bottles or even a pen, Mr. Acosta said. 
 Classes consist of sparring and grappling drills called offensiva-defensiva, usually practiced in pairs. But instructors eschew rigid sequences. ''You have to learn the pattern, and then break the pattern,'' Mr. Acosta explained, because ''a real attack is random chaos.''
 The regimens attract few women in this country, Mr. Acosta conceded, but appeal to both genders in their homeland. ''Most people like the Filipino martial arts,'' or FMA, ''because size doesn't really matter,'' said Steven Dowd of Fallon, Nev., who publishes the online FMA Digest. ''No matter how old you are, or how disabled, it can be adapted.'' 
 Mr. Acosta's Web site is kuntawkali.com.
 Xing Yi: Power From the Body's Core
 No photo montage of China is complete without a sunrise shot of elderly people tracing the deliberate gestures of tai chi in a public park. It would be easy to imagine tai chi's sister art, xing yi (pronounced shing-ee), as similarly pacific, but it's not. 
 More than 1,000 years ago in northern China's hinterlands, there were no police, so xing yi emerged for self-defense, said Mr. Henning, the martial arts historian. 
 ''If you didn't take care of your village, no one else was going to do it,'' he said. 
 Meaning ''shape'' or ''will'' boxing, xing yi relies on power from the body's core, wielded in joint locks, throws and weapons practice, as well as solo and paired open-hand sequences. It builds strong muscular ''roots'' in the legs, hips and torso, said Mark Li, a sixth-generation instructor and an economics graduate student at George Mason University. 
 Underlying all is the mind-body concept of chi , a sort of healing internal airflow. Aligning one's chi -- as, for example, through breathing exercises -- matters as much as the hands, feet and body. ''When your chi is able to flow, it improves the function of your whole body,'' Mr. Li said. For the Long Island studio of Mr. Li's father, Grandmaster Li Tai-Liang, litailiang.homestead.com.
 Iaido: Not for the Weak-Kneed
 The opponents are imaginary in the samurai martial arts form known as iaido (pronounced ee-eye-doe), an unlikely combination of dancelike movements and a nasty-looking weapon. Iaido is especially appealing, perhaps, to anyone who's ever practiced tough-guy poses in the bathroom mirror.
 Iaido can be a ''moving meditation,'' but its operative idea is deadly, explained Noboru Kataoka, one of its leading masters and a martial arts film actor. ''The moment you draw the sword, you have to kill your opponent,'' he said. Each of its swordsmanship routines, called kata, evokes a specific peril, like fighting in a low-ceilinged tunnel, sparring in the dark, or being jumped from two sides. 
 The routines may be imagined but, in real life, Mr. Kataoka has used his menacing iaido mien to face down would-be muggers, he said.
 While not for the weak-kneed -- from katas to kowtowing, all the kneeling, squatting and springing could challenge a cheerleader -- iaido suits students seeking less strenuous practice, Mr. Kataoka said. But its suppressed vigor can be challenging, as indicated in a recent Midtown class of eight men aged 17 to about 70. Each proceeds at his own pace, creating an unsynchronized whirl of waving, whistling blades, demonstrating why iaido is best practiced in small groups.
 Mr. Kataoka's studio is the New York City Kendo Club (www.nyckendo.com).
 Naginata: The Art of Fighting
 Developed a thousand years ago as warriors' pole-arms, naginata later passed to samurai wives for defense. Eventually, ''a fine naginata became a requisite item in the dowry of a samurai bride,'' said Ray Sosnowski, a Maryland engineer, Zen lay priest and instructor of weapons arts. In 1912, naginata was introduced in Japanese high schools, where it remains a staple of girls' physical education. Though Japanese men disdain it, perhaps half the roughly 200 United States naginata practitioners are male, Mr. Sosnowski estimated. 
 Today's naginata are slender and lightweight, up to seven and a half feet long, with curved tips of wood or bamboo. Their use -- to batter, stab or hook an opponent -- makes sense for women, as it relies on ''the centripetal force of rotating hips, of swinging arms, and of the long, rotating weapon'' rather than upper-body strength, Mr. Sosnowski explained. 
 Combat value aside, naginata offers a window into Japanese culture, according to a Virginia-based instructor, Fran Vall. ''There are people who are fighters, and there are people who are out to learn the art and beauty of it,'' Ms. Vall said.

Investors Remain
 Worried Over Citi
 Shouldn't Citigroup's credit be a sure thing? After all, the government has extended unprecedented support to the megabank, including a $45 billion taxpayer equity buffer and a partial guarantee on some $300 billion of toxic assets. 
 Despite that, insurance against default costs more than twice as much for Citi as it does for Bank of America, its struggling rival and another big aid recipient. Even the full might of the government doesn't seem enough to dispel investors' worries over Citi. 
 Yes, analysts expect the bank to post a small first-quarter loss when it announces results on Friday. But that does not completely explain the magnitude of the market's credit concerns. The cost to protect $10 million of Citi's senior debt against default for five years is about $570,000 a year. The cost of similar protection for Bank of America, which analysts expect to eke out a small first-quarter profit, is around $270,000.
 That's despite a tacit consensus among the Group of 20 finance ministers recently that governments should protect bank bondholders. Fears of a Lehman Brothers-like crisis, as well as huge losses among systemically important entities that own bank bonds, like insurance companies, have so far kept authorities from forcing lenders to share the pain.
 It may be that investors now see Citi as too big and troubled for the government to support ad infinitum. The bank has $232 billion of senior debt, according to Barclays' estimates, topping Bank of America's $184 billion and JPMorgan Chase's $137 billion. 
 That figure may not seem crushing when compared with the $5 trillion of debt and guarantees the government was forced to more or less explicitly make when it seized the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac last September. But those entities have public policy mandates and the support of powerful lawmakers.
 Citi doesn't. And the government's attempts to fight the economic downturn with huge monetary and fiscal infusions in recent months have strained its coffers and dented its once-unimpeachable credit. Investors may be right to wonder whether it will continue to view bailing out Citi's bondholders as a top priority -- and even if it does, whether it can afford to do so for much longer.
 Stress Test Disclosures
 The government seems to be slowly coming to grips with what to do with the results of the bank stress tests. Regulators want to reassure the market that the country's 19 biggest banks can ride out a recession, with or without more federal help. But until recently, they did not want to publish the results, which rather defeats their purpose. 
 Now they are considering releasing some information. But it would be much better to get it all out in the open. 
 Just revealing final grades, for example, won't cut it. In fact, it could prompt investors to dump shares in those companies considered least stable and thus lead to the bank runs that the stress tests are supposedly meant to avoid. That could sap what fragile confidence there is in the financial system and plunge markets back into despair. 
 Instead, regulators should make much more information public. First, they should lay out what happens to each bank's capital under the most-severe stress situation, they should define what type of capital they are focused on, and say how low they are comfortable with allowing that capital to fall. 
 Second, they should detail what their assumptions are for default and recovery rates on various asset types and whether those assumptions are national, regional or local. That will be a crucial factor for mortgages, for example.
 Of course, releasing a plethora of data alone also risks runs on the most troubled banks. 
 That is why the government needs a more robust strategy to inject capital into any weak banks. The current plan gives banks six months to raise the necessary money in the private market. But that adds to the uncertainty. If the Obama administration is unwilling to let any of these 19 banks fail, it should scrap that window in favor of offering to backstop any issuance of securities needed to bolster capital right away, which might also help stretch the dwindling resources of its Troubled Asset Relief Program.
 Combined, these measures should stave off too much panic selling, set clear boundaries and give private investors enough information to determine whether and how they want to invest in the banking sector. After all, enticing them back in ought to be the ultimate goal of government intervention. But it requires a good dose of openness.

HEADLINE: Refinancing Deal May Save Low-Cost Housing at Starrett City

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
For nearly three years, Starrett City, the 140-acre apartment complex on Jamaica Bay in Brooklyn, has been at the center of a citywide battle to preserve existing housing for working- and middle-class families.
 Tenant groups and elected officials stymied efforts by the longtime owners to reap over a billion dollars through a sale of the complex during a wildly exuberant real estate market. And a second attempt to sell the complex earlier this year also failed.
 Now the owners are working with federal, state and city officials to put together a deal that would enable the owners to reap a $200 million profit, while the 5,881 apartments at the complex would remain affordable for many New Yorkers for the next 30 years. The deal still requires state legislation and federal approval, but Deborah VanAmerongen, the state housing commissioner, said she was hopeful for a positive outcome. 
 Senator Charles E. Schumer said the proposal was ''a way out of the woods'' for Starrett City residents. ''Despite the difficult economic times, this arrangement will ensure that Starrett City stays affordable for current and future tenants and allows for vital upgrades to the entire complex to be completed,'' he said.
 Mr. Schumer called it a ''groundbreaking agreement'' that could be applied to other subsidized housing complexes in the city. In recent years, tenant groups have bemoaned the loss of lower-income housing as private equity firms bought working-class housing in Harlem, East New York and Queens with plans to make a profit by converting rent-regulated apartments to market rents.
 Starrett City, between Canarsie and East New York, has about 14,000 tenants. It is the largest federally subsidized complex in the nation, with its own post office, power plant, shopping center, synagogue and churches.
 The owners of the complex, Starrett City Associates, are meeting with tenants and elected officials on Thursday to explain the tentative plan.
 Under the terms of the deal, the owners would refinance the complex for roughly $500 million, or 80 percent of its value. That sum is far less than the $1.3 billion a potential buyer offered in 2007, before the buyer was effectively disqualified by federal officials. But it would enable the owners to pay off their old $234.4 million interest-free mortgage and other fees and take a profit estimated at roughly $200 million, according to housing officials and real estate executives. 
 The owners would also set aside more than $40 million for work on the facades of the 46 towers in the complex and for capital projects. Since the money would come from the refinancing, the capital work would not lead to increases in rent. State officials say they created a mechanism that would allow the owners to make a greater annual profit shortly after making the improvements.
 Starrett City Associates would also pledge to remain in the state's middle-class housing program, Mitchell-Lama, and maintain rents affordable to lower-income residents.
 ''We've worked very hard to get to this point,'' said Priscilla Almodovar, president of the State Housing Finance Agency. ''It's a great outcome for everyone.''
 Separately, the owners could develop housing and retail space on vacant land at the complex in keeping with city zoning. The complex would continue to receive a property tax abatement worth an estimated $12 million a year.
 ''If this works out,'' said Martin McLaughlin, a spokesman for the owners, ''it would guarantee 30 more years of affordable housing.''
 New York Acorn, a community building organization that has worked with the Starrett City tenant association, expressed ''cautious optimism,'' but declined to endorse the plan without seeing the language that guarantees long-term affordability and a program for capital improvements. The organization also wants to see an ''ironclad'' commitment from the owners to continue the existing tenant services and amenities, as well as greater cooperation with tenants.
 ''I'm hopeful we'll get there so that this can be a model for preserving affordability at Mitchell-Lama buildings throughout the state,'' said Ismene Speliotis, executive director of New York Acorn Housing Company. ''But we're not there yet.''
 Starrett City Associates plans to submit legislation in Albany that would amend the state's housing laws, allowing owners of Mitchell-Lama complexes to refinance for a sum greater than the original project cost.
 The Legislature can be an unpredictable and treacherous place given the current squabbles between and among Republicans and Democrats. But Vito Lopez, chairman of the Assembly's housing committee, said it might be possible to get the proposed legislation approved by the time the current session ends on June 30. He said the owners must establish a sizable reserve fund for maintenance, repairs and upgrades with money from the refinancing. Otherwise, he said, the complex could fall into disrepair.
 ''I think we can work out a solution,'' Mr. Lopez said Wednesday.
 The owners also need to work out a number of issues with the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which provides rent subsidies for about 60 percent of the apartments.

HEADLINE: U.S. Offers Aid for California's Water Woes

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER and JESSE McKINLEY; Felicity Barringer reported from Rancho Cordova, and Jesse McKinley from San Francisco.

DATELINE: RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif. 

 BODY:
As part of the federal stimulus plan, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar offered California $260 million on Wednesday to patch the Central Valley's decrepit water-delivery system and protect its threatened fish. 
 He also offered his good offices as a mediator in the fierce battles to come over how water will be allocated, and to whom. 
 ''There is a lot of passion around these issues,'' Mr. Salazar said at a news conference with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger at Mather Air Field near here. ''It is my wish that the Department of Interior can play a helpful role.'' 
 But he said he would not try to impose solutions on the state and its many water districts, even though much of California's available surface water is controlled by the Bureau of Reclamation, an Interior Department agency.
 The $260 million, to be overseen by the state's Department of Water Resources, will be spread among various projects throughout the state's complex water delivery system, which is often forced to balance environmental interests and agricultural and industrial demands. 
 The largest chunk of federal money, nearly $110 million, will be used to build a screened pumping plant to protect fish at a dam in the northern city of Red Bluff, on the Sacramento River, while also feeding more water to some 150,000 acres of farmland.
 About $20 million is earmarked to protect salmon and Delta smelt along the Contra Costa Canal, a 48-mile-long structure east of San Francisco. The state is well into its third year of drought, and the pressure on agriculture has been intensified by court decisions requiring that the endangered Delta smelt be protected. 
 Some $40 million is meant for immediate drought relief, including new wells in the Central Valley, the vast agricultural area where unemployment, hunger and homelessness have soared as the recession and drought have packed a double wallop.
 ''Our hope is that some of this money can help farm workers,'' Mr. Salazar said.
 Lester A. Snow, director of the Department of Water Resources, said in a statement, ''This is exactly the kind of immediate federal action we've been seeking.'' Mr. Snow added that the stimulus would ''create needed jobs up and down the state.'' 
 About $26 million is designated to help restore fisheries in Northern California, where low numbers of fall Chinook salmon -- usually the Sacramento River's richest harvest -- have led to the canceling of the salmon fishing season for a second straight year.

HEADLINE: Gorging the Beast

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
An Ode to Taxes: Oh, little tax return form/No longer are you sad and lorn./Fly away with your friends in a crowd/And try to make your filers proud./Maybe you'll fix a road or a park/Just please don't turn into another earmark.
 ''April 15th has long been and always will be a day American workers and their families despise,'' said the House minority leader, John Boehner, on Wednesday as he hailed the arrival of anti-tax tea party protests around the country. Actually, given the fact that a vast majority of households get refunds, the day might be a pleasant reminder that the check for $2,429, on average, is in the mail. 
 Still, there's one strain to the well-orchestrated chorus of tea party complaints that does seem to have hit a chord. It's the worry that President Obama is trying to do too much at once, spending too much money without making the tough decisions about how to pay for it all.
 Some conservatives, including my soon-to-be-colleague, Ross Douthat, have suggested that the president is doing a reverse version of Starve the Beast. That was, you will remember, the Republican theory -- brilliant except for its utter wrongness -- that if you cut taxes enough, the lack of revenue would force Congress to reduce the size of government. 
 So is the White House trying to spend Congress into a tax-hike corner? Gorge the Beast? Leave it so stuffed with new programs that it just sits in front of the television munching on entitlements? Taxes, in this metaphor, would have to be the equivalent of a good fitness regimen, and we all know how much the Obamaites love their ellipticals.
 The problem with this whole line of reasoning is that it begins with the idea that government is a beast. We may whine about Congress, but a large part of the population still sees the federal government as a stimulus-providing, Social-Security-check-sending, Somali-pirate-defeating protector. How far do you think the Republicans would have gotten if they had announced that they wanted to Starve the Family Dog? 
 Perhaps his name was Bo. He was so cute, and Ronald Reagan wanted to let him shrivel away.
 Obama responded to the critics this week, arguing fiscal responsibility. He said the country can't flourish on the sands of deficits and financial bubbles. It has to find new savings that will bring down debt for future generations.
 ''That's the new foundation we must build. That's our house built upon a rock,'' he said, mixing two of America's favorite things -- Biblical allusions and real estate. The speech triggered a brief surge of excitement as the chattering class wondered if New Foundation was going to be Obama's signature, like F.D.R.'s New Deal, or Bill Clinton's unfortunate attempt to market a New Covenant.
 Let's hope not. First of all, ''New Foundation'' has a rather dreary ring, calling up visions of an unfinished basement. Secondly, there already are several New Foundations out there, including one for Quakers and one for teenage substance abusers in Arizona. (There also are quite a few Rock Foundations, including one that's trying to help a music fan get a kidney transplant and one ''dedicated to preserving the tradition of fire lookouts.'')
 However, we do like the idea of building our economic house on stone, despite the possible dangers of bad drainage. Obama has been trying to set an example of prudent government, trotting out cabinet officials to describe the way projects are coming in under budget and proposing cost-cutting changes. For instance, he wants to get rid of a rule somebody in Congress inserted to make sure states will continue to get federal mine cleanup aid even after all the mines are clean. (We're looking at you, Wyoming delegation.) 
 But while all thrift is worthy, this stuff only provides tiny slivers of savings in return for endless, exhausting struggle. (While we have tea on our minds, let's recall that it took Bill Clinton almost an entire term to get rid of the 99-year-old Tea Tasting Board, which met two days a year in a Brooklyn warehouse to sniff and sip imported tea in the name of consumer quality control.)
 The president himself has proposed some really big-ticket savings from reforming things like agricultural subsidies, the college loan program and the private insurance end of Medicare. He wants to change tax laws that would end special treatment for people like oil drillers or hedge fund operators or multinational corporations. 
 The only problem is that Congress seems deeply unenthusiastic. Can we organize a tea party in favor of the Obama budget-balancers? Everybody who wants to stop giving subsidies to the banks for making college loans with federally backed default protection, send your senators some variation on the theme of caffeinated beverage.
 Unless, of course, you want to starve the puppy.

HEADLINE: Deals Help China Expand Its Sway In Latin America

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO and ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Simon Romero reported from Caracas, and Alexei Barrionuevo from Rio de Janeiro.

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
As Washington tries to rebuild its strained relationships in Latin America, China is stepping in vigorously, offering countries across the region large amounts of money while they struggle with sharply slowing economies, a plunge in commodity prices and restricted access to credit. 
 In recent weeks, China has been negotiating deals to double a development fund in Venezuela to $12 billion, lend Ecuador at least $1 billion to build a hydroelectric plant, provide Argentina with access to more than $10 billion in Chinese currency and lend Brazil's national oil company $10 billion. The deals largely focus on China locking in natural resources like oil for years to come. 
 China's trade with Latin America has grown quickly this decade, making it the region's second largest trading partner after the United States. But the size and scope of these loans point to a deeper engagement with Latin America at a time when the Obama administration is starting to address the erosion of Washington's influence in the hemisphere. 
 ''This is how the balance of power shifts quietly during times of crisis,'' said David Rothkopf, a former Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration. ''The loans are an example of the checkbook power in the world moving to new places, with the Chinese becoming more active.''
 Mr. Obama will meet with leaders from the region this weekend. They will discuss the economic crisis, including a plan to replenish the Inter-American Development Bank, a Washington-based pillar of clout that has suffered losses from the financial crisis. Leaders at the summit meeting are also expected to push Mr. Obama to further loosen the United States policy toward Cuba. 
 Meanwhile, China is rapidly increasing its lending in Latin America as it pursues not only long-term access to commodities like soybeans and iron ore, but also an alternative to investing in United States Treasury notes. 
 One of China's new deals in Latin America, the $10 billion arrangement with Argentina, would allow Argentina reliable access to Chinese currency to help pay for imports from China. It may also help lead the way to China's currency to eventually be used as an alternate reserve currency. The deal follows similar ones China has struck with countries like South Korea, Indonesia and Belarus. 
 As the financial crisis began to whipsaw international markets last year, the Federal Reservemade its own currency arrangements with central banks around the world, allocating $30 billion each to Brazil and Mexico. (Brazil has opted not to tap it for now.) But smaller economies in the region, including Argentina, which has been trying to dispel doubts about its ability to meet its international debt payments, were left out of those agreements. 
 Details of the Chinese deal with Argentina are still being ironed out, but an official at Argentina's central bank said it would allow Argentina to avoid using scarce dollars for all its international transactions. The takeover of billions of dollars in private pension funds, among other moves, led Argentines to pull the equivalent of nearly $23 billion, much of it in dollars, out of the country last year. 
 Dante Sica, the lead economist at Abeceb, a consulting firm in Buenos Aires, said the Chinese overtures in the region were made possible by the ''lack of attention that the United States showed to Latin America during the entire Bush administration.'' 
 China is also seizing opportunities in Latin America when traditional lenders over which the United States holds some sway, like the Inter-American Development Bank, are pushing up against their limits. 
 Just one of China's planned loans, the $10 billion for Brazil's national oil company, is almost as much as the $11.2 billion in all approved financing by the Inter-American Bank in 2008. Brazil is expected to use the loan for offshore exploration, while agreeing to export as much as 100,000 barrels of oil a day to China, according to the oil company. 
 The Inter-American bank, in which the United States has de facto veto power in some matters, is trying to triple its capital and increase lending to $18 billion this year. But the replenishment involves delicate negotiations among member nations, made all the more difficult after the bank lost almost $1 billion last year. 
 China will also have a role in these talks, having become a member of the bank this year. 
 China has also pushed into Latin American countries where the United States has negligible influence, like Venezuela. 
 In February, China's vice president, Xi Jinping, traveled to Caracas to meet with President Hugo Chavez. The two men announced that a Chinese-backed development fund based here would grow to $12 billion from $6 billion, giving Venezuela access to hard currency while agreeing to increase oil shipments to China to one million barrels a day from a level of about 380,000 barrels. 
 Mr. Chavez's government contends the Chinese aid differs from other multilateral loans because it comes without strings attached, like scrutiny of internal finances. But the Chinese fund has generated criticism among his opponents, who view it as an affront to Venezuela's sovereignty. 
 ''The fund is a swindle to the nation,'' said Luis Diaz, a lawmaker who claims that China locked in low prices for the oil Venezuela is using as repayment. 
 Despite forging ties to Venezuela and extending loans to other nations that have chafed at Washington's clout, Beijing has bolstered its presence without bombast, perhaps out of an awareness that its relationship with the United States is still of paramount importance. But this deference may not last. 
 ''This is China playing the long game,'' said Gregory Chin, a political scientist at York University in Toronto. ''If this ultimately translates into political influence, then that is how the game is played.''

HEADLINE: A Retreat From Citing China Over Its Currency

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Treasury Department said on Wednesday that China was not manipulating its currency to increase its exports, a big retreat from the criticism expressed by Timothy F. Geithner in January during his Senate confirmation hearing to become the Treasury secretary.
 The new report highlighted the political and diplomatic constraints that the Obama administration faces in dealing with China. 
 American officials remain frustrated that China's currency policies lower the cost of Chinese goods and make American products more expensive in foreign markets. But they are relieved that China is fighting the global recession with an enormous fiscal stimulus program to spur domestic growth.
 American officials and lawmakers have complained for years that China deeply undervalues its currency, the yuan, in order to increase its exports at the expense of American producers.
 President Obama repeatedly accused China of outright currency manipulation during the presidential campaign, and Mr. Geithner echoed that opinion during his confirmation proceedings. 
 But in a new report to Congress, Mr. Geithner not only refrained from such accusations, but praised China for its economic stimulus program and its move toward a more realistic exchange rate for the yuan.
 ''China has taken steps to enhance exchange rate flexibility,'' Mr. Geithner wrote in a statement accompanying the new report. 
 He said that the yuan had climbed 16.6 percent against other currencies from June through February, even as the financial crisis intensified and other currencies lost value against the dollar. 
 Treasury officials placed even greater emphasis on China's $586 billion fiscal stimulus program. They couched the entire discussion of currency manipulation in the context of fighting the global downturn, adding that China's stimulus program was bigger than that of any other country except the United States. 
 The substance and tone of the new report contrasted sharply with Mr. Geithner's written response to questions posed by the Senate Finance Committee as it was weighing his nomination to be Treasury secretary.
 ''President Obama -- backed by the conclusions of a broad range of economists -- believes that China is manipulating its currency,'' Mr. Geithner wrote at the time. Though he stopped short of charging that China was intentionally manipulating its currency to gain an unfair trade advantage, as the law requires for an official citation of currency manipulation, Mr. Geithner's mere use of the word infuriated Chinese leaders.
 Mr. Geithner tried to head off angry reactions from Congress by calling numerous lawmakers on Wednesday morning, before the report was issued. Several leading Democratic critics of China made it clear they were unhappy about Mr. Geithner's new report, but said they understood why Mr. Geithner wanted to avoid a heated conflict. 
 ''I believe the Chinese are manipulating their currency, but given the times and the exigencies, I understand why the administration didn't want to call them a manipulator,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who has repeatedly proposed punitive tariffs on imports from China. 
 Senator Max Baucus of Montana, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and another prominent critic of China, said that it needed to ''continue reforms'' and that Mr. Geithner should ''set out clear milestones to measure our progress.''
 Some business groups that have complained about China's exchange rates for years were not assuaged.
 ''While we recognize the delicacy of the global financial situation, today's decision was a missed opportunity,'' said John Engler, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, in a statement. 
 Mr. Engler said that the International Monetary Fund had already declared China's currency ''significantly undervalued.'' But, he added: ''The I.M.F. is unlikely to take up China's currency as long as the Treasury Department says nothing is amiss.''

HEADLINE: 'Stimulus' Works Its Way to Madison Avenue

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
GENIUS, Thomas Edison said long ago, is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration. Now, the geniuses on Madison Avenue are recalculating the formula to add a lot of stimulation.
 As marketers remake campaigns to address the recession, advertising copywriters are liberally peppering prose with financial words and phrases, particularly ''stimulus'' and ''stimulus package.''
 The choice of language reflects, of course, the attention paid to the passage by Congress in February of the $787 billion economic stimulus measure. Like politicians, marketers like to ride coattails; the tactic of ads seeking to capitalize on news events or the popular culture is known as borrowed interest. 
 ''It's a bit of an opportunistic practice,'' said Burt Alper, principal at Catchword Branding, a consulting company in Oakland, Calif.
 ''But if you're not being sympathetic to what's going on, your customers may view you as having blinders on,'' he added.
 As a result, there is no shortage of marketers trying to simulate the stimulation of a stimulus package. These are among scores of examples since the year began:
 The CBS Television Network, part of the CBS Corporation, promoted its Monday sitcoms like ''How I Met Your Mother'' by calling them ''the entertainment stimulus package.''
 There was also a ''late-night stimulus package,'' composed of ''Late Show With David Letterman'' and ''The Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson.''
 A commercial for Trojan condoms, sold by Church & Dwight, presented ''our own stimulus package, the Trojan Pleasure Pack.'' The spot was created by the Kaplan Thaler Group in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe.
 Valpak Direct Marketing Systems ran ads that described its Valpak coupon packets mailed to consumers as ''the original consumer stimulus package since 1968.''
 Carmike Cinemas introduced a promotion, ''Stimulus Tuesdays,'' offering moviegoers discounted drinks and popcorn.
 In a print advertisement with a $1 coupon for Uncle Ben's Ready Rice, sold by a unit of Mars, the Uncle Ben character declared, ''Consider this a part of the economic stimulus package.'' The ads were created by the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group.
 Coincidentally, the ad is part of a campaign for Uncle Ben's that carries the theme ''Ben knows best'' -- no reference intended to Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
 An ad for a new business book, ''The Carrot Principle,'' published by the Free Press division of Simon & Schuster, redefines the incentive behind using carrots rather than sticks as motivational tools by asking, ''Heard about the carrots stimulus package?''
 The Baltimore Orioles have a ''Birdland Stimulus Package'' for the 2009 baseball season, which enables fans to celebrate birthdays with free tickets to games at Oriole Park at Camden Yards (orioles.com/birthdays).
 Gold's Gym is introducing a ''Fitness Stimulus Package'' that includes free seven-day passes, health audits and exercise guides (goldsgym.com/stimulus).
 ''Putting the stimulus spin on this is timely,'' said Lisa Zoellner, chief marketing officer at Gold's Gym in Dallas, because the state of the economy ''is going to be absorbing people's attention for quite some time.''
 Most stimulus lingo is turning up in campaigns for marketers in categories hardest hit by the recession. They include automobiles, like invitations from the Volvo unit of Ford Motor to ''stimulate your stimulus''; retail, like a ''stimulus sale'' at ABC Carpet & Home stores; and travel, like a ''stimulus, recovery and rebound package'' at the Mohegan Sun casino and hotel in Uncasville, Conn.
 ''When people hear 'stimulus package,' they think of the government,'' said Tom Koenigsberg, chief marketing officer at CiCi's Pizza in Coppell, Tex. ''It's time business provided stimulus packages to give consumers a chance to save money.''
 CiCi's recently began a promotion, the ''Million-Penny Stimulus Package,'' in which that many pennies -- bearing stickers offering prizes like free meals -- are being scattered around CiCi's restaurants. The promotion is being advertised in a campaign celebrating ''penny picker-uppers,'' created by the Marina del Rey, Calif., office of Deutsch, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
 ''I think the way we've done it is to be a little different, a little more creative, hopefully separating us from the others out there,'' Mr. Koenigsberg said.
 That brings up a major drawback to ads that borrow interest: They tend to proliferate to the point they seem derivative and unoriginal.
 ''You can get lost if people think you're just co-opting something they see on the news,'' said Alain Sylvain, managing director at Redscout in New York, a brand strategy company owned by MDC Partners.
 Rather, marketers ought to strive ''to make it much more about empathy,'' he added, ''to say: 'We understand what's going on. We sympathize with you. We know what you're looking for.' '' 
 That is why Domino's Pizza included value deals in ads featuring a make-believe federal secretary of taste offering a ''Taste Stimulus Package'' and a ''Big Taste Bailout.'' 
 ''It seems like every ad starts out, 'In this economy ...,' '' said Andrew Keller, partner and co-executive creative director at the Boulder, Colo., office of the Domino's agency, Crispin Porter & Bogusky, also part of MDC.
 ''We have an opportunity to offer something around value,'' he added. ''It's doing something, rather than just trying to ride the wave of news.''

HEADLINE: Protesters Air Views on Government Spending at Tax Day Tea Parties Across U.S.

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS; Reporting was contributed by Bernie Becker from Washington, Robbie Brown from Atlanta, Jon Hurdle from Philadelphia, James C. McKinley Jr. from Houston, and Janie Lorber and Katie Zezima from Boston.

 BODY:
Some people wore their tea bags hanging from umbrellas or eyeglasses. Others simply tossed them on the White House lawn. 
 Wednesday's deadline for filing income tax returns offered some Americans a timely excuse to vent their frustrations as demonstrators attended more than 750 Tax Day tea parties in cities like Boston, Washington, East Hampton, N.Y., and Yakima, Wash. 
 The events were meant to protest government spending, particularly the Obama administration's $787 billion stimulus package and its $3.5 trillion budget. 
 Although organizers insisted they had created a nonpartisan grass-roots movement, others argued that these parties were more of the Astroturf variety: an occasion largely created by the clamor of cable news and fueled by the financial and political support of current and former Republican leaders.
 Fox News covered the events all day with reporters and hosts at the scenes. Neil Cavuto, a Fox host, and Michelle Malkin, a conservative contributor, headlined the protests in Sacramento while Sean Hannity broadcast his show from the protests in Atlanta. 
 The Web site TaxDayTeaParty.com listed its sponsors, including FreedomWorks, a group founded by Dick Armey, the former House majority leader; Top Conservatives on Twitter; and RFCRadio.com. 
 The idea for the demonstrations grew in part out of a blast from Rick Santelli, a CNBC commentator who on Feb. 19 at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange said that the Obama administration was promoting ''bad behavior'' in helping people who were at risk of losing their homes and that Americans should protest with a tea party in Chicago. 
 The clip inspired earlier protests in cities like Cincinnati, Green Bay, Wis., and Harrisburg, Pa. 
 The main goal as a national organization, said Eric Odom, the administrator of the Tax Day Tea Party Web site, ''is just to facilitate an environment where a new movement would be born.'' 
 It was hard to determine from the moderate turnout just how effective the parties would be. In Philadelphia, a rally in Center City drew about 200 rain-soaked participants. 
 Several hundred people showed up in Lafayette Park opposite the White House, until the park and parts of Pennsylvania Avenue were cleared while a robot retrieved what the Secret Service confirmed was a box of tea bags.
 In Pensacola, Fla., about 500 protesters lined a busy street, some waving ''Don't Tread on Me'' flags and carrying signs reading ''Got Pork?'' and ''D.C.: District of Corruption.''
 In Austin, Tex., Gov. Rick Perry energized a crowd of about 1,000 by accusing the Obama administration of restricting states' rights and vaguely suggesting that Texas might want to secede from the union.
 In downtown Houston, there were some in the crowd of 2,000 that poured into the Jesse H. Jones Plaza who also wanted Texas to secede. They were joined by other conservative groups like anti-abortion activists, Libertarians and fiscally conservative Republicans. American flags abounded, along with hand-painted placards that bore messages like ''Abolish the I.R.S.,'' ''Less Government More Free Enterprise,'' ''We Miss Reagan'' and ''Honk if You Are Upset About Your Tax Dollars Being Spent on Illegal Aliens.''
 Paul Sommer, 41, of Humble, Tex., said he came out because he feared the country was drifting toward socialism under President Obama. ''I don't agree with them taking my money,'' he said. ''I'm a small-business owner. I don't want them taking everything.''
 Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. of Utah, a Republican, was booed in Salt Lake City for accepting about $1.5 billion in federal stimulus money, and in Alaska, hundreds of people held signs and chanted ''No more spending,'' The Associated Press reported.
 Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, urged people in New York to tell their lawmakers ''we're going to fire you'' unless they vote against big spending, The A.P. reported.
 In Boston, the birthplace of the original tea party, the protest was on Boston Common, near the State House. The crowd, initially about 500, grew throughout the day. 
 ''I'm not happy with the way our government is managing our taxes,'' said Jo Ouimete, 54, of Northampton, Mass., who was holding an umbrella with an American flag pattern, even though the sun was shining. The umbrella had a tea pot on top and Red Rose tea bags hanging from it. 
 ''The American taxpayers are really getting pressed too hard,'' Ms. Ouimete said. ''We can't live like this, and our kids can't live like this.''
 Some participants were dressed in colonial garb, including Paul Jehle, of the Plymouth Rock Foundation, who is also a professional Boston tour guide. Mr. Jehle offered his enthusiastic audience a history lesson about the 1773 Boston Tea Party. 
 The only organization in Boston re-enacting the original tea party -- a gay rights group -- was not associated with the other demonstrations. 
 Its protest was that in Massachusetts, where same-sex marriage is legal, married same-sex couples cannot file joint federal tax returns.

HEADLINE: Obamas' Earnings, Buoyed by Book Royalties, Stayed High in '08

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE; Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting from Washington, and Liz Robbins from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama and his wife released their 2008 federal tax return on Wednesday, showing that they paid $855,323 in federal income taxes on a combined household income of $2,656,902.
 Mr. Obama and Michelle Obama also reported giving $172,050 -- nearly 6.5 percent of their earnings -- to 37 charities, including $25,000 contributions to CARE, a global antipoverty group, and to the United Negro College Fund.
 For the fourth year in a row, most of the Obamas' income came from royalties from his two books: ''Dreams From My Father'' and ''The Audacity of Hope.'' 
 Proceeds from book sales totaled more than $2.4 million in 2008, dwarfing the roughly $200,000 the couple made from Mr. Obama's salary as a United States senator and Mrs. Obama's at the University of Chicago Hospitals. Mrs. Obama went on leave from her job during the presidential campaign last year and formally resigned at the beginning of this year.
 Earlier on Wednesday, the deadline for Americans to file their income tax returns, Mr. Obama made a sales pitch for his tax proposals, saying a tax cut in the stimulus bill would benefit ''95 percent of American workers,'' and praised other changes that he said would help small-business owners, parents of college students and first-time homebuyers. And he called for a sweeping overhaul of the tax code.
 Mr. Obama made his remarks as conservative activists held a series of ''Tea Party'' protests around the country calling for lower taxes and less government spending. 
 The president has proposed to raise taxes on more affluent workers, and would himself be likely to pay higher taxes should his proposals go through. He has called for putting a cap on the value of itemized deductions, like charitable contributions.
 Moreover, he advocates allowing Bush-era tax cuts to expire as scheduled at the end of 2010, restoring the marginal tax rate on couples' earnings above $250,000 to 39 percent, as it was during the 1990s. That rate is currently 35 percent.
 The White House on Wednesday also released the tax return for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill. They reported an adjusted gross income of $269,256 and paid $46,952 in federal income taxes. 
 The Bidens also reported donating $1,885 to charity, less than 1 percent of their earnings. In a press release, the White House said the Bidens have made additional donations to charity not listed on the returns.
 ''The charitable donations claimed by the Bidens on their tax returns are not the sum of their annual contributions to charity,'' it said. ''They donate to their church, and they contribute to their favorite causes with their time as well as their checkbooks.''
 The Obamas first opened a window onto their rapidly escalating personal wealth in March 2008, when they released seven years of their tax returns amid Mr. Obama's effort to secure the Democratic presidential nomination.
 Those forms showed that the couple's income had spiked sharply in 2005, largely because of book sales after Mr. Obama became famous with a speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, when he was running for the Senate.
 From 2000 to 2004, the Obamas had earned an average of about $250,000 a year. But their taxable income surged to $1.6 million in 2005 and $983,826 in 2006. 
 In 2007, as book sales rose to a new high during the first year of his presidential campaign, they earned $4.2 million. Since then, Mr. Obama's book sales have slowed somewhat but remain lucrative, the new tax filings show.
 Mr. Obama signed a book deal in January, just before taking office. The deal, revealed in a routine Senate filing last month, will pay him $250,000 for an adaptation of his memoir for younger readers. The Senate filing also first disclosed his 2008 book royalty income.
 The White House also released the Obamas' and the Bidens' state tax returns. The Obamas reported paying $77,883 in state income taxes to Illinois, and the Bidens reported paying $11,164 in state income taxes to Delaware.

HEADLINE: A Rockies Casino Town Preps for the Big Time

BYLINE: By LIONEL BEEHNER

 BODY:
PART Deadwood and part Reno, the Rocky Mountain town of Black Hawk, Colo., is a surreal combination of Old West authenticity and the neon pizazz of casino gambling.
Just 40 miles from Denver -- and with little more than 100 full-time residents -- Black Hawk unfolds along a ravine dotted with tumbledown mines and colorful gingerbread-style homes. Its dusty main drag, often crammed with tour buses, passes through Victorian-era general stores and hotels refashioned into casinos with names like Bullwhackers and Bull Durham.
But a state law requiring casinos to boot out gamers at 2 a.m. and limiting bets to $5 has mostly confined the gambling action in Black Hawk to penny jackpots and Texas Hold 'Em tournaments with all the excitement of a church bingo game. As a result, its casinos have catered mostly to casual gamblers and retirees.
This summer, however, the stakes in Black Hawk are being raised. 
On July 2, a new state law goes into effect that raises betting limits to $100, and allows Colorado's casinos to remain open around the clock and add craps and roulette tables. In anticipation, casinos are expanding their pits, sprucing up their entertainment options and replacing all-you-can-eat buffets with broader dining choices.
With swankier accommodations and larger jackpots in the offing, local officials expect Black Hawk to become a bigger draw for high rollers from the Denver area and beyond.
''We're hoping to garner some of the folks who in the past would have gone to Vegas,'' said David Spellman, the town's tanned and goateed mayor and a fifth-generation native. ''With table games like roulette, this place will generate more excitement.''
Black Hawk sits at the mouth of Gregory Gulch, which kicked off the Colorado gold rush 150 years ago, earning the area the sobriquet ''the richest square mile on earth.'' The mining boom declined in the 1900s, but the town's fortunes turned around after Colorado passed a law in 1990 allowing for limited gaming in a few former mining towns, provided some of the profits went toward historic preservation. Now about a dozen casinos can be found along Black Hawk's main stretch.
In preparation for the new law, Fitzgeralds Casino added 22,000 square feet of floor space last year to go with Don B's, its new Irish-style steakhouse. Golden Gaming, which operates three casinos in town, is considering a $30 million expansion. And the boarded-up barn on the edge of town that used to be the Gold Mine will reopen this September as a sleeker casino geared toward a younger, more affluent crowd.
''We're not going for that outdoorsy feel like every place else in town, which cater more to retirees,'' said Mike Hills, 30, a co-developer of the casino. ''We want to be the younger, more hip guys on the hill.''
But Mr. Hills will have to compete with Ameristar, which opened a glitzy casino a few years ago. The gambling and entertainment company, based in Las Vegas, is now building a 33-story hotel that towers confidently above the town and is said to be the tallest building between Denver and Salt Lake City. With a rooftop pool and room views of the Continental Divide, the hotel will have some 500 beds once it opens this fall, bringing the total in town to more than 1,000.
''Our goal is to make this a destination resort and put Black Hawk on the map,'' said Heather Leigh, the hotel's public relations manager, noting its grand ballroom and the only full-service spa in the area. ''We're going four-star, four-diamond on this.''
Even Black Hawk's (and possibly Colorado's) oldest saloon, Crook's Palace, has just reopened, giving visitors an Old West venue to drink at without the clink and whirr of slots in the background.
That said, Black Hawk is no Las Vegas. There are no slot machines in its bathrooms, bottle-service requirements at its clubs or Celine Dion shows on its stages. On a recent Saturday, the night life consisted of an '80s cover band playing at the Ameristar's octagonal-shaped bar while a roomful of retirees worked the video slots, enjoying free drinks.
But Black Hawk offers a different experience from most casino hubs. The town is surrounded by spectacular scenery, even by Rocky Mountain standards, attracting gamers with a nature-loving streak in them.
''We like the Tombstone mystique to the place,'' a visitor, Nito Gemmell, said last month in between puffs of a cigarette outside a red-brick casino that resembles an old railway station. ''My wife loves the amenities. I like that I can pull over anywhere and catch some coldwater trout.''
Mr. Gemmell, 36, and his wife were on a road trip from their home in Fort Worth when their car skidded into a boulder near Durango, Colo. With their car in for repairs, they tried to ski at Breckenridge, but there was no snow. So instead, the Gemmells hightailed it to Black Hawk, where they'd spent part of their honeymoon four years ago.
The serpentine road linking Black Hawk with Interstate 70 winds its way through Clear Creek Canyon, whose craggy sandstone walls offer some of the state's best rock climbing. A number of nearby railroad beds are being converted into mountain biking paths. Then there's ''Oh My God Road,'' a hair-raising stretch with no guardrails overlooking Virginia Canyon that links Black Hawk and Idaho Springs to the south.
And history buffs will appreciate the area's mining past, even if today most of its mines sit unused, their abandoned machinery rusting. But Ed Lewandowski, a former miner, will hand visitors a hard hat, a hammer and a chisel, and lead them into the Hidee Mine, a well-ventilated shaft -- ''The air inside is better than Denver, though that's not saying much,'' he said -- where they can chip away at the mine's vein for souvenirs of gold ore.
To be sure, Black Hawk can feel a bit down on its luck at times. ''It is not a thriving rural community about people,'' said Patricia Stokowski, a former University of Colorado professor who wrote a book about the area and casino gambling. ''It's about industry, and that industry happens to be gambling.''
The recession has not skipped over Black Hawk. Many storefronts are boarded up, while casinos with names like Lilly Belle's and Winners Haven sit gloomily vacant. Up the road, the adjacent casino town of Central City has been even harder hit. Its quaint Main Street feels like the abandoned set of a Hollywood western. Not even the parkway the town built a few years back to lure gamers coming from Denver via Interstate 70 has been able to revive its gaming business.
Last year Colorado casinos generated just $716 million in revenue, a 12 percent drop from the year before. Joanne Lah, the executive director of the Black Hawk/Central City Visitors & Convention Bureau, blames a recently enacted smoking ban for the decline. ''That affected us dramatically,'' Ms. Lah said. ''The nonsmoker is generally not a gamer.''
But for Jim Rapp, a salesman visiting from Denver, the bad economy is a bigger factor. Mr. Rapp, 59, used to visit Black Hawk's casinos a few times a week but now comes only every few months. ''The payoffs aren't as big as they used to be,'' he said, sitting at a poker slot next to the Lodge Casino's indoor waterfall and giant diorama of snow-capped mountains framed by fir beams.
''Still, you can't beat it,'' he said. ''Within 40 minutes you can spend an enjoyable day up in the mountains. It's small and homey. I just don't want it to become like Vegas.''
IF YOU GO
Black Hawk, Colo., is about a 40-minute drive west of Denver off Interstate 70. Information about casinos and lodging is online at www.colorado.com/BlackHawk.aspx. Starting July 2, a new state law raises the betting limit to $100 from $5, and allows games of craps and roulette.
Colorado Central Station (343 Main Street; 303-582-3000; www.coloradocentralstation.com) has comfortable rooms with flat-screen TVs and marble-tiled baths. Rooms currently begin at around $80.
Chase Creek Bed & Breakfast (250 Chase Street; 303-582-3550; www.chasecreekinn.com), a short walk from downtown, is a Victorian inn. Rooms start at $95.
Tours of the Hidee Gold Mine (2432 South Yukon Way; 720-548-0343; www.hideegoldmine.com), a few miles outside of town, are available by appointment and cost $18.

PENNY ANTE NO LONGER
This summer in Black Hawk, Colo., the ante, as they say, is being raised. Because of strict gambling laws the town has catered mostly to the dilettantes or the casual.

The economy has been affecting nearly everything these days, and for those facing retirement hard times could delay it.

Luckily, there are some tools out there that can make the transition from second home to home office easier. Page D2

ROXANA SABERI
There is nothing resembling justice in Iran's prosecution of Roxana Saberi for espionage. The government's accusations against the American journalist have fluctuated wildly.

A CLEAR CLEAN WATER ACT
The United States' clean-water policy is in a terrible muddle, and the country has the Supreme Court to thank for it. The remedy lies in a Senate bill called the Clean Water Restoration Act.

HEADLINE: Attracting New Teachers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The National Commission on Teaching and America's Future report predicting teacher shortages reinforces how society and the education system fail through lack of foresight and will (''Report Envisions Shortage of Teachers as Retirements Escalate,'' news article, April 7). 
 My wife retired after 30 years of teaching in the same elementary school. A career of creativity and success while mentoring new generations of teachers is lost.
 My daughter, a gifted teacher at 22, will be graduating next month with a double degree in elementary and special education from one of the top education schools in the country. In an ideal world, she would be recruited no differently from the editor of The Harvard Law Review.
 Unfortunately, we do not live in that world -- teachers are not perceived as professionals. Uncompetitive salaries, working under the constraints of No Child Left Behind, teaching to tests, chronic underfinancing, and disincentives to creativity and innovation all raise the question: Why teach? 
 Anthony Green Merion Station, Pa., April 7, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The teaching profession is not eroding at both ends. Boomers are retiring, true, but more slowly now with the bad economy. The young teachers described in the research are Generation Xers who are now 25 to 44 years old. There weren't enough of them to satisfy the demand, so they could afford to be fickle, move around and leave the profession. That's over.
 The huge new Generation Y, the children of the baby boomers, is why. Generation Y is just now beginning to flood the teaching profession, and they will stick like glue because they face the prospect of 20 percent unemployment and they want to eat.
 Generation Y will replace the baby boomers faster than they can retire because Generation Y is bigger than the boomers. Generation Y will be a huge wake-up call for ''entitled'' Generation X teachers.

HEADLINE: Searching for Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
WHILE on a bike ride in the hills behind Stanford University, I was helping a fellow cyclist fix a flat tire when a rental car full of lost Italian tourists pulled over. Clutching a map in his hands, the driver beseeched us, ''Can you tell us where we can go to see Silicon Valley?'' 
 The cyclist, Tony Fadell, an Apple engineer who led the iPod and iPhone design teams, and I grinned at each other, but we had to sympathize with the driver's plight. Perhaps more than any region, Silicon Valley has transformed the world in the last half century. Yet exploring -- or even finding -- this patchwork quilt of high-tech research and development centers, factories and California suburbia can be baffling. That's because the valley is as much a state of mind as it is a physical place. 
 Consensus has it that Silicon Valley -- a phrase first used by the journalist Don C. Hoefler in the early 1970s to describe the home of an emerging chip industry -- is defined as the southern half of the San Francisco Bay Area. It stretches north of Palo Alto toward the San Francisco airport, spills over the Santa Cruz Mountains to the southwest, and sprawls to the east and south of San Jose. 
 But in a tangle of freeways and low-slung technology design and marketing campuses, trying to find the real Silicon Valley is no easy task. Certainly, there are the corporate headquarters like those of Apple, Cisco, Google, Intel and Yahoo that line Highways 101 and 280, but viewing them from a distance only brushes the surface of what is the nation's -- and the world's -- high-tech heartland.
 The region has given us the semiconductor chip, the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet and Google, and yet there remains an ethereal quality about Silicon Valley -- fitting, as the workings of a computer are essentially the invisible flow of electrical pulses. Even so, it's possible -- and enjoyable -- to find touchstones of the valley's history, and explore the technology that has emerged from it.
 The technological powerhouse that displaced Santa Clara County's fruit orchards grew in part from the vision of Frederick Terman, the dean of engineering at Stanford, who as early as the 1930s sought to create an industry so his students wouldn't have to leave the valley for electronics firms in the East.
 Once defined by its factories, Silicon Valley is now more synonymous with product design and interactive digital media. The digital technologies incubated there have transformed each industry they touched -- music, Hollywood, newspapers and books, to name a few.
 Riding the exponentially increasing power of the computer chip, the valley has demonstrated the ability to reinvent itself relentlessly. And each new generation of technology has been quickly cannibalized by the following one, in a perfect enactment of the economist Joseph Schumpeter's notion of creative destruction. 
 In the Silicon Valley creation story, mainframe computers begat minicomputers, which begat personal computers, which begat laptops and today's ''smart'' cellphones.
 When I was growing up in Palo Alto in the 1950s, Santa Clara County still retained much of its original agricultural spirit, which early on had led it to be known as the Valley of Heart's Delight. The county once produced a large percentage of the nation's prunes, and orchards and pastures occupied a meaningful percentage of the space between Palo Alto and San Jose. 
 The temperature always seemed to be somewhere near 70 degrees, the fog that so often drenched San Francisco during the summers was held at bay by the Santa Cruz Mountains that are the backbone of the San Francisco peninsula, and traffic still hadn't reached Los Angeles proportions.
 A strong regional conservation movement that has preserved tens of thousands of acres has made it possible to enjoy some of the region's original pristine quality. Two favorites for short hikes are Windy Hill and Monte Bello, open space trusts in the hills above Portola Valley and Palo Alto.
 But it is what has taken place indoors that has secured Silicon Valley's place in the nation's folklore. Images of Bill and Dave (Hewlett and Packard) and the two Steves (Jobs and Wozniak) tinkering in their garages are emblematic of how teams of inspired inventors and entrepreneurs can create entirely new industries.
 Today it is possible to drive down a quiet street in the Palo Alto neighborhood known as Professorville, just off the Stanford campus, where at 367 Addison Avenue, you can then peek over the fence at the 12-foot-by-18-foot garage where Mr. Hewlett and Mr. Packard, both Stanford graduates, with the encouragement of Mr. Terman, built an audio oscillator for Walt Disney Studios in 1939. The spot, however, is marked only by a modest plaque. 
 Another, more cerebral way to observe the forces that power Silicon Valley is to drive through the Googleplex in Mountain View and see the Googlers -- most of whom appear to still be of college age -- tooling around on their bicycles and Segways. Then, cross town to Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park and watch the venture capitalists come and go in their BMWs and their Porsches.
 For a more conventional interpretation, drive south a few miles along the 101 freeway to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View. Now ensconced in a splashy high-tech building that was originally occupied by Silicon Graphics, once a valley high-flier (and recently sold off out of bankruptcy to Rackable Systems), the museum is perhaps the best way to actually touch and feel Silicon Valley history. 
 A copy of the original Babbage Engine, arguably the first computing machine ever designed, is now on display, as well as a room full of early computers. My favorite is the Alto, the Xerox PC that is the forerunner of our modern personal computers.
 Thirteen miles south in San Jose, the Tech Museum of Innovation offers a hands-on experience for younger visitors. For more tech history, Intel has an in-house museum, as does the NASA Ames Research Center.
 Over the last four decades, the dream of being the next Jobs or Wozniak has captured the world's imagination and turned the valley into a global crossroads. 
 Nowhere is that more clear than on a visit to the Naz 8 Cinemas in Fremont, the manufacturing community southeast of San Francisco Bay. Billed as the first multicultural entertainment multiplex, it shows Bollywood movies from India as well as films from Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Taiwan, Korea and the Philippines on eight screens with 3,000 seats and 5,000 parking places.
 That diversity is immediately apparent almost anywhere in Silicon Valley. You can see it on Castro Street in Mountain View, dotted with a proliferation of ethnic restaurants. Elsewhere, you can turn down a street seemingly at random and find the shop signs are all in Chinese or Spanish or Vietnamese. 
 Standout restaurants include La Costena, a hole-in-the-wall grocery in Mountain View that has great burritos (and a Guinness World Record claim for making the largest), and Evvia in Palo Alto, which serves a spectacular version of arnisia paidakia, or lamb chops.
 Given the cycles of boom and bust, and innovation and imitation, perhaps the favorite sport of valley-watchers is trying to predict the Next Big Thing.
 In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, when new obstacles to immigration were erected, it appeared the United States was on the verge of stanching the flow of the region's most precious resource: intellectual capital. 
 But eight years later the valley continues to thrive, even in a deep recession. There are hints that the green technology fad that has swept the venture capital community here in recent years may translate into a return to manufacturing. Heavily financed startups like Nanosolar in San Jose and MiaSole in Santa Clara are building factories. A co-founder of PayPal, Elon Musk, is designing the battery-powered Tesla automobiles in San Carlos.
 The future of Silicon Valley can probably best be pondered from the terrace of Thomas Fogarty Winery & Vineyards, on Skyline Boulevard in the Santa Cruz Mountains, with all the valley spread out beneath you. 
 From there, a glass of wine in hand, you can gaze down at the unremarkable patchwork of offices and suburbs that has changed the way the world works. It's obviously the place I should have directed the lost Italians.

HEADLINE: San Diego Utility, Fearing Wildfires, Looks to Power Shutdowns

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: JULIAN, Calif. 

 BODY:
There probably is not a person in this little mountain town who has mentally deleted the images of 2007, when angry orange flames, followed by giant plumes of smoke, licked at the trees and roared across the freeway near here, killing neighbors in communities close by and engulfing hundreds of homes.
 Eager to avoid a repeat of that horrific year, and the ensuing lawsuits, officials of San Diego County's chief power utility have hatched a disputed plan to deal with one potential fire source: downed power lines. If electrical wires can cause fires when winds and temperatures are high, the officials say, then electricity itself will have to go. 
 The utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, says that if the state approves the idea, it will shut off power to thousands of residents here in the rural ''backcountry'' of northeastern San Diego County under specific fire-friendly weather conditions: low moisture, high temperatures and sustained winds of at least 35 miles an hour.
 Power would remain off until those conditions passed. The utility envisions shutdowns as short as 12 hours or perhaps as long as 72.
 This is the first time such a proposal has been made by a power company in California, where the threat of wildfires has grown exponentially over the last decade, in large part because of a protracted drought. 
 Eight large wildfires devastated parts of the state in the fall of 2007, and three of them -- including the second-largest fire in the state's recorded history, which burned in this area -- were caused by downed electrical wires. Since then, 126 families have sued the company for damages.
 The shut-off plan, covering roughly 130,000 residents of small towns across 1,600 square miles, has infuriated local water authorities, who count on electricity to feed water wells. 
 It has also caused an uproar among many homeowners, who fear that a lack of power could in some cases worsen a fire rather than prevent one. With power off, ''that means that when the other 97 percent of causes that start a fire occur, there is no water in our system to fight them,'' said Gary Arant, general manager of the water district in the town of Valley Center.
 The battle has pitted many in this remote area, where it is not uncommon for some homeowners to see more coyotes than people for days at a time, against what they call ''the city,'' or San Diego, where officials hold sway over any number of matters affecting the county's largely unincorporated rural sections.
 The towns here, abutting large swaths of Indian reservations, are the topographical opposite of the nearby desert and beaches. They are tucked into wooded hills surrounding the Cleveland National Forest that are reachable by roads that those who suffer from motion sickness ought to consider warily when visiting. 
 Residents generally do not care for former city dwellers who arrive looking to add bright streetlights, or what they see as the imposition of the will of government or utility companies on their rural ways. ''This is an old mining town,'' said Michael Hart, publisher of The Julian News. ''Once or twice a year we get people who want to citify the backcountry. We had someone show up here once who wanted to make us like Santa Barbara. We ran them out on a rail.''
 Officials of San Diego Gas & Electric, a subsidiary of Sempra Energy, say the power shut-off plan (formerly ''proactive de-energization,'' a name that was changed because no one could pronounce it) is needed in an area with heavy forests and a hot and dry climate where Santa Ana winds are a threat to down lines. 
 They point out that the company has taken other preventive measures, like replacing wooden utility poles with steel ones, and note that the likelihood of imposed power shutdowns would be relatively low, given all the requisite criteria.
 Stephanie Donovan, a spokeswoman for the company, said it was very unlikely that the entire area would experience all those weather conditions at once. 
 ''We are projecting that we could have the conditions ripe for an emergency shut-off once or twice a year,'' Ms. Donovan said, ''covering about 18,000 to 22,000 people at a time.''
 The plan requires the approval of the California Public Utilities Commission, which held public hearings on it last week. The commission's decision is expected this summer, just in time for the height of the fire season. 
 The plan has some limited support among residents and business owners. ''This is a practical solution until another solution comes about,'' said Gary Knight, president of the San Diego North Economic Development Council. 
 As an alternative, Mr. Knight suggested, backcountry residents could agree to waivers freeing the power company from any liability in the event of a fire ignited by a downed wire. In exchange, the shut-off plan could be scrapped. 
 ''It's a beautiful lifestyle back there,'' Mr. Knight said, ''but there are risks.''

 Museums
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GUSTAVE CAILLEBOTTE: IMPRESSIONIST PAINTINGS FROM PARIS TO THE SEA,' through July 5. Thirty-some years ago, the museum had a big success with a Caillebotte retrospective that more or less introduced American audiences to an artist who was an Impressionist by association rather than by style or temperament. His three best-known pictures, ''The Floor Scrapers,'' ''The Pont de l'Europe'' and ''Paris Street, Rainy Day,'' all grand urban scenes from the late 1870s, are absent from this show, which is a more modest enterprise than a survey, with emphasis falling on less-focused late work. But Caillebotte was a painter as interesting for his weaknesses as for his strengths, and any exposure is valuable. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20090416 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'HERNAN BAS: WORKS FROM THE RUBELL FAMILY COLLECTION,' through May 24. With a loose, deft touch, this young Miamian paints and draws storytelling images of winsome young men in homoerotically charged situations. He also creates video installations, the best of which involve old films of women in mermaid costumes performing underwater. This disproportionately big and splashy 10-year retrospective was organized by, and first appeared at (in 2007), the Rubell Family Collection, a private museum in Miami where the art collectors Don and Mera Rubell exhibit their holdings. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20090416
 FRICK COLLECTION: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE NORTON SIMON MUSEUM,' through May 10. In a rare exchange that inaugurates a reciprocal loan agreement, five paintings from the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, Calif., have been temporarily installed in the Frick's Oval Room. The Simon paintings, which date from the 16th and 17th centuries, bring a whiff of fresh air into the Frick. None of the artists -- two Spaniards, two Italians and one Flemish master -- are currently represented in its collection. Of special note are Francisco de Zurbaran's ''Still Life With Lemons, Oranges and a Rose'' (1633), which has been freshly cleaned for the occasion, and Guercino's commanding portrait of an Italian count's pet mastiff, ''Aldrovandi Dog'' (1625). 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org.20090416
 (Karen Rosenberg)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 2009 YEAR OF FASHION, through May 3. Four synergistic shows inaugurate the museum's yearlong focus on fashion photography. Leading off is the snapping, crackling survey ''Weird Beauty: Fashion Photography Now'': a floor-to-ceiling, push-pull installation that clocks the genre as a fast-moving collective expression that is as esoteric as abstract art, and as startling as a sleek, hissing serpent in the drab garden of everyday reality. Stylists, in particular, shine. ''This Is Not a Fashion Photograph'' reveals faces, bodies, garments, poses and style in a century's worth of nonfashion photographs by everyone from Jacob Riis to Malick Sidibe. ''Edward Steichen: In High Fashion, the Conde Nast Years, 1923-1937'' affirms fashion photography's short history by examining in detail how this pioneer more or less invented both fashion photography and celebrity portraiture while working for Vogue and Vanity Fair. ''Munkacsi's Lost Archive'' is less an exhibition than a prelude to one, but it elucidates post-Steichen developments by highlighting Martin Munkacsi, a photographer who set fashion models in motion, further blurring the line between fashion and nonfashion photography. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, www.icp.org. (Roberta Smith)20090416
 JAPAN SOCIETY: 'KRAZY! THE DELIRIOUS WORLD OF ANIME + MANGA + VIDEO GAMES,' through June 14. This show addresses a vibrant chapter in the history of visual storytelling: a specifically Japanese set of approaches that has gained a worldwide following over the past two decades. It will not live up to its promise for devoted followers of Japanese pop culture, but as a multimedia sampler including comics, graphic novels, video games, action figures, animated cartoons and more, it might entice the uninitiated to explore the field more deeply. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Johnson)20090416
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'RECLAIMED: PAINTINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF JACQUES GOUDSTIKKER,' through Aug. 2. This show of paintings returned to the family of Goudstikker, a prominent Dutch gallery owner who died while fleeing the Nazis, is many exhibitions in one. It's a portrait of an enormously successful art dealer who shaped tastes and markets between the wars. It's a marriage of Northern Baroque and Southern Renaissance painting. Most of all, it's an extraordinary, continuing tale of looting and restitution. At the center of all these stories is a small black notebook, used by Goudstikker to catalog his inventory of some 1,400 works and now on display, in actual and digitized form, at the Jewish Museum. Other highlights include a landscape by Salomon von Jacobsz Ruysdael and a portrait by Rembrandt's pupil Ferdinand Bol. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090416
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ART OF THE KOREAN RENAISSANCE, 1400-1600,'through June 21. The Korean gallery at the Met is a trim, tall, well-proportioned box of light. But it's just one room, and a smallish one at that, a reflection of the museum's modest holdings in art from this Asian country. So no surprise that the expansive-sounding show is a small thing too, with four dozen objects, most of them -- ceramic jars, lacquered boxes, scroll paintings -- compact enough to be stashed in a closet. But what it lacks in grandeur, it makes up for in fineness, and in rarity.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090416
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'CAST IN BRONZE: FRENCH SCULPTURE FROM RENAISSANCE TO REVOLUTION,'through May 24. Most of the works in this impeccably scholarly exhibition display a cold impersonality, cramped imagination and slavish obeisance to the official culture of their times. But there are compelling exceptions, including small, action-packed sculptures representing episodes in the life of Hercules by Francois Lespingola, and Jean-Antoine Houdon's ''Winter or La Frileuse,'' a heartbreakingly lovely statue of a young woman nude, except for a shawl wrapped around her bowed head and shoulders.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090416
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LIVING LINE: SELECTED INDIAN DRAWINGS FROM THE SUBHASH KAPOOR GIFT,'through Sept. 7. This almost supernaturally beautiful exhibition presents 40 mostly small drawings by Indian miniaturists of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Rendered with amazing skill, the subjects include bearded aristocrats and bejeweled women; hunting scenes; wild animals and mythic beasts fighting; and gods, goddesses and demons ascending and descending. The art of drawing does not get much better than this.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090416
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'RAPHAEL TO RENOIR: DRAWINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF JEAN BONNA,'through April 26. Candy box displays like this show of 120 European drawings are natural crowd pleasers, and for obvious reasons. They're very much about comparison shopping and personal taste. Relax-and-browse is their operative mode. And if they are confections, their flavor has range and intensities, from soft-center sugary to dense bittersweet. History is here if you want to find it, but if you don't, that's O.K. Enjoy.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090416
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,'through fall 2009. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090416
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'WALKER EVANS AND THE PICTURE POSTCARD,'through May 25. This compact exhibition, the first drawn from the museum's extensive Walker Evans archives, unforgettably illuminates Evans's lean, influential documentary style: the picture postcards he collected from age 12 onward, an ultimate collection of 9,000 examples organized by subject. The show includes some 700 arranged in expanses that bring to mind Conceptual Art. Most visually rewarding is a smattering of his photographs, seen beside the postcards he made from them, for an unrealized project with the Museum of Modern Art. He was fearless about cropping, and often made outstanding images even better.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20090416
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ON THE MONEY: CARTOONS FOR THE NEW YORKER,' through May 24. Go to this exhibition and you will see not only how money is like a cartoon, but also how cartoons shed light on money. In more than 80 drawings, the complexities of economic theory dissolve into the far more pungent currency of social relations, of status and snobbery, pretense and pride, distilling finance to its human essence. Money becomes a chit in the social game, a medium of exchange in a world careering between boom and bust. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rothstein)20090416
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'THE THAW COLLECTION OF MASTER DRAWINGS: ACQUISITIONS SINCE 2002,' through May 3. The Thaw Collection of Master Drawings, promised to the Morgan Library & Museum, has been introduced to the public in a series of exhibitions since 1975, each reflecting the latest additions by the former art dealer Eugene V. Thaw and his wife, Clare. This installment of 80 recently acquired drawings from the past five centuries is a bit smaller than the last one in 2002-3, though it includes sure-to-please works by Ingres, Gauguin and others. Many selections reflect the Thaws' passion for 19th-century German Romantic art, which may not be for all tastes. The curators make the most of this historically unbalanced group, however, sketching out a pragmatically loose chronology. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)20090416
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'INTO THE SUNSET: PHOTOGRAPHY'S IMAGE OF THE AMERICAN WEST,'through June 8. Almost every one of this resonant exhibition's approximately 150 pictures dating from 1850 to 2008 evokes tension between the myth and the reality of the great American West. Its overall perspective is predictably bleak, but it is loaded with arresting images, from the 19th-century group portrait of the outlaw gang the Wild Bunch in suits and bowler hats to Irving Penn's glamorizing studio shot of five Hells Angels and their two girlfriends.(212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)20090416
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: THE PROBLEM PERSPECTIVE,'through May 11. The career of the German artist Martin Kippenberger, who died in 1997 at 44, was a brief, bold, foot-to-the-floor episode of driving under the influence. What was he high on? Alcohol, ambition, disobedience, motion, compulsive sociability, history and art in its many forms. But art in its many forms was exactly what he made -- specifically paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs, prints, posters, books -- all in madly prolific quantities. In every sense, he took up a lot of space, and he continues to in this first American retrospective, which spills out of top-floor galleries and down into the atrium. Not everything has equal punch. If messy and bad aren't your thing, and pristine objects are, he's not the artist for you. Yet in each work, the model he set for what an artist can be and do shines through.(212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)20090416
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PERFORMANCE 1: TEHCHING HSIEH,'through May 18. This small, gripping exhibition -- the first in a series dedicated to performance art -- centers on the documentation of ''Cage Piece'' (1978-79), the first of five ''One Year Performances'' by the deprivation-prone Taiwanese artist Tehching Hsieh. The piece entailed spending one year doing absolutely nothing in nearly solitary confinement in a cell-like cage, built in the artist's studio. The show includes the cell, as well as daily photographs of the artist that measure the year in the growth of his hair. Few performance pieces communicate the demands of this particular genre in such a basic, resonant way, or its ability to expand our understanding of time and space with such simple force.(212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090416
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'TANGLED ALPHABETS: LEON FERRARI AND MIRA SCHENDEL,'through June 15. This overly full show mixes together partial accounts of the work of two important South American artists instead of focusing on one. Leon Ferrari (Argentine, born 1920) and Mira Schendel (Brazilian, born in Switzerland, 1919-1988) shared an interest in abstraction contaminated by language, line and modest materials, especially paper and wire. But Ferrari is, at heart, a sardonic, sometimes grandiose Conceptualist whose best works elaborate a maniacal, nonsense calligraphy. Schendel was a purist with a Zen slant, adept at transferring random marks and letters to rice paper, from which she also made ephemeral sculptures. While the show opens a window on a complex history that ran parallel to, not behind, postwar art in the United States, the double survey suggests a failure to commit. Our loss.(212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090416
 NEUE GALERIE: 'BRUCKE: THE BIRTH OF EXPRESSIONISM IN DRESDEN AND BERLIN, 1905-1913,' through June 29. The original bad boys of 20th-century German art are featured in this visually aggressive show, specifically Erich Heckel, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Max Pechstein and their driven, putative leader, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. Together they revived a rawness of feeling, form and execution that had been largely absent from European art since the Middle Ages, but they also unleashed a palpable Dada swagger before Dada. As their dreams had not yet been trammeled by World War I, theirs was still a fairly cheerful barbarism, based on the belief that they could retrieve what was good and natural in the world if they just took off their clothes, danced around a bit and made art. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)20090416
 THE NEW MUSEUM: 'THE GENERATIONAL: YOUNGER THAN JESUS,' through July 5. The latest local survey to challenge the pre-eminence of the Whitney Biennial is big, international in scope and age-specific. As the title implies, only artists 33 or younger were considered for inclusion. The result is a serious, carefully considered show, but one that with a few magnetic entries aside -- a video by Cyprien Galliard; an animation by Wojciech Bakowski; a madcap Ryan Trecartin installation -- feels sedate for a youthfest. Despite the global reach, it's oddly familiar, like a more-substantial-than-average weekend gallery hop in Chelsea and the Lower East Side, right down to token African and Asian imports. Still, there are many intriguing artists to look (and listen) for, among them the filmmakers Keren Cytter and Luke Fowler; the painter Tala Madani; the collagist Haris Epaminonda; the digital whiz-kid Mark Essen; the photographer Elad Lassry; and the multitaskers Ruth Ewan, Ziad Antar, Dineo Seshee Bopape, Liu Chuang, Ahmet Ogut, Guthrie Lonergan, Ciprian Muresan and Icaro Zorbar. There is also, as it happens, a much livelier survey to be found in an accompanying book called ''Younger Than Jesus: Artist Directory,'' which features nearly 500 artists who didn't make the final exhibition cut. A panel discussion led by Brian Sholis with three now older-than-Jesus artists of earlier generations -- Carroll Dunham, Joan Jonas and Mira Schor -- on Saturday at 3 p.m. should be worth hearing. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090416
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through Oct. 5. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20090416
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'JONATHAN HOROWITZ: AND/OR,' through Sept. 14. Andy Warhol's grandchildren, numerous beyond count, have cashed in on his rich and radical legacy to see what further possibilities it might yield. Such is the case with the New York artist Jonathan Horowitz in this smart, crisply edited retrospective. The works evoke the media-saturated art of the 1970s, the neo-Conceptualist consumer art of the 1980s, and the identity art of the 1990s, landing in a Neverneverland era, in which analog is poised to turn to digital, and Doris Day and Paris Hilton have equal currency. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)20090416
 QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'QUEENS INTERNATIONAL 4,' through April 26. It says a lot about New York cosmopolitanism that one of its museums can present an International and still restrict its selection to artists living and working in one borough. The fourth edition of this biennial Queens survey includes participants with direct or second-generation roots in China, Czechoslovakia, England, Greece, India, Iran, Israel, Japan and South Korea, as well as in several countries in Central America and the Caribbean. Yet there is little sense of this being an ''identity'' show of the kind we were accustomed to a decade ago. Some works suggest the many options artists are now pursuing: carved marble versions of consumer throwaways by Lars Fisk; Tommy Hartung's video about a fictional explorer; and an installation by Las Hermanas Iglesias -- two sisters, Janelle and Lisa Iglesias -- providing dance instructions for a new music combining merengue and Norwegian polkas. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090416
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'JENNY HOLZER: PROTECT PROTECT,'through May 31. After decades of pelting us with unsettling, increasingly relevant portents, Jenny Holzer can say, ''I told you so.'' This 15-year survey proves that her signature LED-sign conflations of poetry, politics, reading and seeing are ever more dazzling; her warnings about the military-commercial-entertainment complex ever more pertinent. In addition, as time has overtaken her, Ms. Holzer has turned from soothsaying to simply reporting the facts. Her latest light works and paintings take their language and motifs entirely from declassified and redacted government documents concerning the war in Iraq. This is a beautiful show, but not a pretty sight.(212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20090416
 Galleries: Uptown
 JAMES CASTLE: 'DRAWINGS: VISION AND TOUCH,' through April 25. His atmospheric, extravagantly tonal soot drawings make Castle (1899-1977) something like the Vuillard of the American West, as well as one of the greatest outsider artists of the 20th century. These 34 landscapes, farmyards and interiors have never been exhibited. They picture the world of Castle's childhood and reflect an acute visual intelligence and an instinctive grasp of space, both of which were undoubtedly sharpened by the artist's deafness. They are lonely, silent, but immensely tender images. Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 794-0550, knoedlergallery.com. (Smith)20090416
 Galleries: Chelsea
 DAVIDE BALULA: 'AMERICAN WALL NUT,' through next Friday. Fake Estate, opened by Julia Trotta in 2007, may not be the smallest gallery in town, but it certainly is minute, being confined to a former utility closet in a building that houses other galleries of regulation size. And the young French artist Davide Balula makes good use of these dimensions in a solo show that consists of a single, succinct visual gesture questioning the solidity of architecture, the stability of our sense of space and the absurdity of the concept of real estate. Fake Estate, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 502A, (917) 499-9005, fakeestate.us. (Cotter)20090416
 VERA ILIATOVA: 'CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR ,' through April 25. Ms. Iliatova's second solo show intrigues without satisfying. She paints a world inhabited only by teenage girls loitering in groups among trees or on the shores of lakes, rivers or the Gowanus Canal, occasionally in buildings or among ruins. These structures can be vintage, industrial or Modernist and also form distant urban backgrounds. The colors and quasi-academic rendering evoke American Social Realism; the show's fanciful news release, written by the artist Kevin Zucker, cites Cezanne, Morandi and Fairfield Porter, which also works, given the soft light, fractured skies and stop-and-start paint-handling. These scenes suffer from visual anemia and brittleness, but they are strange and intentional enough to rouse interest in what comes next. Monya Rowe Gallery, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-5065, monyarowegallery.com. (Smith)20090416
 GAVIN TURK: 'JAZZZ,' through May 2. A nonexpert could mistake the paintings in this show for vintage Jackson Pollocks. Mr. Turk made them by repeatedly dripping his own signature on canvases up to 23 feet wide. They're clever meditations on identity and authorship, as is a film in which the artist imitates a famous 18th-century chess-playing automaton known as ''the Mechanical Turk.'' Sean Kelly Gallery, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, skny.com. (Johnson)20090416
 RICHARD TUTTLE: 'WALKING ON AIR,' through April 25. Mr. Tuttle's new fusions of painting and sculpture are a joy to behold. All 12 pieces have the same basic structure: two narrow, horizontal lengths of fabric, one above and slightly overlapping the other, are fitted with grommets by which they hang from projecting finishing nails. Tie-dyed colors and textures nostalgically evoke hippie consciousness, and the marriage of the material and the immaterial is at once austere and seductive. Pace Wildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, (212) 929-7000, pacewildenstein.com. (Johnson)20090416
 Galleries: SoHo
 LAURIE ANDERSON: 'FROM THE AIR: TWO INSTALLATIONS,' through May 2. Ms. Anderson, the artist and cross-over pop star, here presents two modest works. An audio piece has a high-tech overhead speaker projecting quiet sounds and poetic fragments of speech in such a way that it seems as if they were inside your head. The other piece is in the form of a miniature video projection in which Ms. Anderson tells a story about vultures menacing her little dog in the mountains of Northern California. It's about post-9/11 New York. Location One, 26 Greene Street, at Grand Street, (212) 334-3347, location1.org. (Johnson)20090416
 Galleries: Other
 KINKE KOOI: 'LET ME COMFORT YOU,' through April 25. With a meticulously refined and voluptuously sensuous touch and mischievous humor, this Dutch artist draws fantastic, densely patterned, erotically suggestive pictures that resemble collaborations between Hans Bellmer and a painter of classical Indian miniatures. Her works relate to a kind of psychedelic doodling that has been popular in the past decade or so, but they have their own surrealistic vibe. Feature Inc., 276 Bowery, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 675-7772, featureinc.com. (Johnson)20090416
 'NOBLE TOMBS AT MAWANGDUI: ART AND LIFE IN THE CHANGSHA KINGDOM, THIRD CENTURY B.C.E. TO FIRST CENTURY C.E.,' through June 7. In the early 1970s three tombs were discovered in southeastern China. Because they had never been plundered and because of the unusually well-preserved state of their contents, the discovery caused a worldwide sensation in archaeological circles. This show presents about 70 of more than 3,000 objects that were excavated, including fabric samples, lacquer ware, lamps, grooming tools and wooden figurines. China Institute, 125 East 65th Street, (212) 744-8181, chinainstitute.org. (Johnson)20090416
 Out of Town
 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA: 'DIRT ON DELIGHT: IMPULSES THAT FORM CLAY,' through June 21. Ignoring the art-craft divide, this bold show examines ceramics in its own right. With George Ohr as Jackson Pollock, it ranges from postwar greats like Peter Voulkos and Ken Price, to younger eminences like Adrian Saxe and Arlene Shechet, to new arrivals like Sterling Ruby, Jessica Jackson Hutchins and Jeffry Mitchell. The clash of approaches to beauty, technique, scale, color and finish is exuberantly edifying. It foments hope that the Minimal-Conceptual-Relational art religion (important as it is) could wither away, and curators of contemporary art could regain full use of their eyes and thus their brains. 118 South 36th Street, Philadelphia, (215) 898-7108, icaphila.org. (Smith)20090416
 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHEPARD FAIREY: SUPPLY AND DEMAND,' through Aug. 16. The surprise of the first museum retrospective for the creator of the Obama Hope poster is that almost everything he does, from abstracted images of Andre the Giant to his album covers for Led Zeppelin and other bands, is visually arresting. But in tracking his 20-year evolution from aesthetic anarchist to savvy, all-purpose designer and illustrator, the exhibition inadvertently casts doubt on his authenticity as a radical street artist. 100 Northern Avenue, Boston, (617) 478-3100, icaboston.org. (Johnson)20090416
 ZOE LEONARD, through Sept. 7. Always an exceptionally moving artist, though only sporadically visible, Zoe Leonard has an exhibition Dia:Beacon, an hour and a half north of the city. It is different from some of her earlier shows: cooler and less intimate, documentary in form, broadly social in scope. At the same time, it shares a sensibility with what has come before, one attuned to realities of constant change, which as often as not means loss. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diaart.org. (Cotter)20090416
 NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'PRIDE OF PLACE: DUTCH CITYSCAPES OF THE GOLDEN AGE,' through May 3. There is nothing like a beautiful city, and there are several, lovingly painted, in this quiet, gorgeous exhibition. The display of 48 paintings, 22 maps and assorted atlases and printed books includes works by Jan van Goyen, Gerrit Berckheyde, Jan van der Heyden, Jacob van Ruisdael and other preternaturally skillful painters of intensely realistic yet idyllic images of cities and towns viewed from far and near. National Mall, Fourth and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, D.C., (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Johnson)20090416
 NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN ART, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION: 'MAMI WATA: ARTS FOR WATER SPIRITS IN AFRICA AND ITS DIASPORAS,' through July 26. Mami Wata is Mother Water, Mother of Fish, goddess of oceans, rivers and pools, with sources in West and Central Africa and tributaries throughout the African Americas, from Bahia to Brooklyn. Usually shown as a half-woman, half-fish, she slips with ease between incompatible elements: water and air, tradition and modernity, this life and the next. Provider of riches, she is the natural bailout savior for our time, and this exhibition, organized by the Fowler Museum of Cultural History in Los Angeles, presents her in all her shape-shifting glory. The show's creator, Henry John Drewal, has compressed three decades of Mami watching into vivid visual form; the Washington curator, Christine Mullen Kreamer, has devised a fantastic, subaqueous showcase for a powerhouse spiritual diva. 950 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, D.C., (202) 633-4600, africa.si.edu. (Cotter)20090416
 Last Chance
 JANE ALEXANDER; closes on Saturday. This solo exhibition for an important South African artist is small and made up entirely of photomontage prints rather than of the half-human, half-animal sculptures for which she is best known. But in a sense, the sculptures are animatedly present in these digitally manipulated pictures, which give an unforgettably dreamlike view of Africa as a place where geologic epochs merge, and where everyone is a stranger in a strange land. Jack Shainman Gallery, 513 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-1701, jackshainman.com. (Cotter)20090416
 'BERLIN 2000'; closes on Saturday. This large, messy group show of large, messy art is a panoramic cultural snapshot. It distills the heady, disoriented, free-for-all spirit of a major art-making city in the decade immediately after the destruction of the Berlin Wall. Many of the names, from John Bock to Katja Strunz, are familiar in New York. Others -- Uwe Henneken, Halina Kliem, Erwin Kneihsl, Alicja Kwade, Gunter Reski, Jenny Rosemeyer, Suse Weber, Tilman Wendland -- probably should be. The whole affair adds up to a substantial complement to the Martin Kippenberger retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. Pace Wildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-4258, pacewildenstein.com. (Cotter)20090416
 'BRAZZA: A SYMBOL FOR HUMANITY'; closes on Saturday. This show consists of a single 12-part oil-on-canvas mural by 11 artists from a group collectively known as the Poto-Poto Painters, located in Brazzaville, the Congo Republic. The painting is partly a tribute to Pietro Savorgnan di Brazza, the European explorer after whom the city is named, and who is the subject of the exhibition ''Brazza in Congo: A Life and Legacy'' at Casa Italiana at New York University through Friday. The National Arts Club has a delightful video of interviews with the artists. National Arts Club, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212) 475-3424, nationalartsclub.org. (Cotter)20090416
 JAMES CASTLE; closes on Saturday. One of the geniuses of 20th-century outsider art is represented here by his subtle grisaille drawings of his family farm rendered in soot mixed with spit; his more rudimentary images created from brightly colored paper pulp (also self-made); and his relatively jarring constructions of folded paper and cardboard tied together with string (exemplified here by a magnificent black pram). All have markedly different effects. The cardboard pieces suggest that in his understanding of structure, moving parts and the abbreviation of familiar forms, Castle used cardboard as brilliantly as Alexander Calder used wire, but with more corners. Ameringer Yohe Fine Art, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 445-0102, ameringer-yohe.com. (Smith)20090416
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'THE THIRD MIND: AMERICAN ARTISTS CONTEMPLATE ASIA: 1860-1989'; closes on Sunday. This strange, often beautiful, long-overdue show gives us, as expected, nature, cosmic consciousness and tons of Zen. But there's also enough revisionist thinking to muss up standard accounts of American Modernism. Not everything works; the installation alternates blank stretches with cluttered stretches, and sculpture seems a bit tossed in. But who cares, if you have under-regarded artists like Mark Tobey, Morris Graves, Paul Kos, Natvar Bhavsar, Zarina Hashmi, Tadaaki Kuwayama, Lee Mullican, Gordon Onslow-Ford, Harry Smith, Jordan Belson, James Whitney, Linda Montano, Mark Thompson and Tehching Hsieh to contemplate? There's a lot of bliss to follow here, not the least being that the Guggenheim has, for once, defied the market and gone for a subject still little-known. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter)20090416
 BARBARA KRUGER: 'PRE-DIGITAL 1980-1992'; closes on Saturday. ''Truth through advertising'' could be a blanket title for Barbara Kruger's art from the 1980s, which uses the stripped-down graphs and punched-out language of commercial promotion to deliver political warnings and admonitions. Although we've come to expect large scale from Ms. Kruger -- billboard-size paintings, gallery-filling installations -- everything in this show is small, roughly the size of a book or magazine page. Each piece takes the form of old-style cut-and-paste mechanicals, long since made obsolete by computer software, but once assembled by hand using printed galleys, an X-Acto knife and paste. Many of Ms. Kruger's best-known pieces are enlarged versions of these originals. Skarstedt Gallery, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 737-2060, skarstedt.com. (Cotter)20090416
 YOON LEE, JONATHAN SCHIPPER, TAVARES STRACHAN; closes on Sunday. The Boiler, a new gallery that is a converted factory boiler room, is an annex to the pioneering Pierogi gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, a few blocks away. Pierogi continues to have one-person exhibitions, most recently a superbly witty and timely one by the artist David Shapiro, who is surely Whitney Biennial material. But the Boiler opens new possibilities for large-scale projects, in this case a very large painting by Yoon Lee; a many-eyed surveillance satellite by Jonathan Schipper; and Tavares Trachan's continent-and-climate-leaping ''Distance Between What We Have and What We Want (Arctic Ice Project),'' with a piece of North Pole real estate in a freezer. The Boiler, 191 North 14th Street, Williamsburg, (718) 599-2144, pierogi2000.com. (Cotter)20090416
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'PIERRE BONNARD: THE LATE INTERIORS';closes on Sunday. This sumptuous show presents around 40 of the interiors and still lifes that Bonnard painted between 1923 and his death early in 1947, a time usually identified with the Bather paintings that are considered his masterpieces. Those works are missed here, but not terribly. Compensation comes mainly from some nearly abstract still lifes and several large canvases in which Bonnard combines still life, interior, landscape and painting-within-painting into a fabulous optical puzzle. The images expand time through their pictorial complexity, saturated colors and shifting textures, as well as through the semi-hidden figures whose sudden appearances -- even though they've been there all along -- suggest events unfolding.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20090416
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'SECOND LIVES: REMIXING THE ORDINARY'; closes on Sunday. The inaugural show in the Museum of Arts and Design's jewel-box-like building continues its haphazard segue from a concentration on craft to a hipper, more wide-ranging program. Unfortunately, the focus is a strategy that is epidemic in the larger art world: the massing of something small (plastic spoons, ladies' pumps, spools of thread, dangling eyeglasses) into something large (a pyramid, a love seat, a view of the ''Mona Lisa,'' a chandelier). It is Surrealism 101, descended from Meret Oppenheim's beloved and far too influential fur-lined teacup. Basically, you see the thing. You see the things it is made of. Something in the way of a punch line follows. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Smith)20090416
 THOMAS SCHEIBITZ: 'MISSING LINK IN DELPHI'; closes on Saturday. This German painter may not get enough respect on these shores, but he continues to excel at slightly wan paintings that shouldn't work but do; look abstract but aren't entirely; almost lapse into graphic design but don't; and are occasionally transposed into equally hapless-looking sculpture. Several failed utopias lurk within Mr. Scheibitz's compositions, but they are neither especially ridiculed nor mourned. Mainly he affirms that their forms still have meaning and possibilities in our time, despite the visible hollowness -- the loss of ideals and the collapse of programmatic schemes. The weirdly ersatz, irradiated color helps. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com. (Smith)20090416

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: Guggenheim Museum: 'The Third Mind: American Artists Contemplate Asia: 1860-1989': Georgia O'Keeffe's 1917 work ''Abstraction'' is featured in this extensive exhibition, closing on Sunday, which explores the philosophical and aesthetic impact of Eastern culture on American art over more than a century.

HEADLINE: Strong Ending to an Up-and-Down Day

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY; David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Solid profits at the banking giant JPMorgan Chase gave investors another reason to feel optimistic on Thursday, and they pushed stocks sharply higher, shrugging off another batch of shaky economic data. 
 For a second day, stock markets that spent the day seesawing turned higher in the last hour of trading and finished strong. Consumer companies and technology firms led the upswing, which lifted the major indexes to their highest closing since mid-February.
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 95.81 points or 1.19 percent, to close at 8,125.43 while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 13.24 points, or 1.55 percent, higher at 865.30. The Nasdaq, which lagged on Wednesday because of losses in technology companies, outpaced the other indexes by rising 43.64 points, or nearly 2.7 percent, higher at 1,670.44.
 Although investors had been bracing for an earnings season of lower profits and recession-driven losses, big banks and other companies have been offering positive surprises, fueling hopes that the worst of the economic decline may be abating. Investors pushed shares of Google 2.4 percent higher, to $388.74, ahead of the company's first-quarter earnings report. After markets closed, Google said its revenue declined from the previous quarter, but was still up 6 percent over last year.
 Shares of JPMorgan closed 2.1 percent higher at $33.24 after the bank reported a profit of $2.1 billion for the first quarter, a decline from a year ago, but better than analysts had expected. 
 Just three months after major banks reported staggering losses, JPMorgan became the latest to announce solid profits. Wells Fargo said it expected to report a record $3 billion in profits, and Goldman Sachs this week announced profits of $1.66 billion.
 Yet, some analysts expect a pullback from the recent rally.
 ''We're sort of approaching the upper bound of where we should be, and it's starting to look a bit stretched,'' said Binky Chadha, chief United States equity strategist at Deutsche Bank. 
 Manufacturing conditions remain somber. The shopping mall owner General Growth Properties and the newsprint company AbitibiBowater filed for bankruptcy protection on Thursday. Housing starts fell to one of their slowest rates on record, but some economists saw traces of a bottom. Weekly jobless claims fell, but continuing claims for unemployment insurance topped 6 million.
 The Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported that regional manufacturing contracted in April, saying that its reading on manufacturing was a negative 24.4 for April compared with a negative 35 in March. Though the report indicated an improvement from March, employment and new orders remained negative.
 The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by General Growth, one of the largest real estate investment companies in the United States, underscored the dismal outlook for the American commercial property sector. 
 In credit markets, interest rates rose. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year bill fell 19/32, to 99 9/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.83 percent, up from 2.76 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: A Fund Manager Wins, and Moves On

BYLINE: By ZACHERY KOUWE

 BODY:
William A. Ackman makes a lot of noise for someone in the hush-hush business of hedge funds. He harangues executives, goads boards, talks this stock up and that one down -- all in search of profit. 
 On Thursday, someone listened. After a campaign by Mr. Ackman that had lasted for months, one of the nation's largest operators of shopping malls, General Growth Properties, filed for bankruptcy protection. 
 Now Mr. Ackman, who runs a hedge fund called Pershing Square Capital Management, is positioning his fund to pick up the pieces. Pershing controls 25 percent of General Growth and will play a crucial role in restructuring the company. If Mr. Ackman gets his way, he and his investors could walk off with hundreds of millions of dollars in profits. 
 Given the ins and outs of bankruptcy proceedings, his payday is by no means assured. And Mr. Ackman, 42, has stumbled before. His first hedge fund failed -- ''blew up,'' in Wall Street parlance. A recent investment in Target, the big retailer, has plunged in value, and he is battling with management over the direction of the company. 
 Not everyone is a fan of Mr. Ackman. Some argue that his tactics distract executives who should be focused on running their businesses. 
 Irwin M. Jacobs, a co-founder of Qualcomm and a personal friend of Target's chairman emeritus, Robert J. Ulrich, has few kind words. 
 ''How can a man sit there and criticize a management team and a board in these economic times just because he made a badly timed investment?'' said Mr. Jacobs, who lives in Minneapolis, where Target is based. ''To distract this company the way he's doing and to shake up this community is just insane.''
 Mr. Ackman is unbowed. Indeed, he is already training his sights elsewhere: at the nation's troubled banking industry. He is betting that the share prices of big banks will decline, and hoping to give them a little push. 
 In an interview, Mr. Ackman argued that banks like Citigroup and Bank of America are effectively insolvent, a view some economists share, but the banks vigorously deny. He plans to begin a media blitz urging banks' bondholders to exchange their debt for equity in order to shore up the institutions. Such a move would, in all likelihood, sink banking shares, profiting Mr. Ackman.
 Mr. Ackman said he is only protecting the interests of investors and, the case of banks, taxpayers. ''The problem when you are C.E.O. of a business is that you get used to being able to do anything you want, and you get a little bit too full of yourself,'' he said.
 Mr. Ackman has never been shy about speaking his mind. In high school, a friend suggested his yearbook epigram: ''A closed mouth gathers no foot.'' 
 While most hedge fund managers shun the limelight, Mr. Ackman reaches out to the media to promote his views. That approach stems in large part from a scrape in 2002 with Eliot Spitzer, then the attorney general of New York. 
 Mr. Spitzer opened an investigation into whether Gotham Partners, Mr. Ackman's firm at the time, manipulated the market by publishing research promoting its positions. He eventually dropped his investigation, and Mr. Ackman was exonerated, but not without having his reputation tarnished for a time. 
 ''I think Bill learned a lot about how to handle the media and get his point across by watching Eliot go after him,'' said one close adviser to Mr. Ackman.
 In the case of General Growth, Mr. Ackman was clear from the start that the company should file for protection from its creditors. He invested last fall, as the financial crisis reached a fever pitch, and for months urged the company to seek bankruptcy. (Pershing has not disclosed the price at which it bought its General Growth stock.) General Growth controls Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston and the South Street Seaport in New York, and Mr. Ackman argues that its properties are worth far more than they are valued on its books. 
 Pershing has agreed to lend General Growth $375 million so it can continue to operate in bankruptcy. The loan and the equity stake give Mr. Ackman a powerful seat at the table with General Growth creditors. He also hopes to join the board, giving him even more leverage in shaping the company's future.
 At Target, Mr. Ackman is campaigning to put five handpicked representatives, including himself, on the board. That battle has already intensified, with Target's chief executive, Gregg W. Steinhafel, attacking Mr. Ackman in a recent letter for trying to force the company to make what he characterized as short-term, risky strategic changes in the midst of a recession.
 Pershing owns its stake in Target through several funds, including one set up two years ago for the sole purpose of investing in one company. That fund, which uses options to leverage its investment in Target, had lost over 90 percent of its value in February, prompting Mr. Ackman to cut fees and allow some investors to cash out. He called the investment ''one of the greatest disappointments of my career to date'' and apologized ''profusely'' for the fund's results in a letter to investors. Target, of course, happily pointed out the losses in its letter to shareholders.
 But because of its position in option contracts on Target's stock, the fund has risen over 80 percent since the beginning of March, as Target's share price has skyrocketed. Mr. Ackman points out that his other funds own over $1 billion worth of common stock, and that he personally has $100 million invested in the company.
 ''I own more Target stock than any executive of the company -- full stop,'' Mr. Ackman said. ''There is no one in the world that has a greater economic incentive to see this company succeed and minimize its risk of failing.''
 Board elections are scheduled for May 28. Mr. Ackman thinks his slate includes people with experience in retailing, credit cards and real estate, something he says the company's board currently lacks. Target says its board is made up of ''world-class corporate leaders.'' 
 Asked if he is ever overly confident, Mr. Ackman said: ''I was full of myself years ago and experience has humbled me.''

CORRECTION-DATE: April 18, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman misidentified the business executive who criticized Mr. Ackman's activist investor tactics. He is Irwin L. Jacobs, who runs the private equity firm Genmar Financial -- not Irwin M. Jacobs, a co-founder of Qualcomm.

HEADLINE: Task to Aid Self-Esteem Lifts Grades For Some

BYLINE: By BENEDICT CAREY

 BODY:
Some seventh graders who were struggling in class did significantly better after performing a series of brief confidence-building writing exercises, and the improvements continued through eighth grade, researchers reported Thursday. 
 The students who benefited most were blacks who were doing poorly, the study found; the exercises made no difference for white students, or for black ones who were already doing well.
 Experts cautioned that the writing was hardly transforming. Those who benefited were still barely getting C's, on average, by the end of middle school.
 Yet the results were surprising, because interventions to improve school performance tend to have short-term benefits, and the writing assignments were simple 15-minute efforts. 
 By the end of eighth grade, the students who benefited had nearly a half-point higher grade point average than struggling peers who completed a different writing exercise. The study was published in the journal Science.
 ''A difference of a third or more on G.P.A. is a large effect, and what's surprising is that there was apparently no fadeout of the effect,'' said Greg Duncan, an economist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the research. ''Fadeout is the coin of the realm in school intervention studies.''
 The researchers, led by Geoffrey L. Cohen, a social psychologist at the University of Colorado, had seventh graders in suburban Connecticut schools do the assignment three to five times through that school year. It asked them to choose from a list values that were most important to them -- including athletic ability, sense of humor, creativity and being smart -- and to write why those values were so important. The students were randomly assigned, within classes, to do the exercise or a control assignment that was not focused on their values.
 In previous studies, researchers had found that such exercises reduced stress and the fear of failure in some students. By the end of eighth grade, among black students who were struggling, those who had expressed in writing their most important values had an average G.P.A. that was 0.4 points higher than those who had not.
 ''The idea is that a bad experience early in school can have lasting effects, and that if we can do something in that crucial window, it could alter the student's trajectory slightly and change the arc of their experience over time,'' Dr. Cohen said.
 The assignment, he said, reminded students that their entire self-worth was not riding on a single test result. 
 Dr. Cohen's co-authors were Julio Garcia of Colorado; Valerie Purdie-Vaughns of Columbia University; and Nancy Apfel and Patricia Brzustoski of Yale. 
 The authors found, too, that those who benefited from the exercises felt more adequate as students on average than those struggling peers who did the control assignment. One reason black students benefited more than whites may be that they have more anxiety over academic performance because of racial stereotypes, the authors suggest.
 The writing exercise did not mention race, but previous research has found that reminding minorities of stereotypes can worsen their performance on a variety of tests.
 ''But there's no reason to think that it couldn't benefit kids who are highly anxious about tests, of any race,'' Dr. Cohen said. ''We haven't looked at that yet.''

HEADLINE: Passover's Over, and Bagels Are Back, Big

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Giasuddin Ahmed ran through the timetable. ''The guys arrive at 4:30 a.m. to make the bagels,'' he said. ''At 5:30 a.m., the coffee. Open, 6 a.m.''
 He left out one step. Someone had to tear down the white paper that had been taped over the plate-glass windows of the store he runs -- and the signs that said the store, 72nd Street Bagel, on the West Side, would be closed for Passover. 
 Mr. Ahmed and other bagel makers say that the first business day after the holiday ends -- Friday -- is typically one of their busiest days of the year as Jewish customers line up to observe the passing of at least eight days of yeast privation. 
 Bagel makers spent Thursday contemplating the end of Passover. Some, like Mr. Ahmed, gave their ovens and mixing bowls the once-over after time off during the holiday, which started at sundown on April 8. His store follows kosher dietary rules and treats Passover as an eight-day holiday, as many observant Jews do. (Reform Jews typically celebrate Passover for seven days, said Rabbi Andy Bachman, the senior rabbi at Congregation Beth Elohim in Park Slope, Brooklyn.)
 During Passover, many Jews avoid leavened products in commemoration of the exodus from Egypt, during which, according to Old Testament tradition, the Israelites had so little time to flee that the bread they were baking did not have time to rise, and came out of the ovens as matzo.
 That means eight bagel-free days, unless you make bagels with matzo meal (there are recipes on the Internet). People who have not had a bagel in eight days make the post-Passover time busy -- as busy, Mr. Ahmed said, as Thanksgiving Day, when crowds watch the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade stream down Central Park West, a block from his shop.
 ''Generally,'' he said, ''we do one and a half times'' the normal business on the day after Passover ends.
 Some bagel shops shut down for part of Passover. Ess-a-Bagel, with two stores on the East Side, closed for the first two days of the holiday, said Florence Wilpon, who started Ess-a-Bagel with her husband and her brother in 1976. 
 For some Jews, a Thursday evening bagel would have been premature, she said.
 ''People who observe Passover would not eat from flour made during Passover,'' she said. ''They'd eat bagels made with flour and dough mixed after sundown on Thursday.''
 Lenny's Bagels, on Broadway at 98th Street, was open during Passover. But Benjamin Choi, the owner, said that business was down 20 percent during the eight-day holiday. He said he typically makes up for that as the holiday ends.
 How many more bagels would Lenny's make for Thursday evening and Friday morning? ''I don't count,'' Mr. Choi said. 
 But he did the math. ''On an average day, we sell 50 dozen,'' he said. ''Thursday night and Friday, it's 70 dozen.''
 Terrace Bagels in Park Slope was planning no such increase, but could handle a sudden jump in demand if it materialized. ''We bake as needed all day long,'' said Anthony Thompson, the manager. 
 ''Do I expect to sell more?'' he asked. ''Yes. It's hard to say with the economy the way it is. You think you're going to do good, you do nothing. You think you're going to do nothing, you've got a line of people out the door.'' 
 He said there had been ''a slight drop'' in sales during Passover. ''But I put that more to people going away for vacation because school is out,'' he said.
 Rabbi Bachman said he knows more people who are hungry for pizza or pasta, which are also off limits during Passover, than for bagels. 
 ''Maybe what that tells you is that what we're slowly experiencing is the Americanization of Jewish eating proclivities,'' Rabbi Bachman said. ''People will go out for more American food than the classic Jewish ethnic food of the bagels. People rush to eat after the Yom Kippur fast, but most people I know don't rush for a bagel. They go for a slice with some pasta.''

HEADLINE: A Loud and Promised Land

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

DATELINE: TEL AVIV 

 BODY:
 On my 12th visit to Israel, I finally had my baptism by traffic accident. I was sitting at a red light, when a bus turning the corner honked at me to back up. When I did, I scraped the fender of the car behind me.
 The driver -- a young, hip-looking, alt-rocker dude -- came running out of the car in a fury. He ran up to the bus driver and got into a ferocious screaming match. Then he came up to me graciously and kindly. We were brothers in the war against bus drivers. Then, as we were filling out our paperwork, another bus happened by and honked. The rocker ran out into the street and got into another ferocious screaming match with this driver. Then he came back to me all smiles and warmth. 
 Israel is a country held together by argument. Public culture is one long cacophony of criticism. The politicians go at each other with a fury we can't even fathom in the U.S. At news conferences, Israeli journalists ridicule and abuse their national leaders. Subordinates in companies feel free to correct their superiors. People who move here from Britain or the States talk about going through a period of adjustment as they learn to toughen up and talk back. 
 Ethan Bronner, The Times's Jerusalem bureau chief, notes that Israelis don't observe the distinction between the public and private realms. They treat strangers as if they were their brothers-in-law and feel perfectly comfortable giving them advice on how to live. 
 One Israeli acquaintance recounts the time he was depositing money into his savings account and everybody else behind him in line got into an argument about whether he should really be putting his money somewhere else. Another friend tells of the time he called directory assistance to get a phone number for a restaurant. The operator responded, ''You don't want to eat there,'' and proceeded to give him the numbers of some other restaurants she thought were better. 
 We can all think of reasons that Israeli culture should have evolved into a reticence-free zone, and that the average behavior should be different here. This is a tough, scrappy country, perpetually fighting for survival. The most emotionally intense experiences are national ones, so the public-private distinction was bound to erode. Moreover, the status system doesn't really revolve around money. It consists of trying to prove you are savvier than everybody else, that above all you are nobody's patsy. 
 As an American Jew, I was taught to go all gooey-eyed at the thought of Israel, but I have to confess, I find the place by turns exhausting, admirable, annoying, impressive and foreign. Israel's enemies claim the country is an outpost of Western colonialism. That's not true. Israel is, in large measure, a Middle Eastern country, and the Israeli-Arab dispute is in part an intra-Mideast conflict. 
 This culture of disputatiousness does yield some essential fruits. First, it gives the country a special vividness. There is no bar on earth quite so vibrant as a bar filled with Israelis. 
 Second, it explains the genuine national unity. Israel is the most diverse small country imaginable. Nonetheless, I may be interviewing a left-wing artist in Tel Aviv or a right-wing settler in Hebron, and I can be highly confident that they will have a few things in common: an intense sense of national mission, a hunger for emotionally significant moments, an inability to read social signals when I try to suggest that I really don't want them to harangue me about moving here and adopting their lifestyle. 
 Most important, this argumentative culture nurtures a sense of responsibility. The other countries in this region are more gracious, but often there is a communal unwillingness to accept responsibility for national problems. The Israelis, on the other hand, blame themselves for everything and work hard to get the most out of each person. From that wail of criticism things really do change. I come here nearly annually, and while the peace process is always the same, there is always something unrecognizable about the national scene -- whether it is the structure of the political parties, the absorption of immigrants or the new engines of economic growth. 
 Today, Israel is stuck in a period of frustrating stasis. Iran poses an existential threat that is too big for Israel to deal with alone. Hamas and Hezbollah will frustrate peace plans, even if the Israelis magically do everything right.
 This conflict will go on for a generation or more. Israelis will keep up their insufferable and necessary barrage of self-assertion. And yet we still dream of peace and the day when I am standing in line at an Israeli cash register and an Israeli shopper sees a chance to butt in front of me, and -- miracle of miracles -- she will not try to take it.

HEADLINE: Replicating The Charm, Not the Edge

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
By the middle of the seventh inning Thursday, the Yankees' highly anticipated home opener had officially been declared a disaster. The Yankees opened a new season and christened a new stadium in the eerie shadow of the old. 
 The home team trailed, 10-1, after a nine-run seventh by the Cleveland Indians on the way to a 10-2 loss. And Yankees players were showered with boos in the new $1.6 billion stadium. 
 For most major league baseball teams, the home opener is the essence of the clean slate, the fresh start. For the Yankees, the idea of starting with a clean slate is daunting, like climbing Mount Everest. After they were pasted Thursday, the incline became a lot steeper. 
 This was much more than a simple home opener: This was the opening of a lavish new Yankee Stadium, built by a franchise with baseball's highest payroll, despite the economic collapse around it -- a franchise accustomed to winning championships, although it hasn't won a World Series title since 2000. Old Yankee Stadium represented one of the greatest, or at least one of the most storied, home-field advantages in North American sports. Visiting players routinely gushed about walking into the Stadium and soaking in its history.
 With a simple move across the street, that part of the Yankees' legacy is gone and the franchise, payroll aside, is now on a level playing field with the competition. 
 After Thursday's game, pitcher C. C. Sabathia was asked whether the new Stadium, with its amenities, felt as special as the one he used to visit when he was a member of the Indians.
 ''It still has that feel because the park still looks kind of like the old Stadium,'' Sabathia said. ''But it's a weird feeling, too, going out with a clean slate and us starting a new era of Yankee baseball.''
 The focus on the Yankees' mystique tends to be baseball-centric, but what gave the old Yankee Stadium its luster were classic championship moments that cut across sports. The old Stadium was a veritable museum of American sports history: 
 Knute Rockne's famous ''Win one for the Gipper'' speech delivered at halftime of Notre Dame's 1928 victory over Army.
 Joe Louis's 1938 victory over Max Schmeling in a heavyweight title bout.
 The Baltimore Colts' sudden-death victory over the Giants in 1958 in the Greatest Game Ever Played.
 The string of World Series appearances through the 1920s, '30s, '40s, '50s, '60s and '70s, then from 1996 to 2003.
 Before Thursday's game, Derek Jeter, asked about the recent losses in Tampa Bay, including a 15-5 pummeling, said that a six-month baseball season was hardly over in April. Indeed, a month from now, the embarrassment in the home opener may well be a footnote. 
 Manager Joe Girardi said that Thursday's game was ''hard to watch,'' but he added that the Yankees' fate and the legacy of the new Stadium wouldn't be decided on the first day.
 True enough, though Thursday's rout, three days after the rout against Tampa Bay, raises questions about how long it will take these Yankees to fill a new stadium with the sort of championship moments that made the old Stadium so special.
 Soon? Longer? Never?
 Before Jeter's first plate appearance Thursday, a bat was placed across home plate. The bat, we were told, was used by Babe Ruth on opening day 1923, for the opening of the old Yankee Stadium. Ruth homered that day and the Yankees swept the opening four-game series against the Red Sox, then cruised to the pennant and the World Series title.
 On Thursday, Jeter flied out and the Yankees were pummeled.
 Asked what he would miss about the old Stadium, Jeter said, ''You're going to miss everything about it.''
 On its own merits, the new Stadium is a gem. Every effort was made to duplicate and, in many instances extend, the charm of the old Stadium. The signature frieze at the top of the stadium bowl is back, the manually operated auxiliary scoreboard is replicated, and a gap between the bleachers and right field allows us to get a peek at the No. 4 elevated train. 
 But some crucial things did not make the trip across the street -- and they never will.
 Mystiques are created by championships and championship moments: title fights, football classics and World Series victories. The old mystique is gone. You can argue that the mystique began to fade seasons ago.
 What will that legacy be? Who will be the first group to win a championship in the new Yankee Stadium? 
 How the Yankees transfer that mystique from the old building, now gray and dark and awaiting its demise, to the new is Girardi's challenge. 
 The questions may not be answered for years. 
 The architects and the Yankee organization did a great job of moving as much memory as they could into the new Stadium.
 Sadly for these Yankees, some spirits just don't travel that well.

HEADLINE: A Retreat for Roosevelt and More Recent Arrivals

BYLINE: By JOE SAMUEL STARNES

 BODY:
HE came for the water but fell in love with the land. Franklin Delano Roosevelt first traveled to the piney woods of western Georgia in 1924, seeking to treat his polio with the curative powers of the mineral-rich springs at the Meriwether Inn at Warm Springs. 
 Two years later, Roosevelt bought the hotel and 1,200 acres and converted it into a polio treatment center. In 1932, running for president in the depths of the Great Depression, he built a refuge a mile away that would become known as the Little White House. He died there on April 12, 1945, during his fourth term, on what one report called a pleasant spring day. 
 The rural and relaxing pace that attracted Roosevelt has also drawn vacation-home owners and retirees -- and even with the nation in the sharpest economic decline since the 1930s, the area is poised for more growth. 
 F. D. Roosevelt State Park, the largest in Georgia, now stretches more than 9,000 acres from Warm Springs west to Pine Mountain, home to Callaway Gardens, a 13,000-acre resort with gardens, golf and other activities, and planned communities aimed primarily at second-home buyers. The terrain in this part of the Piedmont is far from flat, with Pine Mountain rising 1,395 feet above sea level, overlooking the village of Pine Mountain Valley to the south and edging the town of Pine Mountain to the west. 
 Home choices include cabins on the mountain, houses with large tracts of land in the valley, and new communities inside the heavily wooded Callaway Gardens, lush this month with blooming azaleas and dogwoods. 
 ''We love to see the azaleas,'' said Bob Bonner, a semiretired landscape architect from Ypsilanti, Mich., who with his wife, Nancy, bought a newly built vacation home here in 2004. ''It's a season you can't duplicate anywhere.'' 
 The Bonners paid $350,000 for their two-bedroom house with a screened back porch and a two-car garage in the Longleaf development in Callaway Gardens. 
 Their home was built to be environmentally sensitive, including landscaping with a mat of pine needles, which don't use the water and fertilization that grass needs. ''With the pine straw, there's no turf to manage,'' Mr. Bonner said. ''It makes it very nice for a part-time resident.''
 Roosevelt was not only one of the first part-time residents of the area, but he was also behind one of its earliest developments -- the Pine Mountain Valley Resettlement Project, a New Deal program begun in 1934 that built 210 homes for unemployed workers in the valley as well as a diversified farming operation that provided jobs for them. 
 David and Katherine Johnson, who retired to Pine Mountain Valley eight years ago from nearby Columbus, Ga., see themselves as part of a second wave of settlement. In 1989, they bought 17 rural, hilly acres with a creek for $1,100 an acre, and over the years expanded their property to 33 acres.
 In 2001 they finished a replica of an 1840s farmhouse at a cost of about $185,000 and moved there permanently. 
 Mr. Johnson, a poet and former professor of English at Columbus State University, is producing a video about the resettlement project. He says he has found much in common with the current recession and the Great Depression. ''There is a feeling of deja vu doing the research,'' he said. 
 The Scene
 Pine Mountain town, known until 1958 as Chipley, has a population of 1,263 according to 2007 census estimates and lies along an abandoned rail line that runs from Columbus to Atlanta that is being turned into a bicycle trail. 
 A downtown plaza is similar to those of many small Southern towns, but the influx of tourists and vacation-home owners supports some urbane spots. The Rose Cottage tea room at 111 East Broad Street has dark hardwood floors and solid wood furniture and is known for tasty muffins, desserts and a broad selection of tea. Around the corner at 149 North Main Street is Sweet Home Antiques, one of about a dozen antiques shops and arts and crafts stores in the town center.
 Most outdoor activities revolve around the verdant grounds of Callaway Gardens, founded in 1952 by Virginia and Cason Callaway, and now owned and operated as part of the nonprofit Ida Cason Callaway Foundation. 
 Inside Callaway Gardens, there are 13 lakes, a wide beach, two golf courses, a tennis center, a spa, 10 miles of bike paths and 7.3 miles of walking paths. The resort also has 11 dining spots, with the Friday night seafood buffet ($24.95, $12.50 children 6 to 12) in the Plant Room restaurant a favorite of many.
 Most second home owners here are from Georgia, Florida and Alabama, although some come from the Midwest and the Northeast. 
 Howard and Mary Busbee of Richmond, Va., discovered Pine Mountain in the '70s when they lived in Atlanta and Ms. Busbee clipped a newspaper coupon for a discount on a weekend getaway at Callaway Gardens. They returned often and soon bought a cottage. In 1984 they sold the cottage and upgraded to a three-bedroom villa for $215,000 that they still own and often rent out. 
 When Callaway Gardens began developing new homes, the Busbees paid $375,000 in 2004 for a two-bedroom home with a large loft on a wooded half acre. They visit regularly, often with some or all of their children and nine grandchildren, spending their time bicycling, golfing, shopping, visiting Warm Springs and enjoying meals together. ''We came for a weekend and have stayed for generations,'' said Mr. Busbee, a retired accountant who is a visiting professor at the College of William & Mary in Virginia. 
 Not all second homes here are in Callaway Gardens. In 2007 David and Debra King bought three acres and a 2,200-square-foot, 30-year-old ranch home for $253,000 less than half a mile from the Callaway Gardens entrance on Route 18. They invested about $45,000 and much of their own labor into renovating what will be their retirement home. The yard includes a swimming pool and a dozen blueberry bushes. 
 Pros
 Atlanta is slightly more than an hour's drive away, and Birmingham is about two hours' drive. The terrain is unexpectedly steep and hilly for being so far south. Callaway Gardens and the Roosevelt historic sites can occupy visitors for days.
 Cons
 The only grocery store in Pine Mountain is a smallish IGA that is closed on Sundays.
 The Real Estate Market
 Sales have slowed said Dickie Fogal, owner of Pineland Properties in Pine Mountain. 
 In 2007, there were 397 homes in Pine Mountain and surrounding Harris County sold for an average price of $255,524, local multiple listing statistics that Mr. Fogal provided show. That dropped to 281 sales in 2008 at an average of $250,669, and through March 18 of this year, 30 homes had sold at an average of $231,578. Mr. Fogal, however, is optimistic about the area, particularly because of Callaway Gardens' long-term growth plans. ''This is really a place that is setting itself up to be discovered by a lot of people,'' he said.
 Callaway Gardens agents said they had seen a drop in sales but had experienced a recent uptick, selling four homesites during the last 30 days and scheduling two more closings. 
 Plans for construction in Callaway Gardens accommodate up to 1,400 new homes, but thus far only 131 have been built or are under construction, with all but eight in the six-year-old Longleaf community, where prices begin at $360,000. Three developments broke ground in the fall and a fourth is expected to be announced this spring. There are 212 older cottages and villas in Callaway Gardens, most built in the 1980s. Prices start in the $190,000s for the oldest of the two-bedroom cottages.
 Outside Callaway Gardens, homes can be significantly cheaper, and larger tracts are available. At the highest elevation of Pine Mountain, the Mountain Top Inn and Resort has 30 modern log cabin vacation homes and room for 100 more on privately owned land surrounded by the Roosevelt State Park. An acre lot runs from $28,000 to $35,000, and building a new cabin costs about $175,000. 
 What was a favorite spot of Roosevelt's is only about two miles away from the log-cabin community. He last visited Dowdell's Knob, a scenic overlook where he often picnicked, two days before he died. In 2007 the state dedicated at the site a bronze statue of Roosevelt sitting on his removable car seat, wearing leg braces for polio, gazing at the wide, green valley.

HEADLINE: Gannett's Quarterly Earnings Fall 60%

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Gannett Company, the largest newspaper publisher in the nation, reported a 60 percent decline in first-quarter profit Thursday and said its advertising revenue was continuing to fall. 
 Gannett, which publishes USA Today and dozens of other daily newspapers, earned $77.4 million, or 34 cents a share, in the first three months of the year. In the same quarter in 2008, Gannett earned $192 million, or 84 cents a share. 
 Revenue fell 18 percent, to $1.38 billion from $1.68 billion.
 Adjusting for one-time losses and gains, earnings came to 25 cents a share, 1 cent better than the 24 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Sales fell short of the $1.44 billion analysts had forecast 
 Stock in Gannett, which is based in McLean, Va., rose 11 cents, to $3.60 a share.
 Ad revenue is falling throughout the industry. Big advertisers facing financial crises -- especially in real estate, retail and automobiles -- have pulled back, and the Internet has increased competition for many ads, especially classifieds.
 Ad sales in the company's publishing unit, which includes newspapers, fell 34 percent to $723 million. That was the ninth consecutive quarter of ad declines for the unit and the sharpest fall in the last two years.
 At USA Today, the country's highest-circulation daily newspaper, ad revenue shrank by 33.5 percent. USA Today's total number of paid ad pages in the quarter fell to 527, from 826 a year ago.
 Gannett said it had offset some of the revenue declines by cutting costs. Operating expenses in its publishing segment slid 21 percent to about $955 million.
 Interest payments on debt cost the company $48.9 million during the quarter, up slightly from $48.5 million in the same period of 2008.

HEADLINE: Hundreds Protest Cuts In Water In California

BYLINE: By MALIA WOLLAN

DATELINE: FIREBAUGH, Calif. 

 BODY:
Hundreds of farmers, farm workers and local elected officials walked along dusty roads in the Central Valley on Thursday, part of a four-day march to protest federal cutbacks in water supplies. 
 ''No Water, No Jobs, No Food,'' read one sign held above the crowd, expressing the frustration of many in a region battered by a three-year drought, the national recession and surging unemployment.
 ''This is ground zero,'' said Mario Santoyo, an adviser to the California Latino Water Coalition, which organized the 30-mile hike. ''There's a human tragedy going on here, and we need water.'' 
 The march, the largest of several held this year, will end Friday at the San Luis Reservoir, one of many in the area that are well below normal levels. 
 With below-normal precipitation, many in the Central Valley have let their fields go fallow this spring. In March, the state projected that because of the drought as many as 23,700 full-time workers would go without jobs, and farmers would lose up to $477 million in revenue. 
 The marchers started their trek on Tuesday in the hard-hit town of Mendota, which has an unemployment rate of 40 percent.
 Organizers are calling for a new canal that would divert water from the Sacramento River to Central Valley farms as well as a relaxation of the environmental protections given to threatened species like the delta smelt, a pinky-sized fish native to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, a critical aquatic byway for water from the wetter north part of the state. 
 Court rulings have limited pumping from the delta, while the drought has eliminated all federal water allocations to farms south of the delta for this growing season.
 Still, some labor organizers and advocates for rural areas contend that the marchers' goals reflect only the desires of agribusiness and not the real needs of farm workers. 
 Many of the protesters were paid by their employers to march in lieu of harvesting crops. 
 ''In reality, this is not a farm worker march,'' said Arturo Rodriguez, president of the United Farm Workers of America, the 27,000-member union founded by Cesar Chavez, which did not participate in the march. ''This is a farmer march orchestrated and financed by growers.'' 
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who is expected to address the crowd Friday, said in a statement on Thursday, ''This march is about so much more than politics and water policy. It's about our jobs, our schools, our families, our environment.'' 
 Patricia Lopez, a 38-year-old farm hand, carried a sign made by her 7-year-old son with a smiley face under the word ''water'' and a sad face under ''no water.''
 ''My legs are tired,'' Ms. Lopez said. ''But this is my job, and more water will make more work.''

HEADLINE: Heavy Debt Bankrupts Mall Owner

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED and TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Fifty-five years ago, Martin and Matthew Bucksbaum built one of the nation's first shopping centers, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Soon they built another, and another, and another -- transforming their family company, now known as General Growth Properties, into a colossus of the American mall. 
 But early Thursday morning, after months of increasingly dire warnings, this giant on the retail landscape toppled. General Growth, whose malls include Ala Moana Center in Honolulu, Water Tower Place in Chicago and the Westlake Center in Seattle, filed for bankruptcy. 
 It was the biggest commercial real estate collapse in American history, and, analysts said, a harbinger of the troubles to come in that market as the recession drags on. 
 While General Growth's bankruptcy was widely expected within the industry, it underscored what many see as a looming crisis in commercial real estate. This market is weakening, as the housing market did before it, leaving real estate companies straining to pay their debts. 
 General Growth, which operates 200 malls in 44 states, is unlikely to face liquidation, and its malls will continue to operate. 
 But scores of other real estate operators are struggling to keep up with their debts as well. Their travails are a big worry for the banking industry, which, despite tentative signs of stabilizing, remains weakened. 
 General Growth was unusually dependent on mortgage financing. In all, its debts total $27 billion. 
 But analysts estimate that the commercial real estate industry has about $264 billion in debt scheduled to mature this year, and $273 billion in 2010. General Growth said it could not persuade investors who own more than $2.25 billion of its bonds to waive payments due this year.
 ''The credit market effectively ended in October for companies like ours,'' Thomas H. Nolan Jr., General Growth's president and chief operating officer, said in an interview on Thursday.
 General Growth was unable to cope with debts piled on over the years as it grew from its humble origins into the nation's second-largest mall operator, behind the Simon Property Group. 
 To finance its conquests -- culminating in its acquisition in 2004 of the Rouse Company for $12.6 billion -- General Growth relied on short-term mortgages, which imposed no caps on a company's total debt. Cheap at the time, that financing eventually became a millstone, growing increasingly difficult to refinance as the credit markets tightened and retail property values plummeted.
 General Growth had sought for months to obtain waivers from its bondholders, as they grew impatient as debt maturities mounted. An effort by the company last month to win a forbearance on bond payments for the rest of the year failed to garner enough support, and bondholders began agitating for repayment. (Citigroup announced last month that it had foreclosed on the Oakwood Shopping Center in New Orleans.)
 Confronted with what promises to be an extraordinarily complex bankruptcy case, restive bondholders and uncertainty over the future of the commercial real estate market, General Growth's board voted to file for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday.
 Mr. Nolan said that the company is hoping to exit bankruptcy in about a year. During that time, he said, General Growth will look to extend the maturities of its mortgages and reduce its debt. It may do so by bringing in new capital or converting some of its debt into equity. 
 A less palatable option is selling some of the company's properties, he said. But General Growth has already tried that approach with little success, as the dismal credit markets restrict what potential buyers can borrow to finance their purchases. Several of General Growth's malls are also underwater, with their debt now greater than their equity.
 The company has already secured support from one of its biggest stakeholders, the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management. Pershing Square, led by William A. Ackman, has agreed to provide General Growth with a $375 million debtor-in-possession loan, and Mr. Ackman could gain a board seat as well.
 Analysts said that General Growth was a rarity among real estate investment trusts in its capital structure problems. The bankruptcy is likely to have a major impact on mall values. No major mall transactions have occurred in more than a year, making it impossible to estimate how much value they have lost. But the sale of the General Growth assets will provide a benchmark, said Keven S. Lindemann, director of real estate for SNL Financial, a research company in Charlottesville, Va.
 While malls across America have been battered by the recession, hurting as scores of retailers have closed, analysts and company executives say that General Growth's properties have held up well. 
 Still, real estate owners in general and mall owners in particular will continue to face increased pressure as they reluctantly lower rents to keep prized tenants from leaving -- a possibility that has made lenders wary of committing money to these companies.
 ''There was a bubble in prices,'' said Mike Kirby, a principal of Green Street Advisors, a company in Newport Beach, Calif., that specializes in real estate investment trusts. ''The bubble has popped. The problem is that companies financed themselves as if the bubble was going to last forever.''
 The company's collapse is almost certain to dwarf any future real estate bankruptcies, analysts said. ''This will be the Olympia and York of this cycle,'' Mr. Kirby said, referring to the 1992 real estate debacle that became a symbol of the last crisis.
 General Growth's malls will continue to operate normally. But the collapse of the company has already taken its toll on the Bucksbaum family, whose 25 percent stake has been virtually wiped out over the last year. John Bucksbaum, the son of a co-founder, Matthew, was replaced as chief executive last fall, though he remains chairman. Bernard Freibaum, General Growth's then-chief financial officer and the architect of the risky mortgage financing strategy, was dismissed last fall as well.

HEADLINE: There's a Silver Lining In Costa Rica's Gold Coast

BYLINE: By PERRY GARFINKEL

 BODY:
AT the heart of the real estate wave in Guanacaste province in Costa Rica in 2006, some 20 residential projects had either broken ground, been announced or been approved. About 350,000 visitors landed that year at the regional airport in Liberia, quadrupling the figure from 2003, its first year of international flights.
 In 2006, $131.4 million was spent on personal property sales in Guanacaste, according to the Central Bank of Costa Rica, and Alexander Porras, an economist for the bank, estimated that most of that was in second homes. 
 But now the tide has turned. A number of highly publicized residential developments aimed at second-home owners and anchored by brand-name hotels and golf courses have been delayed on Guanacaste's so-called Gold Coast, a 60-mile stretch on the Pacific Ocean from the Papagayo Peninsula in the north to Tamarindo in the south. 
 Vacation-home sales have been reduced to a ripple. Individuals who built or bought with an eye toward selling have lowered or postponed their quick-flip expectations, trying instead to earn money by renting out their properties in a region that remains a popular tourist destination. 
 These days, there are still visitors who come to Costa Rica on real estate buying sprees, but they will see less than was projected three years ago. 
 That's not all bad news. For the serious or even the spontaneous buyer ''this means deals can be had in some niche price ranges,'' said Christopher Howard, an American author in Costa Rica who has written a book on the topic that will be self-published in July. 
 The best deals are in the $300,000-and-under market, ''but properties at the high end haven't been hit too badly,'' Mr. Howard said. ''In a way, this turn-down benefits the Guanacaste market. Things were developing too fast; prices were getting too high.'' 
 The best-known Guanacaste project to be delayed is Cacique, a venture backed by Stephen M. Case, co-founder and former chairman of AOL. He announced plans in August 2007 for an $800 million development that included two luxury hotels, an array of high-end homesites and 300 private residential units on 650 acres. A year later Mr. Case halted development. Jorge Cornick, corporate relations officer for Cacique, said it would be delayed until the economic outlook improved. 
 Not far from Cacique, in Panama Beach, work had begun on La Punta Papagayo, a projected $300 million development, but it's now been put off, too, said the Minneapolis-based developer, Blaine Kirchert. The Costa Blanca Hotel, which was on the property when he bought it, is open, but no progress has been made on another hotel, the 150-room Viceroy, nor on the planned 86 condos and 34 estate lots.
 Ground was broken in January 2008 in Brazilito for the Azulera Resort Village, a 557-acre community with a $300 million Hyatt Regency and 1,000 condominiums, town houses and single-family houses. Then construction stopped last fall. Anil Kothari, chief executive of the New Jersey-based Global Financial Group, the developer, said that work would resume in June, with completion in two years.
 Despite the slowdown, opportunities have risen. A small number of individual homeowners are finding a market among vacationers seduced by the enduring appeal of the country, where annual municipal property taxes are 0.25 percent of the construction value of the home, where no rain falls from December to May, where 25 percent of the country's rich biodiversity is protected parkland and where a stable democracy has existed since 1899.
 In February, Louise Chandler and Ken David, a couple in their early 50s from near Butte, Mont., walked into the Tamarindo Beach office of Bella Collina Realty and walked out with a ''fire sale'' deal: on April 1 they closed on a two-bedroom 1,100-square-foot town house. It was originally priced at $142,000; they paid $99,000. Lock Cooper, the sales director at Bella Collina, said the owners had sold because they wanted to trade up to a larger unit closer to the beach.
 The new owners say they plan to spend two to three months a year there and rent it out the rest of the time. ''It was purely an impulse buy. We were on vacation, fell in love with the country and didn't want to leave,'' Ms. Chandler said. ''We just happened to pop into this agency. It was an unheard of deal -- plus a pool and gated security.'' 
 Chris Simmons, an owner of ReMax Ocean Surf Realty in Tamarindo, said there were a few individual owners in every property he currently represents who were willing to shave 20 to 30 percent off listing prices. Developers are also posting special deals, he said, including at Crystal Sands in Langosta Beach, south of Tamarindo. Five beachfront condos there, originally priced from $800,000 to $2.3 million, are being offered at 20 percent discounts.
 But because ''there are virtually no new projects breaking ground now,'' Mr. Simmons said, ''I'm going to swim against the tide of conventional wisdom here and predict that the real problem we'll face is next year when we'll have no inventory to sell.''
 For now, though, homes remain available at the three major developments on the Gold Coast. They are Peninsula Papagayo in the northern region (a 30-minute drive from Liberia), a 2,300-acre luxury development anchored by a Four Seasons Hotel with its own collection of homes and lots for sale, the destination club Exclusive Resorts and a 180-slip marina that opened in December; Reserva Conchal in the middle (near Conchal and Flamingo Beaches), a 2,200-acre development with homes, lots and condos, with a Paradisus Playa Hotel; and Hacienda Pinilla (just south of Tamarindo Beach), a 4,500-acre project, with a JW Marriott resort that opened in early February.
 Sales representatives from all three reported that since last September most of the signed contracts had been for condos, while lots and villas had moved very slowly.
 Those who buy lots in such gated developments and have their houses built ''definitely minimize their risk compared to starting from scratch on their own in this country,'' said Bryant Martin, 49, of Denver, who is Hacienda Pinilla's largest individual property owner. Along with buying a 12-room bed-and-breakfast on the grounds and turning it into a family vacation home, he also bought 13 beachfront acres (24 lots) to develop as La Dulce Vida. On another lot, he built a 4,000-square-foot four-bedroom house, which he put on the market on March 1 for $1.5 million and rents out for $7,500 a month.
 ''These development owners spend many millions on infrastructure -- water, roads, electricity, permits -- which in a third-world country like this can be a time- and money-consuming process,'' said Mr. Martin, who owns a company that sells high-end bathroom fixtures, windows and doors and has built homes in Colorado, Arizona and Mexico. 
 The Gaunacaste real estate ebb may turn out to be an inadvertent saving grace for a country known for its ecological treasures.
 Jim Preskitt underscored that idea, pointing to a hillside across Culebra Bay from the executive offices of Peninsula Papagayo, where he is senior vice president. The forested hill dropped into the white-sand beaches of villages named Panama, Hermosa and Coco.
 ''That hill would have been dotted with a Rosewood, a Miraval and a One & Only hotel. But all those projects are stalled,'' he said. ''Though we welcome the competition and the regional buzz, this slowdown may be nature's way of saying, 'Protect what you have.' ''
 Michael McNulty and his wife, Denise, were vacationing at the Four Seasons when they saw real estate opportunities in the development. He and his friend and business partner, Frank Rizzo III, bought four Papagayo lots in that frenzy three years ago and have since built two homes. Mr. McNulty said he hoped delayed development protected not only the environment but also their investment, which he calculated at about $9 million.
 ''When we saw the economy sliding, we worried about our long-term investment, but now we find ourselves in an enviable position as pioneers here,'' said Mr. McNulty, 47, of Philadelphia, a founder of the early Internet business-to-business portal VerticalNet.com. The McNulty-Rizzo houses are the first of six built so far at Peninsula Papagayo and the only two currently available for rent. When not vacationing with family and friends, Mr. McNulty and Mr. Rizzo market the houses as vacation rentals at $2,200 to $4,500 a day, depending on the season.
 Meanwhile, Mr. McNulty still harbors fantasies of flipping the properties.
 ''Some day,'' he said, ''a wealthy yachtsman from Dubai will pull in to the new marina, look up, see our house and say, 'We need a place to sleep tonight. Let's buy that one.' ''

DATELINE: FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. 

 BODY:
Rick Williamson, a Chicago banker turned junk-loan buyer, knew the name-calling would start again when he moved to foreclose on the Fayetteville Athletic Club, a sprawling, family-run gym and spa complex in this corner of northwest Arkansas. 
 ''Vulture, bottom feeder,'' Mr. Williamson said, recalling insults thrown his way during his years hunting for bargains in distressed real estate.
 And just as he predicted, the insults are flying. 
 ''Trash-eating rat,'' is how Robert Shoulders, the club's owner for the last 13 years, described Mr. Williamson. ''What he does is reprehensible. I am not sure how he can sleep at night.'' 
 Mr. Williamson sees it differently. And the government agrees. 
 As he points out, it isn't his fault that Mr. Shoulders overextended himself by borrowing $10 million to add the spa, a preschool, tennis courts and other amenities to his once-modest health club. And by moving aggressively to collect on loans like these, Mr. Williamson says, he is playing a crucial role in helping clean up the bad debts that are clogging the economy.
 ''If you want to fix what is ailing this country, you need to destroy the worthless debt out there,'' he said, adding with characteristic candor, ''You have to shut down the zombies, liquidate their assets.''
 Clashes like this are increasingly taking place across the country, as banks struggle through their worst crisis in a generation. And Mr. Williamson is part of a niche industry that buys at bargain-basement prices the hard-to-collect commercial loans that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation auctions off after it seizes a failed bank. They take on the most troubled assets, the ones others aren't willing to touch, in exchange for potentially lucrative returns.
 Nationwide, the F.D.I.C. has seized 58 banks over the last 15 months and through loan auctions has sold about $2.2 billion worth of loans. The $1.2 billion generated for the government has gone into the fund to insure deposits at other banks.
 Many of the auctioned loans are considered ''performing,'' meaning the borrowers are current on their payments. But a portion of them are delinquent, like the one held by Mr. Shoulders and his wife, who stopped making payments after their local bank, ANB Financial of Bentonville, Ark., failed last year.
 Loath to throw homeowners out on the street, the F.D.I.C. has made it a national policy to try to avoid foreclosures on the single-family mortgages it inherits from failed banks, even if payments are past due. But there are no such rules to protect struggling small businesses, whose loans are more typically sold at the F.D.I.C. auctions.
 The borrowers, like the Shoulderses, suddenly find themselves dealing with aggressive out-of-state loan consolidators, rather than local banks with long-standing community ties. And the consolidators' primary objective often is to immediately collect on the debt, or seize the collateral.
 The single biggest buyer at these auctions has been Andrew Beal, a banking billionaire from Texas who made his fortune buying distressed debt during the savings and loan crisis. 
 By the end of February, Mr. Beal had paid more than $200 million to buy $438 million worth of loans, according to agency records. Some of the loans came from the failed Arkansas bank. 
 Mr. Beal is hardly averse to risk. He is famous for trying (and failing) to build his own space satellite launch company, and for luring some of the world's best poker players to a series of games, with him as a participant, and betting pots worth $2 million. Mr. Beal, in a telephone interview, said he went to great lengths not to push people out of their businesses, but at times he had no choice.
 ''Borrowers force us into litigation,'' he said. ''They don't want to perform on their loan, they won't talk to our workout people. What are we supposed to do, send them a vase of roses?'' 
 Another buyer here, Daniel C. Cadle of Newton Falls, Ohio, has drawn some of the loudest protests over the years for hardball collection practices. 
 In 2007, Massachusetts authorities, in denying him a license to operate in the state, accused Mr. Cadle of not having ''the character, reputation, integrity and general fitness to engage in the business of a debt collector in an honest, fair and sound manner.'' In one instance they cited, a representative of Mr. Cadle's firm told a debtor that he had photographs of the man outside his house, knew his wife's name and had information on his bank account.
 For nearly a decade, Mr. Cadle faced the threat of arrest by authorities in Texas as the result of a lengthy debt collection dispute in which a county court concluded that Mr. Cadle had tried to financially ruin a debtor and used a pattern of abusive lawsuits. 
 Mr. Cadle says his run-ins with the law are a consequence of his willingness to demand repayment from some powerful people. And he makes no apologies for working hard to collect from debtors.
 ''We are heartless because people refuse to pay us even payments they can afford?'' he said. ''You aren't taking advantage of anyone if you are simply asking them to pay what they owe you.''
 Some of the debts are so hard to collect that the F.D.I.C. lets these loans go for a song. LeMire Schmeglar, a mortgage broker in Chicago, bought 191 delinquent loans with a book value of $6 million. He paid just over $15,000.
 F.D.I.C. officials, in a written statement to The New York Times, said the agency had tried to balance its mandate to recoup as much as possible through the sale of loans it acquired while still protecting the interests of borrowers. 
 ''We are statutorily required to sell assets in a way that will get as much money back for the uninsured depositors and other creditors, including our insurance fund,'' Andrew Gray, an F.D.I.C. spokesman, said in the statement. ''By focusing on a small percentage of particularly distressed assets, the view becomes distorted.'' Mr. Gray added that the agency was creating a new unit to field any complaints from customers who had loans at failed banks.
 There is a fair amount of mystery about the F.D.I.C.'s auction process. Bidding is not open to the public. And the list of winners is next to impossible to decipher. It is filled with enigmatic names like ''Brown Bark III'' and ''Oceanside, CA 92054,'' entities that have no Web sites or telephone listings.
 Matthew Anderson, a partner at Foresight Analytics, a California firm that has studied the F.D.I.C. sales, said the buyers of these loans typically hoped to earn a profit of 25 to 35 percent a year -- a high rate of return, but achievable only by buying loans with big risks. The forceful collection efforts are spreading nationally as bank failures increase. A search of court records shows cases filed by buyers of F.D.I.C. business loans in states like Florida, Arizona and Michigan.
 In Arizona, Michael W. Bauer, 53, an electrician and owner of a vending machine business, said that after 15 years in business, and never once defaulting on a loan, he might have to file for bankruptcy because an entity called SMS Financial XVII, which bought his loans from the F.D.I.C. after the failure of First National Bank of Nevada, had filed a foreclosure lawsuit against him.
 ''I owe the money. I know that, and I am prepared to repay my loan over time,'' he said. ''But to be strong-armed like this, at the moment when you are the most vulnerable, it just does not seem right.''
 Northwest Arkansas, home to Wal-Mart and the poultry giant Tyson Foods, is hardly the epicenter of the banking crisis. But because ANB Financial was one of the first reasonably large banks to go bust, just as the wave of mortgage defaults was getting under way, the distressed loan drama is playing out here with particular intensity.
 Even before the F.D.I.C.- sponsored auctions took place last fall, some of the agency's Arkansas staff tried to warn small-business owners in the Fayetteville area to try to quickly clear up any past-due debts or be prepared to face the consequences, according to company owners and a former agency contractor.
 ''They said it out loud and quite clearly,'' said Marsha G. Dunbar, who worked as a contractor for the F.D.I.C. after it took over ANB, where she once was a loan officer. ''Settle up these debts now, or it is not going to be pleasant,'' Ms. Dunbar said, paraphrasing the warnings.
 Mr. Shoulders and his wife, Katherine, who bought the Fayetteville Athletic Club 13 years ago, heard these same warnings. They offered to pay $6 million immediately, and an additional $1 million upon the future sale of the gym, if the agency would agree to forgive their $10 million in debt.
 F.D.I.C. officials, seeking to maximize their return for the insurance fund, said they proposed to reduce the loans' interest rates instead, an offer Mr. Shoulders disputes was ever made. So the loans were bundled with others and auctioned off in late October. 
 That was where Mr. Williamson came in. 
 More than a year ago, at the first signs of recession, Mr. Williamson, a one-time Illinois soybean farmer who became a banker in the 1980s, quit his corporate bank job to form his own business specializing in buying up distressed debt. 
 Like many in this business, Mr. Williamson, 57, is not shy about confrontation. He is openly disdainful of what he calls ''the nanny state,'' referring to a federal government that he says too often tries to protect delinquent borrowers. 
 He bought the Shoulderses' loans for 34 cents on the dollar, an outcome that left the gym owners furious, because the auction produced a price that was far lower than they had offered to pay the F.D.I.C. From the start, relations between the two sides were tense.
 ''These guys put a gun to our head and said 100 percent is due in 10 days,'' said Mr. Shoulders, 54, a tall, wiry man who uses a giant green exercise ball as his desk chair and wears a big name tag on his gym fleece that simply says ''Bob.''
 Within a matter of weeks, a foreclosure lawsuit was filed, as the Shoulderses, citing credit markets that had grown even tighter, said they could raise only $5 million to repay their loans. After evaluating how much the collateral -- the lavish club -- was worth, Mr. Williamson rejected the offer. The lawsuit is pending in the local court system.
 Business is still brisk at the Fayetteville Athletic Club. Its workout rooms are filled with local doctors, lawyers, Wal-Mart executives, even the local tax assessor. But the Shoulderses, who are prominent figures in the community here, soon may no longer own the club.
 ''Were we overextended? Yeah, I will not deny it,'' Mr. Shoulders said, as he walked through the gym, greeting members by name. ''But we have put our heart and soul, and every penny we have earned, into building this place. It is criminal the way we have been treated.''
 As Mr. Williamson sees it, a debt is a debt.
 ''When I grew up, people paid for their mistakes,'' he said.

The biggest discounts are on so-called nonperforming loans where borrowers have fallen behind on payments. This market attracts companies that include debt collectors accustomed to high risks and high profits.(Sources: F.D.I.C.

HEADLINE: Glaxo and Pfizer Join Forces to Develop and Market H.I.V. Drugs

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
Hoping to challenge Gilead Sciences, the leader in H.I.V. drugs, the pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer said Thursday that they would form a specialty company to research, develop and market treatments for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. 
 By combining products from both companies, the new entity would have 11 H.I.V. drugs, representing a 19 percent share of the market, and six other drugs in various stages of development. 
 ''It absolutely restates GSK's commitment to be a leader in this field,'' Andrew Witty, the chief executive of Glaxo said Thursday in a conference call with journalists.
 Mr. Witty described the joint venture as having ''the focus of a specialist company with the support of two big parents.''
 Drug makers have often combined forces to develop and market single drugs. Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis, for example, are partners in the anticlotting drug Plavix.
 But the decision by Pfizer and Glaxo to form a joint venture focused on an entire drug category represents a new model of industry collaboration. 
 ''It does stand as a first,'' said Kevin Scotcher, an analyst with Liberum Capital, an investment bank based in London and New York. H.I.V. drugs are a lucrative market, with global sales last year of about $12.3 billion -- $7.2 billion of it in the United States, according to IMS Health, a market research firm.
 Glaxo will initially have an 85 percent equity interest in the joint venture. The combined entity, which will not have a name until the expected closure of the deal in the last quarter of this year, could save about $90 million annually by merging sales and management infrastructure, the companies said. Glaxo has been struggling to maintain its share of the H.I.V. market in the face of looming patent expirations on several of its drugs and rising competition. 
 H.I.V. is typically treated with a cocktail of medications -- including one kind of drug to stop the virus from entering cells and other kinds of drugs to inhibit it from replicating. Glaxo formerly led the field with Combivir, a pill that combines two H.I.V. drugs and is taken twice a day.
 But three years ago, Gilead introduced a pill that combines three drugs and can be taken once a day. The pill, called Atripla, combines two Gilead drugs with one from Bristol-Myers Squibb.
 Last year, Gilead's H.I.V. franchise had sales of about $4.3 billion.
 And there are newer competitors. Isentress, a novel H.I.V. drug introduced by Merck in late 2007, had worldwide sales last year of $361 million. 
 Glaxo's H.I.V. franchise has had effectively flat sales for the last three years of about $2.2 billion annually, according to a note to investors from Alexandra Hauber, a JPMorgan analyst.
 Glaxo ''had their lunch stolen by Gilead because they lost focus on the H.I.V. business,'' said Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink Swann.
 Pfizer, which is trying to complete its more than $62 billion acquisition of Wyeth, has not been an H.I.V. powerhouse. For its minority stake in the Glaxo partnership, it stands to gain access to Glaxo's established marketing presence and distribution channels in the H.I.V. field. 
 Glaxo's portfolio would gain longevity with Selzentry, a new H.I.V. drug from Pfizer that does not face patent expiry in the United States until 2021, as well as several drugs Pfizer has under development. The joint venture could also develop new combinations of the companies' existing drugs, Mr. Fernandez said.
 Shares of Pfizer rose 4 cents, to $13.90 on Thursday. Shares of Glaxo fell a penny, to $30.82. Shares of Gilead rose 31 cents, to $44.85.

HEADLINE: It Depends on Your View: Tickets From $5 to $2,625

BYLINE: By JOSHUA ROBINSON. 
Richard Sandomir contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Yankee Stadium's Section 201 may be nearly 500 feet from the front row of Section 20, but in dollar terms, it is much further than that. 
 Section 201 is one of the two blocks of seats that flank the Mohegan Sun Sports Bar in center field, leaving the fans there with a heavily obstructed view of the outfield. For the regular season, the Yankees have priced those tickets at $5.
 Staring back at them are the front rows of Sections 17B to 22, which bends from dugout to dugout behind home plate and includes the 100 most expensive seats in the ballpark. They range in price from $2,500 to $2,625, and the Yankees have had to spend money advertising their availability. 
 At the home opener Thursday afternoon, both sets of tickets were being used. 
 ''Everything is moving very well, including the premiums,'' the Yankees' president Randy Levine said. ''The only effect of the recession is some of the highest-priced seats aren't selling as well.''
 There was no evidence of that during most of the game, with nearly every seat in the row behind home plate occupied. Though Thursday's paid attendance of 48,271 was roughly 4,000 below the stadium's capacity, the Yankees still called it a sellout. They said that sponsors' tickets did not count toward paid attendance and that standing-room tickets were not being sold yet. 
 The bleachers, meanwhile, were packed with fans who had spent anywhere from the change in their wallets to hundreds of dollars for the privilege of being inside the building for its first performance.
 For John Eich, the $5 he shelled out Thursday as part of his partial season-ticket plan in Section 239 -- Section 201's mirror image on the other side of the sports bar -- seemed incidental. He had flown from his home in Orlando, Fla., for the game. Sitting close by, Chris Picone and James McNevin said they both spent less on their tickets than they did on tolls driving to the stadium.
 With a concrete wall turning much of right field into a mystery, Picone and McNevin were far from thrilled with their seats. ''But for that price,'' Picone said, ''it was definitely worth it to be here.''
 They were helped out by three televisions bolted to the wall of the sports bar that showed a live feed of the game, though many fans said a few extra screens would have been appreciated, particularly in the glare of the sun. Still, they could make out enough of Jorge Posada's long drive to know it was a home run once it disappeared from their own view of the game.
 For the fans in the bleachers who did not have ticket plans, the afternoon was more expensive. Earlier this week, tickets for Sections 239 and 201 were selling for over $200 on StubHub, without the sellers' necessarily mentioning that the view was obstructed. Though the Yankees had previously recognized that these seats were not ideal and lowered the price for them, independent marketplaces like StubHub and eBay leave it up to the sellers to disclose whether or not a view is obstructed. 
 That is how a visibly upset Adrian Rea, a Yankee fan from Binghamton, N.Y., wound up spending $1,200 for four tickets in Section 201. Rea had no idea that he would not be able to see right field.
 ''If I'd known, I wouldn't have bought them,'' he said. ''I would have even paid more if I could have had seats that weren't obstructed.''
 Sitting in the row in front of Rea, Scott Placona, 26, jumped in. He had bought his ticket for $250 from a scalper 10 minutes before the game and insisted that it was worth every penny -- just to be able to tell his grandchildren he was at the first regular-season game at the new Yankee Stadium. What did it matter that he couldn't see left field? 
 Many fans in the bleachers took advantage of the terrace above the sports bar. Security guards said fans could mill about there for as long as they liked as long as they stayed clear of the concession lines.
 From there, the seats right behind home plate looked very small. But the $2,620 difference in price remained quite huge.

HEADLINE: From High-Finance Pinnacles to Unemployment Line to Mentors

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
How does it feel to plummet from the peaks of global finance to an unpaid gig at a fledgling company? A few dozen laid-off New Yorkers are about to find out.
 They are the first group of out-of-work professionals to be paired up with small businesses that need help getting started or expanding. The matchmaking experiment, which began this week, was one of the ideas New York City officials hatched as a response to the growing ranks of unemployed professionals in the metropolitan area.
 With investment banks and other financial companies continuing to eliminate jobs at a fast pace, officials of the city's Economic Development Corporation began to fear an exodus of educated, previously well-paid residents. So they contracted with the Levin Insititute of the State University of New York to set up a boot camp in entrepreneurship for about 50 former financiers who were willing to spend 10 weeks sharing their skills with start-up companies and small businesses free of charge. 
 That's right: free, as in unpaid. The development corporation is putting up just $50,000 for what city officials hope will be the first of several sessions of the program, which is known as JumpStart NYC, held at the institute's offices on the Upper East Side.
 On Thursday, after a few days of classes and a few more speeches from officials of the city and the institute, the participants learned which companies they had been assigned to.
 Some of the entrepreneurs were clearly thrilled about the prospect of tapping the brains of people who as recently as last month were earning more than many Americans ever hope to.
 Jonathan D. Harber, chief executive and president of Schoolnet, a company that develops technology for schools, said he was looking for somebody to study whether his company should expand into the community college market. Ideally, he said, the consultant assigned to Schoolnet would determine that the idea was potentially profitable and would stay on to create and run a new unit of the company.
 ''That's the grand-slam home run,'' Mr. Harber said with an anticipatory grin. The participants seemed to be filled with a mix of eagerness and trepidation about signing on with start-ups. Jamaal Glenn, an investment banking analyst at JP Morgan Chase until he lost his job last month, said some of the participating companies were so small that he probably would have to fix his own computer if it broke.
 But, Mr. Glenn, 26, added, ''I think everyone here is open to something drastically different.''
 Accepting the need to consider a career beyond Wall Street is the first step, said Garrick Utley, the institute's president.
 ''It's about networking, but it's really about stepping over that psychological hurdle: 'I'm not going to be a Master of the Universe,' '' Mr. Utley said. ''It's a question of: when do you realize it's changed?''
 Rodneyse Bichotte said she was ready for a career change after three years of working for giant banks. Out of work since early August, she said she was energized by the meetings with the other participants and the hope of returning to a working environment.
 ''This week has really kind of rejuvenated me,'' said Ms. Bichotte, 36. ''It's sad waking up and realizing that the opportunity of getting another job is really slim.'' 
 Ms. Bichotte, who lives in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, said she expected to continue collecting unemployment benefits while consulting with the company with which she was matched. But she added that she hoped that the program would quickly lead to a paying position. Some of the entrepreneurs had specific tasks they wanted the consultants to perform, but David Hung, an executive of Peek, which sells a portable e-mail device, said he thought the program was too good to pass up.
 ''We're just looking for smart people who are willing to learn new things,'' he said. ''Free, talented labor -- how can you say no to that?''

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Unlikely to Shut The South Street Seaport

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The South Street Seaport, the city's 19th-century historic district, will remain open, unaffected by its operator's bankruptcy in a huge commercial real estate collapse, according to city officials and the operator, General Growth Properties.
 Shoppers at General Growth's Staten Island Mall will also be unlikely to notice any difference as a result of General Growth's filing for bankruptcy protection on Thursday. 
 But the company, the country's second-largest mall operator, is struggling under $27 billion in mostly short-term debt and is not rushing forward with its redevelopment plan for the South Street Seaport or with a planned $700 million project in East Harlem.
 ''Our goal is to get through this bankruptcy process and have a really strong enterprise,'' said Adam Metz, the chief executive of General Growth, which is based in Chicago. It hopes to reduce its debt and reorganize, rather than go out of business. ''We think South Street is terrific, but ultimately, it has to make good business sense.''
 The company operates more than 200 malls in 44 states. It has been severely hobbled during the recession by its inability to refinance its debt, much of it accumulated during a buying spree at the height of the market.
 In 2004, the company paid $12.6 billion to acquire the Rouse Company, another mall operator, which owned the South Street Seaport and Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston.
 General Growth has been negotiating with its lenders for months in an attempt to reorganize its debts. But with the credit markets essentially frozen, the company ran out of options.
 It said on Thursday that it had obtained a commitment for $375 million in bankruptcy financing from Pershing Square Capital Management.
 Last year, General Growth unveiled an ambitious plan to redevelop the seaport and its mix of former countinghouses and other 200-year-old commercial buildings that line cobblestone streets south of the Brooklyn Bridge.
 Although the area, which also includes a 1980s-era mall on Pier 17, attracts office workers during lunchtime and tourists in warm weather, South Street has never been a retail powerhouse.
 General Growth's proposal for a 42-story apartment building for the low-rise district , as well as a hotel and a new two-story retail mall on Pier 17, drew criticism from the Landmarks Preservation Commission and the City Planning Department. 
 The company had hoped to revise its plans later this year and formally begin the city's review process.
 ''It has great potential to be something fabulous,'' Mr. Metz said. ''We're trying to figure out what makes most sense and what's the right timing.''
 In December, General Growth put South Street Seaport and two other well-known properties -- Faneuil Hall Marketplace and the Inner Harbor marketplace in Baltimore --up for sale. But with retail sales down sharply, there were no attractive offers.
 Even after the company ran into financial trouble, the city selected a development team led by General Growth in October to build the $700 million East Harlem Media, Entertainment and Cultural Center on 125th Street in Harlem. 
 Seth Pinsky, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said that the company had since taken a less-prominent role in the project. He said that its first phase was centered on housing, although the project's residential developer, Archstone, also has financial problems.
 ''Long-term, there's great opportunity there,'' Mr. Metz said. ''When that happens exactly, I can't tell you.''

HEADLINE: French Strikers Hang On To Threads of a Worldview

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Maia de la Baume contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ECHIROLLES, France 

 BODY:
The workers here at Caterpillar have been on strike for more than a month, and they see themselves in a battle for all the workers of France.
 They have ''boss-napped'' management officials, blocked intercity trains, stopped and interrogated the local police prefect, set up picket lines and organized assemblies to seek more solidarity with workers at other companies whose jobs are also at risk. Asked if France will experience a hot summer of protest, Pierre Piccarreta, a factory representative with the main union here, the General Confederation of Labor, or C.G.T., said, ''It's already a hot spring.''
 A sign on a factory fence reads ''Les Cater en lutte'' -- the Caterpillars at battle -- and many workers spent a rainy Wednesday night on the site in tents, in what has become the most prominent labor conflict in France.
 The workers are fighting for their own jobs, of course, and the jobs of their children here in the Isere region, around Grenoble, where the icy peaks of the Alps rise impassively above the clouds. But in a way these workers are also fighting for a traditional kind of French management-worker relationship that is quickly fraying in this global economic crisis. 
 ''Today, politicians don't put people at the center of life,'' said Michel Palomera, 64, who retired in 2005 after 40 years at Caterpillar but came here out of solidarity with the strikers. ''Today, the only value is money.''
 Even 20 years ago, he said, ''the bosses came from the bottom of the scale, with another attitude, and a good knowledge of the company and its values.'' Today, he said, with globalization and the intensity of the crisis, ''it's all changed.''
 Caterpillar, an American company that makes sophisticated agricultural and construction equipment, reported a profit last year of $3.5 billion. But in January, presuming a continued drop in orders, the company announced immediate cuts of 5,000 jobs worldwide and the gradual elimination of 22,000. 
 Here, where Caterpillar started operations in the early 1960s and now employs about 3,000 people in two plants, the immediate issue has been 733 jobs that management said must go.
 But Mr. Piccarreta, 53, said that in addition to full-time jobs, management wanted to get rid of an additional 300 or so contract workers. 
 ''That means that one-third of the work force may disappear in six months,'' Mr. Piccarreta said. ''We insist that they have the financial capacity to do otherwise.'' He complains that management refuses to sit down with the union and discuss alternatives, including a shared reduction of working hours and a reorganization of what has been a seven-days-a-week workplace.
 While the conflict is about a global company with a distant management, there is affection for Caterpillar and the tenor is not anti-American.
 Last week, management offered to fire only 600 people in return for major changes in working times and a rollback in benefits like the 35-hour week, free transportation and cafeteria privileges. The union refused. ''They want to profit by the global crisis to take back social advantages won at Caterpillar,'' said Jose Munoz, 64, who worked here for 37 years.
 The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who aides said was anxious about a possible season of escalating protests in France, tried to intervene early. He would not let the workers down, he said, and vowed to save the plant.
 But the workers here consider this just another empty Sarkozy promise. Mr. Munoz cited a Sarkozy vow last year to save 575 steelmaking jobs at the Arcelor Mittal foundry at Gandrange -- jobs that have since disappeared.
 Unemployment in France is now about 8.3 percent and is expected to reach nearly 10 percent this year. In this region, unemployment has hit 12 percent.
 The unions, traditionally strong in France, are struggling to find an effective response to the crisis and the threat to jobs. Many analysts say that the power of the unions has long passed its peak and that while they are able to disrupt everyday life -- and let off steam -- through one-day general strikes, they are no longer powerful enough to force substantive changes. 
 Asked if the workers regret holding four of their bosses overnight in their offices, which created a furor, Mr. Piccarreta said: ''We didn't mean to end up there. But it was exasperation, anger, and the bosses were making us go in circles.'' The management representatives either do not show up to meetings or arrive late, he said. ''We weren't able to negotiate.''
 Mr. Munoz said, ''The tradition of social dialogue is disappearing.'' He said he considered it a question of manners and attitude, but also of strategy in a globalized company. ''The bosses here are young,'' he said. ''They don't know how to listen and manage people. They don't have the power to decide.''
 The press office at Caterpillar here said only that the situation was ''sensitive'' and that the company would have no comment.
 Dominique Quercia, 36, has been a welder for 15 years, and has a 9-year-old daughter. ''I'm fighting for the people here, because it makes me heartsick to see people leave the company,'' he said. ''They have kids to feed.'' New jobs are scarce, he said. ''These people,'' he added, ''are going to be in deep trouble,'' despite French social protections.
 Michel Laboisseret, the C.G.T.'s main delegate to both Caterpillar plants, said the hope was that politicians, both national and local, would bring pressure to bear on the company to reopen negotiations in earnest with the unions.
 ''We're realistic,'' Mr. Laboisseret said. ''We know we won't be able to avoid layoffs. The point is to save the maximum number of jobs.''
 Management has agreed to a fund of 50 million euros (about $66 million) to pay and help retrain those laid off. The unions want the number of jobs to be lost reduced to 600, but they also want the same special fund and a promise that Caterpillar will keep the plants open for at least five years.
 Mr. Piccarreta has four children. ''I'm 53 and I still have years to work,'' he said. ''I'm fighting against this economic system that makes men, women and entire families suffer. Everyone realizes this now. This system is starting to explode; it should no longer exist. It makes the entire world suffer, it enriches the rich and impoverishes the poor.''
 Mr. Palomera was more practical. ''We don't want to break this company,'' he said. ''We just want to work.''

HEADLINE: Plan Tries to Lower Malaria Drug Cost

BYLINE: By DONALD G. MCNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
A new campaign to save lives and prevent drug resistance by driving the price of the best malaria medicine down to as little as 20 cents was announced Friday by international health agencies and European governments.
 The subsidy program, unveiled in Norway, will have an initial budget of $225 million and will be run by a new partnership called the Affordable Medicines Facility for Malaria, or AMFm.
Malaria experts hailed the program as one of the most important recent advances in fighting malaria, which kills one million people a year, 90 percent of them children. Awa Coll-Seck, executive director of one of the groups involved, the Roll Back Malaria Partnership, called it ''a triumph of international cooperation.'' 
 But the United States, the world's biggest donor to the war on malaria, is not supporting it yet. 
 The goal of the medicines facility is to pressure the few drug companies that now make artemisinin combination drugs to lower their private-sector price to $1 per treatment from $4, and then to use donor funds to pay 95 cents of that dollar so the drugs cost only a nickel wholesale. The hope is that when the drugs are sold at retail in villages in Africa and Asia, the marked-up price will still be low enough to drive out cheap but less effective alternatives.
 ''For a poor farmer in Cameroon or a poor market woman in Ghana, the difference between 20 cents and $8 is huge,'' said Olusoji Adeyi, who led the World Bank task force that drew up the plan. 
 The program is a joint effort by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Roll Back Malaria partnership, the governments of Norway, Britain and the Netherlands, and the Unitaid partnership of 30 countries raising money through airline ticket fees.
 Heavily subsidizing the private malaria medicine market was first proposed in 2004 by a committee of the Institute of Medicine of the American Academy of Sciences, led by Kenneth Arrow, a winner of the Nobel Prize in economics. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Clinton Foundation backed the plan. 
 The United States has declined to put any money in yet. Dr. Bernard Nahlen, deputy coordinator of the President's Malaria Initiative, said in an interview Thursday that he wanted more studies proving that subsidies would work before investing hundreds of millions of dollars.
 ''I sometimes joke that this is the biggest faith-based initiative in the world of malaria,'' he said. ''I'm perfectly willing to be convinced, but sometimes the advocacy gets out ahead of the evidence.''
 Mr. Adeyi said Thursday that ''a few pilot studies'' had convinced the plan's backers it would work; Dr. Nahlen dismissed those as ''two highly controlled Clinton Foundation studies in two districts in Tanzania.'' 
 The law Congress passed last year authorizing another $48 billion for AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria specifically forbids donations to the AMFm until the head of malaria activities for the government has ''compelling evidence of success from pilot programs.'' 
 Early plans were for the program to start with $1.9 billion in donor funds, so the $225 million kickoff is being treated as a pilot project to be rolled out in Cambodia and 10 African countries. 
 It will be re-evaluated after two years. 
 At the base of the dispute are a few details that make fighting malaria different from fighting AIDS or tuberculosis.
 Those diseases kill slowly, and drugs for them are handed out at public health clinics.
 But cerebral malaria can kill a child in 24 hours, so antimalaria drugs must be sold everywhere, ideally within walking distance of even the remotest village. Many brands are stocked by pharmacies and even in small huts whose owners sell soap, matches and cooking oil. 
 The World Health Organization now endorses first-line treatment only with cocktails of artemisinin and at least one other drug. Artemisinin, a derivative of artemisia annua or sweet wormwood, was developed by the Chinese in the 1970s -- originally on the orders of Mao Zedong to help the North Vietnamese.
 The intent of the subsidy is to crowd out of the market older drugs like chloroquine and Fansidar, to which resistance is common, as well as artemisinin monotherapy, because taking any drug alone greatly increases the chance that the parasite will develop resistance.
 Only three companies -- Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis and Ajanta, an Indian generics company -- now make cocktails of two drugs in one pill that have been accepted by the W.H.O. Several other drugs by several other companies are expected to qualify soon.
 Doctors Without Borders, the medical charity that treats patients all over the world, endorsed the subsidy plan for combination pills but also said it ''jeopardized the future'' by also permitting subsidies for two-drug blister packs. Some patients sell one pill or take only the artemisinin because most companion pills taste bitter.
 Drug companies usually sell artemisinin combination therapy at $1 to governments but $4 to private wholesalers. By the time it reaches village level, it may cost 10 to 40 times as much as chloroquine, which reduces fever the way aspirin does but does not kill parasites.
 Complicating matters further is the lack of diagnosis before treatment. Fearful parents often buy malaria drugs whenever a child spikes a fever, but some studies show that up to 90 percent of fevers are not malaria. In those situations, subsidies are costly and wasteful.
 Dr. Nahlen endorsed programs like those in Ethiopia, in which 30,000 village health workers are taught to use rapid test kits. But those are not widely available in Africa yet.

HEADLINE: Bank Industry Showing Signs Of a Recovery

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH; Stephen Labaton contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
Just three short months ago, many of the nation's biggest banks were on life support. 
 Now, a number are showing glimpses of a recovery, aided by a tentative improvement in some corners of the economy and new business picked up from rivals that stumbled in the wake of the financial crisis.
 On Thursday, JPMorgan Chase became the latest bank, after Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, to announce blockbuster profits in the first quarter. The reports fed a rally in financial stocks that began more than five weeks ago, when Citigroup and Bank of America, two of the banks hit hardest by the crisis, suggested the worst might already be over. 
 Banks are enjoying a fresh wave of profits from the government's efforts to nurse the industry back to life. Ultralow interest rates have led flocks of consumers to seek deals on mortgage loans. Investment banking and trading activities are enjoying a bounce from the billions of dollars spent to thaw frozen credit markets. And even before the results of a new health test for the nation's 19 largest banks are unveiled, those who can flaunt an improvement from their dismal recent performance are quickly trying to free themselves from government money. 
 But this silver cloud has a dark lining: millions of consumers continue to default on their mortgages, home equity and credit card loans. Corporate loan losses are just starting to pile up. And the residential housing crisis is seeping into commercial real estate with a vengeance: on Thursday, General Growth Properties, one of the nation's largest mall operators, filed for bankruptcy in one of the biggest such collapses in United States history. 
 ''We are in the eye of the storm,'' Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets. ''The worst is behind us for housing. For commercial real estate and corporate lending, there is still a big dark cloud.'' 
 JPMorgan Chase reported a $2.1 billion profit in the first quarter, besting analysts' average forecasts. Revenue increased to $25 billion, up 45 percent from $16.9 billion in the period last year.
 Still, the results reflected continued turmoil in sectors like credit card services and private equity, businesses that reported losses or steep drops in revenue, reflecting the lingering effects of the recession on consumer spending and the credit markets.
 Many banks are preparing for the next rainy stretch, setting aside more money now to cover future loan losses. Regional and community lenders, which are particularly exposed to corporate and real estate loan defaults, are socking away tens of millions of dollars to add to their reserves; big banks like JPMorgan are adding billions. ''Times aren't exactly great as we speak,'' Michael J. Cavanagh, the bank's finance chief, said in a brief interview. ''Until home prices stabilize and unemployment peaks, we will continue to be under pressure for losses on our balance sheet.'' 
 As long as interest rates remain low, and the government continues to offer financial support, banks hope to earn enough profit to cushion the blow of some of these looming losses. 
 The question remains whether the profitability is sustainable if the recession worsens. 
 Some experts are saying fears of nationalization and bank solvency are subsiding. ''What we are recognizing now is that they can produce profits,'' Charles Peabody, a financial services analyst at Portales Partners. ''The next debate is on the sustainability of those profits.''
 With good reason: the banking industry has gotten relief from recent changes to accounting rules, which could inflate earnings. 
 What's more, a brief moratorium on home foreclosures during the winter will postpone when some banks book losses on a big swath of soured loans. At the same time, banks have benefited from unusually good trading results and low interest rates, which have propped up the value of their mortgage investments. 
 The official stress test findings, expected to be released on May 4, may help investors sort out the handful of banks that can generate enough earnings to absorb their losses if the economy worsens. Their conclusions may bear little resemblance to banks' first-quarter results because the stress test is taking a forward-looking view of the banks' conditions over the next two years. Quarterly earnings reports, by their nature, look back. 
 Officials involved in the stress test say they expect the results to show that some banks will need to raise fresh capital. A senior administration official emphasized, however, that those banks would not necessarily need new government money. Besides tapping private investors, banks could derive a major source of capital by converting the preferred stock now held by the government into common shares, as Citigroup intends. The Treasury is likely to rely on individual banks to release their results, and officials said they expected banks that need more capital to immediately announce plans for raising it. 
 But even ahead of the stress test, investors already appear to be rendering verdicts on which banks will emerge as survivors. Goldman Sachs shares are around $121. Citigroup shares, which fell below $1 in March, are trading at just over $4; Bank of America's shares have rebounded to above $10. 
 On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs raised $5 billion of fresh capital in anticipation of repaying the government's investment. 
 Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chairman and chief executive, was adamant on Thursday that his company would pay back $25 billion as soon as regulators allowed. ''Folks, it has become a scarlet letter,'' said Mr. Dimon, referring to the taxpayer infusion the bank received in October. ''We could pay it back tomorrow,'' he said. ''We have the money.''
 Mr. Dimon added that his bank did not plan to be a buyer or seller in the Treasury's public-private partnership program to siphon loss-making investments from banks' books. ''We're certainly not going to borrow from the federal government because we've learned our lesson about that,'' Mr. Dimon said.

HEADLINE: Housing Construction Fell In March, Dashing Hopes

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Construction of new homes fell sharply last month, and foreclosures surged in the first quarter, according to reports released on Thursday, signaling a still-struggling housing market.
 The government reported that new home starts fell 10.8 percent in March from February, just a month after a spike in new-home construction raised hopes that the country's housing market was beginning to make a comeback as credit conditions eased. 
 Home construction in March fell to an annual rate of 510,000 units, the Commerce Department reported, less than expectations by economists of 540,000 units. It was the second-lowest level on record and 48.4 percent lower than housing starts in March 2008.
 ''There's still no clear indication that the construction market is coming back,'' said Mike Larson, a housing analyst at Weiss Research. ''Even if companies want to start projects, they're having a harder time getting the money to do so. We're being overwhelmed by distressed inventory as well as regular sellers trying to get out of their homes. There's not a heck of a lot of incentive for builders to ramp up construction.''
 Still, some housing experts say the decline in home building was a crucial step toward lowering the glut of unsold houses and condominiums on the market so that housing supply once again lines up with demand. 
 Also on Thursday, the data firm RealtyTrac reported that foreclosure filings surged 9 percent, to 803,489 properties, in the first quarter of 2009. RealtyTrac said that foreclosure notices increased 17 percent in March from February.
 ''We saw a record level of foreclosure activity,'' James J. Saccacio, chief executive of RealtyTrac, said in a statement. He added that foreclosures would probably increase in the next months as temporary halts to foreclosures expired at banks and agencies like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.
 The flood of cheap foreclosed homes and distressed properties has helped push home prices lower across the country, especially in areas hit hardest by the housing downturn, like Southern California, Arizona and Florida. 
 The lure of cheap, plentiful houses and lower mortgage rates have drawn buyers back to the market, and an industry group says homes are more affordable than ever before. Interest rates on 30-year mortgage fell slightly to a nationwide average of 4.82 percent last week, according to data released Thursday by Freddie Mac. 
 But in March, single-family housing starts were unchanged at an annual rate of 358,000. 
 Building permits, an indicator of future construction, fell 9 percent from February, to an annual rate of 513,000. Permits were issued at an annual rate of 932,000 in March 2008. 
 Despite the monthly drops in permits and new construction, some economists said they sensed that these indicators of the housing market were no longer tumbling sharply lower. 
 ''It does look to me like we're hitting a bottom,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, about building permits. ''We're now seeing a restabilization at a much lower level. It doesn't mean they're about to rebound.''
 The Labor Department also reported that first-time claims for unemployment insurance fell 53,000, to a seasonally adjusted 610,000 last week. The large decline caught economists by surprise, but they said that weekly jobless numbers are volatile.

HEADLINE: A Leaner Film Festival Raises The Bar

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Leaner and nicer: that in a nutshell describes the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival, which begins Wednesday with the world premiere of Woody Allen's new comedy, ''Whatever Works.''
 Filmed in New York, the movie, which stars Larry David, is a homecoming for Mr. Allen, whose last four films were made in Europe. A question hovers: Will ''Whatever Works'' extend the creative resurgence that began when Mr. Allen took a sabbatical from his beloved Manhattan? 
 But as the Tribeca festival celebrates its eighth year, marquee events like ''Whatever Works'' are just the sparkly surface. The 12-day festival's identity as a hybrid of serious film forum and family-friendly community celebration catering to cineastes and tourists alike is now firmly established. At Tribeca highbrow meets no-brow with everything in between. 
 Leaner means smaller but more discriminating. Tribeca, like almost every other arts institution, has had to pull in its wings. Since 2007 the number of feature films shown has dwindled by more than 40 percent: 85 this year (45 are world premieres), down from 120 last year and 157 in 2007. Shrinkage has its positive side. Tribeca is no longer a catchall showcase for uneven movies (especially American independent films) seeking a festival imprimatur, and complaints that it is a dumping ground have subsided. 
 Artistically it continues to solidify. Film for film, it still may not be as consistent as the Cannes and Sundance festivals, or even New Directors/New Films. But last year for the first time the winner of its narrative film competition, Tomas Alfredson's ''Let the Right One In,'' became a worldwide critical hit. Chosen best foreign film by half a dozen critics' circles in cities around the country, that romantic Swedish horror movie about a bullied, vengeance-seeking 12-year-old boy who falls in love with a vampire earned more than $2 million in the United States: no mean feat for a subtitled art film. 
 Among the two dozen selections I've sampled from this year's festival the quiet family drama ''Still Walking,'' in the Spotlight category for films that already have distribution, stands out as the closest thing to a masterpiece. Made by Hirokazu Kore-eda, the Japanese director of ''Nobody Knows'' and ''After Life,'' the film, shown at the Toronto International Film Festival last year, observes a family reunion at the seaside home of a strait-laced retired doctor and his wife; events are seen through the eyes of their self-effacing grown-up son, Ryo, a recently unemployed art restorer who brings along his new bride, a widow, and her 10-year-old son from her previous marriage. 
 The parents are still mourning the loss of their favorite, Ryo's older brother, who died 15 years earlier while saving a child from drowning. In their bickering chitchat, years of accumulated resentments and petty grievances well up, along with a collective sense of family obligation and what passes for love. The parents' disappointment in Ryo and his awareness of their mortality make ''Still Walking'' a universal, deeply felt portrait of middle-class family life and its discontents, comparable to Yasujiro Ozu's 1953 masterpiece, ''Tokyo Story.''
 The festival is also presenting the New York premiere of Yojiro Takita's ''Departures,'' also from Japan, which recently won the Oscar for best foreign language film, beating out ''The Class'' and ''Waltz With Bashir.'' This sentimental comedy tells the story of a cellist who moves from Tokyo back to his hometown to take a job as an encoffineer (someone who ritually prepares corpses for cremation) after his orchestra is suddenly shut down. Without barging into weepy ''Touched by an Angel'' territory, the movie offers a comforting, dignified vision of death and mourning. 
 A comic high point is Armando Iannucci's ''In the Loop,'' a viciously funny political satire adapted from Mr. Iannucci's BBC series ''The Thick of It.'' Set mostly in Washington in the recent past, it follows some spectacularly foul-mouthed British and American politicians and diplomats through a bureaucratic maze as they squabble about how to announce a forthcoming war in an unidentified Middle Eastern country. The movie is stolen by Mimi Kennedy's portrayal of the American assistant secretary of diplomacy, a woman whose gums bleed at inopportune moments. 
 Overall the tone of this year's selections is deliberately lighter than in the past, said Jane Rosenthal, one of Tribeca's co-founders. That choice, she said, was partly a response to the economic downturn. Tribeca was conceived in the wake of 9/11 as a community redevelopment project for Lower Manhattan and as an antidote to the city's despair and fear in the months following the terrorist attacks. 
 Now the festival finds itself addressing a different neighborhood crisis, the Wall Street meltdown, which over the past six months has devastated many small businesses in the financial district. Once again Tribeca hopes to give the city a lift.
 The surreal, grotesque films from Russia and Central and Eastern Europe that had been a steady presence in earlier festivals are fewer in number this year. None of the special events is as rarefied or somber as ''Passio,'' the fusion of silent film and live performance (of the Estonian composer Arvo Part's St. John Passion) that was a prestige event of the 2007 festival. This year's special events include the world premiere of ''Poliwood,'' Barry Levinson's exploration of the relation of politics and Hollywood in the 2008 presidential election, and the New York premiere of Spike Lee's film of the Broadway show ''Passing Strange.''
 Other high-profile films include the world premiere of ''The Girlfriend Experience,''Steven Soderbergh's movie about a high-priced Manhattan call girl; ''Outrage,'' Kirby Dick's documentary expose of closeted politicians who take public stands against gay rights; and Leslie Cockburn's documentary ''American Casino,'' which methodically examines the effects of the deregulatory Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000 by visiting neighborhoods in Baltimore and Stockton, Calif., where home foreclosures are epidemic and collateral social damage inestimable. 
 As for festival cheer Ms. Rosenthal cited ''Only When I Dance,'' an inspirational documentary she called a ''real-life 'Billy Elliot,' '' as representative of Tribeca's more upbeat side. The movie, in competition for best documentary, follows the career ambitions of two young talented ballet dancers, a boy and a girl, from poor neighborhoods in Rio de Janeiro as they compete in Lausanne and finally in New York City. Another potential crowd pleaser is ''The Swimsuit Issue,'' a Swedish comedy about an all-male synchronized swimming team that evolves out of a bachelor party stunt. In its jovial tone it suggests a Scandinavian answer to ''The Full Monty.''
 Four of the stronger candidates in the world narrative feature competition are Conor McPherson's ''Eclipse'' (Ireland), Omri Givon's ''Seven Minutes in Heaven'' (Israel), Asghar Farhadi's ''About Elly'' (Iran) and Amir Naderi's ''Vegas: Based on a True Story.''
 ''The Eclipse,'' which is set at an Irish literary festival, has a thread of supernatural horror running through it. It is beautifully acted by Ciaran Hinds as a widowed teacher with two children who works as a festival volunteer, Iben Hjejle as a successful writer of ghost stories and Aidan Quinn as a famous author, adulterer and drunken bully. 
 Reymonde Amsellem gives an outstanding performance in ''Seven Minutes in Heaven'' as a young woman who barely survived a terrorist explosion on a Jerusalem bus; the title refers to the time in which she was clinically dead. She meets and falls in love with the doctor who saved her life, but what begins as a conventional love story takes a metaphysical turn as she mentally reconstructs events around the attack, which killed her fiancee. 
 In ''About Elly,'' for which Mr. Farhadi won best director at the Berlin Film Festival, a group of upper-middle-class college friends from Tehran reunite for the weekend in a house by the Caspian Sea. The party atmosphere curdles when the title character disappears. As the guests begin to question what happened to her, and hidden agendas come to light, the movie turns into a tense thriller. 
 ''Vegas: Based on a True Story'' is a timely, disturbing parable on the consequences of greed. A blue-collar couple with a 12-year-old son who live on the outskirts of the gambing mecca are approached by a polite young man claiming to be a Marine newly returned from Iraq. He offers to buy their flimsy house, which sits on a tiny property where a fortune from a notorious heist that took place decades earlier may be buried. Curious enough to start digging, they become obsessed once they unearth a tantalizing scrap of evidence that the money might actually be there. 
 In the world documentary competition, besides ''Only When I Dance'' and ''Outrage,'' one of the strongest candidates is Ian Olds's ''Fixer: The Taking of Ajmal Naqshbandi,'' which examines the 2007 kidnapping and beheading by the Taliban of the 24-year-old Mr. Naqshbandi, a so-called fixer hired by foreign journalists in Afghanistan as a translator and intermediary.
 Although some levity and entertainment value are certainly welcome, a documentary like ''Fixer'' shows that Tribeca, like any film festival worth its salt, is not afraid to go to a very tough place.

HEADLINE: Texas: A Vote for Stimulus Money

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

The State Senate defied Gov. Rick Perry and voted to accept $555 million in federal unemployment benefits. The measure, which passed 22 to 9 on a preliminary vote, would expand state unemployment benefits by including part-time workers and people who quit for compelling reasons, like a child's illness. Mr. Perry, a Republican, had agreed to take almost all of the nearly $17 billion in federal stimulus money slated for Texas, but he said there were too many strings attached to the $555 million in unemployment benefits. All 12 Democrats and 10 of the Senate's 19 Republicans voted to take the money. Mr. Perry has not said whether he will veto the bill.

HEADLINE: Obama Seeks High-Speed Rail System Across U.S.

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama on Thursday highlighted his ambition for the development of high-speed passenger rail lines in at least 10 regions, expressing confidence in the future of train travel even as he acknowledged that the American rail network, compared with the rest of the world's, remains a caboose. 
 With clogged highways and overburdened airports, economic growth is suffering, Mr. Obama said at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, shortly before leaving for a trip to Mexico and then Trinidad and Tobago. 
 ''What we need, then, is a smart transportation system equal to the needs of the 21st century,'' he said, ''a system that reduces travel times and increases mobility, a system that reduces congestion and boosts productivity, a system that reduces destructive emissions and creates jobs.''
 And he added, ''There's no reason why we can't do this.''
 Mr. Obama said the $8 billion for high-speed rail in his stimulus package -- to be spent over two years -- and an additional $1 billion a year being budgeted over the next five years, would provide a ''jump start'' toward achieving that vision. 
 The stimulus money has yet to be allocated to specific projects, but Mr. Obama said the Transportation Department would begin awarding money by the end of summer. 
 The government has identified 10 corridors, each from 100 to 600 miles long, with greatest promise for high-speed development. 
 They are: a northern New England line; an Empire line running east to west in New York State; a Keystone corridor running laterally through Pennsylvania; a major Chicago hub network; a southeast network connecting the District of Columbia to Florida and the Gulf Coast; a Gulf Coast line extending from eastern Texas to western Alabama; a corridor in central and southern Florida; a Texas-to-Oklahoma line; a California corridor where voters have already approved a line that will allow travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles in two and a half hours; and a corridor in the Pacific Northwest.
 Only one high-speed line is now operating, on the Northeast corridor between Washington and Boston, and it will be eligible to compete for money to make improvements.
 Mr. Obama's remarks mixed ambition and modesty, reflecting the fact that American high-speed rail is in its infancy compared with systems in France and Japan.
 ''Imagine whisking through towns at speeds over 100 miles an hour, walking only a few steps to public transportation, and ending up just blocks from your destination,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It is happening right now; it's been happening for decades. The problem is, it's been happening elsewhere, not here.''
 The Federal Railroad Administration defines high-speed rail as any train traveling 90 m.p.h. or faster. In Japan, the Shinkansen trains average about 180 m.p.h. The TGV train in France uses special tracks to sustain speeds of 133 m.p.h. on the Paris-Lyon route. 
 The Acela Express operated by Amtrak is capable of a speed of 150 m.p.h., but track conditions and other rail traffic bring its average speed to just over half that.

HEADLINE: Southwest Plans Buyouts After a Big Quarterly Loss

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Southwest Airlines reported a surprisingly large quarterly loss Thursday as business and leisure travel slumped and the value of its fuel hedging program fell.
 The carrier, widely known for its thriftiness, pinned the loss on faltering passenger demand, particularly in business travel, during ''the toughest revenue environment in our history,'' Gary C. Kelly, the company's chief executive, said in a statement. 
 The results marked the third straight drop in quarterly net profit for Southwest after 17 years in the black. In an effort to trim costs and increase revenue, the airline said it planned to cut capital spending and capacity and to offer employee buyouts for the third time since 2004.
 Southwest said buyouts would be offered to nearly all its 35,000 employees. Previously more than 1,500 employees took the buyouts, which included cash, health care and some flight benefits.
 Southwest also said it has put in place a hiring freeze and has frozen pay for officers and senior management. 
 The company posted a loss of $91 million, or 12 cents a share, for the first quarter. This compares with a year-earlier net profit of $34 million, or 5 cents a share.
 Excluding special items from a portion of the company's fuel-hedge portfolio, the loss came to 3 cents a share. The results missed analysts' expectations of a loss of 1 cent a share, according to Reuters Estimates.
 Total operating revenue slipped 6.8 percent to about $2.4 billion, from $2.53 billion.
 Based on booking and revenue, Mr. Kelly said that he ''wouldn't be shocked at all'' to see second-quarter unit revenue fall more than the 2.9 percent drop for the period ended March 31.
 The parent company of American Airlines, the AMR Corporation, reported a quarterly loss of $375 million on Wednesday.
 The airline industry has been hit hard by the recession, and carriers have been forced to cut jobs and capacity. Southwest had an 8.1 percent decline in traffic for the first quarter.
 Southwest also said it planned to cut capital spending by about $1.4 billion for 2009 and 2010 by deferring aircraft deliveries, accelerating aircraft retirements and suspending plans to expand capacity.
 In New York Stock Exchange trade, Southwest stock fell 7.1 percent to $7.10.

 BODY:
BANK LIFTS MARKETS JPMorgan Chase became the latest bank to announce strong quarterly profit, and the news helped drive the markets up. But analysts remain wary of the signs of life in the economy as they await the results of stress tests on banks and as foreclosures increase. 
 FOOD SAFETY EFFORTS With the Food and Drug Administration already stretched and food recalls worrying consumers, some sectors of the food industry are paying other government agencies to make sure products are safely handled. [A1.] 
 LIDDY'S INVESTMENTS Edward M. Liddy, the chief executive of the American International Group, earns only $1 a year for that role. But he still owns a stake of more than $3 million in Goldman Sachs, one of A.I.G.'s trading partners that was made whole by the government bailout of the insurer. [B1.] 
 TROUBLE FOR MALL OPERATOR General Growth Properties, one of the largest mall operators in the country, filed for bankruptcy protection. The company was dependent on mortgage financing and had been straining with debt in the credit crisis. [B1.] 
 William A. Ackman runs the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, which controls 25 percent of General Growth Properties, and he had not been shy about pushing for a bankruptcy protection filing. He has also been vocal in criticizing other companies. [B4.] 
 WHAT G.M. MIGHT FACE If General Motors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the proceedings might not be quick. In court, a judge rules, and he or she would want to weigh the stakes carefully. News Analysis. [B1.] 
 SMALL-BUSINESS LOANS Junk-loan buyers pay low prices for commercial loans, which are hard to collect and are auctioned off by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation after it seizes a bank. The buyers' efforts to collect on small-business loans have their owners in danger of foreclosure. [B1.] 
 GOLDMAN'S SKEPTICS Goldman Sachs denies that it profited from the federal bailout of the American International Group, but that has not prevented many in the public from feeling scornful. High & Low Finance: Floyd Norris. [B1.] 
 CHRYSLER WORKING WITH UNION Chrysler is said to be close to a deal with the United Automobile Workers to finance retiree health care. The carmaker has been seeking concessions from its unions to try to stave off a bankruptcy filing. [B5.] 
 PAPER MAKER BANKRUPTCY The world's largest newsprint maker, AbitibiBowater, filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States and said it would make a separate request for protection in Canada. [B3.] 
 THE TIMES CUTS COSTS The New York Times plans several cost-cutting moves, including the elimination of some stand-alone weekly sections, the content of which will be moved to other parts of the paper. [B7.] 
 DRUG MAKERS' AD COMPLAINTS Drug makers trying to comply with warnings from the Food and Drug Administration about online ads say that attempts to comply with the agency's rules might mislead consumers. Advertising. [B7.] 
 YOUTUBE'S NEW VENTURE YouTube has signed deals with several Hollywood studios to offer thousands of TV episodes and hundreds of movies on its site. Under the deal, it will have full episodes of a current CBS show, the drama ''Harper's Island,'' with Matt Barr, above. [B1.] 
 MARKETS RISE The major indexes closed higher as JPMorgan Chase and Google each rose more than 2 percent. After Wall Street had an up-and-down day, the last hour brought a strong finish. [B10.] 
 GRIM NEWS IN HOUSING Construction of new homes fell 10.8 percent last month, although by less than analysts had expected. Foreclosures surged in the first quarter as temporary halts expired at agencies like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. [B10.] 
 H.I.V. DRUG VENTURE GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer are forming a specialty company to focus on H.I.V. drugs. The new entity will have 11 H.I.V. drugs for a 19 percent share of the market, a challenge to the market leader, Gilead Sciences. [B3.] 
 GOOGLE REVENUE FALLS Google posted its first decline in revenue compared with the previous quarter since it went public in 2004, but its net income still increased. [B2.]

HEADLINE: Clinton, in Visit to Haiti, Brings Aid and Promises Support

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 

 BODY:
Venturing to the edge of a once lawless part of this impoverished capital, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton vowed Thursday that the United States would not abandon Haiti, six months after it was devastated by storms and food riots.
 She came with about $300 million in American aid, including $15 million in emergency food assistance, $20 million to rebuild the country's shattered roads and bridges and $2 million to train police officers, some of whom patrol the mean streets of this neighborhood, Cite Soleil. 
 ''They've had a difficult time,'' Mrs. Clinton said, as she toured a dusty outdoor clinic staffed by United States Navy doctors and nurses. ''Part of what we're trying to do is help Haiti reconstruct its services.''
 Mrs. Clinton also indicated that the Obama administration might suspend deportation orders for 30,000 Haitian immigrants in the United States, something Haiti has sought because of the money Haitians send home and because it says it could not cope with the returnees.
 If the United States were to relax its policy, she said, it would apply only to Haitians who were living in the United States and served with deportation orders before President Obama took office.
 ''We don't want to encourage other Haitians to make the dangerous journey across the water,'' she said.
 Mrs. Clinton's visit came a day before she was to join Mr. Obama at the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago, and two days after an international donors' conference in Washington, which raised $324 million in emergency and long-term assistance for Haiti.
 That sum is barely a third of what experts say Haiti needs to rebuild, though officials here insisted that they were satisfied, given the global economic crisis.
 After years of hard-fought progress, the mood here is bleak. Four tropical storms last September killed 800 people in Haiti and wiped out 15 percent of its annual economic output. The country now depends on foreign aid for 60 percent of its national budget.
 Political tensions are also rising, with a long-delayed election scheduled for Sunday. Political parties barred from fielding candidates have threatened to disrupt the vote.
 Several opposition leaders stood behind President Rene Preval at a news conference, and Mrs. Clinton reminded them, aides said, that she and Mr. Obama had put aside their differences after the election.
 Mr. Preval played politics, too, urging the United States to lift its trade embargo against Cuba. That is a message Mr. Obama is likely to hear from several other Latin American leaders at the summit meeting.
 Mrs. Clinton said the Obama administration, having relaxed restrictions on travel and financial transfers for relatives of people living in Cuba, was now waiting for a reciprocal gesture from Havana.
 Mrs. Clinton is the first secretary of state to visit Haiti since 2005, and the most senior official to venture near Cite Soleil, which two years ago was a war zone under the control of armed gangs. But she confined herself to the clinic, which was heavily guarded.
 Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, was more adventurous when he visited Haiti two weeks ago, stopping at a school in the gritty heart of Cite Soleil. He and Mrs. Clinton have sentimental ties to Haiti, she said: they toured the country as newlyweds and bought five Haitian paintings, two of which hang in their kitchen in Chappaqua, N.Y.
 With the help of United Nationspeacekeeping troops, Cite Soleil has been largely pacified. Haitian and American officials hold it up as an example of the progress Haiti had made since Jean-Bertrand Aristide was ousted in a military coup in 2004.
 Despite Mrs. Clinton's obvious feelings for Haiti, the country seemed too careworn to return the affection.
 At a garment factory that benefits from an American law that guarantees tariff-free exports of clothing to the United States, Mrs. Clinton said, ''What you're seeing is what needs to happen in Haiti.''
 But as she walked past banks of sewing machines turning out athletic pants, the mostly female workers watched her, silent and stone-faced. Then she slipped out a side door, and the machines began whirring again.

HEADLINE: Google's Profit Is Up 8%, Beating Analysts' Estimates

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
The slumping economy has broken Google's streak: The Internet search giant said Thursday that it had its first decline in revenue compared with the previous quarter since it went public in 2004, as marketers reined in their online advertising budgets.
 But Google is also showing signs that it has adapted quickly to the new economic reality. With its growth slowing sharply compared with a year ago, Google has imposed severe cost controls and slashed expenses. As a result, Google reported net income for the first quarter of $1.42 billion, an 8 percent jump from a year earlier and higher than analysts expected. 
 ''The freewheeling, high-spending days are gone,'' said Jeffrey Lindsay, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''They've matured a lot and there is a good dose of rationality.''
 The clearest sign of change may be that for the first time in its history, Google's work force shrank. The company ended the quarter with 20,164 employees, down 58 workers from the end of the year. The decline may be modest, but it is a sharp contrast from just 18 months ago, when Google added more than 2,100 employees in a single quarter. 
 Google's rate of growth has slowed in an equally stark fashion as a result of the recession and of Google's own vast size. Revenue in the first quarter rose just 6 percent to $5.51 billion from $5.2 billion a year ago. First quarter growth was 42 percent in 2008 and 63 percent in 2007. 
 Despite the abrupt slowing of its growth, Google continued to outperform both its rivals and the overall market for online advertising, which has declined in recent months. 
 ''No company is recessionproof,'' Eric E. Schmidt, Google's chief executive, said in a conference call with investors. ''Google is absolutely feeling the impact. Users are still searching, but they are buying less.''
 But Mr. Schmidt said: ''Despite the tough economic climate, we think Google had a good quarter.'' 
 Whether Google sees any signs of a recovery in the mountains of data it collects from users, Mr. Schmidt would not say. ''If you look at the economic situation, we are still basically in uncharted territory,'' he said.
 Google also said that Omid Kordestani, the company's first salesman and its top sales executive, would take a new role as senior adviser to Mr. Schmidt and co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Mr. Kordestani, who had been in his job for 10 years, will be succeeded by Nikesh Arora, currently the company's president of international operations.
 Mr. Kordestani's move is the third shake-up in Google's sales operations in just one month. It follows the departures of two Mr. Kordestani's deputies, Tim Armstrong, who ran sales for the Americas, and Sukhinder Singh Cassidy, who was in charge of the Latin America and Asia-Pacific regions. 
 Google said net income in the first three months of the year was $1.42 billion, or $4.49 a share, up from $1.31 billion, or $4.12 a share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings, which exclude the cost of stock options and other items, were $5.16 a share, far higher than the $4.93 a share that analysts expected. 
 Google's net revenue, which excludes commissions paid to advertising partners, was $4.07 billion, a 10 percent increase from $3.7 billion a year earlier, and in line with analysts expectations.
 ''Clearly the upside came from severe cost controls,'' said Christa Quarles, an analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners. Ms. Quarles said that capital expenditures, which include spending on data centers, have plummeted to $263 million, from $846 million in the first quarter of 2008. ''They've been doing a lot of data center efficiency and consolidation,'' Ms. Quarles said. 
 Google's chief financial officer, Patrick Pichette, warned that those declines could be temporary and said that Google would continue to invest significantly in areas that it considered vital to its business. He said, for instance, that Google has bought a site to build a data center in Finland, but that construction was stalled because of the severe winters there, suggesting that capital expenditures could climb later this year. 
 Responding to questions from analysts about rumors that Google has had conversations about a possible partnership with Twitter, Mr. Schmidt said he saw interesting advertising opportunities not just in Twitter but also in other real-time communications services. Asked in an interview whether he would like to see Google help sell ads on some of those services, Mr. Schmidt said: ''Absolutely.''

HEADLINE: A Quick Bankruptcy for G.M.? Not So Fast

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER; Micheline Maynard contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Any hope of a high-speed bankruptcy by General Motors faces a serious obstacle: a judge -- not the Obama administration, not G.M. management and not the company's creditors -- would reign in court.
 A bankruptcy judge would be required by law to listen to unions, whose members fear for their jobs, benefits and pensions. And the judge would have to pay attention to creditors, including bondholders frustrated by how much they stand to lose if G.M. is broken up into ''good'' and ''bad'' companies as the administration is planning. Even a judge sympathetic to the administration -- and the administration would look for a sympathetic court -- might be reluctant to rubber-stamp that plan. 
 ''Once you're in, nobody knows where it's going because anyone can come into court and say no, no, no,'' said Sandra E. Mayerson, head of the insolvency practice in the New York law office of Squire, Sanders & Dempsey. ''I've had preplanned bankruptcies that we thought would be out in 90 days but we were in for a year.'' 
 While a bankruptcy judge agreed to a lightning-quick sale of Lehman Brothers assets last fall, he did so only after a parade of government regulators insisted that a failure to sell could undermine the world financial system. That claim would be a stretch for G.M., whose assets are factories, cars and other tangible goods that, unlike Lehman's financial contracts, have value that is unlikely to evaporate quickly. 
 ''It's a very different kind of business than Lehman,'' said Howard Seife, head of the bankruptcy and financial restructuring practice at Chadbourne & Parke in New York. 
 Casting aside the deliberative processes of bankruptcy would undoubtedly lead other companies to argue for the same treatment in the future. 
 The judge would want to weigh carefully the stakes, given G.M.'s size and its close ties to companies around the world. 
 Unionized employees and retirees would ask that their contracts be protected, and the Bankruptcy Code has provisions specifically requiring good-faith negotiations before labor agreements can be modified. Such talks could easily take many months.
 Bankruptcy cases often drag on far longer than anticipated, slowed by unexpected obstacles to reorganization. The auto parts company Delphi, once a unit of G.M. and now a supplier, has languished in bankruptcy proceedings for four years, twice as long as originally planned, for example. 
 Separating and selling off G.M.'s more valuable assets, a strategy pursued at troubled banks (usually outside of bankruptcy, it should be noted), would most likely pit the company's financial advisers against those working for creditors. 
 ''Creditors may think Buick is their premier line, management may think Pontiac is their premier line,'' Ms. Mayerson observed. That argument will delay important decisions about the company's future, she added. ''It really isn't an asset problem at G.M. so much as a management problem.''
 Even if a judge went along with the government's plan to split the company, that judge would want plenty of legal cover. Gathering and presenting evidence that the split-up is the best option would take time.
 Typically, companies sell off assets to third parties as part of a reorganization in Chapter 11. Plans for G.M. would go further, selling virtually all the viable parts of the company very quickly to a new one created solely to buy it.
 ''What's driving this is the concern that the customer is not going to stand for a three-year bankruptcy,'' said a person briefed on the government's plan who insisted on anonymity because discussions are continuing. ''The revenues will just stall out.''
 Allowing the automaker to sell off the good assets would essentially sidestep the rest of the bankruptcy process, lawyers said, especially the nettlesome requirement that creditors approve a plan of reorganization. Once blessed, that tactic would be alluring to other troubled companies.
 ''If you could do this, it's too cheap a trick -- everyone would do it,'' said Lynn M. LoPucki, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''There would be no other kind of bankruptcy remaining.''
 Lehman Brothers conducted a sale within days of its bankruptcy filing, holding an auction under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, which the administration's plan could also use. But in Lehman's case, an outside buyer, Barclays, bid on the assets, Professor LoPucki said. ''Here, there is no buyer,'' he said. ''G.M. is selling itself to itself. That transaction has no economic reality.'' 
 The transaction could have very real implications, though, for creditors and unionized workers. If union contracts on pensions, employment and benefits remain tied to the old G.M., employees and retirees could be devastated financially. 
 If the contracts move to the new, good company, the surviving business would look considerably weaker. That creates a political problem that would make a rapid, clean bankruptcy unlikely.
 ''It's going to be about the union and the pensions,'' said Ms. Mayerson, the bankruptcy lawyer. ''And I don't see any way that this is a quickie bankruptcy. After all, it took them 30 years to get into this mess.''

HEADLINE: Latin American Leaders Aim to Redefine Relationship With United States

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Prior Beharry contributed reporting from Port of Spain, Trinidad.

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO 

 BODY:
When President George W. Bush traveled to Argentina four years ago for a gathering of Latin American leaders, protesters smashed windows, looted stores and sang anti-Bush slogans. Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's president, drew 25,000 to a soccer stadium to rail against the United States' free trade policies.
 The summit meeting was a qualified fiasco for Mr. Bush and a low ebb for relations between the United States and Latin America. 
 Now President Obama is planning to visit Trinidad and Tobago this weekend for the fifth Summit of the Americas, with a chance to dim memories of the last such meeting and re-engage with Latin America, a region that took a distant back seat to the Iraq conflict during the Bush years.
 But Latin American leaders are seeking more than re-engagement. They are looking to redefine the relationship. 
 ''I'm going to ask the United States to take a different view of Latin America,'' Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil's president, said last month before meeting with Mr. Obama in Washington. ''We're a democratic, peaceful continent, and the United States has to look at the region in a productive, developmental way, and not just think about drug trafficking or organized crime.''
 Leaders from the 34 countries with democratically elected governments that make up the Organization of American States are expected to press Mr. Obama on issues including the global economy and the United States' policies on Cuba and on drugs.
 Mr. Bush was the most unpopular American president ever in Latin America, polls showed, while Mr. Obama has rock-star status throughout the hemisphere -- for the moment.
 ''Yes, there are other leaders coming, but people do not understand that, they only concerned about Obama,'' said Kenneth Job, a street merchant in Port of Spain, Trinidad's capital, where the meeting will be held. 
 ''He is the main man who everybody love and want to see,'' said Mr. Job, who sells framed photos of Mr. Obama, and of Nelson Mandela, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks.
 Ultimately, Mr. Obama's appeal in the region could be what keeps anti-Americanism in check at the meeting, analysts said. Mr. Chavez, a fiery populist, is also less likely to try to use the event to take a stand against the United States. In Argentina his ire was directed at sinking a free trade agreement, a deal that ultimately died and has yet to be revived.
 But the steep decline in oil prices and Brazil's ascendancy in the region may throw Mr. Chavez off balance. ''He is not going to have the same support to be defiant or make provocative statements against the United States,'' said Michael Shifter, vice president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy research center in Washington. 
 Senior American officials said they did not expect Mr. Obama to try a formal reconciliation with either Mr. Chavez or with Evo Morales, Bolivia's president. Each leader has expelled American ambassadors in recent months, accusing them of being involved in coup plots. 
 The conference is focused on ''human prosperity,'' energy security and environmental sustainability, but the global economy will be central for Latin American leaders, including Mr. da Silva, who is still smarting over how the crisis threatens to derail one of Brazil's greatest periods of prosperity in a generation.
 White House officials also worry that economic contagion could reverse the region's growth and poverty alleviation in the past half-decade.
 ''In the last year, these achievements have started to dwindle away,'' said Jeffrey S. Davidow, the White House adviser for the summit meeting. ''There is a real concern that Latin America or the hemisphere may be entering into another lost decade.''
 The Latin American leaders are hoping Mr. Obama will not shy away from subjects that have historically been taboo at such meetings. In the past, the United States has vetoed discussions about Cuba and shrugged off criticism of its drug policy.
 But the Obama administration has signaled it agrees with some leaders in the region who want to rethink the approach to curbing drug violence. Several of the region's leaders have also said in recent months that lifting the embargo with Cuba would go a long way toward repairing relations between Latin America and the United States.
 American officials said this week that the president welcomed the discussion, but he is not expected to go beyond steps announced on Monday: lifting restrictions on travel and money transfers to Cuba by Cuban-Americans.
 ''They may not lift the embargo or legalize drugs, but there will be more space to talk about those kinds of things,'' Mr. Shifter said. ''Something could happen on these issues that hasn't really happened before, which is an open debate. That is Obama's style.''

HEADLINE: Subsidy Plan Seeks to Cut Malaria Drug Cost

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
A new campaign to save lives and prevent drug resistance by driving the price of the best malaria medicine down to as little as 20 cents was announced Friday by international health agencies and European governments.
 The subsidy program, unveiled in Norway, will have an initial budget of $225 million and will be run by a new partnership called the Affordable Medicines Facility for Malaria. 
 Malaria experts hailed the program as one of the most important recent advances in fighting the disease, which kills one million people a year, 90 percent of them children. Awa Coll-Seck, executive director of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership, called it ''a triumph of international cooperation.'' 
 But the United States, the world's biggest donor to the war on malaria, is not supporting it yet. 
 The goal of the program is to press the few drug companies that now make artemisinin combination drugs to lower their private-sector price to $1 per treatment from $4, and then use donor funds to pay 95 cents of that dollar so the drugs cost only a nickel wholesale. The hope is that when the drugs are sold at retail in villages in Africa and Asia, the marked-up price will still be low enough to drive out inexpensive but less effective alternatives.
 ''For a poor farmer in Cameroon or a poor market woman in Ghana, the difference between 20 cents and $8 is huge,'' said Olusoji Adeyi, who led the World Bank task force that drew up the plan. 
 The program is a joint effort by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; the Roll Back Malaria Partnership; the governments of Norway, Britain and the Netherlands; and the Unitaid partnership of 30 countries raising money through airline ticket fees.
 Heavily subsidizing the private malaria medicine market was first proposed in 2004 by a committee of the Institute of Medicine of the American Academy of Sciences led by Kenneth Arrow, a winner of the Nobel Prize in economics. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Clinton Foundation backed the plan. 
 The United States has declined to put any money in yet. Dr. Bernard Nahlen, deputy coordinator of the President's Malaria Initiative, said that he wanted more studies proving that subsidies would work before hundreds of millions of dollars were invested in them.
 ''I sometimes joke that this is the biggest faith-based initiative in the world of malaria,'' he said. ''I'm perfectly willing to be convinced, but sometimes the advocacy gets out ahead of the evidence.''
 Mr. Adeyi of the World Bank task force said that ''a few pilot studies'' had convinced the plan's backers that it would work, but Dr. Nahlen dismissed those as ''two highly controlled Clinton Foundation studies in two districts in Tanzania.'' 
 The law that Congress passed last year authorizing $48 billion for AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria specifically forbids donations to the Affordable Medicines program until the head of malaria activities for the government has ''compelling evidence of success from pilot programs.'' 
 The program will be rolled out in Cambodia and 10 African countries, and re-evaluated after two years. 
 At the base of the dispute are a few details that make fighting malaria different from fighting AIDS or tuberculosis. Those diseases kill slowly, and drugs for them are handed out at public health clinics.
 But cerebral malaria can kill a child in 24 hours, so antimalaria drugs must be sold everywhere, ideally within walking distance of even the remotest village. Many brands are stocked by pharmacies and even in small huts whose owners sell soap, matches and cooking oil. 
 The World Health Organization now endorses first-line treatment only with cocktails of artemisinin and at least one other drug. Artemisinin, a derivative of artemisia annua or sweet wormwood, was developed by the Chinese in the 1970s -- originally on the orders of Mao to help the North Vietnamese.
 The intent of the subsidy is to crowd out of the market older drugs like chloroquine and Fansidar, to which resistance is common, as well as artemisinin monotherapy, because taking any drug by itself greatly increases the chance that the parasite will develop resistance.
 Only three companies -- Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis and Ajanta, an Indian generics company -- now make cocktails of two drugs in one pill that have been accepted by the World Health Organization. Several other drugs made by other companies are expected to qualify soon.
 Drug companies usually sell artemisinin combination therapy at $1 to governments but $4 to private wholesalers. By the time it reaches village level, it may cost 10 to 40 times as much as chloroquine, which reduces fever the way that aspirin does but does not kill parasites.
 Complicating matters further is the lack of diagnosis before treatment. Fearful parents often buy malaria drugs whenever a child spikes a fever, but some studies show that up to 90 percent of fevers are not malaria. In those situations, subsidies are costly and wasteful.
 Dr. Nahlen endorsed programs like those in Ethiopia, in which 30,000 village health workers are taught to use rapid test kits. But those are not widely available in Africa yet.

HEADLINE: Never Mind Your 401(k). How's Your Insurance?

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
Insurance is the least sexy asset in most portfolios. If it were an appliance in a remodeled kitchen, it would be the garbage disposal -- useful, hidden and nothing to show off like that stainless-steel range. 
 Yet in a recession that is dragging on, insurance is the one thing people of all wealth levels should keep current. The problem is, it is often the first thing they eliminate or reduce.
 ''At first, people were very fixated on their portfolio losses -- it was so dramatic and so quick,'' said June Walbert, certified financial planner at USAA. ''With job losses, people began looking at ways to cut back.''
 This has meant different things for people with different means. But any reduction in coverage at a time like this could have dire consequences. The primary use of insurance, after all, is to reduce risk. 
 What you have to consider, though, is how to manage risk exposure without becoming paranoid. ''Insurance is always sold with a lot of promises,'' said Holly Isdale, managing director at Bessemer Trust. ''It may sound like it will make your grass greener and your teeth whiter. But the long and short is that now, more than ever, it's important to look at the policy and see what you actually have.'' 
 Here is what people at three wealth levels should be considering: 
 WEALTHIEST The biggest insurance need for the wealthy is personal liability, often called an umbrella policy. Its primary focus is to protect against lawsuits.
 ''In a tough economy, it's more likely that someone will sue because everyone's looking for a buck,'' said Charles Williamson, president of the private client group at AIU Holdings, a division of A.I.G. ''In a good economy, people may look the other way. In a bad one, that person may suddenly say, 'Here's the lottery -- Ms. Mercedes-Benz just plowed into me and my neck hurts.' ''
 That may be a cynical way to look at your fellow man, but any insurer has horror stories about liability claims. Jim Fiske, marketing manager in the United States for Chubb Personal Insurance, said the largest claim his firm paid in the last decade was $16.5 million -- for a car accident in which a number of pedestrians were hurt. 
 The reality is that settlements more than $10 million are rare, but those over $1 million are far more common. ''Anyone who has anything to lose should carry at least $1 million,'' he said. ''Five million dollars should be the minimum for any executive of any corporation.''
 The cost of coverage is relatively inexpensive for what you get. He estimated that the average person could buy $10 million of personal liability for $1,750 a year.
 Mr. Williamson is more blunt about it. ''People don't buy it because generally the notion is that it won't happen to me. And that is true,'' he said. ''But if it does, you can get to $2 to $10 million pretty quickly.''
 UPPER MIDDLE CLASS The insurance issues for those whom many advisers call the working rich are far more complex and daunting. At the end of the day, a very rich person has the assets to self-insure in most cases. People who have high-paying jobs and live well do not.
 Consider someone who is laid off from his job. He typically thinks first about the lost wages and health insurance. But Greg Oberland, the chief insurance officer for Northwestern Mutual, said a company's group life and disability insurance often ends with the job, and those can be more difficult to replace, particularly for someone who is older or has health problems. 
 While many people carry additional life insurance, personal disability coverage is often overlooked. It is what will pay your wages if you get hurt and cannot work. ''In the past, people said, 'I'm covered at work,' '' Mr. Oberland said. ''In this environment, you need to have your own.''
 He said the volume of applications was up this year, but what was more interesting was how people were looking for ways to afford these policies. Quality disability coverage is typically among the most expensive insurance a person buys. The reason is that it is fairly easy to calculate when someone will die, but not so easy to figure out who will get injured and make a claim.
 Yet just as term life insurance was created for people who could not afford the much higher premiums for whole life, several firms now offer stripped-down versions of disability coverage. One way to lower premiums is to buy a policy with coverage that does not start for 6 to 12 months after a claim. This would protect someone from a catastrophic accident but not something minor. Another way is to limit the coverage to a period of years; traditional disability policies cover people until age 65. 
 Northwestern also offers what it calls ''annual renewable disability insurance.'' The cost for it starts out low and increases as a person gets older. A perfect candidate, Mr. Oberland said, is a medical student in residency. He needs to protect his future earnings but does not have the income to pay the premium on what that projected income will be.
 Certain whole life policies can help out-of-work people in a different way: the policies can be tapped for loans. 
 In tough times, the temptation is to cancel a policy and take the cash value. A better option from a risk mitigation standpoint is to borrow against the policy. Depending on the type of policy, a person could borrow up to the whole amount of what he has paid in premiums. 
 The catch is that the money is lent with interest. New York Life's borrowing rate is 5.44 percent, said Steve Berlin, senior vice president in the individual life insurance department. But the upside is you continue to have life insurance. 
 ''Say you borrow $50,000 on a $100,000 cash value,'' he said. ''If you die, that is deducted from the face value of the policy,'' he said. A $1 million policy would then pay out $950,000.
 Another money-saving device is raising the deductible on a homeowner's policy. This increases the out-of-pocket expense if something minor happens but saves on annual premiums. 
 ''Increasing deductibles make sense if the payback is three to five years,'' Mr. Fiske said. ''If you went from $500 to $1,000 deductible, I would expect in three years you would receive that amount of savings in lower premiums.''
 He added that Chubb offered a ''disappearing deductible'' for major claims, like water damage over $50,000.
 MIDDLE CLASS As in other parts of American life, the less you have, the less you can afford. But you still have things to lose. 
 The one form of insurance that the middle class should strive to keep is some form of life insurance to provide for their family should they die. 
 ''It's important to note that wealthier Americans tend to protect what they have, but those with more modest means can't afford to lose what they have,'' Ms. Walbert said. ''That's why life insurance is so important. But now, it's on the table for them.'' 
 When every penny counts, the people who can least afford to increase their risk often do. But people at every wealth level need to remember that accidents happen.

To the Editor:
 Re ''Too Old for the Foster Care System, and Facing Life in the City During a Recession'' (news article, April 8): 
 There are nearly 17,000 children in foster care in New York City, and more than 40 percent of them are over age 12. New Yorkers for Children, the nonprofit partner to the Administration for Children's Services, provides resources for these young people through programs like Back-to-School Package and Network to Success. We believe that education is the means to stability for youth transitioning out of foster care. 
 The Back-to-School Package program provides college students in foster care with a laptop, printer and school supplies. Network to Success offers high school and college students exposure to potential careers in various industries as they begin planning for their future.
 We cannot overstate the importance of connections to stable adults for these youth about to embark on adulthood. Through mentoring, educational initiatives and financial literacy training, New Yorkers for Children provides them with the tools to become self-sufficient, successful adults.

HEADLINE: The Agony of Competition, With Cameras Rolling

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
Typically, each year, about 1,800 aspiring young singers enter the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, the most visible competition in America. Usually 22 of them, having made it through the district and regional auditions, are brought to New York for the semifinals. 
 Roughly 10 are invited to remain for a week, rehearse with coaches from the Met and perform in the Sunday afternoon finalists concert, held at the house with the Met Orchestra in the pit. The singers know that among the opera buffs in the audience, all hoping to hear the stars of tomorrow, will be managers, impresarios, conductors and critics. 
 ''The Audition,'' a revealing two-hour documentary directed by the award-winning filmmaker Susan Froemke, vividly tells the backstage story of the excruciatingly competitive final rounds of the 2007 auditions, culminating with a concert at the Met on April 1, with Marco Armiliato conducting. Although the film is scheduled to be broadcast on public television in the fall, it is being screened on Sunday afternoon at about 400 theaters across the United States as part of the Met's HD broadcast series. (It will be shown at 3 p.m. E.D.T. and noon P.D.T.; ticket information is available at Fathomevents.com.) 
 Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Met, is the executive producer of ''The Audition.'' But this is not your typical in-house promotional project. The cameras take you into the room where the judges evaluate the finalists at the end of the concert and pick six winners, who receive $15,000 each. Some of their comments are blunt. One young soprano, all agree, has an impressive voice but is temperamentally dull and unfortunately overweight. 
 In interviews Ms. Froemke elicits some revealing admissions from the finalists. Michael Fabiano, an immensely gifted and intensely ambitious tenor, 22 at the time, says, ''There is always politics in every competition.'' Although the camaraderie among the finalists has been very nice, he says, he does not quite believe it. ''People are self-interested'' and ''want to win,'' he explains. To combat nerves and keep himself rested, Mr. Fabiano took three sleeping pills on critical nights.
 The film has also turned out to be a poignant, unplanned tribute to Ryan Smith, a husky, gregarious and promising tenor, one of the winners, who later made it to the roster of the Met, singing five performances last spring as Don Riccardo, a small role in Verdi's ''Ernani.'' In November Mr. Smith died after a yearlong struggle with lymphatic cancer. 
 The oldest finalist, at 30, Mr. Smith is shown discussing his early spotty training and his break from singing for three years while he coped with a financial crisis. No audition is more terrifying, Mr. Smith says, than having a marshal show up at your door with an order for you to pay off credit card debts. 
 The film includes a postscript dedication to Mr. Smith. And in an epilogue, three Met stars -- Renee Fleming, Susan Graham and Thomas Hampson, all former winners of the National Council Auditions -- discuss the film insightfully and speak of Mr. Smith, especially Mr. Hampson, who appeared with him in the ''Ernani'' production.
 Along with scenes of agonizing competition, ''The Audition'' has moments that will hearten all opera lovers. It is endearing to watch the young singers fulfill their fantasies of making it to the Met's storied stage. When Kiera Duffy, a lovely coloratura soprano with a sweet and agile voice, finishes her performance in the final concert, she is teary, anxious and exhilarated, all at once. ''I will never, ever, ever forget that,'' she says. 
 Alek Shrader, a 25-year-old tenor, exuding boyish charm, has an appealing lyric tenor voice with a solid high C. One of his two arias for the concert is ''Ah! mes amis,'' from Donizetti's ''Fille du Regiment,'' the jaunty aria known for its nine high C's. During a rehearsal, after Mr. Shrader tosses off the final top note, his fellow tenor Mr. Smith jokingly says, ''I wanted to throw my shoe at you.'' 
 What comes through in the film is how difficult it is to assess the still-emerging voices of people in their 20s. Along with Mr. Smith, Mr. Fabiano and Mr. Shrader, the other winners that year were the mezzo-soprano Jamie Barton, the soprano Amber L. Wagner and the soprano Angela Meade, who made her last-minute Met debut last season singing Elvira for one performance of ''Ernani'' when the scheduled soprano, Sondra Radvanovsky, took ill.
 But the finalists who may never make it back to the Met at least have that concert to remember. For all time their names will be listed in the archives of performers with the company.

HEADLINE: Fraud Factor

 BODY:
While Washington is spending billions to shore up the financial system, it is doing far too little to strengthen the federal government's ability to investigate and prosecute the sort of corporate and mortgage frauds that helped cause the economic collapse. 
 Those efforts -- never fully adequate -- have suffered in recent years as money and people were shifted from white-collar fraud to anti-terrorist activities. Over time, the ranks of fraud investigators and prosecutors were dramatically thinned, leaving the F.B.I. and the larger Justice Department ill prepared to keep pace with a skyrocketing number of serious fraud allegations. Now they are ill equipped to police the vast infusion of federal money into the economy.
 A bipartisan measure newly approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and now coming before the full Senate would begin to close the enforcement gap.
 Sponsored by Senators Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Edward Kaufman of Delaware, both Democrats, and Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 would significantly expand the number of prosecutors, agents and analysts devoted to pursuing financial crimes. 
 It would strengthen existing federal fraud and money-laundering provisions, updating the definition of ''financial institution'' in federal fraud statutes to include largely unregulated mortgage businesses, for example, and reversing flawed court decisions that have undermined the effectiveness of the False Claims Act, one of the most potent weapons against government fraud.
 The measure envisions spending $490 million over the next two fiscal years. Like a similar enforcement buildup in response to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, this one will contribute far more than it costs to the federal Treasury through restitutions and asset recoveries, according to the Congressional Budget Office forecast. Senators should not be asking if the expenditure is affordable, but whether it is enough.

HEADLINE: A Columbine Victim's Spirit of Hope Grows

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: ENGLEWOOD, Colo. 

 BODY:
Darrell Scott has told the story of his daughter Rachel's life, death and legacy thousands of times in schools all over the world in the 10 years since her murder at age 17 in the mass shootings at Columbine High School, a few miles south of here. 
 But never before, he said, had he stood before an audience like the one on Friday morning in the garage of a carpet and upholstery cleaning franchise. 
 Instead of students, the listeners were men, and a few women, in blue-collar working clothes. Instead of teenagers, urged by Mr. Scott to make a world where horrors like Columbine never happen again, the 50 spectators were mostly parents, so they indicated by a show of hands. Many of the workers looked tough and burly, and some had only joined the company in recent months, managers said, forced by the economic downturn into second careers in cleaning.
 But when music swelled and a photo of Rachel's diary, which was in her backpack and was pierced by a bullet when she was killed, filled the projection screen, many of the workers wiped away tears, just as audiences do during Mr. Scott's speeches to student assemblies.
 ''I think we're all in agreement about life being too short,'' said Tim Bohling, a sales technician, when Mr. Scott was finished.
 What Rachel believed was crystallized in an essay she wrote a month before she and 14 other people, including the two gunmen, were killed at Columbine on April 20, 1999. Its global promulgation by a nonprofit group Mr. Scott founded, Rachel's Challenge, is now branching out into corporate America. The Colorado franchise of COIT cleaning was the pilot foray into this new frontier; the company was offered the program free to see how Rachel's message of ''looking for the best and beauty in everyone'' worked in a new setting.
 Mr. Scott, 59, said the corporate effort -- run by a for-profit company, with Rachel's Challenge receiving a percentage through a licensing agreement -- was intended not so much to stop the bullying and cruelty of school, but to alleviate the angst and anxiety of work. 
 ''In the corporate world, greed and self-interest have been the focal point,'' Mr. Scott said after his presentation. ''That made us realize that Rachel's Challenge has a place.''
 He also hopes that the corporate training will become a new revenue source, to help finance the expanding list of ventures that Rachel's Challenge is involved with, from feeding the hungry to helping support cleft palate surgery programs in underdeveloped countries. Rachel's Challenge has a staff of 50 and an annual budget of $3.5 million, almost all of it paid through fees from schools for the group's presentations and seminars. But Mr. Scott said it needed new staff members to manage and monitor its expanding list of programs.
 Counseling experts say the appetite for messages of hope or compassion -- whether from Rachel's words or someone else's -- is just about bottomless these days in corporate life, as layoffs and economic fear stalk the landscape. 
 ''We're all just being stretched to the boundaries of our ability to cope,'' said Bob Separ, a social worker and clinician at Corporate Counseling Associates, a company based in New York that runs employee assistance programs. Calls from distressed employees increased 15 percent last fall, Mr. Separ said, as did the severity of the problems people were calling about. 
 At COIT, which cleans carpets, drapes, upholstery and air ducts, the recession has not led to layoffs, said Steven J. Peterson, the owner and president. But it has had an impact, as bad times elsewhere in the economy have rippled through Colorado. Recruiting is easier now, Mr. Peterson said, and turnover is lower, as people stay in the job longer.
 It is a debatable point whether any one effort, however well meaning, can alter the grand sweep of an economy or society, or indeed whether anything has changed since that bleak morning in 1999 when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, armed with bombs and high-powered weapons, stormed their school. 
 There have been even worse rampages, like the one at Virginia Tech, which left 32 people dead in 2007, blunting Columbine's special place of horror. But law enforcement and school intervention efforts have evolved, too, perhaps heading off attacks that might have been.
 The message from Mr. Scott and the organizers of the new corporate training program is that Rachel wanted to touch everyone. In her essay, she wrote about starting ''a chain reaction of kindness and compassion,'' that might, when repeated and expanded exponentially, eventually change the world. 
 That thought created the core message of the Rachel's Challenge program, Mr. Scott said, but also the appetite for growth in the organization. More people reached, more lives touched -- there is no end to that chain, either, he said.
 Sam Garnett, a cleaning technician at COIT, said he definitely understood that part of the message that Mr. Scott delivered: actions, for good or ill, ripple out into the world with consequences that cannot be contained or maybe even known. Next time when he is driving to a job and some impatient driver wants to cut in front of him, Mr. Garnett said he would back off and wave the driver in. The courtesy and compassion would come back, he said.
 ''It just goes around,'' Mr. Garnett said. ''That's what this was about.''

HEADLINE: Consumers See Improvement

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Consumers have more confidence in the American economy than they have had since the sudden collapse of Lehman Brothers in September, which nearly caused the global banking system to implode, a survey showed on Friday. 
 The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its preliminary April reading of consumer sentiment rose to a level of 61.9, up from 57.3 in March, and was the highest since 70.3 recorded in September.
 ''The upshot is that everyone is now looking for upside surprises in the data, which tells you that all this is pretty much priced in,'' said Carl Lantz, United States interest rate strategist with Credit Suisse in New York.
 The survey's index of current economic conditions rose to 66.6 in April, from 63.3 in March, and was the highest reading since December.
 The index of consumer expectations rose to 58.9 in April, from 53.5 in March, and was the highest since September.
 ''While consumers believe the economy may have hit bottom, most consumers believe that when the rebound starts the economy will gain ground very slowly,'' the survey director, Richard Curtin, said.

HEADLINE: Animated Characters, Real Settings, No Aliens

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
Every once in a while, Henry Winkler said, ''God gives you a gift.''
 In television, that gift can be a time slot. For ''Sit Down, Shut Up,'' Fox's first new animated series in four years, ''we couldn't have a better time period,'' Mr. Winkler, one of the voice actors, said.
 When it has its premiere at 8:30 p.m. on Sunday, ''Sit Down, Shut Up'' will be sandwiched between ''The Simpsons'' and ''Family Guy,'' two of the most influential animated series in television history. ''The Simpsons'' is celebrating its 20th season, complete with a line of United States Postal Service stamps this year; ''Family Guy'' is credited with making its creator, Seth MacFarlane, a $100 million man. With ''Shut Up,'' Fox is seeking to introduce a new animated cast to its Sunday night lineup, one based in a classroom rather than in a living room. 
 Bookended by those two outlandish family sitcoms, ''Shut Up'' will surely stand out. The series, a product of several alumni from the cult-favorite sitcom ''Arrested Development,'' stars the self-obsessed teachers of a high school where the students are mere obstacles. It notably avoids some of the conventions of Fox's successful animated shows. There are no aliens, as in ''American Dad.'' There isn't a talking dog or a mother named Marge with a sky full of blue hair. The baby isn't Machiavellian; in fact, the baby can't even talk.
 Unlike those shows, ''Shut Up'' is essentially set in the real world, partly as a consequence of its distinctive style of animation. The series combines animated characters with live-action backgrounds in a style originally created by Mo Willems, the children's book author. ''I think it's the only animated show with a locations manager,'' said Will Arnett, the voice of Ennis Hofftard, a doltish English teacher.
 Photos of a deserted, somber high school are painted with forlorn characters and props. (Although the show is set in Florida, careful viewers will notice the occasional California license plate.) 
 ''From a purely aesthetic perspective, it's very different,'' Mr. Arnett said. ''It takes a little bit of getting used to.'' Most of the time, he added, ''you end up forgetting'' that the backdrops are photographs.
 The dysfunctional high school concept is adapted from Australia, where a live-action version of the series was shown in 2001. Mitch Hurwitz, an executive producer and co-creator, envisioned the American edition as a live-action sitcom, too, but TV executives thought his script was ''too broad'' and directed him to revise it. 
 ''I didn't want to rewrite it and make every character plausible,'' he said in a telephone interview, so instead he pitched it to Fox as an animated sitcom.
 ''I was being lazy,'' he said.
 Mr. Hurwitz asked Mr. Willems, a Brooklyn author whose ''Knuffle Bunny'' books for children have combined photographs and hand-drawn characters, to design the characters. (Because of the content, Mr. Willems asked not to be credited on the show.) 
 Mr. Hurwitz has said that the photographs help to reset the comedy bar for the writers, ''so that you don't expect animals to talk or U.F.O.'s to land.'' (''American Dad,'' another creation of Mr. MacFarlane's, features a talking fish and a space alien.)
 It also helps distinguish ''Shut Up'' from the other shows. Mr. Hurwitz said he knew that he could not compete with ''The Simpsons'' or ''Family Guy.''
 ''I've always personally been interested in trying to do something new,'' he said.
 In the first minutes of the first episode of ''Shut Up,'' the characters will start tapping on the fourth wall of television. ''They're slightly aware that they're in a TV show,'' Mr. Hurwitz said. 
 Jason Bateman plays the gym teacher Larry Littlejunk, perhaps the only person in the school who would pass a teacher certification test. In the first episode, while Larry talks about a science teacher who climbed naked out of a papier-mache monkey to rebut the theory of evolution, he asks out loud, ''Can I get a flashback on this?'' Refused a flashback by the imaginary director, Larry and the acting principal joke about whether the presumed censors will allow the phrase ''fuzzy monkey.'' 
 Mr. Hurwitz said he added another TV reference near the end of the premiere episode, when the football coach rallies the team by saying to the students, ''You can win this one; it's the pilot!'' In a later episode a character refers to six hours spent in a harness for a special-effects shot that the show will never end up using.
 Mr. Hurwitz said the characters' self-awareness ''kind of emerged'' in the writing process. ''It wasn't really a choice,'' he said.
 '' 'Family Guy' has been so ambitious and so brilliant in its referencing of popular culture,'' he said. ''You've got to find some way to go further. You certainly can't beat them with that stuff.''
 On a couple of occasions, he added: ''The writing staff would put in a talking animal, and I would take it out. It seemed like we were doing someone else's act.''
 Mr. Hurwitz's awareness about ''Family Guy'' extended to the setting of his series. When it was ordered by Fox last year, the show was set in a fishing town in the Northeast. The fact that ''Family Guy'' is set in Rhode Island influenced the show's relocation to Florida.
 Fox's next animated series, a spinoff of ''Family Guy'' titled ''The Cleveland Show,'' will feature two talking bears in its cast. Both ''Sit Down, Shut Up'' and ''The Cleveland Show'' are part of Fox's effort to expand its animation brand. The network canceled ''King of the Hill,'' a 12-year-old animated series about a family in a small Texas town, earlier this year.
 The producers hired a number of well-known actors for the character voices. They recruited Mr. Arnett, Mr. Bateman and Mr. Winkler, whom Mr. Hurwitz had worked with on ''Arrested Development,'' along with Will Forte, Cheri Oteri and Kenan Thompson of ''Saturday Night Live'' fame. Mr. Winkler, best known for playing the Fonz on ''Happy Days,'' plays a gray-haired German teacher who is best summed up by his catchphrase: ''If I believed in reincarnation, I'd kill myself tonight.''
 The show is likely to attract some viewers who still long for ''Arrested Development,'' an eccentric look at an extended family that was canceled by Fox three years ago. Mr. Arnett said, ''The jokes and the stories are of the same tenor.''
 Mr. Arnett said viewers could expect a strain of social commentary in the series, something Mr. Hurwitz was known for with ''Arrested.'' The first episodes include some jokes about inadequate financing of schools. But Mr. Hurwitz said too heavy a dose of commentary would distract from the series, especially given the country's political and economic climate. 
 Referring to the series's live-action roots, he sarcastically said, ''If anything, I'm attacking the Australian school system.''

HEADLINE: The Enemies Within

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
The United States Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis issued a report last week suggesting that current political and economic conditions are energizing right-wing extremist groups, that many of these groups follow extremely conservative ideologies and that some may seek to recruit and ''radicalize'' veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 True, true and true.
 But, conservatives reacted by throwing a knee-jerk hissy fit. They twisted the report's meaning to imply that they, and more importantly our war heroes, were being vilified by a partisan document. 
 Their argument seeks to suppress and subjugate two rather unfortunate facts: while only a tiny number of conservatives and veterans are members of hate groups, nearly all hate groups do indeed follow far-right ideology. And they covet members with military experience.
 A report issued last summer by former President Bush's F.B.I. entitled ''White Supremacist Recruitment of Military Personnel since 9/11'' said that ''military experience is found throughout the white supremacist extremist movement'' and that these groups ''have attempted to increase their recruitment of current and former U.S. military personnel.'' 
 So, which soldiers are most vulnerable? According to the Homeland Security report, it would probably be those ''facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities.'' This could be a large group because far too many soldiers come back from war broken men. According to a RAND study released on Friday, 300,000 veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan reported some sign of post-traumatic stress disorder or major depression. It said that only about half of those will seek help and only half of those seeking it will receive ''minimally adequate'' treatment.
 These soldiers could prove fertile ground for men hoping to prey on their fear, loneliness and dispossession.
 And those extremist leaders may be able to connect more easily with some of these soldiers because many were soldiers themselves. According to the F.B.I. report, ''although individuals with military backgrounds constitute a small percentage of white supremacist extremists, they frequently occupy leadership roles.''
 Because many know firsthand the value of military experience, they not only recruit those leaving the military, they send recruits into it. According to Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center, ''Many white supremacists over the years have pushed their followers to join the military and enter either the special forces, where the training is judged to be the best in the world, or the infantry, where you will learn the skills necessary to fight the coming race war.'' 
 The only debate we should be having is about the best way to protect our newest veterans from falling prey to this handful of military apostates.
 If they only recruit a few, that is still too many. Terrorists have shown the world time and again that a few well-trained men is all it takes.

HEADLINE: Plan for U.S. Emissions To Be Buried Under Sea

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH

 BODY:
In an ambitious proposal to counter global warming, an upstart power developer wants to build a coal-fired electric plant on the outskirts of New York City that would capture its emissions of carbon dioxide and pump the pollutant 70 miles offshore. The gas would be injected into sandstone a mile beneath the ocean floor in the hope that it would stay there for eons.
 Experts have thought for years that capturing the emissions from power plants will be a crucial technology for limiting climate change. But high cost projections and scientific uncertainty have meant that progress on the technique has been limited, even as the effects of global warming are starting to be felt around the world.
 Now SCS Energy, based in Concord, Mass., contends not only that it can build the world's first such plant and get it to work, but also do so profitably, despite costs that could approach $5 billion. If it succeeded, the plant might become a model that could be copied elsewhere. 
 A key to the proposal is location: an old industrial site near the shore in Linden, N.J., just across the Arthur Kill waterway from Staten Island. Generating power there would allow the company to sell it into one of the country's most expensive markets, and injecting the gas deep beneath the ocean floor, where pressure would help keep it down, would eliminate some of the uncertainty that might attend a similar project on land.
 The proposal raises many environmental and political questions, and it is far from clear that the company can overcome the opposition that seems to crop up to any new power plant in the Northeast. But if the proposal wins approval and if it succeeds in burying 90 percent of its carbon dioxide emissions, as planned, it could be a major step toward finding a technological fix for global warming.
 ''If this succeeds, it's going to be very hard for utilities to say, 'Oh no no, you can't do this,' '' said Daniel Schrag, a Harvard geochemist whose work inspired the proposal.
 The plan may get an attentive hearing in Washington, where President Obama has installed a team at the Energy Department and other agencies that is determined to put new clean-energy plans into effect. 
 The Linden proposal builds on the work of Mr. Schrag and one of his graduate students, Kurt Zenz House. In a paper in 2006, they argued that layers of rock beneath the ocean floor might be the best place to bury the huge amounts of carbon dioxide that industrial societies emit into the atmosphere.
 SCS Energy, which hired Mr. Schrag as a consultant after learning of that work, has specialized in tricky projects. Despite intense opposition, it succeeded in building a power plant fired by natural gas that began operating in Astoria, Queens, in 2006.
 The company has struck a deal to pay $95 million for an old DuPont chemical factory site at Grasselli Point in Linden. The site is near rail lines and barges that can deliver coal. More than a dozen permits are needed from state and federal agencies, and those are likely to take years.
 In an unusual twist, SCS says it intends to bolt a fertilizer plant onto the power plant to improve the economics. When power prices are high, the plant would concentrate on making electricity, but when they are low, it would also make nitrogen fertilizer.
 Richard J. Gerbounka, the mayor of Linden, said he was ''very excited about the project,'' which would help redevelop a desolate industrial area.
 A buried steel pipe, two feet in diameter, would transport liquid carbon dioxide from the power plant to a site 70 miles offshore, beneath half a mile of water. A well would inject the carbon dioxide to a depth of about a mile below the sea floor, into a layer of ancient sandstone. Mr. Schrag said the carbon dioxide would stay there for millions of years, kept down by a thick layer of mud and the weight of the sea. Not even earthquakes or underwater landslides would be likely to dislodge it, he said.
 ''The worst thing that could happen is a little bit of CO2 escaping into the atmosphere,'' said Dean Malouta, the manager of technology for exploration and production for Shell's Americas region, which has financed some related research.
 A well would be drilled to reduce the pressure and release the seawater displaced by the carbon dioxide, providing a better way to manage pressure than is possible on land, Mr. Schrag said.
 Already, some oil companies pump carbon dioxide into their drilling fields in places like Texas, to help squeeze out more oil. The carbon dioxide put underground has mostly remained there, preventing it from re-entering the atmosphere.
 But capturing carbon dioxide from power plants is expected to be costly, adding 25 percent or more to operating expenses, in addition to higher construction costs. In this country, utilities are planning only modest demonstration projects. One larger project in Illinois, FutureGen, was abandoned by the Bush administration as costs escalated.
 Worldwide, more than a dozen projects are under way to store power plant emissions. Norway is the only country to have undertaken a large project to bury greenhouse gas emissions under the sea floor, at the Sleipner gas field 155 miles off the coast in the North Sea. That project has been going safely for 13 years, but it buries less than a quarter of the amount of carbon dioxide as proposed in New Jersey. 
 Environmental groups have been divided over whether this approach is a good idea. ''The burden of proof is clearly going to be on the project developers'' to prove the geological suitability of undersea storage, said Mark Brownstein of the Environmental Defense Fund.
 Partly because of tight regulations and environmental opposition, no coal-fired plants have been built in New Jersey since the mid-1990s, and even renewable energy projects can be hard to site along the East Coast because of the difficulty of obtaining permits.
 ''It's an exciting project, but it's an unproven technology at the scale proposed,'' said Elaine Makatura, a spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Protection in New Jersey, which has had preliminary meetings with the developers.
 The company sees the main hurdle as financing. SCS has begun informally talking with banks, and hopes to sidestep the credit crisis because it will not need large sums until about 2011. ''As a business investment in the electricity industry, it's an attractive investment,'' said Frank Smith, a founder of SCS.
 The company hopes to tap close to $100 million a year in federal tax credits for its technology and says it believes it can turn a profit without additional grants. The plan features not only the fertilizer plant, but also other aspects that would improve the finances.
 For instance, the carbon dioxide disposal pipe would be large enough to carry emissions not only from the power plant but also from factories nearby, a potentially valuable service if the government cracked down on emissions.

HEADLINE: A Danger to Public Health and Welfare

 BODY:
In what could be a historic moment in the struggle against climate change, the Environmental Protection Agency on Friday confirmed what most people have long suspected but had never been declared as a matter of federal law: carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases constitute a danger to public health and welfare. 
 The formal ''endangerment finding'' names carbon dioxide and five other heat-trapping gases as pollutants subject to regulation under the federal Clean Air Act. This in turn sets the stage -- after a 60-day comment period -- for broad new rules touching major sectors of the American economy and profoundly influencing how Americans use and generate energy.
 The finding is also likely to accelerate the progress of climate legislation in Congress and will give the United States the credibility it lost in international climate negotiations during the Bush administration. The next round of talks is scheduled for Copenhagen in December.
 The decision has been a long time coming. Two years ago, the United States Supreme Court ordered the agency to determine whether greenhouse gases harmed the environment and public health and, if so, to regulate them. Scientists at former President George W. Bush's E.P.A. largely agreed that greenhouse gases are harmful and should be regulated. In December 2007, the agency forwarded an endangerment finding to the White House, where senior officials promptly suppressed it, refusing even to open the e-mail to which it was attached. 
 Though they put greater emphasis on the health effects, the E.P.A.'s scientists came to much the same conclusions: that concentrations of greenhouse gases had reached unprecedented levels and had already contributed to increased drought, more frequent and intense heat waves, rising sea levels and damage to water resources, food supplies and ecosystems. 
 This time, fortunately, the findings were not ignored at the White House. Nor should they be ignored anywhere, most especially in Congress, which is where the solution may ultimately lie. 
 The E.P.A.'s new administrator, Lisa Jackson, is to be applauded for moving so quickly, and she should move as aggressively as she can to develop whatever rules she thinks are necessary. But as Ms. Jackson is the first to say, legislation addressing climate change would be more effective and inclusive than top-down regulation. It would require broad consensus in Congress and command a wider political consensus going forward. It would also be less vulnerable to legal challenge.
 Whether Congress can rise to the challenge this year is an open question. Mr. Obama hopes it can, and so do we. In the House, Representatives Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts have crafted an ambitious, many-layered bill that would impose a price on older, dirtier fossil fuels while encouraging newer, cleaner fuels. Though it lacks many important details, the bill provides a plausible framework for the urgent discussion that Congress needs to have and the urgent action it needs to take.

HEADLINE: In Grim Job Market, Student Loans Are a Costly Burden

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD. 
E-mail: tsbernard@nytimes.com

 BODY:
They bought into the notion that if they went to college -- never mind the debt -- their degree would lead to a lucrative job. And repaying their student loans would never be a problem.
 But the economic crisis has turned those assumptions on their ear as thousands of recent graduates have been unable to find jobs or are earning too little to cover the payments for loans that are sometimes as high as $50,000. 
 The result has been rising default rates for student loans. And unlike other debts, student loans cannot easily be renegotiated.
 ''You often hear the quote that you can't put a price on ignorance,'' said Ezra Kazee, who has $29,000 in student debt and has been unable to find a job since graduating from Winona State University in Minnesota last May. ''But with the way higher education is going, ignorance is looking more and more affordable every day.'' 
 About two-thirds of the students graduating from college next month, or an estimated 1.8 million, have taken on student loans to pay ever-rising tuition and room and board. The average cumulative debt among graduating seniors is about $22,500, according to FinAid.org, a Web site that specializes in financial aid.
 Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of FastWeb.com and FinAid.org, recommends that students follow a simple rule of thumb. ''Do not borrow more than your expected starting salary for your entire undergraduate education,'' he said. ''If your starting salary is going to be $40,000, then you should borrow no more than $10,000 a year for a four-year degree.''
 Gregory Westby, a 27-year-old designer who graduated from the School of Visual Arts in New York last May, is caught in the student loan trap. He has $150,000 in debt. He hasn't been able to find a full-time job in graphic or set design, but is using his earnings from low-paying freelance jobs and working weekends at a fitness club to pay his rent. And he's in the process of deferring his loans, which, together, cost $1,500 a month.
 ''Right now I'm surviving, but who knows when I'll be able to start paying my loans back?'' he said. 
 While Mr. Westby has found a temporary solution, many others are in default. The most recent default rate on federal loans was 6.9 percent, the highest rate since 1998, according to preliminary data from the Education Department. But this statistic illustrates only a piece of the picture. It tracks only the students who started to repay their loans between October 2006 and Sept. 30, 2007, but who had defaulted by September 2008. And it doesn't include loans in deferment or forbearance even though those borrowers are unable to make payments. Nor does it include loans not backed by the government. 
 Perhaps seduced by the idea of graduating from a well-respected university, many students tend to overlook the consequences of graduating with debts that are likely to far exceed their starting salaries. And as many borrowers have learned, student loans are among the most ironclad debts, on par with child support, alimony and overdue taxes. They stick with you no matter what.
 Bankruptcy usually doesn't provide relief, except in the most dire of circumstances. Even death isn't a good enough excuse for discharging some private loan debts. And the government can wield a heavy hand to collect what it is due: If you fail to repay your federal loans, it can garnish up to 15 percent of your wages or take your tax refund or part of your Social Security benefits. 
 But if you are having trouble paying back what you owe because you've lost your job or have some other financial difficulty, you have options. Of course, it's always best to take corrective action before you're officially in default. For federal loans, it generally takes about nine months of missed payments. But you can go into default on a private loan as soon as one payment is missed, though the rules vary by lender. And collection charges are usually steep. 
 ''The good news on the federal loan side is that there are a lot of options for borrowers, particularly those who are in shorter-term financial trouble now,'' said Deanne Loonin, director of the National Consumer Law Center's Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project. ''The private loan side is where we don't have or are unable to give a lot of general information because there just aren't as many rights.''
 You first need to figure out what types of loansyou have: federal, private or a combination of both. You can find out by calling the lender, accessing the National Student Loan Data System of federal loans, or FinAid.org's Web site. Below are several options for both loan types.
 Federal Loans 
 Defer or Forbearance All federal loans have a grace period of six months after graduation. But an unemployment or economic hardship deferment and forbearance can each buy up to three years, for a total of six years of relief. Defermentsare preferred because the government generally pays interest on subsidized federal loans, though you're still responsible for interest on unsubsidized and PLUS loans. With a forbearance, you are responsible for all interest (even on subsidized loans), which is added to the loan balance.
 ''Students may not fully appreciate just how much that increases the size of the loan,'' Mr. Kantrowitz said. ''That's why deferments and forbearances should mainly be used as a method to solve a temporary problem.'' 
 A six-month deferment is reasonable: it would add $345 to the balance of a $10,000 loan with a 6.8 percent interest rate. 
 Extend Term If you have taken a lower-paying job but expect to find a more lucrative one later, you may simply extend your loan's term from, say, 10 to 20 years, though doing that may double your interest costs. You can go back to your original term the next year and there's never a penalty for paying off principal early.
 Alternate Repayment If you have taken a low-paying job and don't expect your salary to jump significantly, experts suggest one of the alternate repayment plans. Starting on July 1, all federal loan borrowers will be able to consider the ''income-based repayment'' program, which limits your monthly payment to 15 percent of discretionary income (or income above 150 percent of the poverty line) and forgives the remainder after 25 years of payments. For government or nonprofit employees, any remaining debt will be forgiven after 10 years. And if you earn less than 150 percent of the poverty level, you won't owe any money -- and it will count as a repayment, said Lauren Asher, acting president of Project on Student Debt. To qualify, your debt needs to be high enough relative to your income.
 The income-contingent repayment plan is a similar program, but the payments are usually a bit higher. 
 There is a major caveat for both plans. If you do find a higher-paying job, and your payments didn't cover all of your interest, those costs are tacked onto the loan amount. 
 For help in figuring out your best options, start by calling your lender. The Education Department's Student Loan Ombudsman can also assist. 
 Private Loans 
 There are fewer options with private loans, and borrowers are generally at the mercy of their lender and the loan contract. 
 Ms. Loonin said that some lenders might offer flexible repayment plans if you've encountered hard times and you're not too far into trouble. Most private loans will also provide forbearances, but with a one-year limit. Many lenders will charge about $50 for each loan for the privilege.
 Private lenders don't have as much power as the federal government to collect, but your credit will be damaged.

HEADLINE: Corporate Bonds Sell (If There's a Safety Net)

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
ARE the credit markets showing some signs of revival?
 At first glance, it appears that the answer is yes, at least for high-quality corporate borrowers. The volume of investment-grade corporate bonds issued in Europe and Asia in the first three months of this year was the highest ever for any quarter, while in the United States the total fell just short of the record. 
 But that glance is deceiving. Corporate bond markets around the world are functioning in large part because of government guarantees. Eight months ago, before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the rescue of the American International Group, the idea of a government-guaranteed corporate bond would have seemed contrary to basic capitalist principles. Now, such bonds account for a substantial share of corporate bond issuance, generally by banks and other financial companies.
 The accompanying charts show the volume of new bond issues and new syndicated bank loans, by quarter, going back to 2005, in the United States, Europe and Asia, as reported by Thomson Reuters. 
 Even without the guarantees by governments, the issuing of corporate bonds did pick up from the low levels of late 2008. But syndicated loans -- loans made by banks and then sold off to other banks and financial institutions -- have shown much less recovery among investment-grade issuers.
 And for riskier borrowers, there is little sign of an ability to borrow. The volume of leveraged loans -- syndicated loans issued to less creditworthy corporate borrowers -- continues to decline around the world. And the high-yield, or junk bond, market has only started to recover in the United States and remains moribund elsewhere.
 It could be seen as a disappointment that the $500 billion in government-guaranteed loans issued around the world in the last half year have not done more to spur bank lending. But the syndicated loan markets continue to suffer because whole classes of buyers have vanished. Such loans were previously packaged into collateralized loan obligations, or C.L.O.'s, which were then sold as securities that could be rated as high quality even though the underlying loans were not. That business has blown up, and, increasingly, banks are making only those loans that they, or other banks, are willing to keep on their own balance sheets.
 In the United States, the total volume of leveraged loans and junk bonds issued over the last six months was $70 billion. That figure is one-tenth the size of the figure for the first six months of 2007, before the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States began to shut down the supply of money for risky loans. The declines are smaller in Europe and Asia, but the volume of risky loans never grew as large in those markets.
 A resumption of functioning corporate credit markets would be a strong indication that the credit crisis was receding. But the fact that the current growth in lending is largely a function of government guarantees shows that the credit markets remain far from healthy, even if they are larger than they were in late 2008, when the panic was most intense. 
 ''Credit markets are materially better, but not normal,'' Bruce Kasman, the chief economist of JPMorgan Chase, said this week at the Hyman P. Minsky conference of the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College.

HEADLINE: Regulators Close 2 Banks, Bringing Total To 25 In '09

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Banks in Missouri and Nevada were seized by regulators, bringing the total of federally insured failed banks to 25. The total equals the number of banks shuttered in all of last year, as the recession drives up unemployment and home foreclosures. American Sterling Bank of Sugar Creek, Mo., and the Great Basin Bank of Nevada in Elko were closed. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was named receiver. 
 Metcalf Bank of Lee's Summit, Mo., will assume deposits of American Sterling and take control of the five branches. Metcalf Bank will buy about $173.6 million of American Sterling's assets, with the F.D.I.C. sharing the losses on $100 million of them. Nevada State Bank of Las Vegas, a unit of Zions Bancorporation, based in Salt Lake City, becomes the owner of Great Basin's five offices and is assuming the bank's deposits. Nevada State Bank is purchasing $252.3 million of Great Basin's assets, and the F.D.I.C. will share in losses on $143.4 million. The combined cost to the agency's insurance fund is estimated to be $84 million.

HEADLINE: Newark's Mayor Backs Bloomberg

 BODY:
If only New Jersey could vote in New York City elections.
 Or so Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg may be wishing, after securing the endorsement on Friday of Cory A. Booker, the high-profile mayor of New Jersey's largest city, Newark. Mr. Booker's endorsement came the day after Jerramiah T. Healy , the mayor of Jersey City, was the guest of honor at a fund-raiser at Mr. Bloomberg's town house on the Upper East Side. 
 Both Mr. Booker and Mr. Healy, who faces re-election on May 12, are Democrats. But both have worked closely with Mr. Bloomberg, an independent who will run on the Republican line in November, on gun control and other issues. Indeed, Mr. Booker appeared at a news conference with Mr. Bloomberg in Harlem on Friday afternoon and paid the New York mayor what he said was his ''highest compliment'': ''He has become truly a great American.''
 In particular, Mr. Booker, who turns 40 on April 27, praised Mr. Bloomberg's record on crime, education and economic development. And he said that Mr. Bloomberg had -- by focusing on pragmatic solutions, not ideological ones -- become a role model for younger mayors like him around the country.
 ''Mayor Bloomberg is simply the model in America,'' Mr. Booker said.

HEADLINE: Chief Named to Oversee Bank Bailout

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Herbert M. Allison Jr., 65, who has been chief executive of Fannie Mae since it was seized by the government in September, has been chosen to oversee the $700 billion financial bailout fund, the White House said Friday. 
 Mr. Allison's nomination is subject to confirmation by the Senate before he can succeed Neel T. Kashkari and become Treasury assistant secretary for financial stability. 
 In that role, Mr. Allison will be charged with overseeing several federal programs meant to improve the availability of credit, aid major automakers and bolster the housing market.
 Mr. Allison was named chief executive of Fannie Mae in September as the housing market soured and pushed the company and its sibling agency, Freddie Mac, to the brink of collapse.
 He had spent more than 25 years with the investment bank Merrill Lynch before becoming chairman and chief executive of the pension fund giant TIAA-CREF.
 After six years as the head of TIAA-CREF, Mr. Allison retired in 2008 and was asked by the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., to become conservator of Fannie Mae, the nation's largest source of housing finance.
 He has told Fannie Mae colleagues that his long experience and personal wealth gave him valuable independence when it came to managing the agency.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Ends Week Higher, Barely

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
For the first time since 2007, Wall Street had six winning weeks in a row.
 Profit at Citigroup and an upbeat turn in consumer confidence numbers bolstered investors' hopes that the worst economic declines were behind, and that the recent stock-market rally had some staying power. Most sectors of the stock market rose slightly on Friday, with financial firms and consumer stocks posting the largest gains.
 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 5.90 points, or 0.07 percent, to 8,131.33, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 4.30 points, or 0.5 percent, higher at 869.60. The Nasdaq gained 2.63 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,673.07. 
 For the week, the S.& P. 500 was 1.5 percent higher, and the Dow gained less than a percentage point.
 Even though manufacturing activity continues to decline and housing prices are falling as employers cut more jobs, the S.& P. 500 is up more than 28 percent from its lows of March 9, when the index slid to its worst point in 12 years.
 Still, many analysts say they expect gains to stall out if investors decide to take their profits, or if the signs of stability in the economy weaken suddenly.
 ''The market has had an enormous run since early March, and it's overbought,'' Nick Kalivas of MF Global said. ''I'm not sure I really want to be a chaser of the market up here.''
 Tentative signs of stability in consumer spending, retail sales and other niches could vanish if unemployment surges beyond expected levels, economists warn. In eight states, at least one in 10 people is now unemployed, the Labor Department reported on Friday. 
 The national unemployment rate is 8.5 percent, and many economists expect it to rise to 10 percent or more by the time the economy begins to grow again. Michigan, the epicenter of the collapsing auto industry, has the highest unemployment rate in the country, at 12.6 percent.
 The new chief executive of General Motors, Fritz Henderson, said on Friday that the carmaker, based in Detroit, was developing a restructuring plan but also preparing for a possible bankruptcy. Shares of G.M. were down about 3 percent.
 At the depths of the bear market, investors began surging back into financial stocks after the beleaguered bank Citigroup hinted that it was finally turning a corner on devastating losses. On Friday, Citi made good on that prediction as it announced its best quarter since 2007.
 The bank reported that in just three months, it had rebounded from heavy losses last year to finish the first quarter of 2009 with $1.6 billion in net income. Citigroup, which has accepted billions in government aid since the financial crisis erupted, said it was pleased with its earnings. 
 Still, investors were skeptical about accounting adjustments that the bank had used to calculate its earnings totals, and whether it still faces big losses on consumer banking or securitization. Shares of Citigroup closed 9 percent lower, at $3.65.
 Bank of America, another big beneficiary of government support, rose 2.5 percent, to $10.60. It is expected to report its first-quarter earnings next week.
 Investors also offered a measured reaction to earnings at General Electric, whose first-quarter profit of 26 cents a share was down 36 percent from the year-earlier period, but beat Wall Street's expectations. G.E.'s stock rose 12 cents, to $12.39.
 After months of bleak economic news, the recent optimism on Wall Street and talk of ''glimmers of hope'' from the Obama administration may be rubbing off on consumers. Consumer confidence in April rose to 61.9, from 57.3 in March, according to a Reuters-University of Michigan survey.
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who has also been pointing to ''tentative signs'' of a slowdown in economic declines, called for a balance between financial innovation and protecting consumers. He had previously called for overhauling financial regulation to prevent another financial collapse.
 Interest rates were higher Friday. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 30/32, to 98 11/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.95 percent, up from 2.83 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Twitters From Texas

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Let us pause to consider Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, and his feelings about seceding from the union.
 This all started during the recent anti-tax protests. You undoubtedly saw the pictures of the demonstrations full of people wearing teabags or tricorner hats who kept comparing themselves to the founding fathers at the Boston Tea Party. True, when it comes to taxation without representation, they were slightly different from colonial New Englanders on the minor point of having representation. But let's not be picky.
 Have you ever noticed that the states where anti-tax sentiment is strongest are frequently the same states that get way more back from the federal government than they send in? Alaska gets $1.84 for every tax dollar it sends to Washington, which is a rate of return even Bernard Madoff never pretended to achieve. Yet there they were in Ketchikan waving ''Taxed Enough Already!'' signs and demanding an end to federal spending. 
 Also, have you noticed how places that pride themselves on being superpatriotic seem to have the most people who want to abandon the country entirely and set up shop on their own? 
 ''What a great crowd,'' Perry twittered, referring to the protesters he addressed in Austin, some of whom were waving American flags and yelling ''Secede!'' 
 Afterward, he told reporters that Texas had come into the union with a unique right ''to leave if we decided to do that.'' This is a beloved piece of state folklore despite its unfortunate drawback of being totally untrue. 
 ''My hope is that America and Washington in particular pays attention,'' Perry continued. ''We've got a great union. There's absolutely no reason to dissolve it. But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people, who knows what may come of that.''
 Later, while Perry was holding another press conference after signing a bill extolling states rights, he repeated the part about this being ''a great union'' but then said that he understood the secessionists' feelings. 
 This is not exactly a ringing endorsement. It's as if your spouse pointedly noted that it's extremely easy to dissolve marriages these days, then added that although he was not currently advocating a divorce, he certainly understood why other people who knew you both might think it was a good idea.
 And what about my country, right or wrong? Weren't there complaints, some from Texan quarters, during the last election that Barack Obama seemed insufficiently up front about his love of country? Isn't threatening to dissolve the union over the stimulus package a little less American than failure to wear a flag pin?
 Remember the time when Michelle Obama said, in a moment she spent an entire campaign trying to take back, that 2008 was the first time she could remember ever feeling really proud of her country? Can you imagine how the conservative base would have reacted if she said that it was the first time she didn't feel like renouncing her citizenship?
 And how, by the way, can you stand at a rally waving the American flag while yelling ''Secede''? It's like an employer handing out ''worker of the week'' certificates to employees who just learned that he was moving the plant to Mexico.
 Can't feel the love.
 Perry, who is the sort of person who calls other guys ''dude,'' used to be a cotton farmer, a group that seems to have a special talent for combining rugged individualism with intransigent demands for government assistance. Even as we speak, the Obama administration budget-cutters are trying to end a longstanding federal practice of paying the costs of storing the entire national cotton crop every year. No other farmers get this kind of special treatment, and I am sure Perry's failure to mention it when he calls for an end to corporate bailouts is a terrible oversight that will be corrected immediately.
 The big mystery here is why the tax-protest crowds were behaving as if the world was coming to an end when all Obama's infant presidency has done is lower taxes for a vast majority of the public. And why people like Perry seem to feel compelled to egg them on. 
 The answer is that what's left of the Republican Party is intent on cutting off the knees of the administration before it actually manages to fulfill any campaign promises on reducing the huge economic gap between the top 5 percent of the country and the rest of the populace. In pursuit of that mission, fortune favors the hysterical and rewards politicians who behave like gerbils that just bit into an electric wire.
 We don't want to blame all Texans for the high jinks in Austin. It's a state full of lovely people, three-fourths of whom, according to a recent Rasmussen Reports poll, have no desire whatsoever to secede from the United States. 
 But Perry really understands how that other quarter feels.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Clears Path to Regulate Heat-Trapping Gases for First Time in the U.S.

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday formally declared carbon dioxide and five other heat-trapping gases to be pollutants that endanger public health and welfare, setting in motion a process that will lead to the regulation of the gases for the first time in the United States.
 The E.P.A. said the science supporting the proposed endangerment finding was ''compelling and overwhelming.'' The ruling initiates a 60-day comment period before any proposals for regulations governing emissions of heat-trapping gases are published. 
 Although the finding had been expected, supporters and critics said its issuance was a significant moment in the debate on global warming. Many Republicans in Congress and industry spokesmen warned that regulation of carbon dioxide emissions would raise energy costs and kill jobs; Democrats and environmental advocates said the decision was long overdue and would bring long-term social and economic benefits.
 The E.P.A. administrator, Lisa P. Jackson, said: ''This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem now and for future generations. Fortunately, it follows President Obama's call for a low-carbon economy and strong leadership in Congress on clean energy and climate legislation.''
 The United States has come under fierce international criticism for trailing other industrialized nations in regulating emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants tied to global warming. With this move and steps by Congress toward a cap-and-trade system to curb heat-trapping gases, the American government can now point to progress as nations begin to write a new international treaty on climate change.
 The European Union already has a system of trading permits for industrial emissions of heat-trapping gases in which polluters can meet limits either by reducing emissions or buying credits from more efficient producers. Europe also has a system for regulating emissions of heat-trapping gases from vehicles. 
 Japan and several other nations have programs limiting tailpipe pollution that are more stringent than the limits expected to be proposed by the E.P.A.
 The E.P.A. announcement did not contain specific targets for reductions of heat-trapping gases or new requirements for energy efficiency in vehicles, power plants or industry. Those will come after a period of comment and rule-making or in any legislation that emerges from Congress.
 Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, said the agency's regulation of heat-trapping gases would be expensive and cumbersome.
 ''The Obama administration's actions today,'' Mr. Bond said, ''will do more to endanger families, farmers and workers with new energy taxes and lost jobs than it does to protect the environment.''
 As the E.P.A. begins the process of regulating the climate-altering substances under the Clean Air Act, Congress is writing wide-ranging energy and climate legislation that would alter, combine with or override the actions taken by the agency. Mr. Obama and Ms. Jackson have said they much prefer that Congress address global warming rather than have the E.P.A. tackle it through administrative action that could be subject to lawsuits.
 When the agency announced its finding, Mr. Obama was en route from Mexico City to Trinidad and Tobago for a meeting of Western Hemisphere nations. The agency made its decision public in a news release and an 133-page explanation of the scientific and legal basis of its proposed finding.
 In 2007, the Supreme Court, in Massachusetts v. E.P.A., ordered the agency to determine whether heat-trapping gases harmed the environment and public health. The case was brought by states and environmental groups to force the E.P.A. to use the Clean Air Act to regulate heat-trapping gases in vehicle emissions.
 Agency scientists were virtually unanimous in determining that those gases caused such harm, but top Bush administration officials suppressed their work and took no action.
 In his first days in office, Mr. Obama promised to review the case and act quickly if the findings were justified. The announcement Friday was the fruit of that review. 
 According to the E.P.A. announcement, the finding was based on rigorous scientific analysis of six gases -- carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride -- that have been widely studied by scientists. The agency said its studies showed that concentrations of the gases were at unprecedented levels as a result of human activity and that it was highly likely that those elevated levels were responsible for an increase in average temperatures and other climate changes.
 Among the ill effects of rising atmospheric concentrations of the gases, the agency found, were increased drought, more heavy downpours and flooding, more frequent and intense heat waves and wildfires, a steeper rise in sea levels and harm to water resources, agriculture, wildlife and ecosystems. 
 Environmental advocates applauded the decision, which they had sought for years.
 Auto companies, utilities and others tied to polluting emissions had long dreaded this day but generally reacted with caution because the regulatory process had just begun and they hoped to address their concerns in the legislation before Congress.
 The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said its members were developing cars and trucks to meet the expected tougher emissions standards.

HEADLINE: Mr. Obama and the Neighborhood

 BODY:
President Obama wisely began trying to improve the United States' extremely sour relations with Latin America this week. He slightly eased the counterproductive embargo on Cuba, and in a visit to Mexico, he vowed to help confront the drug cartels. He also promised leaders at a regional summit a ''new day'' of practical cooperation in place of former President George W. Bush's ideologically constricted policies. 
 Mr. Obama tackled the most neuralgic issue in hemispheric relations when he abandoned longstanding restrictions on the ability of Cuban-Americans to visit family members in Cuba and send them money. Cuba's people have paid a high enough price for nearly three decades of repression and isolation imposed on them by Fidel Castro and his cronies. 
 Mr. Obama also allowed telecommunications companies to pursue licensing agreements in Cuba. Such deals are needed to pierce the wall of silence at the heart of the Cuban system by expanding access to cellphones and satellite television.
 But these steps do not go far enough. We believe the economic embargo should be completely lifted. 
 President Raul Castro responded to Mr. Obama's overtures with a call for talks about ''everything.'' We hope the administration follows up and that Mr. Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton continue to insist that Havana reciprocate by freeing political prisoners and respecting human rights.
 Mr. Obama made a welcome commitment to help President Felipe Calderon of Mexico combat drug trafficking, which has caused a surge of attacks on both sides of the border. He acknowledged that America's demand for illegal drugs fueled the trade and that its inability to stop the flow of weapons south fed the violence. 
 But he fell short on what's required to fix the problem. During the 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama backed renewal of an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. On Thursday, it was discouraging to hear him suggest that that would be politically impossible now because of opposition from the gun lobby. If he's that timid, we do not see how he will fulfill his promise to Mr. Calderon to urge the Senate to ratify a long-stalled treaty aimed at curbing illegal arms trafficking.
 The Bush administration left so much turmoil and resentment around the world that Mr. Obama might have been tempted to defer dealing with Latin America. We are encouraged that he seems prepared to take on the full plate of issues, including trade, immigration reform, economic recovery, poverty and climate change.
 Whether Mr. Obama will win over Washington's fiercest critics, like President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, is unclear; the two men raised eyebrows on Friday by greeting each other warmly. But we suspect most Latin Americans will be willing to give him a chance. His challenge will be to stay seriously engaged -- and to advance an even more effective agenda.

HEADLINE: G.E.'s First-Quarter Net Tops Analysts' Estimates

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The industrial conglomerate General Electric held up reasonably well in a difficult first quarter, with its industrial businesses showing slight gains in profit and its struggling finance unit staying in the black.
 G.E. sits astride both the industrial manufacturing and finance sectors, so it probably has as broad a lens on the state of the global business environment as any company. In a conference call, G.E. executives offered an overview of a continuing downturn, but one in which some signs of stability were beginning to emerge.
 Capital markets, they said, are improving, industrial orders are down but not collapsing, and $2 trillion worth of stimulus spending announced by governments worldwide promises to bolster demand for industrial and consumer goods. Things are bad, but manageably so, they said, not in free fall, as many feared a few months ago. 
 G.E.'s first-quarter results ''demonstrated that we're navigating through the recession,'' said Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive. 
 The company's profit fell sharply in the quarter from a year earlier, down 36 percent, to $2.74 billion. Still, G.E's earnings of 26 cents a share surpassed the expectations of Wall Street analysts, polled by Thomson Reuters, of 21 cents a share. 
 G.E.'s revenue for the quarter fell 9 percent, to $38.4 billion. That was more than $1 billion below Wall Street forecasts. But nearly all the shortfall was accounted for by the drop in revenue from GE Capital, the company's big finance arm, which G.E.'s management wants to trim as a share of companywide business. Much of the decline in its revenue was attributable to the strength of the dollar, as funds in foreign currencies are worth less when translated to dollars.
 Shares of in G.E., which is based in Fairfield, Conn., rose 12 cents, to $12.39.
 GE Capital's businesses range from financing aircraft engines and power generators to private-label store credit cards and home mortgages in Britain. Its shaky outlook in the economic downtown is the reason G.E. recently lost its triple-A credit rating and sought additional outside financing, including from the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett.
 G.E.'s management is no longer providing detailed quarterly guidance. And at an analysts' meeting last month, executives said only that they expected GE Capital to post a profit for the first quarter and for the year.
 GE Capital did report an operating profit of $1.1 billion in the first quarter, a decline of 58 percent, and a figure lifted by one-time tax credits. The percentage of borrowers delinquent on payments and bad debts will rise as the year goes on, noted Keith Sherin, G.E.'s chief financial officer. 
 But Mr. Sherin said GE Capital had ample long-term funding, sharply reduced its dependence on short-term commercial paper and further trimmed its conservative leverage ratio -- debts to underlying capital -- to 6 to 1, from 7.1 to 1 a year ago. 
 The performance of GE Capital, analysts say, was reassuring, under the circumstances. ''The losses are going to get worse, but it's not out of control,'' said Richard Tortoriello, an analyst at Standard & Poor's. ''It's not hemorrhaging.''
 Yet some analysts do question whether GE Capital has set aside reserves enough to account for future loan losses. It has increased its reserve coverage to 1.6 percent of loans outstanding, but that is below the reserves of large banks, which hold 3 to 4 percent. 
 G.E. contends that its loan portfolio as a whole is different from the lending profile of most banks, and less risky.
 In G.E.'s big industrial business, orders were down 10 percent in the quarter. But some of the businesses reported solid growth in profits. The energy business, ranging from power turbines to oil and gas equipment, had a 19 percent increase in earnings.
 The aviation business, largely commercial and military aircraft engines, posted a 39 percent increase in profits. The health care unit, especially sales of medical imaging equipment, was weak, with earnings down 22 percent. And profits also declined, by 15 percent, in the transportation business, which includes railroad locomotives.
 ''The industrial side of the company looks solid, but the strength is all in aviation, energy and oil and gas,'' said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
 G.E.'s industrial business, Mr. Winoker noted, is buffered from the cycles of big-ticket equipment orders by its services business, which involves maintaining, repairing and upgrading industrial products. In fact, Mr. Winoker estimates that services account for 30 percent of the revenue of G.E.'s industrial businesses, and 70 percent of the profits.
 Profits at G.E.'s media and entertainment unit, NBC Universal, fell 45 percent, pulled down by weak advertising for broadcast television and online, and declining attendance at its theme parks.

HEADLINE: OBAMA DECLARES U.S. WILL PURSUE THAW WITH CUBA

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago 

 BODY:
President Obama, seeking to thaw long-frozen relations with Cuba, told a gathering of Western Hemisphere leaders on Friday that ''the United States seeks a new beginning with Cuba,'' and that he was willing to have his administration engage the Castro government on a wide array of issues.
 Mr. Obama's remarks, during the opening ceremony at the Summit of the Americas, are the clearest signal in decades that the United States is willing to change direction in its dealings with Cuba. They capped a dizzying series of developments this week, including surprisingly warm words between Raul Castro, Cuba's leader, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Other leaders here said that in watching Mr. Obama extend his hand to Cuba, they felt they were witnessing a historic shift. And in another twist, Cuba's strongest ally at the summit, President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, no fan of the United States, was photographed at the meeting giving Mr. Obama a hearty handclasp and a broad smile. 
 Cuba is not on the official agenda here; indeed, Cuba, which has been barred from the Organization of American States since 1962, is not even on the guest list. But leaders in the hemisphere have spent months planning to make Cuba an issue here. 
 The White House was well aware that if Mr. Obama did not address it head on, the issue would overwhelm the rest of the summit gathering. This week, the president opened the door to the discussions by abandoning longstanding restrictions on the ability of Cuban-Americans to travel freely to the island and send money to relatives there.
 ''I know there is a longer journey that must be traveled in overcoming decades of mistrust, but there are critical steps we can take toward a new day,'' Mr. Obama said, adding that he was ''prepared to have my administration engage with the Cuban government on a wide range of issues -- from human rights, free speech, and democratic reform to drugs, migration, and economic issues.''
 Mr. Obama's message was not entirely new; he has said in the past that he was willing to engage with Cuba. But making a public pledge before leaders of 33 other nations, many of whom he had not yet met, gave his words added heft.
 He came here with the aim of reaching out to leaders in a region that felt ignored by the United States during the Bush years. Just as he campaigned on the theme of change when running for the White House, he made change a theme of his speech here, saying: ''I didn't come here to debate the past. I came here to deal with the future.''
 He said the United States needed to acknowledge long-held suspicions that it has interfered in the affairs of other countries. But, departing from his prepared text, he also said the region's countries needed to cease their own historic demonization of the United States for everything from economic crises to drug violence.
 ''That also means we can't blame the United States for every problem that arises in the hemisphere,'' he said. ''That's part of the bargain. That's the old way, and we need a new way.''
 On Cuba, the president's words were as notable for what he said as for what he did not say. He did not scold or berate the Cuban government for holding political prisoners, as his predecessor, George W. Bush, often did. 
 But he also did not say that he was willing to support Cuba's membership in the Organization of American States, or lift the 47-year-old trade embargo against Cuba, as some hemisphere leaders here want him to do.
 And his press secretary, Robert Gibbs, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on the way here, pointed out that Cuba needed to take concrete action to ''bring greater freedom to the Cuban people.''
 In his speech, Mr. Obama gave a nod toward these issues, although not explicitly.
 ''Let me be clear,'' he said. ''I am not interested in talking for the sake of talking. But I do believe we can move U.S.-Cuban relations in a new direction.''
 The new tone from Washington drew warm praise from leaders like President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina and President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua. Mr. Ortega, who said he felt ashamed that he was participating in the summit meeting without the presence of Cuba, evoked images of the collapse of the Berlin Wall, saying, ''I am convinced that wall will collapse, will come down.''
 Mrs. Kirchner praised Mr. Obama for ''what you did to stabilize the relationship from the absurd restrictions imposed by the Bush administration,'' adding: ''We sincerely believe that we in the Americas have a second opportunity to construct a new relationship. Don't let it slip away.''
 Mr. Obama's speech on Friday night was only the latest in a string of overtures between the countries. On Thursday, Raul Castro, Cuba's president, used unusually conciliatory language in describing the Obama administration's decision to lift restrictions on family travel and remittances.
 ''We are willing to discuss everything, human rights, freedom of press, political prisoners, everything, everything, everything they want to talk about, but as equals, without the smallest shadow cast on our sovereignty, and without the slightest violation of the Cuban people's right to self-determination,'' Mr. Castro said in Venezuela during a meeting of leftist governments meant as a counterpoint to this weekend's summit meeting in Trinidad and Tobago.
 On Friday, Mrs. Clinton responded, saying, ''We welcome his comments, the overture that they represent, and we're taking a very serious look at how we intend to respond.''
 Earlier this week Brazilian officials signaled in Rio de Janeiro that President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, potentially flanked by the Colombian president, Alvaro Uribe, would raise the issue of accepting Cuba into the Organization of American States at the summit meeting. Cuba's ''absence is an anomaly and he is waiting for this situation to be corrected,'' Marco Aurelio Garcia, Mr. da Silva's foreign policy adviser, told reporters.
 On Friday, the secretary general of the O.A.S., Jose Miguel Insulza, said he would call for Cuba to be readmitted. And Mr. Chavez recently said he would refuse to sign the official declaration produced at the summit meeting because Cuba was not invited.
 There are no plans for Mr. Chavez and Mr. Obama to meet privately, but White House officials said before the meeting that the two would participate in at least one small group leaders' meeting, and that Mr. Obama would not spurn any outreach by Mr. Chavez, who frequently referred to Mr. Bush as ''the devil.'' 
 Indeed, Mr. Obama made the first move, officials said, striding across the room to introduce himself to Mr. Chavez as the leaders were lining up to parade into the opening ceremony. As he extended his hand, the Venezuelan government reported, Mr. Chavez told Mr. Obama: ''I greeted Bush with this hand eight years ago. I want to be your friend.''

HEADLINE: Lawmakers May Limit Paper Mills' Windfall

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
Senior lawmakers in Washington said Friday they would look into repealing or limiting an obscure tax provision that is turning into an unintended, billion-dollar windfall for companies that manufacture paper.
 The provision was originally meant to spur the development of alternative fuels, but has instead become an example of the law of unintended consequences. The stocks of paper-making companies have soared in recent weeks because of the money they could receive from what amounts to an accidental Congressional bailout.
 ''This came out of the blue, and some companies have started to claim these payments as hush-hush, magic money,'' said Brian McClay, a paper industry analyst in Montreal. ''In America, probably more than anywhere else, odd things happen to legislation.'' 
 Mr. McClay estimated the potential windfall to the paper industry at $6 billion, though other estimates have been somewhat lower.
 For decades, pulp companies have burned a wood byproduct called black liquor to fuel their plants. Four years ago, Congress passed a tax credit meant to encourage companies to blend some biofuels into fossil fuels like diesel. The paper companies realized they might be able to claim the tax credit by going the other way, blending a little diesel into their black liquor.
 One company, International Paper, said it had already received a $71 million check last month from the Internal Revenue Service for 15 mills over a one-month period. Deutsche Bank analysts have estimated the company could receive as much as $1.27 billion this year.
 A second company, Verso Paper, received $29.7 million for a single mill, Androscoggin Mill, in Jay, Me. 
 The tax provision, which originated in the 2005 transportation bill and provides a tax credit of 50 cents a gallon, was extended two years ago to include nontransportation energy sources. It is set to expire at the end of the year. 
 While legal, the efforts by the paper industry come at a sensitive time. In recent months, the public has expressed outrage over bailouts to private industry. The payments have also infuriated environmental groups, with one advocate, Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, calling the practice ''a scam.''
 In Congress, where the paper industry traditionally has strong backing, the issue has provoked an embarrassed review. Senior staff members of the Senate Finance Committee said Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the chairman, and Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican, were both looking into whether the paper-making industry was eligible for the tax break if it was adding diesel fuel to a renewable fuel. 
 ''Congress never intended that this tax credit would be used in this way to avoid payment of taxes,'' Senator Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat of New Mexico and a senior member of the finance committee, said in an interview. 
 Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, also added to the growing chorus of criticism. ''Bad economic times are no excuse to cheat, and that's the only word for what these companies are doing,'' Mr. Kerry said in a statement. ''The least the government can do is enforce the law and make sure abuse isn't tolerated.'' 
 Wall Street analysts point out that the provision would help an industry facing a particularly tough year. In some cases, the estimated payments would exceed the market value of the companies that would benefit from them.
 ''These credits could provide a much-needed 2009 lifeline for the industry,'' according to a Deutsche Bank report released last month titled ''Liquored Up?'' 
 A spokeswoman for International Paper, Kathleen Bark, said the company had been mixing small amounts of diesel to qualify for the tax credit, but that it displaced ''other fossil fuels that would have been used in the process.'' 
 ''The alternative fuels tax credit supports a sustainable environmental practice that deserves tax treatment similar to that of other renewable energy sources and fuel types,'' she said in a statement.
 The company's shares, which have been battered over the past year, have gained more than 85 percent since early March as investors realized the potential windfall.
 Industry officials acknowledged that some companies were changing fuel blends in some mills to benefit from the tax credit, while some have been using diesel all along.
 ''The practice is driven by and dictated by the particulars of the law,'' said Scott Milburn, a spokesman for the American Forest & Paper Association. ''If you want to create an incentive, it's only fair that it applies to existing good actors as well as to new good actors. To the extent that it's added diesel, it's minimal when compared to the significant renewable energy that is generated and used.''
 Craig J. Liska, vice president for sustainability for Verso Paper, said the company already mixed diesel in one of its four mills, and added diesel to a second one because of the tax credit, which he said would increase the efficiency of boilers and other pollution controls. 
 ''It is kind of a sad situation the way it has been portrayed,'' he said. ''It gives the impression that there is a gaming of the system. The intent of the law was to stimulate interest in increasing the amount of renewable energy used, and that's really what we are trying to do with the resources that come with the tax credit.''
 The tax credit could precipitate a trade dispute, with some Canadian paper companies alleging that it puts them at a competitive disadvantage. More than 100 mills appear to be eligible for the credit, including some in the United States that are owned by Canadian companies.
 ''This is a travesty of what the original legislation intended,'' said Mr. Hershkowitz, of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''What the paper industry has been doing is reduce its reliance on biomass fuels and increase its consumption in fossil fuels in order to rip off the American taxpayer.''

HEADLINE: Companies Reset Goals For Bonuses

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
When executives have a tough time meeting their performance goals, a growing number of companies are moving the goalposts for them.
 Instead of paying bonuses to top executives when revenue or profits rise -- less and less likely in this dark economy -- companies have disclosed plans to offer awards based on other measures of success. A bonus may be more attainable if based, say, on preserving cash flow. 
 Xerox has dropped revenue growth as a factor in determining bonuses for its executives, the company disclosed recently in regulatory filings. The company will rely instead mostly on cash flow and secondarily on earnings per share. 
 ''In this unstable economy it is critical that we focus on cash generation and earnings,'' said Carl Langsenkamp, a Xerox spokesman, in an e-mail message. ''So as the economy shifts, there are times that we reset priorities.''
 Under the old system, which included revenue growth, Xerox's chief executive, Anne M. Mulcahy, got a bonus of $990,000 for 2008, less than half of the $2.2 million she received a year earlier. Other top executives saw similar reductions in their bonus awards, according to Xerox's proxy.
 But changes like these raise concerns among institutional investors who worry that companies may be looking for ways to pay bonuses regardless of performance.
 ''What makes a lot of investors anxious is, not only is it changing, but it could allow for gaming of these incentive programs,'' said Michael McCauley, corporate governance officer at the Florida State Board of Administration, the investment manager for the state's pension plan. ''You just kind of have to do some analysis of why that change was made,'' and whether it is an incentive that benefits investors, he continued. ''Is the actual change a good one?''
 Companies generally point to the economic downturn and argue that this year, missing the kind of performance targets used in the past does not result from poor management. It would be unfair to withhold pay from executives, in this view, because they may be doing a good job while circumstances beyond their control sabotage their efforts. 
 The Barnes Group, a manufacturing and logistics company, said in its latest filings that its bonuses would take into account the working capital of the company and each of its segments, alongside earnings per share.
 ''It was kind of just a way to focus the organization,'' said Brian D. Koppy, director of investor relations and communications at Barnes. ''If you focus on cash in a down environment, that is better for the sustainability of the business in the long run.''
 If the idea had been to make it easier for executives to earn bonuses, Mr. Koppy added, the company could simply have lowered its earnings target.
 Determining how many companies are adjusting the terms of their executive bonus plans is not easy. Sometimes the changes are disclosed in proxies, but not always. A systematic comparison of disclosures in proxies is time-consuming; bonus terms are not always reduced to easily searched charts or tables.
 ''The disclosures we're highlighting were very far and few between in past years,'' said Alexander Cwirko-Godycki, research manager at Equilar, which identified several modified bonus plans for The Times. ''It's safe to say that this crisis environment, whatever you want to call it, is forcing companies to try to make these changes.''
 Perhaps most controversially, some companies adjusted performance goals on the fly in 2008, generally making it easier to earn bonuses. In October, the board of Comsys IT Partners, an information technology consulting company, approved cutting the earnings target that the company had to meet in the last six months of 2008 for its executives to get a bonus.
 The compensation committee at Comsys justified the reduction by bluntly stating that the original 2008 goal ''was unattainable'' for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The company also reduced the size of bonuses that top executives could receive. Filings show that Larry L. Enterline, the company's chief executive, received a bonus of $187,500 for his performance in 2008, down from $562,500 a year earlier. Similar declines were reported for other top executives. 
 Investor relations officials at Comsys did not return calls seeking comment.
 Consultants who specialize in executive pay say that changes to bonus programs are not necessarily against the interests of shareholders, who benefit from keeping and motivating talented managers. Allowing a company to reset performance goals during the year, providing more opportunities to react to the changing economy, may make sense.
 ''There's a feeling that judgment should be used,'' said James F. Reda, founder and managing director of James F. Reda & Associates, a compensation consulting firm. ''That's what we're seeing.''
 One way to ensure that hard-working executives get the bonuses they deserve is to include a relative measure of performance that compares results with those of competitors. That helps mitigate the effects of a declining economy, since all the companies in a particular business would face similar pressures, said Mr. McCauley of the Florida State Board of Administration.
 Using more factors to set bonuses also helps, he said, because rarely does one measure of performance capture everything.
 ''What investors really want to see is that they're stretch goals -- they're not necessarily easily attainable,'' Mr. McCauley said.
 Reasonable people may differ on what best reveals the quality of an executive's work, but putting too much emphasis on investors' returns poses its own risks. Shareholders may not always be best served by strategies to increase earnings at any cost. Remember the pressure to inflate numbers at Enron, way, way back in 2001. 
 Changing business conditions may alter everything from the executive skills needed to the bonus measurements, remarked Brian T. Foley, managing director of Brian Foley & Company, a compensation consulting firm in White Plains, in an e-mail message. ''But the underlying pay-for-actual-performance dynamic still must be clear, significant and readily defensible.''

HEADLINE: Hard-Charging Doctor Adds Perspective to the President's Health Care Team

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel has always liked to shake things up.
 As a high school senior, he did a little experiment in chemistry class to test the explosive potential of hydrogen gas exposed to a match. A flask burst with a bang, sending shards of glass flying around the classroom.
 Since then, Dr. Emanuel has been challenging conventional wisdom, first as a medical student, then as a doctor and an expert on medical ethics. 
 He is at it again as a White House official trying to remake the health care system. 
 Dr. Emanuel is a special adviser to the budget director, Peter R. Orszag. He is also the older brother of Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff. 
 By all accounts, Dr. Emanuel is a powerful force in his own right. In an interview in his cubbyhole of an office, he said he got his job on his own, with no help from his brother. Rahm was ''very conscious of the nepotism thing,'' he said. Still, he is widely perceived as having extra clout because of his brother.
 For two decades, Dr. Emanuel has been writing about how to guarantee health care for all. In White House discussions on health policy, he emphasizes the need to slash co-payments for preventive care and insists that patients should be able to keep their doctors even if they change insurance plans. 
 But some of his proposals, calling for vouchers, a value-added tax and an end to the system of employer-provided insurance, have differed radically from President Obama's.
 Joseph R. Antos, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said, ''These are mighty spicy ideas -- the opposite of what any politician would say unless he was completely intoxicated.''
 Dr. Emanuel brings to the White House a physician's perspective, which was generally missing from the last big effort to overhaul health care in 1993-94. 
 Mr. Orszag, himself keenly committed to health care as an economic issue, ''has given me the opportunity to stick my nose into anything that's health-related,'' Dr. Emanuel said. 
 Like his brother, Dr. Emanuel is hyperkinetic and speaks in staccato bursts. The differences are also notable. Rahm, 49, is a practitioner of bare-knuckle politics. Zeke, 51, earned a Ph.D. in political philosophy while getting an M.D. at Harvard Medical School.
 ''Zeke is the intellectual Emanuel,'' said Amy Gutmann, a political theorist who is president of the University of Pennsylvania.
 Rahm swears and swaggers. His belligerence has been an asset in crushing Republican hopes at the polls and in Congress, where he held a House seat for six years. Zeke's mind, by contrast, is more subtle, and his vocabulary is more academic. 
 Zeke is the oldest of three hard-charging brothers. The youngest, Ari, 48, is a top Hollywood talent agent.
 ''When we came out of college,'' Zeke recalled, ''we had to be in three quarters of the country. We couldn't get anywhere close to each other because of the force fields of our personalities. Now fortunately we are all fairly well established and much more confident of who we are.''
 The divorced father of three daughters age 18, 22 and 25, Dr. Emanuel has an unusual lifestyle.
 ''I don't have a car, don't have a TV, don't have a house,'' he said. ''I do, however, have four cellphones, so go figure.''
 A breast cancer specialist, Dr. Emanuel has built one of the world's leading centers for bioethics, at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. Since 1997, he has been chairman of the bioethics department at the Clinical Center, or research hospital, of the N.I.H.
 In articles written over the last four years and in a book last May, Dr. Emanuel proposed giving every household a voucher to buy insurance. He would gradually phase out Medicare and Medicaid and ''sever the link between employment and health insurance.'' Employers would no longer pay for health care. The whole scheme would be financed with a value-added tax, similar to a sales tax.
 While some of his ideas bear little resemblance to Mr. Obama's, Dr. Emanuel said he fully supported the president's agenda. ''I'm all for my voucher plan,'' he said, ''but I don't think it's on the table now.''
 In one chapter of his 2008 book, ''Healthcare, Guaranteed,'' Dr. Emanuel criticized proposals to require individuals or employers to buy insurance, with government subsidies for those who could not afford it. 
 Democrats in Congress support some variant or combination of such mandates, as does Mr. Obama. But Dr. Emanuel wrote that mandates ''would do little or nothing to reduce high health care costs,'' and he said the subsidies would be ''an administrative monstrosity.''
 A wiry man (5-foot-10, 142 pounds), he has expressed interest in the idea of taxing junk food or banning it from schools to combat obesity. 
 Dr. Emanuel does not apologize for his unorthodox views. ''I've had various episodes where people have not liked what I said and tried to put the thumb screws to me to shut me up,'' he said. 
 A decade ago, when many doctors wanted to legalize euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, Dr. Emanuel opposed it. He challenged a common stereotype of patients expressing interest in euthanasia. In most cases, he found, the patients were not in excruciating pain. They were depressed and did not want to be a burden to their loved ones.
 Many of Dr. Emanuel's passions stem, by his own account, from his childhood. His father, Benjamin, a pediatrician on the North Side of Chicago, provided large amounts of free care and led the fight to get rid of lead paint because of its harmful effects on children. 
 Dr. Emanuel recalled that his father resigned from the American Medical Association because it opposed the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. The association, he says, is now ''a very different organization, very engaged in health care reform in a positive manner.''
 His mother, Marsha, a nurse and a social worker, was active in civil rights and took her children to marches and demonstrations.
 ''Worrying about ethical questions was very much part and parcel of our daily routine,'' Dr. Emanuel said.
 Like his brothers, Dr. Emanuel took ballet lessons as a boy. He endured his share of jokes. The experience, he says, ''hardened us and taught us that if you do something unusual, people will take potshots at you.''
 Dr. Emanuel recently got a black belt in tae kwon do, along with his youngest daughter.
 ''I like the flying kicks,'' he said. But he insists he will use his new skills only as a means of self-discipline or self-defense.

HEADLINE: Ringling Circus To Raise a Tent In Coney Island

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
O.K., the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus already came to town last month with considerable fanfare. Now, it will be arriving yet again, trading a Manhattan arena for a seaside tent in Coney Island. 
 In a news conference on Friday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced that Ringling's touring show -- called the Gold Unit by the circus, but officially titled the Coney Island Boom-a-Ring -- will raise its air-conditioned tent at Surf Avenue and West 21st Street on June 18, for a summer run through Sept. 7. It will be west of the Brooklyn Cyclones' ballpark, on land owned by Taconic Investment Partners.
 ''For the first time, the Greatest Show on Earth is coming to one of the greatest neighborhoods in New York City -- Coney Island,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''It's all part of our program that we're committed to restoring Coney Island's vibrancy.'' 
 The announcement was the latest salvo in a three-ring struggle over the future of Coney Island between the city and the developer Joseph J. Sitt, chief executive of Thor Equities. In 2006, Mr. Sitt sold the parcel of land where the circus will put up its tent to Taconic Investment Partners for $90 million. 
 The city is shepherding a plan for the revival of Coney Island's historic amusement area that would establish a 27-acre entertainment district with 9.4 acres devoted to arcades, freak shows, roller coasters, Ferris wheels and other rides. It would also allow for hotels and 4,500 new apartments. 
 But Mr. Sitt has said that the city's plan is not economically feasible, and in the past put forward his own billion-dollar proposal featuring large stores, tall time-share hotels and a smaller amusement park.
 Mr. Sitt has evicted some perennial entertainment acts, like the Astroland amusement park, but has announced that he would bring in a sideshow, John Strong's Shows, and 25 rides as part of a Festival by the Sea that, he said, would create more than 1,000 jobs. 
 The mayor said that the city worked with Taconic to find the land, which will be provided to Ringling at no charge, though the circus will pay its operational costs. Andrew Brent, a spokesman for the mayor, said the city was not paying Taconic for Ringling's use of the land. 
 Ringling said it had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to ship a 2,300-seat tent from London. Unlike its two other circus shows, which play in cavernous arenas -- the Red Unit, recently at Madison Square Garden and currently in Norfolk, Va., and the Blue Unit, in Fairfax, Va. -- the more intimate 5-year-old Gold Unit is a one-ring show for smaller sites. 
 ''Thanks to the recession, a lot of people may be curtailing their travel plans this summer, and we hope many of them will gravitate to our show,'' said Kenneth Feld, Ringling's owner and producer. 
 He added: ''We are hoping to become a permanent part of the whole Coney Island revitalization. The mayor has a vision for this neighborhood, and we are proud to be part of that vision.'' 
 Mr. Feld said a potential deal with Thor Equities had foundered because Ringling could not get a commitment in time ''to get the tent on the water and bring it over from Europe in containers.''
 In a statement, Mr. Sitt said he was ''thrilled'' that Ringling was coming to Coney Island, saying it would be a complement to his sideshow. He added that ''all stakeholders must work together to put together a long-term, permanent plan to ensure that this is not a one-summer anomaly.''
 But on Friday, the mayor seemed to express more urgency, saying that ''after this season, if we don't get it going, there's probably no way to put it back together,'' referring to the amusement amenities in the neighborhood. He said, though, that the city and Thor Equities were ''not in an impasse at all.'' 
 Although the show will be a first for Ringling in Coney Island, it is not the first time that the company has brought a one-ring tent to New York. After a 20-month, 12-city tour, Mr. Feld took on the Big Apple Circus in Bryant Park with Barnum's Kaleidoscape, a $25 million holiday-season show that folded its tent forever on New Year's Day 2001.
 The more modest Gold Unit travels with seven tigers, seven dachshunds, three elephants and 110 humans -- 29 of whom are performers. It is currently in Amarillo, in the Texas panhandle, and will travel to Coney Island after a stand in Laredo, on the Mexican border.

HEADLINE: The Remaking of 'Pelham One Two Three' and New York, 35 Years Later

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
At precisely 1:23 p.m. on June 14, a No. 6 train is supposed to head downtown from the Pelham Bay Park station in the Bronx. Trains don't usually leave the station at that time, but this one is scheduled to depart on a special timetable to accommodate subway passengers traveling to and from the Puerto Rican Day Parade.
What makes the time especially tantalizing is that two days earlier a new version of ''The Taking of Pelham One Two Three'' is to open in theaters. The film is a remake of a 1974 movie about four subterranean pirates who hijack a subway train -- designated as Pelham 1-2-3 for the time it left its Bronx starting point that afternoon.
As James Sanders wrote in ''Celluloid Skyline,'' his celebrated book about New York in the movies, the drama about a runaway train ''traces for us the parallel paths of movement -- running visibly on the street, and invisibly, below it -- that define modern Manhattan.'' 
The film was based on a book written by Morton Freedgood, under the pen name John Godey, in the final days of the Lindsay administration. The Brooklyn-born author died a few years ago, so it is uncertain what inspired him. But the movie's fictional mayor seemed to combine the persona of Abraham D. Beame, who won the Democratic nomination in 1973, with just a hint of the feisty Edward I. Koch, who withdrew from that race, but would defeat Mr. Beame four years later. (Mr. Koch has said that if he were the subject of a biopic, he originally wanted to be played by Paul Newman, but now favors Leonardo DiCaprio: ''He's thin and good looking and is a good actor, and that's me.'')
Lee Wallace, a Brooklyn-born actor who portrayed the mayor in the 1974 film, recalled the other day that his character ''was ineffectual, a ditz, a kvetch. He was overwhelmed and manipulated by his wife and his deputy.''
A movie reviewer for The New York Times concurred, writing that Mr. Wallace ''makes a pleasing, indecisive slob of a mayor -- aware that he'll be booed by any random crowd.''
In the original film, the hijackers demand $1 million in ransom to free the 18 passengers trapped underground in a single subway car. The sniveling mayor meets his wife, Jessie, played by Doris Roberts, and his deputy, Warren LaSalle, played by Tony Roberts. He ponders how the public will react.
Deputy Mayor LaSalle: ''All right, Al, you've heard from the three wise men. Now what do you say?''
Mayor: ''What are they going to say, Warren?''
LaSalle: '''They...who?''
Mayor: ''Who? Everybody -- the press, the man on the street.''
Mayor's wife: ''He means the voters.''
LaSalle: ''You know what they're going to say. The Times is going to support you. The News is going to knock you. The Post will take both sides at the same time. The rich will support you...but come on, Al, quit stalling!''
Mayor: ''Will you stop bullying everybody, Warren? This is supposed to be a democracy!''
LaSalle: ''Wise up, for Christ's sake, we're trying to run a city, not a damn democracy! ...Al, we've got to pay!''
Mayor: ''Jessie, what do you say?''
Mayor's wife: ''I know a million dollars sounds like a lot of money. But just think what you'll get in return.''
Mayor: ''What?''
Mayor's wife: ''Eighteen sure votes.''
Mayor: ''All right. All right, Warren. Warren, arrange for the payoff!''
New York's celluloid mayors have generally performed worse than the real ones, with the possible exception of Al Pacino in ''City Hall.'' Consider Purnell Pratt in the Marx Brothers' ''A Night at the Opera,'' or David Margulies playing Lenny the mayor in ''Ghostbusters,'' or the cartoonish Rod Steiger in ''January Man.''
New York itself was not doing much better in 1974 -- crime was soaring and the economy was in free fall, a situation that the Lindsay administration hoped to disguise by insisting that the filmmakers use a graffiti-free subway car.
''New York is a mess,'' the Times film critic Vincent Canby conceded back then. ''It's also getting worse all the time.''
Nonetheless, Mr. Canby pronounced ''Pelham One Two Three'' ''a good-humored, often witty suspense melodrama in which the representatives of law and decency triumph without bending the rules.'' He added, though: ''If you have to take any form of public transport to and from the theater where it's playing, you may find its conclusions wildly improbable.''
Thirty-five years later, the city and the subway system are in much better shape. The mayor and the people who run the transit system had no trouble finding a graffiti-free train for the remake. (Still, subway buffs, who ridiculed a television version of ''Pelham One Two Three'' filmed in Toronto and released in 1998, will spot a number of technical improbabilities. Transit officials say subway cars can operate only in tandem, not individually. Also, for security reasons, filming was not allowed in the actual transit command center.)
This time, the city's film office took a precaution that might have seemed pointless in the 1970s: The filmmakers -- who have slightly abbreviated the film title to ''The Taking of Pelham 123'' -- were requested to limit their make-believe gunfire so as not to alarm nearby residents.
And this time, the mayor of New York is being played by James Gandolfini of ''Sopranos'' fame.
''I would think it would be quite different,'' Mr. Wallace, the actor, said. ''I don't know that he would play that kind of buffoon.''
In fact, Mr. Gandolfini plays a Wall Street guy -- echoes of Michael R. Bloomberg (both also share a reputation for being brutally blunt). People who have seen the film describe Mr. Gandolfini as more in command than his 1974 predecessor, but still a victim of his own impatience and overconfidence, which lead to tactical miscalculations.
''We are content-neutral; we would never comment on the portrayals,'' said Katherine Oliver, commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, which cooperated with the filmmakers and is presiding over a record year of film and television production in New York. ''Clearly the Gandolfini character is a different type of character. But, again, this is fiction.''

PERSON: Samuel H. Beer 

HEADLINE: Samuel H. Beer, 97, Authority on British Government

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Samuel H. Beer, a leading American expert on British government and politics who was a longtime professor of government at Harvard and who led the liberal organization Americans for Democratic Action from 1959 to 1962, died April 7 at his home in Washington. He was 97 and lived in Washington and Cambridge, Mass.
The death was confirmed by his wife, Jane K. Brooks. 
For 30 years, Mr. Beer taught ''Western Thought and Institutions,'' a legendary course that combined history, political theory and comparative government, to generations of Harvard undergraduates. In the wider world, he was known for several books on politics and government in Britain and the United States noteworthy for their timeliness and the elegance of their arguments.
In his first book, ''The City of Reason'' (1949), he articulated a liberal political philosophy based on the ideas of Alfred North Whitehead. It was followed by ''Treasury Control'' (1956), a study of how the British government coordinates financial and economic policy, and the highly regarded ''British Politics in the Collectivist Age'' (1965), an inquiry into the conflict between conservative and radical impulses in postwar Britain.
In 1982, as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government gathered steam, he published ''Britain Against Itself: The Political Contradictions of Collectivism.'' He later turned his attention to American political theory in ''To Make a Nation: The Rediscovery of American Federalism'' (1993).
Samuel Hutchison Beer was born in Bucyrus, Ohio, and attended Staunton Military Academy in Staunton, Va., where he played football with Barry Goldwater. After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1932, he attended Balliol College, Oxford, as a Rhodes scholar, earning a first-class degree in history.
In 1935 he married his college sweetheart from Michigan, Roberta Reed, who died in 1987. In addition to his second wife, he is survived by two daughters, Katherine Swingly Beer of Cambridge and Frances Fitzgerald Beer of Toronto; two stepdaughters, Alison Brooks of Washington and Camilla Brooks of Brooklyn; six grandchildren; three stepgrandchildren; and one great-grandchild.
Mr. Beer was a staff member of the Democratic National Committee and an occasional speech writer for Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1935 and 1936. He then worked as a police reporter for The New York Post and a writer for Fortune before returning to Harvard, where he earned a doctorate in political science in 1943.
After serving with an Army artillery unit in World War II and earning a bronze star at Normandy, Mr. Beer, who rose to the rank of captain, was stationed in Germany as part of the allied military government. He began teaching at Harvard in 1946 and retired in 1982.
After retiring, Mr. Beer taught at Boston College and Dartmouth and was a senior scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
A liberal in the old-fashioned sense, he opposed the student rebellion of the late 1960s while at Harvard, arguing that it politicized the classroom, and later testified before the House of Representatives in opposition to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, which he regarded as a politicizing of the process.
As national chairman of Americans for Democratic Action, Mr. Beer applauded what he called ''the big thaw in the Ike Age,'' strongly supported the policies of John F. Kennedy (a friend), and excoriated the alliance of Republicans and conservative Southern Democrats, or Dixiecrats. Its members were, he said, ''determined to misuse the machinery of government to thwart progress in every important area of American life.''
His liberalism came wrapped around a contrarian core. For years, Mr. Beer had no bank account, no telephone, no car and no radio. When a columnist for The New York Post asked him to explain the bank policy, he said, ''I didn't want them to make a dime out of me, so I put my $5 a week in postal savings.''

HEADLINE: The Road to Telemundo

BYLINE: By DON BROWNE. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
I GREW up in the Pine Barrens in southern New Jersey. My family was economically challenged, but it never felt that way. In the woods, every day was an adventure. My dad was a boat builder.
I started a business the summer I was 8. New Jersey was building the Garden State Parkway, and I sold ice-cold sodas to the construction workers. The workers often didn't have the exact change, and because I didn't know how to make change, they would let me keep the whole amount.
As a teenager, I worked construction jobs and had a side job shoveling manure out of chicken coops. I stored it for a year and then sold it as fertilizer. I got paid for removing it, and again when I sold it. I remember shoveling in the summer heat and thinking that life was definitely going to get better. 
I was an overachiever as an athlete but an academic underachiever. In high school, I was selected to attend Boys State, a summer program in which students study government and elect a student governor. The week turned my life around. I became campaign manager for the boy who was elected, and then he appointed me secretary of state. I knew then that I was not going to be defined by anyone.
My high school basketball coach helped me get a scholarship for a year at a New Jersey prep school, which helped me grow up a little more before I attended the University of South Carolina on a football scholarship.
I wanted to be a broadcast journalist. A construction foreman I had worked for referred me to his son, Bill Gillen, an executive at CBS News in New York. I went to visit him and he offered me a job on the spot, but I still had a semester of college left. He told me that I could always finish college, but that I might never get a job offer like this again.
I dropped out of college in 1967 and started in an entry-level newsroom job. (I eventually did finish college.) In 1974, I transferred to CBS News in Atlanta and followed stories including Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign and Elvis Presley's death. I also covered Latin America and was enthralled by the culture. I met my future wife, Maria, a Cuban exile, in Atlanta. She had been my banker.
I left CBS in 1979, when NBC offered me the job of bureau chief for NBC News in Miami. A number of stories came out of Latin America during that time, including the Mariel boatlift out of Cuba and the civil war in El Salvador.
While covering Latin America for NBC, I began advocating for a Spanish language network. In the meantime, I was helping a group of Latino journalists who wanted to create a Spanish-language network, which became Telemundo.
NBC and General Electric bought Telemundo in 2002, and I joined in 2003 and became president in 2005. Bob Wright of G.E. and Jeff Zucker of NBC charged me with transforming the network into a company that produced original content. We've had a challenging five years, but I love to build things and mentor people.
One of the things we've tried to do is integrate products into our story lines in a natural way. You've got to have integrity with your viewer. Recently we included a Chevy Malibu in a telenovela, a limited-run Latino soap opera. General Motors was interested in reaching a certain demographic, so our producer created the demographic for the story. We chose a 20-something lawyer who was a perfect person to drive the car. We created her before a story line was ever written, which is more natural than the usual product placement.
We're No. 2 in the Spanish-language market in the United States, after Univision, but I'm O.K. with that. Having original content allows us to control our destiny. When I ran track, my favorite position was as the No. 2 runner gaining on the No. 1. I could feel the moment when he started hearing my footsteps, and when we approached the final turn, he knew I was right behind him.

THE THOREAU YOU DON'T KNOW
What the Prophet of Environmentalism Really Meant
By Robert Sullivan
354 pp. Collins/HarperCollins Publishers. $25.99.
It's time to pack the old Thoreau -- austere, high-minded, solitary -- in mothballs and break out the new. This new model, as advertised by Robert Sullivan in ''The Thoreau You Don't Know,'' is a wisecracking, subversive, entrepreneurial party boy, as likely to dance a jig and break into song as preach at you, a man who heads into Concord not just to do laundry at Mom's, but to attend dinner parties where he plays his flute before heading back late at night to his cabin. The cabin, and the woods around them, have also undergone substantial renovations: the shack is a parody of the vacation homes of the day, and the neighborhood, far from a pristine wilderness, is Concord's main wood supply, the mid-19th-century equivalent of ''an electric power plant or a gas station,'' where ''the sound of axes chopping was ubiquitous.'' 
In his bid to render his subject relevant, Sullivan, the author of the unconventional nature books ''Rats'' and ''The Meadowlands,'' can sometimes push a little hard, making too many comparisons to ''modern'' life. Thoreau, we are told, is like ''an online blogger''; sheet-music ballads are ''the MP3 downloads of their day''; Thoreau's first book, ''A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers,'' is like ''a reality TV show''; and finally, this doozy: ''To put it in contemporary electronic terms, nature is your hard drive.''
Which raises the question of just whom this book is for. The author admits that the answer isn't ''scholars,'' and if you already know Thoreau, you already know the Thoreau You Don't Know.
Perhaps the book is meant for the many readers who were force-fed Thoreau in sophomore English and came away bored or irritated with the preachy tee/totaler, who find that Thoreau the nature saint has precisely zero to do with their lives -- other than to make them feel a little bad. Sullivan asks those readers to consider what this more complicated, full-bodied and often funny writer has to say to them now, things they perhaps weren't ready to hear back in high school.
One of those things is that nature isn't over there, in Yosemite or Yellowstone, but right here in your day-to-day life. Another is that the idea of thrift, which so often feels grim and, well, just plain un-American, can actually be exciting if it frees us to better spend our time. Sullivan explores the complexity behind the exhortation ''Simplify!'' Thoreau wrote during his own volatile economic times, when farming and local community were giving way to commuting and industrial life, changes that are still coming home to roost.
For Sullivan, a central problem is the dichotomy that Thoreau's reputation helped create: true nature lovers lined up on one wall, and the soiled, cynical rest of us against the other. By keeping Thoreau hermetically sealed in his place, in a pristine museum version of Walden Pond, we also keep us in our own place, separate from so-called nature. Sullivan's Thoreau is a sloppier environmental hero, less prissy and less somber, who reminds us that being in nature is, among other things, fun. He is both rabble-rousing abolitionist and canny entrepreneur, keeping a strict account of his transactions while subscribing to a magazine called Businessman's Assistant.
The book starts slowly but picks up just when Thoreau's life does, with the move to Walden to live what he called ''a hard and emphatic life.'' ''It was a stunt, plainly put,'' Sullivan writes. ''This was a faraway wilderness retreat right on the edge of town.'' Its closeness is the point. As Thoreau put it, ''It is in vain to dream of a wilderness distant from ourselves.'' Sullivan's book is an invitation to embrace a new idea of wildness, as something nearby and commonplace. Seeing Thoreau as a guy who danced a jig might not save the world. But it does allow more of us to join the party.

To read the four newly released memos on prisoner interrogation written by George W. Bush's Justice Department is to take a journey into depravity.

Laura Pappano's book ''Playing With the Boys: Why Separate Is Not Equal in Sports,'' written with Eileen McDonagh, will be published in paperback in June.

 BODY:
There is a panic button. Well, not a button, exactly, but a code that the receptionist at Boston University's Office of Financial Assistance can dial in an emergency from behind the counter.
 ''People get upset a lot, but it's rare that we call the police,'' says Christine W. McGuire, the aid office's plain-talking executive director, who briefly considered a career as a minister. She remembers it happening only twice. In both cases, the agitated students left before the police arrived. More often -- and quite often, she says -- tempers flare and voices rise as students and their parents face numbers different from what they had expected. Or hoped for. 
 Then, says Ms. McGuire, striding across the waiting area and opening the door to a space labeled ''conference room'' that happens to be the size of a supply closet, ''you pull them in here to calm them down, go over the facts.''
 The job of the financial aid office certainly seems tedious, but as the uncorked emotions suggest, the decisions made here shape students' futures. 
 Before plunking down their deposits by May 1, students must decide which college to sign on for or walk away from, or whether to try to bargain for a better package. This year is about picking not the college you want but the one you can afford. For those considering universities like Boston, at $53,110 next year, campus aid -- the money that comes directly from the institution -- may determine whether a college is manageable. Or not.
 Making sense of aid awards is puzzling, to say the least. Awards may vary a lot, even though you have provided each campus the same financial information. Private colleges typically expect families to pay far more than the expected family contribution (E.F.C., in financial aid lingo) would suggest. It's called gapping, because there is, literally, a gap between how much a college costs and how much aid is offered.
 ''Students get frustrated that their award letter doesn't seem to have anything to do with their E.F.C.,'' says Peter Shungu, who helps Boston students navigate the college aid process as an adviser with the nonprofit organization Access. 
 The reason is that every college has its own approach and goals in offering money from its coffers. Aside from a relative handful of elite colleges that admit students regardless of their financial need and then award enough aid to cover it, most colleges are like Boston University, using financial aid -- both need- and merit-based scholarships -- to lure the best students. 
 Ms. McGuire, whose office overlooks the Charles River and Harvard beyond (''It's the only time I get to look down on Harvard,'' she quips, on separate occasions), is blunt about the purpose of B.U. aid: ''It's meant to encourage some and do what we can for others. I don't want to say 'discourage' because we want people to enroll. But we are more encouraging to some.''
 Translation: The strongest students in a pool of applicants (maybe this is your safety school) will probably get more aid than the weakest applicants (maybe this is your reach school). 
 ''We're saying, 'We love you,' '' to those offered the best packages, says Laurie A. Pohl, vice president for enrollment and student affairs. 
 Boston University is a sprawling strip of a city campus befitting its breadth of academic offerings (100 majors) and eclectic range of alumni, from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Howard Stern. Most of its students come from out of state, and only 11 percent are poor enough to qualify for federal Pell grants. Still, nearly half are eligible for financial aid. 
 With its spectacular tuition and fees, B.U. is among the growing ranks of gappers: the university says that, for this year's freshman class, 75 percent of students deemed to have financial need were offered enough to cover it. (The official statistic, 47 percent, is considerably lower because, the school says, not all families took it up on the federal loans or work-study that were part of their award packages.) Last year, B.U.'s average freshman award was $29,650, including loans. 
 Bottom line, Dr. Pohl says, is that ''we're going to meet full need out of the box for our best students who have financial need.'' All told, about 200 students in each incoming class receive scholarships for half the tuition, and about 100 for full tuition, whether they need it or not. 
 Beyond the few getting these coveted scholarships, how does Boston University decide how much ''love'' to shower? 
 B.U. may be need-blind in admissions, but like many colleges, it is not talent-blind in financial aid. When the admissions office accepts a student, the file gets a rating before going to the financial aid office. That rating, Dr. Pohl says, is based on a holistic read of the application: factors like leadership, talent, motivation and personal character are weighed as well as grades and test scores. 
 ''They get a number that is not a calculation,'' she says. ''It is not a tally. It is a label. It could just as easily be colors or letters. What it tells us internally is their relative strength, how competitive they are within our pool.'' With that rating and the office's calculation of ''need'' -- indeed a relative term -- a formula is applied to reflect, as Ms. McGuire puts it, how ''encouraging'' the school will be to an accepted student.
 For a nearly paperless process (students file aid forms online) there is an awful lot of the stuff in Ms. McGuire's office. Her broad wood desk is cluttered with reports, folders and printed projections to help decide how much money she must offer students that B.U. really wants, to get the right number to come.
 Ms. McGuire, who is one of the few who doesn't think the Fafsa (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) is too complicated, says it is not her job to make B.U. affordable to everyone. ''What we are doing is incredibly thoughtful and complex,'' she says, tapping a tower of files on her desk, a financial analysis of what happened with last year's class. ''I don't want families to walk away with the impression these decisions are random, which they sometimes do.''
 For example, last year, Boston University gave $43 million in institutional aid to incoming freshmen. To end up at that figure, it offered $150 million to accepted students (27 percent took the offer). This year, despite a budget deficit for the university and freezes on hiring and new construction projects, the school is offering even more -- $160 million -- with hopes of spending $45 million. Ms. McGuire says the higher aid figure recognizes that more people need help, that B.U. raised tuition by $1,370 (almost 4 percent), and that it will very likely need to offer more aid to get enough students to attend. ''We are assuming not as many people will take the offer in this economy,'' she says. ''We are building that in.''
 Ms. McGuire leans on models and analyses, but clearly this year is different. 
 The financial aid process is tweaked annually, which is why even experienced aid officers attend multiple training sessions before award season. Training this season put new emphasis on family situations that aid officers might not have seen much of in recent years. 
 ''We need to be really aware that we will see parents who have lost jobs. We will see parents who have had foreclosures. We will see parents in bankruptcy. We will see parents whose equity is a negative number and are struggling to meet their monthly obligations.'' That's what Jim Briggs, a professorial-looking C.P.A. with a sense of humor (his spiral handout is titled ''Fun With Taxes'') told Boston University officers at his financial aid training workshops, which he holds for about 25 colleges and universities. 
 Mr. Briggs's message to the officers: Think about the economy when facing confusing financial information. For example, what may look like extra income could be an emergency early withdrawal from an I.R.A. Or in a sample of financial aid humor: ''There are two ways to resolve conflicting information, right? Contact the parents or shred the offending documents. Just kidding. We can't shred.'' At a session near Valentine's Day, foil-covered Nestle Crunch hearts were given as prizes for those who correctly identified codes that must be entered on computer screens when aid officers alter data (Congress grants them ''professional judgment'' to make such changes). 
 The effort at levity, however, can't camouflage the size of the chore. Between mid-February and mid-March they would have to process 13,000 aid applications (15 computer screens' worth of data per student), a reminder made at one session with a large ''30'' drawn in Magic Marker on a flip chart. That's how many files each of the 24 aid officers present would have to review each day. And come May, they would do the same for returning students. 
 So what exactly do they do with the files?
 In their warren of blue-walled cubicles, they are looking at families' incomes, home values, investments, business earnings. Because B.U. gets financial data from two sources -- Fafsa and the College Board's CSS/Financial Aid Profile, a form used by about 300 private colleges and universities -- aid officers must first make sure numbers match up. Often they don't. 
 Because it is colleges' job to administer federal aid, officers at B.U. apply two different analyses to the data, one that reflects eligibility for federal aid and one that reflects eligibility for B.U. aid (some colleges use only the federal formula for both jobs). 
 What's key to know: the federal formula casts a family's finances in the most favorable light to get the most aid, while the College Board's methodology scrutinizes finances more critically. The federal approach, for example, does not consider the value of a family's home or even a family-owned business with less than 100 employees. On the other hand, most private institutions consider home equity, business value and even sibling savings.
 Meredith A. Barnhart, senior assistant in the B.U. financial aid office, working beside a whirring fan on a February afternoon to counteract the solar gain from a bank of windows, reviews the application of a student whose family has a $37,000 annual income and also receives $20,000 a year in Social Security benefits. 
 ''I see right away the mother is a widow,'' says Ms. Barnhart, who notes that the family has $100,000 in savings and a home worth $250,000. While the formula for federal aid considers only the $37,000 income that yields an E.F.C. of about $1,700, B.U. comes up with an institutional E.F.C. of $16,000. That is what the family can afford, according to B.U.
 ''We recognize that their income is very low, but we are really looking at their assets,'' she says, noting that the student has two siblings but none in college. The E.F.C., however, is not the end of the line. After Ms. Barnhart reviews the file and hits the F11 key on her computer, the application is ready to be ''packaged.''
 The packaging -- the specific combination of grants, loans and work-study a student is offered -- is secret. ''It's proprietary how we are putting someone into a box,'' Ms. McGuire says. She does say her office has 13 computer packaging models into which undergraduate aid files are entered. The model applied to a student's application determines what kind and how much financial aid he or she gets.
 This aspect of the process is confusing to families who see two colleges offering vastly different amounts of aid -- and coming up with significantly different family contributions. To see how this disparity happens, look over the shoulder of Julie Wickstrom, associate director of financial aid, sitting at her desk on a March afternoon just days before financial aid awards and acceptances are to be slipped into scarlet B.U. folders -- the ''fat envelopes'' -- and mailed out. The offers were printed this year partly on the old stationery with the B.U. ''meatball'' seal and partly on new stationery with a sleeker rectangular ''brick'' logo (students shouldn't read into this; it's a paper supply matter).
 Ms. Wickstrom reviews the award packaged for a student with 2020 SAT scores, a family income of $22,000, $10,200 in savings and a home the family owns outright worth $225,000. ''I noticed the house was bought in 1991 and I thought, 'Wow, they were able to pay off their home with that income,' '' she says. 
 B.U. is deciding not to consider home value in calculating this family's need, because the income is so low they may not be able to get a home equity loan, especially this year. A policy in place for the past several years limits the amount of home equity counted to twice a family's income. 
 B.U. calculates this student's need at $50,800 (the federal formula puts it at $53,110 -- the full cost of attendance). But this determination doesn't mean the university will come even close to making it affordable. The award: a $17,500 institutional grant, a $5,350 Pell grant (the maximum for the 2009-10 academic year) and $3,250 in other federal grants for needy students for a total of $26,100 in grant money. The university offers the student another $11,000 in work-study and federal loans, but this leaves the family short $16,110, or 73 percent of its annual income.
 ''This student has a lot of financial aid -- $37,000 -- but they still have a big gap,'' says Ms. Wickstrom, who concedes that based on what she knows, the student will probably not enroll. 
 B.U. seems to be making a stronger pitch to get a student with 2350 SATs whose parents are divorced. Ms. Wickstrom says the mother has income of $112,000 and reports $11,000 a year in child support. She has $63,000 of home equity and $18,400 in savings. Typically, B.U. needs detailed information about both parents' finances to consider the aid request, but Ms. Wickstrom says B.U. received a letter ''indicating that there had been some kind of abuse'' and waived the requirement for the father's financial data. 
 The university calculated the family's need at $25,500 and awarded $17,000 in campus grants (family income was too high for federal grants), plus $10,500 in loans and work-study, for an award of $27,500. ''We think it's fabulous because we met their need,'' she says. The numbers mean the family must pay $25,610. Whether the student accepts depends on other offers and how much the student wants to attend.
 This year, more than in the past, colleges are uncertain how their financial aid models will hold up, and families are scrutinizing offers more carefully. Aid awards are not finalized until families have submitted their 2008 federal tax returns. But these days even those figures may not reflect a fair financial state. 
 As Ms. Wickstrom reviewed aid awards last month, she was bracing for a deluge of phone calls and visits, given that people have lost jobs and that assets have lost value (one dad simply noted on his electronic submission ''bad timing on real estate investment,'' by way of explaining why the home he owned had a value of $0).
 Last year, Ms. Wickstrom says, 600 families appealed their aid awards. ''We changed awards on at least half,'' she adds, noting increases ranged from $500 to $2,000. At some colleges, of course -- and particularly this year when more are worried about getting enough students to enroll -- haggling over the financial aid award is practically part of the process. 
 Here, such an approach (even if you keep your temper in check) might be greeted with polite dismissal. ''We don't bargain at all if they say, 'I got $20,000 from N.Y.U., can you match this?' '' Ms. Wickstrom says. ''Our answer is, 'Have you had changes in your circumstances that we didn't know about when you applied?' ''
 That B.U. costs a lot to attend is a fact it doesn't hide. Ms. Wickstrom says some families express frustration that government loans don't cover costs. ''One of the questions we get a lot is, 'Do you expect me to pay out of my pocket?' '' The answer is yes.
 That's why Dr. Pohl, whose very job overseeing both admissions and financial aid is to get people excited about attending, wants families to reflect before they commit. She reaches for a hot half-caff coffee (in a rinsed-out plastic Pepsi bottle, a green effort, she says, and yep, she had the same bottle at a meeting weeks earlier) and says: ''I am a big B.U. fan, and I think there is a lot B.U. offers. But it is not for everybody in terms of academics and being in a big city. And it's not for everybody in terms of cost if it means your family will be destitute if you go here.''

CORRECTION-DATE: April 28, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on April 19 about the inner workings of Boston University's financial aid office referred incorrectly to child support as a factor in the awarding of federal aid. The federal forumla does indeed consider child support, as untaxed income. And an accompanying chart on the costs and rewards for law school graduates in 2008 misstated the median base salary of those from the University of Texas working in the private sector. It was $160,000, not $165,000. The chart also gave an incorrect figure from Stanford Law School for its program's total cost. The cost is about $114,000, not $120,000.

HEADLINE: They'll Work For Education

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN. 
Lisa Belkin writes the Motherlode blog at NYTimes.com.

 BODY:
For 10 hours each week, Anna Rice can be found behind a desk in the hallway of a dorm at Northeastern University in Boston, her books spread in front of her so she can study. Every so often students will approach the desk, and Ms. Rice will ask for ID, and rustle up the vacuum or pool table equipment or DVDs they have come to borrow for the evening. Then she'll go back to her work. For this she receives $10 an hour, up to, in her case, $1,250 a semester, which she uses for groceries and spending money.
 Ms. Rice's job, through the federal work-study program, is one piece of the financial puzzle that college has become, dependent on the government, the economy and, to some extent, the whims and work ethics of each year's crop of teenagers. 
 Time was when work-study meant taking shifts at the campus commons, wearing a paper hat and serving mystery meat and creamed spinach as your classmates shuffled through. But with dining services mostly outsourced, and everything about college life more complex, work-study jobs have come to fill a variety of needs -- beyond the obvious one of putting cash in the pockets of undergraduate and graduate students. Some want to develop a skill, or beef up a resume. Some seek an ''in'' with a certain professor. Ms. Rice's goal was to make as small a dent in study time as possible.
 Work-study lies somewhere between a grant and a loan in the college-aid universe -- the institution promises to make a job available, at a rate of pay that is at or slightly above minimum wage, up to a maximum that depends on other ingredients of your financial aid package. The government pays 75 percent of those wages, and the college pays 25 percent. You don't get the money unless you put in the hours. 
 Right about now, participating institutions are learning how much money they will have to allot (based on a complex formula that includes size of the student body and percentage of students in financial need), and thus how many jobs they can offer for the fall. Students typically have to apply for jobs, a process that is becoming more challenging -- even with stimulus money on the way. 
 Established as part of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, work-study mirrors the economy: demand for the jobs is lower in good times and higher in bad times.
 It was not that long ago that campuses had more jobs than students who were willing to do them. A year ago the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor designated four times as many students to be eligible as there were available jobs, because most students simply never signed on. Reasons for sniffing at self-help aid vary. Some parents don't want their children to work, particularly freshman year, for fear it will interfere with their studies. Some students are in time-intensive majors and can't fit in regular work shifts. Families somehow pony up more money or the students take out loans -- the average award is just $1,500 a year.
 In the last year, the ratio of jobs to students has decreased, says Pam Fowler, the director of financial aid at Michigan, and she expects that trend will continue. ''We are definitely seeing an increase in student acceptance'' of work-study jobs. Ms. Fowler is confident Michigan will be able to offer enough jobs next year for the students who need (and accept) them, but administrators at some small, less-wealthy colleges are not as sure. 
 At Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla., Jose A. Mazorra is hoping that its yearly work-study allotment of $150,000 will last until the school year ends. He is human resources coordinator at Lynn, and this year saw the largest number of students taking the offered positions.
 In Virginia, Danville Community College began turning students away this year. Time was when every student who qualified for financial aid was able to get a $7-an-hour work-study job. But this past fall, the college started ranking students by need, and giving jobs to those at the top of the list. The city of Danville ''has one of the highest unemployment rates in Virginia,'' says Andrea J. Burney, the director of public relations for the 6,300-student college, which means students are unlikely to find work off campus either.
 That is the bind that Justin Callaway, a junior and aspiring entrepreneur at Auburn University in central Alabama, finds himself in. Last year, he qualified for work-study but didn't take the job, opting to start a restaurant delivery business instead. That failed, and this year he was denied work-study in his financial aid package. There were too many students ahead of him, and the jobs ran out. He looked for work in town, but most required 25 or 30 hours a week, and he worried about having sufficient time to study (work-study workweeks tend not to exceed 20 hours). 
 For now he is getting by with the help of his mother, who is widowed and works as an office manager for the Macon County Racing Commission. ''I am lucky enough to have a mother who is able to help me get through everything, and who also taught me some important lessons on living on a little bit of money,'' he says.
 There may be a light at the end of Mr. Callaway's tunnel, in the form of an extra $200 million in stimulus money earmarked for work-study, which could help finance 130,000 students for a year. Whether more jobs are created by the promised funds will depend on a number of factors, including the fact that the minimum wage will increase in July, to $7.25 an hour. An analysis by The Chronicle of Higher Education concludes that ''some of the new money will be absorbed by this increased cost at affected campuses.'' In addition, The Chronicle says, ''even if a college does offer more work-study jobs, it might do so by converting regular on-campus jobs into work-study ones,'' leading to no net increase in available work.
 And should there be an increase in available jobs after all those maybes sort themselves out, it might not be enough. Not for schools like Bellarmine University in Louisville, Ky., where about 40 percent of the 2,600 students are the first generation in their families to go to college, and 100 percent of full-time students receive some aid. Yet only 12 percent of students hold work-study jobs because ''we ran out of funds,'' says Heather H. Boutell, director of financial aid. Bellarmine got about $22,000 for this year. Ms. Boutell thinks any additional allocation will be offset by the increased request for financial aid in the last year. 
 ''We certainly could use more,'' she says, ''as we have many, many more eligible students who would like to work.''
 So what kind of work do students want to do? 
 Chloe Hamrick, a sophomore biology major at Ohio Wesleyan, wanted a real job, not the ''make-work jobs designed to give students something to do that they can get paid for.'' She is a tour guide, a job that, for reasons administrators say they don't really understand, is consistently in great demand. It's brutal on rainy and snowy days. ''Recruitment makes a huge difference in the future of a college, and I wanted to be part of that,'' Ms. Hamrick explains. And she had professional skills to develop. ''Communication, flexibility, diction and enthusiasm are traits tour guides use every day, but they are also traits I will use as a physician.'' 
 Ben Erickson, a mechanical engineering major, is finishing his junior year at Valparaiso University southeast of Chicago. He works 10 hours a week in the lab of a professor who is designing ''a frame-and-mirror-holding apparatus for the concentrator portion of a solar furnace.'' Mr. Erickson is considering a solar-energy focus in graduate school, so this job is a trial run. 
 Amanda Williams, a senior at the University of Michigan, seeks to give back to the community. She has spent four years at a work-study job with America Reads, which employs 200 students on her campus to go into elementary schools and tutor students. She found the position on the campus work-study Web site before she even began her freshman year, and her pay has increased over time, to $11 an hour for mentoring other tutors. Altogether she earns up to $2,200 a year. 
 For a while Ms. Williams worked at the recreation center, sitting in an empty building until 2 a.m., which allowed her to get schoolwork done but was ''not very fulfilling,'' she says.
 For Anna Rice at Northeastern, unfulfilling was more or less what she was looking for. She arrives for her shift and finds maybe ''a stack of posters for me to hang up, and some envelopes to distribute to residents,'' she says. ''I can do these things whenever I want during my shift and do homework the rest of the time.'' A perfect solution, she says, to her shortage of both time and money. 
 She is worried about talk that the work-study program might constrict with the economy. Because at heart, it's about need. ''I really depend on it,'' she says.

HEADLINE: For Architects, Less May Have to Be More

BYLINE: By AMY CORTESE

 BODY:
IN the construction industry, architects are sometimes like the canaries in a coal mine. 
 Architecture firms started seeing signs of slackening demand in early 2008, and, in recent months, as the full force of the recession has hit, many of these firms have had to make deep staff cuts. Some of the biggest reductions have come at high-profile shops like Gehry Partners, which cut half its staff, and Foster + Partners, which shed 25 percent and shuttered some overseas offices. 
 Adding to the woes of big-name architects, many of their most ambitious projects have been shelved, scaled back or abandoned. Gehry's billion-dollar mixed-use developments in Los Angeles and Brooklyn are in limbo, Foster's 118-story Russia Tower in Moscow is on hold, and work on Santiago Calatrava's Twizzlerlike Chicago Spire, which was to be one of the world's tallest buildings, has sputtered. 
 The situation has led some industry watchers to declare an end to the era of celebrity architecture and signature buildings. 
 But it's not just the big guys who are suffering. With financing still tight and developers in retreat, new commissions are scarce for most everyone. The American Institute of Architects, an industry group, reported that its Architectural Billings Index, a monthly measure of design activity, has sunk to record lows for the past five months. The group also projects an 11 percent drop in nonresidential construction spending in 2009. 
 With no relief in sight, architecture firms are having to become more creative to drum up business. To stave off more layoffs, some have instituted pay cuts and furloughs. And, as in past recessions, many firms are looking overseas for projects, and with mixed results. 
 Many firms are competing for jobs they might have eschewed in boom times. ''Architecture firms are more than willing to compromise these days,'' said Roger Kogan, a management consultant and member of the American Institute of Architects' practice management committee. That might include jobs that fall outside architecture's traditional domain, such as facilities management and energy upgrades.
 These days, too, it's not unusual to see some prominent architects like the Gehry and Foster firms competing for less lucrative public projects. A team led by the Tanzanian-born architect David Adjaye edged out competing groups that included Foster and I.M. Pei to design a new $500 million National Museum of African American History and Culture on the mall in Washington. Nearby on the mall, a memorial dedicated to President Dwight D. Eisenhower will soon be constructed. Gehry Partners will design the memorial, which is expected to cost less than $120 million and involve a large degree of landscaping across four acres. 
 The competition can be felt across the field. ''It's ridiculous,'' said Bradford Perkins, the chairman and chief executive of Perkins Eastman in New York. ''Even small projects, where we might have been one of three or four competing, now there are 20 or 30.''
 But certain niches are proving fruitful. Mr. Perkins's firm, which has built many schools and hospitals nationwide, is finding demand for such projects -- which are typically not dependent on bank financing and are driven by pressing needs -- in places like Ecuador, Turkey, the Persian Gulf region and China. Demand for schools, he noted, is driven largely by demographics, and the company is designing schools in countries with fast-growing populations, such as China, Senegal and Tanzania. 
 Harley Ellis Devereaux, based in Detroit, has carved out a successful niche designing forensic crime laboratories. The firm's first such project was a regional crime lab for Los Angeles -- the Hertzberg-Davis Forensic Science Center at California State University, a $102 million facility that opened last year. 
 ''We discovered this was a market that was being underserved,'' said Dennis King, the firm's chief executive. Many facilities, he said, were operating out of ''leftover space in a basement.'' 
 Construction of such labs has experienced something of a boom. ''There's hardly a municipality or state that isn't looking at modernizing or moving out of the basement,'' said Mr. King, who created a separate partnership, Crime Lab Design, to focus on the market. The firm has designed more than two dozen of these labs, and is currently designing a large facility in Kuwait and discussing similar projects elsewhere around the Persian Gulf. 
 Beyond specialty niches, some architecture firms are banking on commissions to refurbish or adapt existing properties, in lieu of new construction. During downturns, building owners might take advantage of vacancies to renovate their properties, for example, or companies that had planned to move to new offices might decide to make do with their current buildings. One potentially hot area is ''adaptive reuse,'' in which new uses are imagined for buildings that have outworn their original purpose or whose premise is no longer viable. (Think of all of those half-finished luxury condominium towers and retail centers.)
 ''There's a great opportunity in the existing building stock,'' said Paul Katz, the president of Kohn, Pedersen, Fox Associates in New York. ''Walk up any avenue in New York,'' Mr. Katz said. ''In five to six years, most of the buildings will be owned by someone else and occupied by very different people. We're about to see a big transformation.'' 
 The firm has had a hand in renovating many prominent structures, including the World Trade Center in Amsterdam, which received a sweeping makeover to unify its disparate buildings; the Museum of Modern Art in New York, which it renovated in conjunction with Taniguchi & Associates of Japan; and 712 Fifth Avenue, a historic building near 57th Street in Manhattan that houses the retailer Henri Bendel; the building got a new facade and an additional 52 stories. 
 ''Some of the most interesting work we've done has been revitalizing and improving existing buildings,'' Mr. Katz said.
 SL Green Realty, one of New York's largest office landlords, has embarked on several redevelopment projects, including a $40 million facelift and a new lobby for 1515 Broadway, designed with input from the building's main tenant, Viacom, according to Edward Piccinich, an executive vice president of SL Green. 
 HLW International, a design firm based in New York, has been approached by owners looking to upgrade their current facilities, said Ted Hammer, managing partner at the firm. ''Smart developers,'' he said, ''are absolutely looking at how to take their underperforming assets and at least get ready for when the economy turns.''

HEADLINE: The Money Hits the Roads (and Bridges and Paths)

BYLINE: By NATE SCHWEBER

DATELINE: SYOSSET 

 BODY:
 FOR more than a year now, Mel Patto has wished that somebody would do something about Jackson Avenue, a street lined with residences and businesses, including his, about a mile from the train station and downtown.
 ''There's a lot of potholes, puddling, no sidewalks or curbs in parts,'' said Mr. Patto, owner of Mel J. Patto Realtors, a business that has been around since the 1970s and has had its office in Syosset for three years. ''It just needs to be cleaned up.''
 Jackson Avenue is one of numerous roads on Long Island that is scheduled to be repaired either directly through federal stimulus money or indirectly through money freed by the federal funds for other projects, Nassau and Suffolk County officials said. 
 In all, the two counties are set to receive more than $150 million in federal funds earmarked for transportation under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, according to the office of Gov. David A. Paterson. The bulk of the money will be spent on road repairs and improvements and strengthening bridges. 
 In addition, 13 Long Island municipalities are to receive a total of $24.5 million under federal energy efficiency and conservation block grants to make buildings and vehicles more energy efficient, enhance recycling programs and tap renewable energy sources, the governor's office said.
 Suffolk County has already received $27 million in federal stimulus money this year, said William Hillman, chief engineer for the county's Department of Highways, Structures and Waterways. Most of that money will be used to resurface 18 miles of service roads along the Long Island Expressway, he said.
 Mr. Hillman said he had expected the resurfacing project to be paid for piecemeal with county funds and to take five years. Because the federal money came in a lump sum, he said, the project will take just one year. ''It helps us out tremendously,'' he added.
 Nassau County has already received around $30 million, which will be spent on projects including bridge reinforcement, road improvements, repaving and rehabilitation, and building bicycle and pedestrian paths, said Raymond A. Ribeiro, the county's commissioner of public works. 
 ''The stimulus money enables us to actually now free up county money that will be used on other projects,'' Mr. Ribeiro said. The projects, he said, are mostly repairs on other roads that the county had planned to fix in the future, when it had the money.
 Charles Carrier, a spokesman for the State Department of Transportation, said the federal stimulus money was intended to supplement state funds already budgeted for infrastructure work.
 ''We are adding to what would already be our core effort,'' he said. ''Now we can backfill other projects and accomplish a lot more.''
 Federal stimulus money given separately to the State Department of Transportation will also be used locally on Long Island, including more than $50 million to reconstruct three and a half miles of Route 112 between Pine Road in Coram and Route 347 in Port Jefferson, which more than 20,000 motorists use daily, the governor's office said.
 Steve Levy, the Suffolk County executive, said that while the county would not see an immediate cash infusion in its own budget, he expected that infrastructure improvements paid for with stimulus dollars would benefit businesses in Suffolk in the future, allowing the county to add to its coffers with increased sales tax revenue. 
 ''In the long term, it gets people working, it gets people spending money and it filters down in the form of the sales tax,'' Mr. Levy said. 
 Sales tax revenue has plummeted, adding to a budget shortfall for the next fiscal year projected at $115 million by Suffolk County.
 Charan Anand, owner of Anand Chiropractic in Glen Cove, said that planned road repairs on Cedar Swamp Road there would be good for business eventually, though perhaps not in the short term.
 ''If they're doing construction here, that will make it a lot harder for people to get to me,'' he said. ''But if the roads are smoother, people will be happier driving here.''
 Motorists are not the only ones who stand to benefit: $2.5 million will be spent in Nassau County building bicycle and pedestrian paths in Eisenhower Park. 
 Daniel Neuburger, vice president of Pedal Pushers Online, a group that promotes safer cycling on Long Island, called the investment ''a good start'' to encourage ''safe, healthy outdoor activities that improve our quality of life.''
 Another key element of the stimulus money is job creation, said Erin Duggan, a spokeswoman for the governor's office. She said stimulus funds would create 3,715 jobs on Long Island, most of them in construction.
 The approved stimulus funds will be available for two years, with the majority of the highway money being allocated in the first year, she said. 
 Counties and municipalities that receive the federal money will have three years to get their projects under way or it will revert to the federal government.
 Ms. Duggan said that funds allocated so far represent just ''the tip of the iceberg'' of federal money that will come to Long Island and New York State.
 ''We have many more projects coming,'' she added, ''and there's no doubt New York is going to get the money spent.''

HEADLINE: To Improve the Schools

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Hold the Line on School Reform'' (editorial, April 9):
 All too often the school reform discussion is reduced to ''requiring states to finally publish data on their teacher evaluation systems.'' 
 This has a certain appeal, as it works to fulfill the prospect of putting a highly qualified teacher in every classroom. But it might be more productive to find out what educational processes and methods are successful. This is impossible to achieve under our present Balkanized educational system, where each state and local school board creates its own assessment process.
 Although nationalizing banks is a questionable idea, it is time to nationalize our school system. National exams at various grade levels in the core subjects would give us data that could be useful in assessing which pedagogical processes work and which do not. 
 We should shift the focus away from the quality of teachers to the quality of processes and methods. 
 Larry Hoffner New York, April 9, 2009
 The writer is a high school teacher.
 To the Editor:
 The problem with the stimulus money is not that the guidance accompanying it has too many loopholes. The problem is that the stimulus money does not even begin to address the gaps in education financing that have been widened by the economic crisis. 
 School districts like mine in Stamford, Conn., have been historically underfinanced by the state, so local governments bear the burden of financing most of a school district's budget. There is no federal requirement for local governments to maintain any level of financing, so they are free to slash the budget for public schools. 
 Since the stimulus money is funneled through the same inadequate state formula that deprives local school districts of money, it will be of little help to already struggling schools. 
 We are not as worried about ''preserving the momentum'' as we are of being able to tread water. It is hard to win the race to the top when our schools' ladders are missing so many rungs.
 Wendy Lecker Stamford, Conn., April 9, 2009
 The writer, vice president of the Stamford Parent-Teacher Council, has been a consultant on school finance.

HEADLINE: Guardian of the Fish With the Golden Eggs

BYLINE: By LAUREN PORCARO DORMENT

 BODY:
IN a modern glass laboratory on the roof of the American Museum of Natural History, in the shadow of the red-tiled turrets and green copper domes, a 36-year-old conservation geneticist named Phaedra Doukakis is fighting to save an endangered fish. 
 Dr. Doukakis is on a mission to protect the sturgeon, a fish particularly vulnerable because its eggs are used to make caviar. 
 Her informal manner echoes the way she talks about these fish. She refers to them affectionately as ''these guys'' and laments the fact that they ''got whacked'' by overfishing. But the informality cloaks a depth of knowledge.
 Dr. Doukakis, who alternates between an apartment in Hamilton Heights and a house in Ulster County, has been associated with the museum since 1996. It may be fitting that she is doing this work in the heart of the city that is perhaps the nation's leading consumer of caviar, buying several tons a year.
 The fish that is the focus of her professional endeavors has a special status in the conservation world. Sturgeon, about 25 species of fish from one family, first appeared in the fossil record 200 million years ago and are generally huge: In some species, a sturgeon can live past 100 and grow to 2,000 pounds. To spawn, they swim upstream from seas into rivers; their favorite is the 1,500-mile Ural River, which runs from the Ural Mountains in Russia through Kazakhstan to the Caspian Sea. 
 The lure of illegal caviar drives the black market: At $5,000 to $10,000 per kilo of beluga caviar, one beluga sturgeon could be worth $50,000. 
 In 2007, several Kazakh scientists came to New York and met with Dr. Doukakis and other American biologists in an effort to try to save their sturgeon from the sorry fate the fish met in New York. Two species found in the Hudson River, the Atlantic sturgeon and the short-nosed sturgeon, were once plentiful, perhaps because their meat was unpopular.
 By the 1850s, fishermen were hawking sturgeon meat under the name Albany beef. Enterprising merchants shipped American caviar off to an expanding European market, while New York bartenders offered free caviar sandwiches, hoping that the salty taste would prompt people to drink more alcohol. By 1900, the populations of both species crashed. Still, the demand continued.
 Flash forward a century. In the mid-1990s, Dr. Doukakis, working with Rob DeSalle, a curator at the museum, and Vadim Birstein, a Russian biologist, developed a method of identifying caviar by its DNA sequence. They also designed a market study that involved buying tins of caviar locally and analyzing the DNA to see if the species inside matched the label. 
 They found that a quarter of the caviar sold in New York was mislabeled, with the eggs of endangered species for sale in Manhattan, often unbeknown to both buyer and seller. The study, published in 1998, contributed to the imposition of trade restrictions by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.
 The sale of caviar from the wild beluga sturgeon, which is among the endangered species, is banned in the United States. But because beluga caviar can still be found in stores and online, a decade later, Dr. Doukakis and her colleagues are on the hunt again.
 AT the museum's lab, officially known as the Sackler Institute for Comparative Genomics, Dr. Doukakis is working with Anna Rothschild, a research technician, to replicate the original study, with funding from the Institute for Ocean Conservation Science at Stony Brook. The goal is to determine whether international conservation efforts have reduced the amount of endangered species' caviar sold in New York and online. 
 For the past year, they have been visiting high-end food shops, posing as party planners. 
 ''If anybody asked, we had our story down,'' Ms. Rothschild said. 
 Because Dr. Doukakis is widely known in the caviar world, she uses colleagues' credit cards to buy caviar online. In one of the lab's ultracold freezers sat a box bearing the business address of Ms. Rothschild's father, who works in the music industry.
 After washing the eggs from the caviar samples, Ms. Rothschild breaks them down to DNA strands, which are then read by a laser that identifies the DNA sequence. Using a computer program, she compares the sequence of a new sample with samples in a database.
 Neither woman much likes caviar, but because fraudulent caviar is often poorly processed or spoiled, tasting is part of the job, and not always a pleasant part.
 ''You've had the paddlefish caviar, right?'' Dr. Doukakis asked her technician one day recently as the two women inspected vials of frozen caviar in the lab. ''It just tastes like mud.'' 
 Their report will appear toward the end of the year. While Dr. Doukakis predicts that it will show that New Yorkers are buying less illegal caviar than in the past, over all, the picture for sturgeon grows bleaker, largely because the international black market persists. ''These fish continue to be pummeled,'' Dr. Doukakis said. 
 In the course of her research, she has visited four of the fishing nations on the Caspian Sea -- Russia, Azerbaijan, Iran and Kazakhstan -- and spent three fishing seasons on the Ural River.
 But her work in the city presses on. The other day, Dr. Doukakis sat in the lab at a blond-wood table examining photographs of fishing expeditions on the river. Across Central Park, sunset bronzed the buildings of the East Side. 
 The work can be difficult, she acknowledged. ''But,'' she added, ''I'm pretty convinced I'll end up working on sturgeon for the rest of my life.''

HEADLINE: Going Against the Trend, Nevada Lawmakers Consider Easing the State's Ban on Smoking

BYLINE: By STEVE FRIESS

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
The Nevada Senate voted 16 to 5 on Friday to advance a measure that would soften a statewide smoking ban, putting the state on track to become the first in the nation to ease restrictions it had imposed on cigarette use in public spaces. 
 The Nevada Clean Indoor Air Act, which took effect in 2007, bans smoking in any indoor space where minors may be present and where food is served. The new bill, which now moves to the Assembly for consideration, would allow taverns that offer food to permit smoking if they bar people under 21 from entry.
 Many taverns in Nevada have video poker slot machines that provide a significant source of revenue, but the Nevada Tavern Owners Association said gambling revenue had fallen considerably since they had to stop patrons from smoking. Smokers have decided to gamble at the local casinos instead because the law excluded casino floors from the ban, said Geno Hill, the association president. ''Our members' gaming revenues are off 20 to 30 percent since the ban, and that's before the recession,'' said Mr. Hill, owner of the Rum Runner taverns in Las Vegas.
 Gambling revenues over all have plummeted in Nevada over the past year, down 18.1 percent in February versus February 2008, according to the Nevada Gaming Control Board.
 While a few cities, including Champaign and Urbana, Ill., and Friendship Heights, Md., have repealed smoking bans over the past decade, antismoking advocates said they knew of no statewide restrictions that had been eased or undone.
 The City Council in Atlantic City voted last year to ban smoking in casinos, but it suspended the ban for a year after casinos said business had dropped 10 to 20 percent under it. The New Jersey Legislature is now considering making a ban on smoking in casinos a state law.
 Health advocates dismiss the idea of a link between lost business and smoking bans, insisting that people get used to the prohibitions over time. Twenty-three states ban smoking indoors at bars and restaurants.
 Jennifer Stoll-Hadayia, public health program manager for the Washoe County Health District, which includes the Reno area, predicted that state legislators could face a backlash against the measure as it moved toward passage in the Assembly. More than 54 percent of Nevada voters supported the measure in 2006.
 Senator John Lee, Democrat of Las Vegas, was one of five to oppose the new measure and said it was ironic that within hours of the Senate action, the Assembly passed a bill requiring public hospitals to provide outpatient cancer treatment to the indigent.
 ''One house says it's O.K., if you're over 21, to go ahead and kill yourself and everyone around you -- 'We think that's great, it's your freedom' -- but the other house says, 'Wait a minute, my gosh, if they have cancer we've got to take care of them,' '' said Mr. Lee, a cancer survivor. ''People don't seem to see the connection between the two.''

CORRECTION-DATE: April 26, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about a measure that would soften a smoking ban in Nevada erroneously included a city among ones that have repealed smoking bans. Urbana, Ill., has not done so.

HEADLINE: To Preserve Or to Pave Over History

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: FISHKILL, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 History is what we choose to remember, and there have been many reasons not to remember too much about the Fishkill Encampment and Supply Depot, a sprawling military city that became the most important northern supply center during the Revolutionary War.
 No stirring battle was won there. Life was brutish and often short, a place of smallpox, frostbite and mutiny, where wounded soldiers had limbs sawed off and covered with tar, where, as one contemporary account put it, soldiers ''patched their clothes until patches and clothing both gave out and the garments dropped from their bodies,'' where hundreds, perhaps well over a thousand, were buried in unmarked graves. 
 No grand building was left behind. And over time the lure of commerce and utility -- the Dutchess Mall on one side of Route 9, a Hess gas station and a Mexican cafe on the other, a pump station up the road -- meant more than the hoarse whispers of history.
 It's probably too late for Fishkill to become New York's Valley Forge or Morristown, even though it was in use, not for a winter or two, but for nearly the entire American Revolution, from late 1776 through 1783.
 Still, perhaps a combination of technology and recession, passion and politics will mean that after all these years and more setbacks than successes, what's left of a 70-acre site will find its place in history after all.
 The Fishkill site's story is not entirely lost. Historians have chronicled its place in the revolutionary effort, but it has been described as ''the last of the important Revolutionary War sites yet to be properly explored, studied and preserved.'' It became a place where food, grain, clothes and ammunition were stored in more than 10 buildings, with a prison, a hospital, bakeries, blacksmiths, stables and workshops for the manufacture of almost everything the troops needed. 
 Almost none of it remains, save for the Van Wyck Homestead, an early-18th-century Dutch Colonial house that served as the depot headquarters and now functions as a museum in the shadow of Interstate 84.
 Perhaps because little was left to see, the site's history became disposable, like a skin that had been shed. There was an epic battle in the 1970s over the construction of the mall on a large part of the site, and the development interests won out. In the early '90s, another slice was usurped by the Hess station. The main part that's left now is an eight-acre site on Route 9 between the gas station and Maya Cafe.
 Some critics, local historical society members who formed Fishkill Historical Focus to lobby for the preservation of the site, say the town chose commerce over history. ''So many local people have no idea what they have here because the town has been so intent on covering the entire town in blacktop,'' said Mara Farrell of Fishkill Historical Focus. ''The history is inconvenient.''
 BUT the town supervisor, Joan A. Pagones, said that Fishkill did not have the ability to arbitrarily turn down appropriate development. And some seem to think that what's lost is lost. The latest proposal for the site was for a 50,000-square-foot retail and restaurant center.
 But these days, no one, including the site's developer, Scott Jerutis, expects that to materialize. With the recession, little is being built. And advances in ground-penetrating radar have led to the discovery of more than 100 graves in a corner of the site, and there could be many more. Paving over history is one thing; paving over graves is another. The State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation is encouraging the town to protect the site, saying the opportunity to preserve it is unlikely to come again.
 Ms. Pagones said there was no active development proposal, and she found it hard to imagine one going forward. 
 ''Whatever they try to do there would be really scrutinized,'' she added. 
 Mr. Jerutis suggested that the site could be better preserved as a retail center with interpretive history that would leave the grave sites as green space, but he does not expect that to happen. ''If someone who wants to see it preserved, wants to buy it, they can buy it,'' he said. ''I hear a lot of talk, but no one ever steps up to the plate.''
 Maybe before the next strip center or retail plaza is proposed, someone will. But for now and the foreseeable future, the site figures to sit -- revolutionary ghosts underground, mall across the street, traffic zipping up and down Route 9 -- not a preserved monument, but not a paved-over memory either.

HEADLINE: The Heat Is On

BYLINE: By RANDY COHEN

 BODY:
I'm the proud owner of a new, highly efficient, green condominium. However, this winter I noticed something strange. If I turn off my furnace, my apartment stays warm even in subzero temperatures because of ambient heat coming through the walls and ceiling of my neighbors. Is it ethical to keep the furnace off? It seems a little like stealing to me. T. HOLLISTER, CHICAGO
 You do gain heat from your neighbors, and they gain heat from you: that's efficiency, not theft -- an ecological, economical and ethical advantage that urban apartment dwellers have over the suburbanites in their single-family homes, leaking heat through every outside wall and window and driving around the streets on their riding mowers in a vain search for a decent loaf of bread, a good French film and a bookstore open after 9 o'clock. 
 You and your neighbors virtuously insulate one another's apartments. In an era of global warming, such prudent use of energy is both ethically and economically sound. You would be wrong to surreptitiously cut vents in your walls or drill holes in your floor to siphon off your neighbors' heat. (And they would be wise to install better insulation.) But if you forswear such illicit duct work, you may honorably set your thermostat to the lowest comfortable setting.
 Turning off your furnace entirely might make you feel like a free rider, forcing neighbors to pay for your apartment's warmth, but what can you do? Each unit has its own furnace, so there is no simple way for all tenants to share the cost of heating the building equitably. That's where we New Yorkers have an edge. Here most apartment buildings have one furnace for the entire structure, its cost borne by all tenants. (And we have no icy wind off Lake Michigan. And no Lake Michigan.)
 I am president of a co-op and a member of its sublet committee. We generally deny requests to sublet except as allowed by our rules and can fine owners who violate these rules $1,000 per month. A chance conversation with someone I know professionally, but not well, revealed that he had moved into a banned sublet in our building. If I alert management, the unit's owner will be fined and the tenant most likely evicted. Does my position with the co-op require me to tell? NAME WITHHELD, WASHINGTON
 It does. You should let the acquaintance know that the post you hold in the building compels you to act on this knowledge and suggest that he start looking for a new place. Then explain your awkward position to your committee colleagues and urge them to give this fellow more than the usual amount of time to relocate. That is, find a balance between your duties to the building and your wish not to misuse a professional conversation or wring misery from a chance remark.
 Your role in the building might not explicitly require you to report this. But because you serve on a committee charged with enforcing the rules, it would be unseemly to in effect grant a special exemption to a professional associate.
 The real rascal here is the person who sublet his apartment, and you might understandably resent his getting not a free pass, perhaps, but slower than usual enforcement. But that is a reasonable way to reconcile your conflicting duties, the unlucky consequence of a coincidence unlikely to occur outside a Dickens novel.

HEADLINE: Does This Rally Have Legs?

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM.

 BODY:
AFTER witnessing several promising rallies dissolve since stocks slid into a bear market in October 2007, investors may indeed be skeptical about the latest surge in share prices. 
 Yet, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up 28.5 percent since March 9, this rally could qualify as the start of a new bull market. Whether it has enough staying power to do so, though, will depend on two crucial factors. 
 For starters, the perception of risk in the market must decline significantly, market strategists say. 
 By some measures, the stock market this year has been even more volatile -- and frightening -- than it was at the end of 2008. Consider that on 32 of the 73 trading days so far this year, the S.& P. 500 index has moved by 2 percent or more in either direction.
 ''This has been an extremely emotional market,'' said James B. Stack, editor of the InvesTech Market Analyst, a newsletter based in Whitefish, Mont. ''We need to see some of that volatility subside'' before a sustained rally can ignite. 
 The good news is that it's already starting to happen.
 Even as stock prices have soared of late, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX), the popular gauge of market anxiety, has dropped drastically -- to a reading in the mid-30s, compared with about 52 in early March. 
 In fact, the VIX is now trading below its 200-day moving average for the first time since last September. This is important, some market watchers say, because it shows newfound investor confidence. 
 Still, this rally now has to run a gantlet of tests regarding the second crucial factor: corporate profits. For the rally to be sustainable, earnings must justify the market's growing optimism. After all, when investors buy stocks, they are buying a share of corporate profit growth, too. 
 Yet the short-term forecasts for first-quarter profits are pretty bleak. The consensus among Wall Street analysts is that earnings for companies in the S.& P. 500 will drop 37 percent in the first quarter, versus the period a year ago, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. 
 If first-quarter results come in worse than that, the rally could easily be snuffed out, market watchers say. 
 But noting that the expected decline is already so steep, Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago, said that ''we have a pretty low bar to hurdle.''
 And that bar may be even easier to clear if recent trade figures are accurate, said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. Mr. Paulsen noted that a recent Commerce Department report showed that exports unexpectedly grew by about $2 billion in February, to $126.8 billion. 
 That better-than-expected news, he said, could mean that economists will soon begin revising estimates for first-quarter gross domestic product slightly higher. And if that happens, expectations for first-quarter earnings could move higher as well. 
 ''The earnings reports could still be bad, but it might not be nearly as bad as people thought just a few weeks ago,'' Mr. Paulsen said.
 A case in point: When Wells Fargo recently reported better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter, the Dow Jones industrial average soared nearly 250 points in a single day. 
 An even bigger obstacle for this rally is the earnings outlook for the rest of the year. 
 Remember that earnings are a lagging indicator. Since World War II, stocks have generally started recovering from bear-market lows some eight months before corporate profits stopped falling, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P. 
 Now, most analysts are predicting that profits will continue to slide in the first three quarters of this year, but that they will recover sometime in the final three months. 
 According to Thomson Reuters, Wall Street analysts now think that S.& P. 500 profits will jump 168 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with the same quarter of 2008. 
 Yet this probably isn't realistic. 
 For one thing, that kind of earnings growth would be fueled partly by what analysts predict will be a stunning 707 percent climb in earnings among companies in the consumer discretionary sector, which includes automakers.
 MOREOVER, history shows that it may take awhile before profits make such a comeback. 
 Mr. Stack of InvesTech has studied past recessions, and has found that since the Great Depression, it has typically taken nearly five months after the end of recessions for corporate profits to record their first quarterly gains. 
 Based on this measure, an expected recovery in profits by October would assume that the recession will end next month. Yet few economists are predicting such a rapid recovery. 
 S.& P., for example, is expecting the domestic economy to emerge from recession in the fourth quarter this year. 
 So if this rally is to become a sustainable bull market, investors will not only need to see decent first-quarter results in the coming weeks, but they will also need to hear from companies that the profit outlook for the coming quarters has improved drastically.

HEADLINE: No Country For Close Calls

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER and ANDREW GELMAN.

 BODY:
ELECTION junkies like us can't help but savor the excitement of races where the advantage shifts with nearly every click-refresh of the Board of Elections' Web site. 
 Right now, there's plenty to savor: the courts are still hammering out the Senate race in Minnesota, where Al Franken leads by 312 votes out of nearly three million cast. The special election in the 20th Congressional District in upstate New York, where at one point the candidates were tied at 77,225 votes each, may be headed along the same trajectory. Contests as close as these -- not to mention Florida's electoral adventures in 2000 -- have led to an impression that the margin between Democrats and Republicans is pretty narrow. That is why when Barack Obama defeated John McCain by 7.3 points last November, historically a fairly average margin, the victory was widely hailed as a landslide.
 In truth, these nail-biters have become, at least in elections to the House of Representatives, exceedingly rare. 
 Consider that, in the past decade, there were 2,175 elections to the United States House of Representatives held on Election Days 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008. Among these, there were 41 instances -- about 1.9 percent -- in which the Democratic and Republican candidates each received 49 percent to 51 percent of the vote (our calculations exclude votes cast for minor parties). In the 1990s, by contrast, there were 65 such close elections. And their number increases the further one goes back in time: 88 examples in the 1950s, 108 in the 1930s, 129 in the 1910s. 
 Although ''wave'' elections like 1994 and 2006, in which a relatively high number of incumbents are unseated, can deliver momentarily higher numbers of close contests, the trend has generally been toward less competition. Indeed, it may be precisely because close Congressional races are so atypical that the exceptions get so much attention.
 Why is it that there are fewer close elections than there once were? We can think of three reasons:
 POWERFUL INCUMBENTS The incumbency advantage has generally been increasing over time. A 2002 paper by Stephen Ansolabehere and James M. Snyder Jr. of M.I.T. examined the incumbency advantage in elections since World War II, and found that it had increased from about a two-point head start in the 1940s to eight points in the 1990s. 
 Since there are no term limits for Congress, and since most senators and representatives today are career politicians who won't retire until age or scandal forces them to, this means that elections in the vast majority of states and Congressional districts are never competitive. 
 There are many theories as to why this is the case -- in the television and Internet era, name recognition may be a more powerful advantage. Increasingly, gerrymandered districts may also be helping to protect incumbents, although academic research disagrees on whether gerrymandering is itself a direct cause of declining competition.
 SELF-SORTING VOTERS While America as a whole is becoming more diverse, individual localities are becoming less so, according to ''The Big Sort,'' written by Bill Bishop of The Austin American-Statesman and Robert Cushing of the University of Texas.
 In the 1976 election between Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, only about a quarter of Americans lived in counties that were decided by 20 or more points. But by the 2004 election between George W. Bush and John Kerry, that number had nearly doubled. Mr. Bishop and Mr. Cushing's thesis is that, as the economy has become more virtual, individuals can now choose where to live on an ideological rather than an occupational basis: a liberal computer programmer in Texas can settle in blue Austin, and a conservative one in the ruby-red suburbs of Houston. 
 These effects can be especially acute in Congressional districts, which contain, on average, about 700,000 citizens each, and which can be as small as 10 square miles. 
 INFLEXIBLE PARTIES In theory, the major party candidates in each Congressional district should be able to adapt themselves to their constituents: a Republican Congressional candidate in San Francisco should be very liberal, just not quite as liberal as her Democratic counterpart, whereas a Democrat in the Oklahoma panhandle should be quite conservative, if slightly to the left of his opponent. 
 This sometimes still holds in elections at the state and local levels, where candidates can better divorce themselves from the priorities of national parties -- Wyoming, for instance, has a very moderate Democratic governor, while Vermont has a moderate Republican one. But candidates for national office have become increasingly constrained as Congress has become more partisan.
 Candidates who don't follow the party line may have trouble eliciting support from activists and national campaign committees. Voters, moreover, may have difficulty reconciling the positions the candidate is advancing with their impressions of what it means to be a Democrat or Republican on Capitol Hill. 
 And so Rockefeller Republicans are all but extinct in New England, whereas conservative Democrats have been all but banished from their former stronghold in the South. Gone with them are competitive elections in those districts.
 The good news for fans of competitive elections is that some of these factors could conceivably be changed through acts of Congress. Congressional districts could be drawn along strictly geographic lines, for instance, or campaign finance laws could be reformed to give incumbents less of an advantage. The bad news is that the first instinct of our senators and representatives is self-preservation, and reforms that would threaten the safety of their seats are likely to encounter stiff resistance. 
 In an age when the country remains pretty evenly divided politically, presidential elections will likely continue to be close. But the geographical separation of Democratic and Republican voters, the rigidity of our political parties, and the ability of incumbents to win re-election in all but the most unusual circumstances have made close elections for Congress increasingly rare. Elections like those in New York's 20th district or in Minnesota, as contentious as they are, actually hark back to a less divisive era in American politics.

 BODY:
BELA BORSODI 
 Even in these dour economic times, the Austrian photographer Bela Borsodi remains a commodity devotee with a sense of humor. His still-life portraits, which have appeared in publications like Another Magazine and Italian Glamour, often play up the eroticism that lurks below the surface of, say, a B&B Italia armchair. He once placed a fur hat on the tip of a phallic pink balloon sculpture (far right) and enjoys creating female forms out of luxury accessories. (Another example of his work is at center.) ''Our society is very conscious of the body,'' he says. ''In a way, it is our big fetish.'' Inspired by the idea of ''a nice sunny day at the pool,'' Borsodi shot the best new outdoor furniture for ''Sunny Side Up'' on Page 84. ''Many of the products in my images relate very much to our psyche -- our society, our vanities, our insecurities.'' If that sounds like some armchair philosophizing, Borsodi's aim is actually quite succinct: ''What can an object tell us about a person?''
 TODD EBERLE 
 Of all the thrills that come from being a globe-trotting photographer, house calls are at the top of the list. Just ask the lensman Todd Eberle, who shot Bil Ehrlich's art-filled town house (''Arty Like It's 1973,'' Page 92). ''The house is really something unlike I've ever seen in New York City,'' Eberle says. ''The living room feels like a cathedral,'' with a 1970 Donald Judd stack (similar to the one at center) as the altarpiece, which Eberle illuminated with one of his camera lights -- ''Quite irreverently!'' he says with a laugh. The photographer at large for Vanity Fair, he has shown his images internationally, including in solo exhibitions at the Tate Modern in London and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Eberle splits his time between New York and Connecticut, and has myriad works in progress, including one ''about all the newspapers strewn about the Mall in D.C. after Obama's inauguration.'' Who says print can't be resurrected?
 AMY HENRY
 Having designed sets with slabs of rock and minimalist black-and-white stripes, the New York artist Amy Henry has built a following by plugging into the elemental. For this issue, she created the plaything ''T'' on Page 75 out of the elementary. ''Toys are the first time in our lives when we start to think about the fun of 'going' and travel,'' she says. ''Plus, who doesn't like a big pile of toys?'' Henry happily concedes that when it comes to her oeuvre -- she's created sets for Nylon magazine and the photographer Terry Richardson -- she has some growing up to do. (Two of her sets are at center and far right.) ''I'm looking forward to developing more conceptual sets where design, creativity and humor meet to create a surreal atmosphere.'' But don't think her inner child will sit tight. She's currently toying with ''an idea involving objects suspended in clear plastics.'' 
 WILLIAM SHAW 
 For this issue, the writer William Shaw profiles the aptly named British artist Richard Woods, who transforms ordinary floors and facades into Warholian spectacles of pop colors and cartoonish charms. For ''Against the Grain'' on Page 52, Shaw had plenty of material. ''Richard gave me a bright red floorboard of my own to take home with me,'' he says. Shaw, who edits the Arts & Ecology Web site and blog for the Royal Society for the Arts, thinks his motherland could royally use a Woods makeover. ''I would love to see Buckingham Palace, the ugliest building in London, super-Tudorized,'' he says. Arts & Ecology's next project is also a changing of the guard: putting together some exhibits for ''Radical Nature: Art and Architecture for a Changing Planet, 1969-2009,'' which goes up June 19 at the Barbican Center in London. Mark Dion's ''Mobile Wilderness Unit -- Wolf,'' a piece in the show, is at center. 
 GARY CARD 
 The 27-year-old set designer Gary Card is never afraid to shuffle the deck. He teamed up with the stylist Nicola Formichetti to transform cashmere sweaters into kooky puppets for the Japanese brand Uniqlo (far right) and has done window displays for Stella McCartney. For this issue, Card worked with the photographer Bela Borsodi to capture outdoor furnishings so bright they require a pair of shades (''Sunny Side Up,'' Page 84). ''The most important thing in this story was to convey a sense of sun and water, a feeling of light and breeze,'' he says. (He also admits that he ''ruthlessly stole'' from David Hockney's 1967 masterpiece ''A Bigger Splash,'' center.) Card recently took up welding to create a giant hand sculpture for Adidas's eco-friendly Grun collection. But that's not all he's got up his sleeve. ''I'm working on loads of cool things, actually -- a lot that I'm not allowed to mention.'' ALEX HAWGOOD

HEADLINE: Rising From the Rooftop: The Rock of TriBeCa

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
THOUGH it will be virtually invisible from the street, the boulderlike two-story penthouse proposed for 78-80 Leonard Street in TriBeCa has not gone unscrutinized.
 The structure has been compared to, variously, a rock formation, an origami sculpture and a stone cloud. It has also been called ''hideous.'' 
 ''It's not a conventional proposal,'' said Bruce L. Ehrmann, the co-chairman of the Landmarks Committee for Community Board 1. Late last year the group overwhelmingly -- and unexpectedly -- embraced the addition, which is reminiscent of Ayers Rock in Australia in the way it rises from the rooftop. ''Ten years ago,'' he said, ''it would undoubtedly have been rejected by the community board.'' 
 Just as surprisingly, the Landmarks Preservation Commission also signed off on the addition in early February. 
 It's rare for the commission to approve two-story rooftop additions, said Elisabeth de Bourbon, the commission's spokeswoman.
 ''In fact, the commission found the addition appropriate because of its limited visibility,'' she said. ''One commissioner said the design would recall rooftop bulkheads and some other utilitarian features found on buildings of that type.''
 Henry Smith-Miller, a partner of Smith-Miller & Hawkinson Architects of Manhattan, designed the 9,500-square-foot penthouse to go above two 19th-century cast-iron buildings in TriBeCa's historic district. He said the inspiration for the tin, wire glass and corrugated metal structure was, indeed, utilitarian rooftop structures, as well as the stonework found above the cornice of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 Rather than design an aluminum or glass rooftop bungalow, examples of which dot the rooftops of TriBeCa, Smith-Miller & Hawkinson took a different approach, Mr. Smith-Miller said.
 ''We actually research the architectural history of the place we're working in, and tie our proposals into something that's an intellectual idea about history rather than just replicating it,'' he said.
 Designs for the two-story addition show at least four, and possibly eight, apartments. Constructed of a fine metal mesh, the contemporary design would enable residents to see out through the walls, but outsiders -- mainly those people in neighboring buildings -- would not be able to see in.
 The developer, Second Development Services of Brooklyn, converted 78-80 Leonard Street into 20 rental apartments in 1997. At that time, Louis V. Greco Jr., the head of Second Development, built a one-story recessed rooftop addition, which he combined with the top floor of the buildings to make duplex apartments.
 The new addition would be built on top of that, bringing the buildings to a total of eight stories.
 But that will happen only if the developer finds the $2.2 million to $2.4 million to build the addition. An investor backed out last fall, and the recession is making it difficult to find another, said Barbara J. Resnicow, the company's director of development. 
 ''When the real estate market was better, it looked like a good thing to do,'' she said. ''At the time, we had an investor, and it looked like a profitable project.''
 Owners of rooftop rights can expand if their building is underbuilt, meaning its zoning allows more floor area than it occupies. All that is required is a building permit. But if the building is declared a landmark or is in a landmark district, the Landmarks Preservation Commission must approve the project.
 Being in the TriBeCa East Historic District, the rooftop addition also needed to go before Community Board 1, which gave it unequivocal support over the objections of a handful of board members.
 ''I thought it was out of character with the neighborhood,'' said Paul Sipos, a board member and TriBeCa resident of four decades. ''I find a lot of the architects now, like Frank Gehry and others, are just trying to find ways to be as outlandish as possible.''
 But Mr. Ehrmann, who voted for the rooftop outcropping with the majority, said his decision was influenced by a nearby building, the 1967 Synagogue for the Arts. Designed by the architect William N. Breger, it has a barrel-shaped facade of concrete over a diminutive glass entrance.
 ''That does everything that zoning and landmarks laws try to prevent,'' he said. ''Under the current law, it probably wouldn't have gotten built, and I would not have voted for it. But then you walk down the street and see how brilliant and wonderful it is. That's how I think this rooftop addition will be.''

HEADLINE: Don't Knock It

BYLINE: By PILAR VILADAS

 BODY:
Maybe it's the chill that has descended over the world's economy, but the warmth of wood -- especially plywood -- is looking mighty inviting. Mind you, this isn't a sudden development: wood has been making a comeback in the furniture world for some time. Still, there's something about the simplicity of plywood, and its throwback to Modernist idealism, that suits our craving for plain but honest and elegant furnishings right now. 
 Plywood, a glued and pressed sandwich of thin layers of wood that was first produced industrially in the mid-19th century, was thought of by 20th-century architects and designers as a way to bring Modernism to the masses. Groundbreaking examples included Alvar Aalto's sinuous 1931-2 Paimio chair, with its scroll-like plywood seat, and Charles and Ray Eames's 1945 LCW chair, with its compound-curved, body-friendly seat and back. The LCW employed the same innovative technology that the Eameses used in making plywood splints for the Navy. 
 The material got a more decorative treatment in the 1980s when Knoll produced chairs designed by the postmodern pioneer Robert Venturi, each of which was covered with plastic laminate in a billboard-like representation of a different historical period. A few years later, Knoll sponsored Frank Gehry's investigation into bending thin strips of laminated maple into springy, sculptural chairs. Plywood has also been admired, function aside, for its asceticism. Donald Judd's plywood chairs and tables of the 1980s, masterpieces of minimalism (if not of comfort), became icons of the art-furniture movement. And the British designer Jasper Morrison exploited plywood's modesty by making an entire room out of it -- including the walls and furniture -- for an installation that he created in Berlin in 1988.
 More recently, the young Dutch designer Jeroen Verhoeven did just the opposite, using computer-aided technology to give this industrial material the baroque treatment in his limited-edition Cinderella table, one of which sold at auction last year for $253,000. Technical advances also enabled the industrial designer Konstantin Grcic to mold plywood for his Kanu chair for Cassina as if it were sleek leather. And plywood shows no signs of losing its fascination. Earlier this year, the Cristina Grajales gallery in New York showed a chair by the Chilean designer Sebastian E that is an angular version of the innovative 1930s plywood model by Gerald Summers, another Briton. Eames chairs are still going strong at Design Within Reach, and a snappy, relatively wallet-friendly plywood table, Nick, is available from Blu Dot. For an informed history of plywood in design, pick up a copy of ''Bent Ply,'' by Dung Ngo and Eric Pfeiffer. In a nod to its subject, the book even has plywood covers. PILAR VILADAS

HEADLINE: Authentic French In a Tiny Setting

BYLINE: By PATRICIA BROOKS

 BODY:
IT is always upsetting when a favorite restaurant disappears and the principals behind it vanish from the local dining scene.
 Such was the case when Voila! -- a charming French bistro in Fairfield -- closed a few years ago. But now its two creators, Dominique Arrighi, the chef, and Roger Martin, the maitre d', have resurfaced. 
 At Bon Appetit Cafe, a new, minuscule restaurant in the Stop & Shop Supermarket shopping complex in Wilton, they have been joined by a third partner and second chef, Lionel Arnal. 
 The cafe seats a mere 20 at tables, and 4 more on stools at a counter facing the kitchen work space. Lunch is a crazy time there, boisterous and ear-splitting, mostly because the quarters are so cramped that the sound has nowhere to go. At dinner, at least when I was there, ours was the only occupied table, though several people came in for takeout orders. 
 The food is authentically French and can be very good indeed at both lunch and dinner. The dinner menu is a short one, but several blackboards are chalked with lots of specials. The lunch menu is much larger, with a number of sandwiches, salads and specialties like salade nicoise, croque-monsieur and New York steak au poivre.
 In economically depressed times, there's nothing more soothing than comfort food, especially when it's French. Bon Appetit is rife with old-time Gallic favorites, expertly prepared. French onion soup, a bubbling melange of onions and cheese, was served in a little crock sealed with melted Gruyere and accompanied by slices of a good French baguette.
 The soups in general were flawless and gratifying. The woodsy-fragrant mushroom soup came with several slices of fresh mushrooms on top; the Rhode Island clam chowder had a surfeit of tender clams and vegetables. Petite bouillabaisse, emitting the fragrant aroma of fresh seafood, was served in a crock at lunch with a coverlet of melted Gruyere. A large, entree-size, Marseilles-style bouillabaisse is offered in the evening.
 Another classic, escargots a la bourguignonne, made a pungently delicious starter. The snails were tucked into their appropriate holes in a special escargot dish wearing a grassy cover of chopped parsley sparked with garlic.
 For an entree, I liked the sea scallops honey balsamic -- three monster-huge, perfectly cooked scallops in a slightly sweet, velvety sauce, served with mashed potatoes, half a roasted herbed tomato and snow peas. Just as succulent was the duck leg confit -- two plump, fork-tender legs, along with a roasted tomato half, baby bok choy, a thin slice of baked baby eggplant and a separate timbale of potatoes au gratin. At $22.50 it made a complete and wholesome meal, as do many of the main courses, each of which, I later learned, comes with three vegetables, usually different ones depending on the entree. 
 My only disappointment was a lunchtime quiche Lorraine. It had good flavor and an abundance of ham, but the quiche tasted as if it had been frozen, then micro-waved. The center was firm, not soft and custardy as when freshly made, and the crusty edges were dry. 
 Better lunch choices were the asparagus and shrimp salad in a citrus vinaigrette or the smoked salmon salad with Belgian endive, toasted sunflower seeds and capers with a drizzle of yogurt dressing. 
 Desserts also follow a classic culinary path, whether you choose the super-smooth creme brulee, intensely rich chocolate mousse in raspberry coulis or tarte Tatin (with its caramelized apples and puff pastry crust with a nicely charred edge). An enjoyable croissant pudding was like a raisin-studded bread pudding. Each dessert had a crunchy, paper-thin tuile cookie riding its crest.

ANIMAL SPIRITS
 How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism
 By George A. Akerlof and Robert J. Shiller
 230 pp. Princeton University Press. $24.95
 Look around you, George A. Akerlof and Robert J. Shiller say. The second coming of the Great Depression is, like the original, a direct result of animal spirits. If only we had factored those turbulent emotions into economic theory, we might not be repeating the earlier tragedy.
 Akerlof, a Nobel laureate, and Shiller, a good bet to become one, are prominent mainstream economists. They don't deviate easily from orthodox theory, with its allegiance to the proposition that people are essentially rational, well informed and unemotional in the numerous transactions that shape the economy. But in ''Animal Spirits,'' they have deviated -- and they have done so just as mainstream theory self-destructs. 
 There was nothing rational, well informed or unemotional about the behavior that has all but collapsed the economy. That leaves most of America's economists without a believable framework for explaining how we got into this mess. Akerlof and Shiller are the first to try to rework economic theory for our times. The effort itself makes their book a milestone. 
 Keynes performed a similar service in the 1930s -- mainly by making the point that market economies could suffer long periods of high unemployment and low output unless government stepped in to supply the necessary demand. Barack Obama's $787 billion stimulus program reflects his insight.
 But another aspect of Keynes's thinking did not fare well. He also introduced the world to ''animal spirits,'' coining that phrase to describe a range of emotions, human impulses, enthusiasms and misperceptions that drive economies -- and ultimately unwind them. The economists who interpreted Keynes ''rooted out almost all of the animal spirits -- the noneconomic motives and irrational behaviors -- that lay at the heart of his explanation for the Great Depression,'' Akerlof and Shiller declare.
 Addressing this wrong, the authors attempt to restore animal spirits to economic theory. They do this by drawing on the greater understanding of human psychology that exists today, and which Akerlof and Shiller, along with other economists, have incorporated into the relatively new field of behavioral economics. 
 Until now, behavioral economics has focused mainly on a variety of disparate traits that chip away at the assumption of rationality embedded in mainstream theory. A young person, for example, fails to join a 401(k) plan, even one subsidized by his employer, although if he were rational and fully informed, he would certainly sign up. 
 What Akerlof and Shiller do is to highlight this sort of finding, packaging it with numerous other psychological insights into a half-dozen broad maxims that permanently alter the concept of rational behavior. And their book takes their case not just to economists, but also to the general reader. It is short (176 pages of text) and easy enough for laymen to understand (most of the time).
 Above all, they challenge the reigning free-market ideology of the past 30 years or so, from the rise of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan to the abrupt arrival of the present crisis late last year. That ideology held that markets should operate free of government because they were rational. But if animal spirits influence behavior, then government must play a broad, disciplinary role, and do so permanently.
 Akerlof and Shiller spent five years writing ''Animal Spirits'' and honing that conviction. They are concerned that once we enter a revival, pressure will inevitably build -- just as it did in the late 1970s, more than a generation after the Great Depression -- to give the markets free rein again. Akerlof and Shiller intend their book as an obstacle to that ever happening.
 ''The system of safeguards developed from the experience of the Great Depression has been eroded,'' they write. ''It is therefore necessary for us to renew our understanding of how capitalist economies -- in which people have not only rational economic motives but also all kinds of animal spirits -- really work.'' 
 Both men are old hands at prodding their fellow economists into recognizing exceptions to mainstream theory. Akerlof, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, shared a Nobel Prize in 2001 for his work on ''asymmetric information,'' which means that some parties to a transaction know more about the deal than others, like the used-car salesman who knows more about the shortcomings of the vehicle he is trying to sell than the customer he is pitching. Lemon laws, protecting consumers, grew out of such findings. Akerlof has long believed that in most market situations a government role can improve the outcome. ''Animal Spirits'' brings that view to a high boil. 
 Shiller, a Yale professor, originated the phrase ''irrational exuberance'' before Alan Greenspan made it famous, and in his research he has documented the rise and fall of home prices going back decades, to demonstrate that the latest surge was far and away the greatest in American history. The bubble will burst with very unpleasant results, Shiller warned, well before that actually happened. 
 What are these animal spirits that drive the American economy? Confidence is one. Far from dispassionately weighing and analyzing all the options, people act on the confidence, or overconfidence, that a home they are about to buy will be worth more a year later. Confidence drove up stock prices in the 1920s and again in this decade, far more than corporate balance sheets and pure reason would justify, and now lack of confidence, spreading like a contagious disease, is exacerbating the sell-off. 
 Fairness also shows up as an animal spirit, influencing thousands of decisions in ways that part company with standard theory. Out of a sense of fairness, for example, bosses often pay their employees more than the market demands. ''Considerations of fairness are a major motivator in many economic decisions,'' Akerlof and Shiller write, ''and are related to our sense of confidence and our ability to work effectively together.'' 
 Corruption, too, is an animal spirit. This includes the propensity to produce not just what people really need but what they think they need, like the mortgage-backed securities, ''a modern form of snake oil,'' the authors declare.
 In their list of animal spirits, the two economists pay special attention to the tendency of people to think in terms of narratives or stories. ''High confidence tends to be associated with inspirational stories, stories about new business initiatives, tales of how others are getting rich,'' the authors write. On the other hand, stories about the Great Depression shape our narrative of what is happening now, and our behavior. 
 So what is to be done? Animal spirits are human emotions; they can't be turned off. Unchecked, they drive the economy into misbegotten booms and disastrous busts. Tempered by government, on the other hand, they are a great source of entrepreneurial energy, safely channeled into a healthy capitalism. Keynes came to that conclusion, and Akerlof and Shiller, in ''Animal Spirits,'' push hard in the same direction -- prodding their colleagues to follow their lead in revamping economic theory to deal with a market system that, quite irrationally, failed to govern itself.

HEADLINE: It's 2009. Do You Know Where Your Soul Is?

BYLINE: By BONO. 
Bono, the lead singer of the band U2 and a co-founder of the advocacy group ONE, is a contributing columnist for The Times.

 BODY:
I AM in Midtown Manhattan, where drivers still play their car horns as if they were musical instruments and shouting in restaurants is sport.
 I am a long way from the warm breeze of voices I heard a week ago on Easter Sunday.
 ''Glorify your name,'' the island women sang, as they swayed in a cut sandstone church. I was overwhelmed by a riot of color, an emotional swell that carried me to sea. 
 Christianity, it turns out, has a rhythm -- and it crescendos this time of year. The rumba of Carnival gives way to the slow march of Lent, then to the staccato hymnals of the Easter parade. From revelry to reverie. After 40 days in the desert, sort of ...
 Carnival -- rock stars are good at that.
 ''Carne'' is flesh; ''Carne-val,'' its goodbye party. I've been to many. Brazilians say they've done it longest; they certainly do it best. You can't help but contract the fever. You've got no choice but to join the ravers as they swell up the streets bursting like the banks of a river in a flood of fun set to rhythm. This is a Joy that cannot be conjured. This is life force. This is the heart full and spilling over with gratitude. The choice is yours ...
 It's Lent I've always had issues with. I gave it up ... self-denial is where I come a cropper. My idea of discipline is simple -- hard work -- but of course that's another indulgence.
 Then comes the dying and the living that is Easter.
 It's a transcendent moment for me -- a rebirth I always seem to need. Never more so than a few years ago, when my father died. I recall the embarrassment and relief of hot tears as I knelt in a chapel in a village in France and repented my prodigal nature -- repented for fighting my father for so many years and wasting so many opportunities to know him better. I remember the feeling of ''a peace that passes understanding'' as a load lifted. Of all the Christian festivals, it is the Easter parade that demands the most faith -- pushing you past reverence for creation, through bewilderment at the idea of a virgin birth, and into the far-fetched and far-reaching idea that death is not the end. The cross as crossroads. Whatever your religious or nonreligious views, the chance to begin again is a compelling idea.
 Last Sunday, the choirmaster was jumping out of his skin ... stormy then still, playful then tender, on the most upright of pianos and melodies. He sang his invocations in a beautiful oaken tenor with a freckle-faced boy at his side playing conga and tambourine as if it was a full drum kit. The parish sang to the rafters songs of praise to a God that apparently surrendered His voice to ours.
 I come to lowly church halls and lofty cathedrals for what purpose? I search the Scriptures to what end? To check my head? My heart? No, my soul. For me these meditations are like a plumb line dropped by a master builder -- to see if the walls are straight or crooked. I check my emotional life with music, my intellectual life with writing, but religion is where I soul-search.
 The preacher said, ''What good does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul?'' Hearing this, every one of the pilgrims gathered in the room asked, ''Is it me, Lord?'' In America, in Europe, people are asking, ''Is it us?''
 Well, yes. It is us.
 Carnival is over. Commerce has been overheating markets and climates ... the sooty skies of the industrial revolution have changed scale and location, but now melt ice caps and make the seas boil in the time of technological revolution. Capitalism is on trial; globalization is, once again, in the dock. We used to say that all we wanted for the rest of the world was what we had for ourselves. Then we found out that if every living soul on the planet had a fridge and a house and an S.U.V., we would choke on our own exhaust.
 Lent is upon us whether we asked for it or not. And with it, we hope, comes a chance at redemption. But redemption is not just a spiritual term, it's an economic concept. At the turn of the millennium, the debt cancellation campaign, inspired by the Jewish concept of Jubilee, aimed to give the poorest countries a fresh start. Thirty-four million more children in Africa are now in school in large part because their governments used money freed up by debt relief. This redemption was not an end to economic slavery, but it was a more hopeful beginning for many. And to the many, not the lucky few, is surely where any soul-searching must lead us.
 A few weeks ago I was in Washington when news arrived of proposed cuts to the president's aid budget. People said that it was going to be hard to fulfill promises to those who live in dire circumstances such a long way away when there is so much hardship in the United States. And there is. 
 But I read recently that Americans are taking up public service in greater numbers because they are short on money to give. And, following a successful bipartisan Senate vote, word is that Congress will restore the money that had been cut from the aid budget -- a refusal to abandon those who would pay such a high price for a crisis not of their making. In the roughest of times, people show who they are.
 Your soul.
 So much of the discussion today is about value, not values. Aid well spent can be an example of both, values and value for money. Providing AIDS medication to just under four million people, putting in place modest measures to improve maternal health, eradicating killer pests like malaria and rotoviruses -- all these provide a leg up on the climb to self-sufficiency, all these can help us make friends in a world quick to enmity. It's not alms, it's investment. It's not charity, it's justice.
 Strangely, as we file out of the small stone church into the cruel sun, I think of Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, whose now combined fortune is dedicated to the fight against extreme poverty. Agnostics both, I believe. I think of Nelson Mandela, who has spent his life upholding the rights of others. A spiritual man -- no doubt. Religious? I'm told he would not describe himself that way.
 Not all soul music comes from the church.

HEADLINE: Your Last Chance to Be a Big Spender

BYLINE: By GABRIELLE GLASER

 BODY:
EVEN in these hard times, Peter Moloney, a funeral director, believes that people should have what they want. 
 Although not all of his customers can fully express their wishes, Mr. Moloney and his brothers, who own six funeral homes on Long Island, have worked hard to arrange customized send-offs. And the touches are as varied as the customers themselves. 
 Bike lovers pay an extra $200 or so to take their last ride in a special hearse towed by a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Gardeners select wildflower seed packets to include with their funeral programs. One gentleman wanted to be remembered for comforting his grandchildren with ice cream, so, after the funeral, mourners were greeted by a man in a Good Humor truck, handing out frozen treats.
 ''You have to give people something special,'' says Mr. Moloney, who is 44 and a fourth-generation funeral director. ''If you're not, someone else will be. That means adjusting to what people want today.'' 
 A growing willingness to cater to individual tastes is helping the funeral industry hold its own during the recession. While some people spend an extra $1,000 or more on 14-karat gold mementos, others want less expensive or environmentally friendly options. So funeral homes are renting out coffins as well as Harleys, and some minimize the use of chemicals. 
 Even in a tough economy, of course, people in the funeral business have something that executives in many other industries don't: a guaranteed, and expanding, pool of customers. 
 ''The honest-to-goodness truth of the matter is that everybody does die,'' says Arvin Starrett, a spokesman for the National Funeral Directors Association and the owner of Starrett Funeral Home in Paris, Tex. 
 Revenue in the American funeral industry will grow 1.2 percent this year, to $20.7 billion, estimates Toon van Beeck, a senior industry analyst at IBISWorld, the research firm. That's down from a 2 percent gain last year -- but, hey, it's still growth when companies in other industries are reporting double-digit losses.
 Americans may be living longer than ever, but the reality of a graying nation is stark. The annual death rate of about 2.5 million has been rising about 1 percent a year, and is expected to spike in the early 2020s as older baby boomers reach their mid-70s.
 Nevertheless, the death industry is facing something of an existential crisis. Cremation, which can reduce costs by half or more, is a strong trend. (The average cost of a funeral and traditional burial is about $8,000.) Families are increasingly abandoning traditional religious funerals, which are typically organized by funeral directors, in favor of secular ceremonies they may arrange themselves. Natural burials, which avoid embalming and concrete burial vaults, are more commonly considered than they once were, while a minority of families are bypassing funeral homes altogether to take care of their dead themselves. 
 People in the industry believe that they can continue to prosper by adapting and evolving. But some insiders suggest that the business could be headed for a restructuring as radical as that sweeping through the music or newspaper industries, especially as baby boomers approach their final act.
 The same generation that questioned convention in sex, birth and marriage will probably do the same in death care, says Char Barrett, 48, a funeral director in Seattle and the owner of A Sacred Moment, a business that helps families prepare the bodies of loved ones at home. For a home funeral, she charges $1,450 to $2,595.
 ''It's your funeral, your choice -- and the industry needs to recognize that,'' Ms. Barrett says. ''Or it can stay in the box, and drive itself out of business.''
 A PREFERENCE for cremation is already transforming the funeral industry in the United States. Cremations will account for a projected 38 percent of all deaths this year, compared with 26 percent in 2000, according to the Cremation Association of North America, an industry group based in Chicago. 
 A possible reason for this, says Ron Hast of Tiburon, Calif., a funeral director for 51 years and publisher of Mortuary Management, an industry magazine, is that, in the end, people want simplicity. ''Cremation plays a big part in that,'' he says. 
 As Americans become more mobile, they have moved away from hometowns and from some traditions. So final goodbyes become secular. ''Here in Marin County, the yacht club is church,'' Mr. Hast says.
 Even within churches, shifting preferences and guidance have rewritten funeral rites. In 1963, the Vatican lifted a centuries-old prohibition on cremation, and more Catholics are choosing it. ''Few of us die in the same neighborhoods where we were born, so often when a person dies, there are fewer long-term connections,'' Mr. Goodness says. 
 And if you care a little bit less about ceremony, and are ready to allow your body to go up in smoke, then all of the trappings of traditional funerals matter less as well -- like fancy caskets, says Jerry Sullivan, a second-generation funeral director in Chicago.
 ''Back in the day, families might spend $10,000, $12,000 on a solid African mahogany casket, have an all-out wake and such,'' he says. ''Those days are over.'' 
 Today, many funeral directors offer hardwood or metal rental coffins for a short period before cremation, Mr. Sullivan says. He charges roughly $1,000 to rent a hardwood casket for a daylong viewing; a body is placed in a combustible container of cardboard or soft wood, and inserted into the rental coffin lined with fabric.
 ''We were early adapters,'' says Mr. Sullivan, who has rented coffins since 1976. ''You want to stay alive in this business, you anticipate your customer's needs.'' 
 For those who are budget-minded, but don't want to rent, they can buy coffins at Costco, which offers a selection from $924.99 to $2,999.99. 
 Many funeral directors are compensating for lost revenue as the Moloneys have, by offering new services like video tributes, grief counseling referrals and memorial items including ceremonial urns, keepsake jewelry, wind chimes and sundials that hold a portion of cremated remains. Some are even selling sterling silver or 14-karat gold ''Thumbies'' -- earrings, charms, pendants and cufflinks that are fashioned from the thumbprint of their loved one and can cost $1,000 apiece.
 They pull in profits from the rental business, too. Morticians can recoup the cost of an ornate coffin after a dozen or so rentals, but use it for several years.
 Still, the funeral industry faces competition from a growing number of companies, which, like Costco, are providing goods or services that cater to the cost-saving or environmental concerns of a new generation. 
 Consider Paul Firnstein, a retired advertising executive who moved to Ashland, Ore., from upstate New York in the early 1990s. Members of his small synagogue lacked access to the simple coffins required by Jewish law. So Mr. Firnstein, a carpenter, set about making them himself in kits that families could assemble themselves. Word spread about his business, Ark Wood Caskets, first locally and then, with Internet advertising, nationwide. His coffin kits sell for $599, and fit into a slender cardboard box. 
 ''You can stand the box up in the garage, or put it under the pool table for when the time comes,'' he says. 
 Mr. Firnstein also says he is fielding more calls from families interested in natural burials. Adherents of the movement wrap bodies in simple shrouds or in biodegradable coffins and bury them in woodland cemeteries. 
 Such simple burials are traditional in many faiths, and were long the standard practice in the United States until the Civil War, when the development of modern embalming and the expansion of the train system altered the landscape of death and gave rise to the modern mortuary practice.
 No one keeps statistics on natural burials, but interest is growing, says Mark Harris, author of a 2007 book, ''Grave Matters: A Journey Through the Modern Funeral Industry to a Natural Way of Burial.'' 
 ''It's not just this chic eco-trend for greenies,'' he says. ''It's based on simplicity and thrift, and has broad appeal.'' 
 Since 2005, the Green Burial Council, a nonprofit organization in Santa Fe, N.M., has certified cemeteries and funeral providers that follow certain environmental guidelines. It has a list of 220 funeral homes that identify themselves as willing to handle unembalmed bodies, 17 cemeteries that, among other practices, avoid chemicals, and 14 coffin companies that use nontoxic, biodegradable materials. 
 LAWS vary by state, but it is legal in most states to care for the dead at home. New York is among the few states that require a licensed funeral director or undertaker to handle most death care needs. The online Home Funeral Directory, based in Austin, Tex., shows a list of 41 organizations that help arrange home funerals. Many of these charge fees for conducting home death-care seminars and workshops. 
 Char Barrett, the funeral director in Seattle, spent 25 years in corporate sales and nonprofit management before attending mortuary school. Two years ago, she founded A Sacred Moment and has since assisted with 54 home funerals. She offers Web seminars and workshops that help families prepare bodies at home for burial or cremation, and works closely with others who provide customized merchandise. 
 One of those merchants is Marian Spadone, an artist in Portland, Ore., who designs and makes burial shrouds for her four-year-old company, A Fine Farewell. She says she laughs along when people make wisecracks about her ''burial burritos,'' and even when they call her the ''Death Shroud Lady.'' 
 ''A lot of people think it's weird at first,'' she says. 
 Her shrouds start at $895, can be made to order, and can be used in coffins or to wrap bodies before burial or cremation.
 ''People spend all this time planning how they will decorate their home or have a wedding,'' she says. ''Why wouldn't you do the same when you say goodbye?''

HEADLINE: A Sprawling Place, And the Menu Is, Too

BYLINE: By KARLA COOK

 BODY:
THERE were vacant storefronts along Route 22 nearby, but most of the tables were occupied during a recent Saturday-night visit to Stage House Restaurant and Bar in Union. We had to jockey for a spot at the headwaiter's station in the warren of nooks and dining rooms. That may have something to do with the Bail Out Menu, a collection of two-course meals for $15 that acknowledges the recession. Or it may be attributable to the attitude expressed by Eric Hambrecht, executive chef and co-owner with Tom Britt. 
 ''You've got to stay up with the times and keep on reinventing yourself,'' Mr. Hambrecht said. ''We're competing with so many restaurants -- with Friday's, all the chain restaurants, all the fine dining restaurants. We try to give everybody a little bit of something.'' That includes a construction project in which the restaurant is adding an indoor-outdoor grill that capitalizes on the popularity of the rustic cooking style. 
 Giving ''everybody a little something'' translates into a slightly eccentric place. On our first visit to this 120-seat restaurant -- the tavern holds another 120, and the patio about 100 -- we were led to a bare-bones upstairs room that was also a thoroughfare for waiters -- a continual distraction. On another night, when we asked to sit elsewhere, the server found a corner table in a far more elegant room with low ceilings, exposed and sagging beams and well-used wide plank floors. 
 Mr. Hambrecht's food, too, is eclectic. On the Bail Out Menu, appetizers included an iceberg lettuce wedge drenched in blue cheese dressing, wild mushroom soup that lacked soul, and tender steamed mussels. Among that menu's main dishes, we tried the linguini in marinara sauce, which was nicely cooked, but the meatballs were unremarkable and the tarragon called too much attention to itself.
 The regular menu is better. Don't miss the whole grilled artichoke with Romesco sauce; it is a luxury. Other standout starters included light ricotta gnocchi with shiitake mushrooms, English peas and scallions; a small pasta dish called open-faced ravioli that seemed more like a braised short-rib lasagna with peas and wild mushrooms; and a table favorite -- arugula with apples, pine nuts, blue cheese and dried cranberries, dressed with port vinaigrette.
 Among the main dishes, the runaway favorite was the crisp roasted half of Long Island duck with brown rice, walnuts and scallions. The 14-ounce sirloin was next, though it had far too much meat on the plate next to dainty servings of broccoli rabe and roasted garlic potato gratin. In third place was the light tempura-battered fish with too many French fries and too much tartar sauce -- and not a vegetable to be seen on my portion.
 Sauteed salmon was deliciously paired with lentils dotted with a dice of butternut squash and dried fig bits. However, the red wine butter sauce lacked body, and the dish desperately needed the balance of greens. 
 Then there was the curious case of the grilled mahi-mahi, which the menu said was served with Israeli couscous, tomato, fava beans and lemon broth. I imagined something light, fresh and lemony, so when I took the first bite of the couscous mixture, I was taken aback by its cloying sweetness. I mentioned my surprise to the server, and in short order, I had a replacement that matched the menu. 
 As for desserts, some may be happy with a slice of pecan pie and masterfully made espresso, and others with the molten chocolate cake (which would serve a family of four). But the best is the Blue Moon ale zabaglione -- tangy and rich, a revelation in flavor so offbeat that it could inspire another visit, all by itself.

HEADLINE: The Bigots' Last Hurrah

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
WHAT would happen if you crossed that creepy 1960s horror classic ''The Village of the Damned'' with the Broadway staple ''A Chorus Line''? You don't need to use your imagination. It's there waiting for you on YouTube under the title ''Gathering Storm'': a 60-second ad presenting homosexuality as a national threat second only to terrorism. 
 The actors are supposedly Not Gay. They stand in choral formation before a backdrop of menacing clouds and cheesy lightning effects. ''The winds are strong,'' says a white man to the accompaniment of ominous music. ''And I am afraid,'' a young black woman chimes in. ''Those advocates want to change the way I live,'' says a white woman. But just when all seems lost, the sun breaks through and a smiling black man announces that ''a rainbow coalition'' is ''coming together in love'' to save America from the apocalypse of same-sex marriage. It's the swiftest rescue of Western civilization since the heyday of the ambiguously gay duo Batman and Robin. 
 Far from terrifying anyone, ''Gathering Storm'' has become, unsurprisingly, an Internet camp classic. On YouTube the original video must compete with countlesshomemade parodies it has inspired since first turning up some 10 days ago. None may top Stephen Colbert's on Thursday night, in which lightning from ''the homo storm'' strikes an Arkansas teacher, turning him gay. A ''New Jersey pastor'' whose church has been ''turned into an Abercrombie & Fitch'' declares that he likes gay people, ''but only as hilarious best friends in TV and movies.''
 Yet easy to mock as ''Gathering Storm'' may be, it nonetheless bookmarks a historic turning point in the demise of America's anti-gay movement.
 What gives the ad its symbolic significance is not just that it's idiotic but that its release was the only loud protest anywhere in America to the news that same-sex marriage had been legalized in Iowa and Vermont. If it advances any message, it's mainly that homophobic activism is ever more depopulated and isolated as well as brain-dead. 
 ''Gathering Storm'' was produced and broadcast -- for a claimed $1.5 million -- by an outfit called the National Organization for Marriage. This ''national organization,'' formed in 2007, is a fund-raising and propaganda-spewing Web site fronted by the right-wing Princeton University professor Robert George and the columnist Maggie Gallagher, who was famously caught receiving taxpayers' money to promote Bush administration ''marriage initiatives.'' Until last month, half of the six board members (including George) had some past or present affiliation with Princeton's James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions. (One of them, the son of one of the 12 apostles in the Mormon church hierarchy, recently stepped down.)
 Even the anti-Obama ''tea parties'' flogged by Fox News last week had wider genuine grass-roots support than this so-called national organization. Beyond Princeton, most straight citizens merely shrugged as gay families celebrated in Iowa and Vermont. There was no mass backlash. At ABC and CBS, the Vermont headlines didn't even make the evening news.
 On the right, the restrained response was striking. Fox barely mentioned the subject; its rising-star demagogue, Glenn Beck, while still dismissing same-sex marriage, went so far as to ''celebrate what happened in Vermont'' because ''instead of the courts making a decision, the people did.'' Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the self-help media star once notorious for portraying homosexuality as ''a biological error'' and a gateway to pedophilia, told CNN's Larry King that she now views committed gay relationships as ''a beautiful thing and a healthy thing.'' In The New York Post, the invariably witty and invariably conservative writer Kyle Smith demolished a Maggie Gallagher screed published in National Review and wondered whether her errant arguments against gay equality were ''something else in disguise.''
 More startling still was the abrupt about-face of the Rev. Rick Warren, the hugely popular megachurch leader whose endorsement last year of Proposition 8, California's same-sex marriage ban, had roiled his appearance at the Obama inaugural. Warren also dropped in on Larry King to declare that he had ''never'' been and ''never will be'' an ''anti-gay-marriage activist.'' This was an unmistakable slap at the National Organization for Marriage, which lavished far more money on Proposition 8 than even James Dobson's Focus on the Family. 
 The Obamas' dog had longer legs on cable than the news from Iowa and Vermont. CNN's weekly press critique, ''Reliable Sources,'' inquired why. The gay blogger John Aravosis suggested that many Americans are more worried about their mortgages than their neighbors' private lives. Besides, Aravosis said, there are ''only so many news stories you can do showing guys in tuxes.'' 
 As the polls attest, the majority of Americans who support civil unions for gay couples has been steadily growing. Younger voters are fine with marriage. Generational changeover will seal the deal. Crunching all the numbers, the poll maven Nate Silver sees same-sex marriage achieving majority support ''at some point in the 2010s.'' 
 Iowa and Vermont were the tipping point because they struck down the right's two major arguments against marriage equality. The unanimous ruling of the seven-member Iowa Supreme Court proved that the issue is not merely a bicoastal fad. The decision, written by Mark Cady, a Republican appointee, was particularly articulate in explaining that a state's legalization of same-sex marriage has no effect on marriage as practiced by religions. ''The only difference,'' the judge wrote, is that ''civil marriage will now take on a new meaning that reflects a more complete understanding of equal protection of the law.''
 Some opponents grumbled anyway, reviving their perennial complaint, dating back to Brown v. Board of Education, about activist judges. But the judiciary has long played a leading role in sticking up for the civil rights of minorities so they're not held hostage to a majority vote. Even if the judiciary-overreach argument had merit, it was still moot in Vermont, where the State Legislature, not a court, voted to make same-sex marriage legal and then voted to override the Republican governor's veto. 
 As the case against equal rights for gay families gets harder and harder to argue on any nonreligious or legal grounds, no wonder so many conservatives are dropping the cause. And if Fox News and Rick Warren won't lead the charge on same-sex marriage, who on the national stage will take their place? The only enthusiastic contenders seem to be Republicans contemplating presidential runs in 2012. As Rich Tafel, the former president of the gay Log Cabin Republicans, pointed out to me last week, what Iowa giveth to the Democrats, Iowa taketh away from his own party. As the first stop in the primary process, the Iowa caucuses provided a crucial boost to Barack Obama's victorious and inclusive Democratic campaign in 2008. But on the G.O.P. side, the caucuses tilt toward the exclusionary hard right. 
 In 2008, 60 percent of Iowa's Republican caucus voters were evangelical Christians. Mike Huckabee won. That's the hurdle facing the party's contenders in 2012, which is why Romney, Palin and Gingrich are now all more vehement anti-same-sex-marriage activists than Rick Warren. Palin even broke with John McCain on the issue during their campaign, supporting the federal marriage amendment that he rejects. This month, even as the father of Palin's out-of-wedlock grandson challenged her own family values and veracity, she nominated as Alaskan attorney general a man who has called gay people ''degenerates.'' Such homophobia didn't even play in Alaska -- the State Legislature voted the nominee down -- and will doom Republicans like Palin in national elections. 
 One G.O.P. politician who understands this is the McCain-Palin 2008 campaign strategist, Steve Schmidt, who on Friday urged his party to join him in endorsing same-sex marriage. Another is Jon Huntsman Jr., the governor of Utah, who in February endorsed civil unions for gay couples, a position seemingly indistinguishable from Obama's. Huntsman is not some left-coast Hollywood Republican. He's a Mormon presiding over what Gallup ranks as the reddest state in the country.
 ''We must embrace all citizens as equals,'' Huntsman told me in an interview last week. ''I've always stood tall on this.'' Has he been hurt by his position? Not remotely. ''A lot of people gave the issue more scrutiny after it became the topic of the week,'' he said, and started to see it ''in human terms.'' Letters, calls, polls and conversations with voters around the state all confirmed to him that opinion has ''shifted quite substantially'' toward his point of view. Huntsman's approval rating now stands at 84 percent.
 He believes that social issues should not be a priority for Republicans in any case during an economic crisis. He also is an outspoken foe of the ''nativist language'' that has marked the G.O.P. of late. Huntsman doesn't share ''the view of some'' that ''the party was created in 1980.'' He yearns for it to reclaim Lincoln's faith in ''individual dignity.'' 
 As marital equality haltingly but inexorably spreads state by state for gay Americans in the years to come, Utah will hardly be in the lead to follow Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa and Vermont. But the fact that it too is taking its first steps down that road is extraordinary. It is justice, not a storm, that is gathering. Only those who have spread the poisons of bigotry and fear have any reason to be afraid.

HEADLINE: Pulp Friction

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI

 BODY:
By the time you read this, Tropicana orange juice's new image -- the sans-serif typeface, the oddly generic packaging, the picture of a glass filled with orange juice -- will be a thing of the past, a relic of the grocery-store imagination, an Edsel of the breakfast aisle. In the world of commercial design, Tropicana's overly bland, overly simplified redesign, introduced in January, will go down in history for annoying consumers so mightily that they agitated for a return to the original packaging: a white carton with a picture of a juicy orange, Venetian-stripe straw piercing its skin. 
 I was a little surprised by the level of public outrage. In the midst of a crippling recession, who has the time and energy to care about the package their orange juice comes in? If you can complain about it, you can still probably afford it, so what's the big deal? 
 But the most remarkable detail about the Tropicana fiasco was how personal it became -- and how eagerly the public tarred Peter Arnell, the marketing and design guru behind it. Video of Arnell explaining the new look was posted on YouTube. If you Googled his name at the time, the second mention to pop up was Gawker, the media gossip site, which described his eyeglasses as ''fetishy.'' Me-ow! New York magazine put Tropicana's return to its original design on its approval matrix along with other ''brilliant'' phenomena like the Oscar winner Dustin Lance Black going shirtless in Vogue Hommes. Since when does an orange juice carton merit gossip-worthy status? 
 Since the world has been in tatters, that's when. If the economic sands are shifting beneath your feet, it seems you want your orange juice container to look the same as it did when your 401(k) was worth more than, say, a carton of orange juice. Marketers, though, seem oblivious. Pepsi, M&M's and Hellmann's have all undergone some sort of design overhaul or adjustment in the recent past. Not so long ago, Triscuit streamlined its sans-serif type and with it all my summertime memories of the 1970s: my parents drinking gin and tonics and eating Triscuits and cheddar on the porch, the smell of the ocean, my mother yelling at me to change my bathing suit -- all up in smoke. The new box puts me in mind of some sort of cracker imported from Sweden, possessing large quantities of fiber. I have to close my eyes and reach into the box before I can smell the ocean at Rehoboth Beach, Del., again. 
 Even some longstanding luxury goods have made dramatic changes. Rigaud has introduced a new candle design, with a fancy new top. I can hear Pamela Harriman -- who was reputed to rely on the candles for amorous purposes -- rolling over in her grave. ''Being different right now just doesn't feel right,'' Jeffrey Bilhuber, the interior designer and Rigaud fan, told me. ''Right now, we crave the familiar.'' 
 So, the more I thought about Tropicana, the more I felt my equilibrium disturbed. Sitting down at the breakfast table -- or, really, standing in front of the open refrigerator -- seemed, all of a sudden, like a foreign experience, as if overnight I had been transported back in time for a semester abroad in Europe, and my roommates spoke only Dutch, and the toilet didn't flush all that vigorously. Breakfast is a particularly sensitive time of the day, so perhaps changing any of its routine comforts is alarming. But Triscuit? Hellmann's? It is too much for my delicate constitution to bear.
 Not since the introduction of New Coke (and the attempt to eliminate old Coke) in 1985 has a consumer backlash reached such a fevered pitch. While plenty of people called the Coca-Cola headquarters to complain about New Coke's taste, I'll bet no one called to complain about the visionary in the fetishy eyeglasses in charge of the situation. Probably no one alive can even tell you who that guy was. But at a time when Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and YouTube can tell you who is eating a tuna sandwich right now, we are all ready to pounce on the pathetic genius who redesigned Tropicana. 
 I called Arnell, and he defended his design. One of Tropicana's issues, he said, is that it is the one prominent brand that is not sold in a transparent bottle: ''You can't see the juice you're buying.'' So he added a picture of a big glass of orange juice on the front of the carton. What's wrong with that? 
 And some buyers loved parts of his design, he said, like the cap in the shape of a halved orange. ''It's charming. It's sincere. It's meaningful.'' Besides, he added, American consumers are used to seeing redesigned products every day. ''Walk into an Apple store and you see new products every week, every month,'' he said. ''Nike, Adidas, Mazola, Nestle. They're flipping packages nightly.''
 But, jeez, Peter, even I got upset about Triscuit.
 ''Get over it,'' he said. ALEX KUCZYNSKI

HEADLINE: Free-Market Flaws, Exposed

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III

 BODY:
THE world is in the throes of an unprecedented economic crisis, and most mainstream economists and Washington policy makers didn't see it coming. In a surprisingly readable new book, ''The Cost of Capitalism: Understanding Market Mayhem and Stabilizing Our Economic Future'' (McGraw-Hill, $27.95), Robert J. Barbera places the blame for this abject failure in economic forecasting and government policy on a ''misguided confidence in the infallibility of free markets.''
 ''It is not that we put our faith in the wrong people, but that we embraced the wrong paradigm,'' Mr. Barbera writes. ''The events of 2008 revealed that using simple-minded free-market rhetoric as a policy guide is a recipe for disaster.'' 
 Mr. Barbera is a veteran Wall Street economist with decidedly liberal leanings. A former staff economist for Paul E. Tsongas, the late Democratic senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Barbera is executive vice president and chief economist at the Investment Technology Group, a financial consulting firm, and an economics department fellow at Johns Hopkins University.
 Although Mr. Barbera did not foresee the full dimensions of the crisis, he was wise enough to declare that the economy was in a recession back in January 2008, even as most mainstreamers were still predicting steady growth.
 ''The Cost of Capitalism'' tries to identify root causes of the current global recession, the specific mistakes made and possible ways to avoid future financial catastrophe. 
 Lest he be mistaken for a radical, Mr. Barbera openly declares his abiding faith in capitalism. 
 ''The ravages of the 2008 crisis do not justify a violent leftward lurch,'' he writes. ''Risk takers are the main drivers in the free-market machinery. Their efforts go a long way toward explaining the lofty growth rates capitalist economies have delivered in the postwar years.''
 A proud member of the so-called post-Keynesian economics school, Mr. Barbera bases his thesis partly on the work of the late Harvard economist Hyman Minsky, summarizing it in two sentences: ''A long period of healthy economic growth convinces people to take bigger and bigger risks. When a great many people have risky bets, small disappointments can have disastrous consequences.''
 Mr. Barbera cites the plunge of the American housing market as a classic example of a ''Minsky crisis.'' From 1966 to 2002, he notes, housing prices maintained a continuous upward trend; that, in turn, prompted both mainstream economists and homeowners to assume that prices would never fall. In fact, as prices rose, people made ever larger bets on the housing market, in the form of subprime mortgages, mortgage refinancings and complex financial derivatives.
 Mr. Barbera takes academics to task, saying they created the complex mathematical models on which those financial derivatives were based. ''The constructs were underpinned by the assumption that people are well informed and act rationally,'' he declares, adding, ''They failed to acknowledge that financial markets periodically go haywire.''
 Mr. Barbera is especially critical of Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, and his successor, Ben S. Bernanke. He contends that they were lulled into complacency by the persistently moderate ''Goldilocks'' economic period from 1985 to 2002, after the success of their predecessor, Paul Volcker, in taming inflation.
 As a result, they focused almost exclusively on moderating upward wage and price pressures. Although Mr. Greenspan worried aloud about ''irrational exuberance'' in the late 1990s stock market, he was ultimately convinced that the economy had entered a ''brave new world'' based on computer technology gains, Mr. Barbera asserts.
 Last fall, Mr. Greenspan even insisted that the precipitating factor of the 2008 crisis was ''the failure to properly price risky assets'' -- evidence, in Mr. Barbera's view, of a misplaced belief that financial markets are rational and capable of policing themselves.
 IF Mr. Barbera offers a concise analysis of what caused the current economic mess, he is a bit short on specific remedies for a long-term cure. Unlike Minsky, he does not advocate a move to socialized investment or total government control of the financial markets. Instead, he calls for ''an enlightened synthesis'' of mainstream and post-Keynesian economic approaches that ''celebrates free-market risk-taking but establishes policies to rein in inevitable excesses.'' 
 For starters, Mr. Barbera says, government policy makers must respond to rapidly rising markets with the same urgency they muster in responding to rapidly falling markets. He also sees a need for regulations that provide ''safety margins for the myriad nonbank financiers'' that arose outside 1930s-era banking industry reforms.
 But he cautions that policy makers must recognize that ''innovation on Wall Street, over time, dulls the applicability of a given set of regulations,'' thereby mandating constant vigilance and regular updating of the rules.
 In the end, Mr. Barbera acknowledges that ''there is simply no elixir to be had that will ensure a Goldilocks backdrop'' completely free of boom-and-bust economic cycles.
 But heeding the lessons of the last few years, as documented in this book, may help both financiers and government policy makers find ways to reduce some future costs of capitalism without sacrificing all the potential rewards. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 26, 2009

 CORRECTION:
The Off the Shelf column last Sunday, a review of ''The Cost of Capitalism,'' referred incorrectly to the economist Hyman Minsky. Although he received master's and doctoral degrees at Harvard, he spent most of his career at other schools; he was not known as ''a Harvard economist.''

HEADLINE: Make Room, Rich Little Cynics, Doing Good Is Coming to MTV

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
Four buddies set off across the country in an R.V., video camera in tow, to knock items off their ''100 things to do before I die'' list: kiss the Stanley Cup, get a tattoo, grow a mustache.
 With plenty of high jinks and adolescent humor, ''The Buried Life'' seems like the perfect MTV reality show, except for one unexpected twist. At each stop the group helps deserving locals with their own wishes. In Idaho, for example, they took eight children with brain cancer on a shopping spree at Toys ''R'' Us.
 Meet MTV for the era of Obama. After years of celebrating wealth, celebrity and the vapid excesses of youth, MTV is trying to gloss its escapist entertainment with a veneer of positive social messages. 
 Last fall, after the financial crisis erupted but before the presidential election, MTV executives gathered in New York for meetings to discuss the direction of the network and whether programs like ''The Hills,'' which chronicles the lives of the young and rich in Los Angeles, and ''My Super Sweet 16,'' a weekly visit to over-the-top coming-out parties, had trapped MTV in a decadent age that was passing. 
 The talk wasn't just academic. While MTV may still be a cultural touchstone for America's youth, its ratings are down considerably from earlier this decade.
 Executives looked at in-house research and the work of William Strauss, a generational expert who gave a presentation to MTV executives last fall, and saw that the country's young were deeply engaged in the election and becoming more civic-minded. 
 One point of discussion at the meetings was whether shows about rich young girls were still relevant. 
 ''It was very clear we were at one of those transformational moments, when this new generation of millennials were demanding a new MTV,'' said Stephen Friedman, MTV's general manager, using the term for those born between 1980 and 2000. 
 In the era that was passing, Mr. Friedman said, ''the humor was more cynical, the idea of community seemed earnest and not cool. It's the opposite now.''
 As a result, a new reality program, ''T.I.'s Road to Redemption,'' shows a troubled rapper helping keep children on the straight and narrow. Nick Lachey, the former boy band star who was married to Jessica Simpson, his co-star on the MTV program ''Newlyweds,'' is producing ''Taking the Stage,'' a reality show about a performing arts school in Cincinnati. A finishing school show, ''From G's to Gents,'' tries to transform homeboys into gentlemen -- or at least get them to cover their tattoos -- with the help of Fonzworth Bentley, who was Sean Combs's valet.
 Other networks, like CBS, Fox and NBC, have adjusted their programming to reflect the more austere times, with some escapist programs like ''Desperate Housewives'' introducing plots about the downturn. But MTV, which caters to 14- to 26-year-olds, often fickle in their tastes, has to be more astute at taking the cultural temperature.
 ''There's a lot of different factors for MTV than a network would face if it were focused on the broader 18-to-49 demographic,'' said Brad Adgate, senior vice president for research at Horizon Media, a media-buying company. ''I think as a programmer at MTV you always have to be one step ahead of the curve.'' 
 Even with the changes, MTV's lineup still has plenty of wealth, celebrity and sophomoric humor. ''My Super Sweet 16,'' about rich families throwing their daughters' 16th birthday parties, and ''MTV Cribs,'' which celebrates the outlandish homes of the young and wealthy, remain on the air. 
 ''It's not like you flip a light switch from one type of programming to another,'' said Van Toffler, president of MTV Networks. ''The notion of escapism will still live next to inspiration.'' 
 Some of MTV's many critics, who over the years have raised questions about the quality of the shows and their effects on children, are cautiously optimistic.
 ''MTV is an enormously important medium in terms of kid culture,'' said James Steyer, the chief of Common Sense Media, a group that promotes family-oriented entertainment and has been critical of MTV for sexually explicit programming. ''We want to encourage the good, and we'll call out the bad when we see it.''
 More broadly, MTV's overhaul comes in the context of programming changes across Viacom, the network's parent company, which has a new deal with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to make shows more supportive of education. And the company recently started a Programming Council, which meets periodically to consider programming messages and includes executives across Viacom -- MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon and BET.
 Historically, MTV has had to reinvent itself from time to time, Mr. Toffler said. In the late 1990s, he said, ''grunge gave way to the pop phenomenon of Britney and 'N Sync. To go from grunge to the bling was a big shift.''
 The latest cultural shift hasn't been kind. This season, 19 percent fewer households are tuning in on average during prime time than in the 2002-3 season, according to Nielsen Media Research. About 1 million individual viewers, on average, tuned in for prime time in 2002-3, compared with 775,000 this season. MTV executives say a better measure is overall total day ratings, and by this measure MTV is down about 13 percent since 2002-2003. It is still the top-rated cable network among 12-to-24-year-olds.
 ''When you give way from one generation to the next, from Gen X to the millennials, you are going to see some blip in the ratings,'' Mr. Toffler said.
 Michael Hirschorn, whose company, Ish Entertainment, produced ''T.I.'s Road to Redemption,'' said: ''It felt like a compelling narrative and a way to see a celebrity in a new and surprising way. You normally see a guy like him swaggering through music videos.''
 MTV executives pointed to several recent bright spots -- a 2 percent increase in ratings, a growing audience for ''Taking the Stage'' -- that they attribute to the new focus. Still, hits like ''The Hills'' aren't disappearing. Even ''The Real World'' which began in 1992 and helped usher in the reality-TV era, is being further tweaked to focus less on roommate fights and drunken hook-ups and more on aspirations.
 ''It's less about the hot tubs and the drama and more about pursuing their careers,'' Mr. Friedman said.

HEADLINE: So You Want to Work for a Nonprofit?

BYLINE: By CECILIA CAPUZZI SIMON. 
Cecilia Capuzzi Simon writes about education from Bethesda, Md.

 BODY:
On Friday, March 14, 2008, Kip Schaefer was at his job at Bear Stearns, fielding call after call from agitated investors who, in one cataclysmic day, canceled billions of dollars in trades, creating a run on the nation's fifth-largest investment bank and shuttering it by weekend's end. Mr. Schaefer, who worked at the firm for 12 years, likened the trauma of that day to the death of a family member. 
 It may have paled compared to the 11 months that followed. In that time he: lost his job, had a third child, sold two homes, went on 20 job interviews, completed a master's degree in fund-raising from New York University, moved his family to a new town, bought and renovated a home, and started a new career.
 ''I don't know all of the top stressors in life,'' he says, laughing as he remembers cold sweats in the middle of the night. ''But I think we lived through most of them last year.'' 
 You would never know it by looking at him now at his new job as director of institutional business development at the National Philanthropic Trust, just outside Philadelphia. Lunching at a bistro at Rittenhouse Square -- a short train ride from the trust's headquarters in Jenkintown, Pa. -- Mr. Schaefer, 34, seems relaxed and amiable. With close-cropped hair and an earnest gaze, he exudes the easy charm of the college athlete he used to be, and betrays his Northern California roots and psychology degree with the new-agey lingo he uses to explain his ''transformation'' from profiteer to philanthropist.
 The ''key takeaway'' from his year of professional limbo? ''Align your intuitive spirit with your career goals,'' he says. It may also help, as Mr. Schaefer's experience shows, to do that psychic check-in before you lose your job. 
 Mr. Schaefer's intuition and do-good drive led him to a cutting-edge not-for-profit, National Philanthropic Trust, which specializes in ''donor advised funds.'' These are charities usually rooted in personal passion -- scholarships at alma maters, money for a local museum -- that are administered by a third party. For a fee, the trust takes care of accounting, taxes, advising, grant-making and liquidating assets used to finance the charities. The idea has been around since the 1930s but gained in popularity during the last decade's flush times as the number of retiring boomers and millionaires multiplied.
 The National Philanthropic Trust, which started in 1996, had managed a total of $1.5 billion in charitable assets and was looking to grow. Its president, Eileen Heisman, sits on the advisory board of the George H. Heyman Jr. Center for Philanthropy and Fundraising at N.Y.U. She was introduced to Mr. Schaefer through one of his professors.He had the Wall Street connections Ms. Heisman wanted to cultivate, but it was his education in fund-raising, his passion for ''mission-related'' work, and his personality that clinched the offer.
 ''He had already educated himself, that was key,'' she says. But what she also saw in him was sincerity. ''It's a harder leap than people think,'' she says of the transition from profit to nonprofit. ''Some come to nonprofits thinking there's not much to know. They think they're doing me a favor coming from the private sector: 'Oh, a charity. How hard can this be? I'm finally ready to give back!' Kip wasn't like that.''
 Kip Schaefer got in, though, ''just before the bottom fell out,'' she says. With fortunes tied to the stock market, the assets the trust currently manages are down 20 percent. Nonprofits everywhere are taking a hit and are expected to stall even more with President Obama's proposed reduction in tax breaks for charitable donations. Some nonprofits have already closed or are cutting staff. The trust downsized in December. 
 ''It was a tough decision,'' she says. She kept her new employee, with his promise of attracting new business. 
 Mr. Schaefer thinks a good instinct about career direction landed him his job in a tanking economy. Feeling ''incomplete'' with a bachelor's from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, he heeded ''an intuitive call'' to further his education in 2006. It was the exposure to massive wealth and what Mr. Schaefer calls the ''philanthropic culture embedded'' at Bear Stearns (senior managers were required to give away 4 percent of their mega-salaries to charity) that got him thinking about a different kind of money management. 
 He was not looking for a career change immediately. He hoped to move into senior management at Bear Stearns and to serve on the boards of charitable organizations. (In 2007, he did, joining the Friends of the Children of New York, a mentoring program in Harlem.) His ''after Wall Street plan'' was to work in philanthropy, perhaps internationally, using his knowledge of the global financial markets.
 ''I never saw myself sitting on a pile of cash at the end of my career,'' he says. ''I expected to look back and say, 'Look how great I impacted the world.' '' 
 Mr. Schaefer was one of the original students in N.Y.U.'s Master of Science program in fund-raising, offered at the School of Continuing and Professional Studies. Academic training in nonprofit work is relatively new, fueled by the recent growth in philanthropy. In the last decade, the number of nonprofit groups has increased nearly 40 percent, to 1.4 million organizations, raising $306 billion in 2007 alone.
 Thirty programs around the country grant master's degrees in nonprofit study, allowing students to specialize in areas like management or fund-raising. Another 130 programs offer concentrations within other disciplines, such as public administration, social work or business. Indiana University has a Ph.D. in philanthropic studies and expects to offer the first bachelor's degree in the subject this fall. 
 ''There's a lot to learn,'' says Naomi Levine, the executive director of the Heyman Center, who created N.Y.U.'s master's three years ago. ''This isn't selling Girl Scout cookies.''
 N.Y.U.'s 42-credit program requires courses in ethics, law, fund-raising, global and corporate philanthropy, campaigns and gifts. Electives include nonprofit marketing, communication, psychology, gender and culture. 
 Mr. Schaefer took two courses per semester -- each met one night a week -- and one course each summer. He finished in just over two years. With 10 hours of homework a week, a full-time job, two young children and a third on the way, he didn't have time for anything else. The last two semesters were a particular challenge. The weekend of Bear Stearns's collapse ended when JPMorgan Chase bought it. Mr. Schaefer was asked to stay on through the transition until August. He was given a year's severance. 
 In between classes and closing out his career there, he put his personal life in order. He sold his apartment on the Upper West Side and his home in the Catskills to stay liquid should he have to relocate. He lived with his family in the Catskills home in a leaseback while crisscrossing the country for interviews in the financial and charitable fields. Some days, he says of the job hunt, were not easy: ''My wife gave me a good visual. Imagine walking through a blizzard. If you stop, you're going to freeze and die. You've got to keep walking. You'll walk out of it.'' 
 By September, he had. When the trust's offer came, he was also weighing a more lucrative deal from a financial firm. The offer from the trust, he says, wasslightly less than his $175,000 Wall Street salary, which had been supplemented by a bonus three times that amount. Executive pay in the nonprofit sector can't compete with Wall Street compensation, not even in these days of slashed bonuses, but it can be comparable to executive salaries in the for-profit world. 
 He did a gut check. 
 ''I followed my passion,'' he says. Given the dire condition of the economy when he finally started at the trust in February, it seems a good thing he did. ''If I hadn't,'' he says, ''I'd probably be chasing my tail right now looking for work.''

HEADLINE: Applying for Stimulus Cash Can Test Officials' Patience

BYLINE: By GREGORY B. HLADKY

DATELINE: HARTFORD 

 BODY:
 GOVERNMENT and community officials across Connecticut are scrambling to cope with the web of bureaucratic strings attached to the state's $3 billion in federal stimulus money.
 Those dollars are intended to help revive the state's economy through spending over the next two years on projects and programs ranging from highways to community health programs and local education.
 Some municipal leaders, like Mark D. Boughton, mayor of Danbury, and Barbara R. Gilbert, town manager for Rocky Hill, say the often-confusing new federal and state rules governing the stimulus program could create lengthy delays in getting projects going. 
 ''We are very frustrated right now with the ridiculous rules they are putting on this money,'' Mr. Boughton said. ''At this rate, we're not going to see any of this money do any good until next year. It completely defeats the purpose of the stimulus package. I don't think that's what President Obama or Congress envisioned.''
 Mrs. Gilbert said it took her ''a little bit of stomping of my feet'' and a call to Gov. M. Jodi Rell's office to clear the way for Rocky Hill to get quick approval for $1.9 million in federal stimulus dollars for a project to repair her town's Main Street.
 ''The state bureaucracy and the guidelines coming down from the feds can tangle everything up,'' she said. ''If we couldn't figure out a way to get through the state bureaucracy, we would have lost that money.''
 Other local officials say they haven't encountered any major holdups. ''I think it's proceeding apace,'' said Mayor John DeStefano Jr. of New Haven. ''I'm not particularly frustrated or concerned.'' He said the federal financing is moving ''reasonably promptly'' given the relatively brief time the Obama administration has been in office.
 Matt Fritz, a special assistant to the governor, said the state is working hard to minimize delays and to streamline the application and approval process for the stimulus cash. But he acknowledged that there were problems.
 ''It is frustrating at our level as well,'' said Mr. Fritz, who is co-chairman of a special 20-member working group created by the governor to help direct and monitor the new flood of federal financing coming into Connecticut. He said federal officials ''want the money to move as fast as possible but haven't changed anything to make it possible.''
 Mr. Fritz said many of the federal and state requirements attached to the stimulus financing are an attempt to prevent taxpayer money from being abused or wasted. He said that, in addition to normal federal bidding and reporting requirements, the states have to meet new standards for tracking the money in order to hold agencies and municipalities accountable for how it is spent.
 Connecticut is expected to receive its $3 billion in stimulus money over the next two years. Part of the uncertainty over when the financing will be released is that it is coming from various pools of money in different federal agencies.
 State House Majority Leader Denise Merrill, Democrat of Mansfield, said she has also been hearing concerns from some quarters about bureaucratic delays. ''In some cases, I think we're doing a pretty good job in Connecticut; in other cases, not so good.''
 The only portion of the federal stimulus package for Connecticut that has actually reached people is $17 million to increase individual unemployment benefits by $25 a week, Mr. Fritz said last week.
 Mr. Fritz said $635 million of Connecticut's federal stimulus money had been committed to specific projects or programs, but none of that money had been spent yet.
 Officials across the state are anxiously waiting for those stimulus checks to be sent out.
 ''I believe we start seeing the money in a month,'' said Mark Masselli, president and chief executive officer of Community Health Centers Inc., a nonprofit organization that operates programs in 12 Connecticut cities and 140 schools.
 Mr. Masselli said his group was expecting to receive $670,000 in federal stimulus money to hire additional nurses and physicians for clinics in Meriden and New Britain over the next two years.
 At Bridgeport's P.T. Barnum public housing project, $1.95 million in federal stimulus dollars will be used to replace rusting outdoor staircases and remove concrete pillars ''where bad guys hide,'' said Nicholas A. Calace, the executive director of the city's housing authority
 Mr. Calace said the housing authority had been promised a total of $5.7 million from the stimulus package and is now awaiting final approval of the proposed spending plan.
 Kevin Nursick, a spokesman for the state Department of Transportation, said agency officials now expect that the first of the $302 million in highway infrastructure projects being financed under the stimulus program should be getting under way ''two to three months from now.''
 That project involves $1.45 million in repairs to the Route 89 bridge over the Mount Hope River in Ashford. Next in line is a $73 million rebuilding of the bridge carrying Amtrak's rail line over Route 1 in Branford, Mr. Nursick said.

HEADLINE: The Story of a Job Lost, and a Job Sought, in Giant Letters

BYLINE: By CYNTHIA WOLFE BOYNTON

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT 

 BODY:
 For the last eight months, Pasha Stocking, a laid-off marketing and sales director, has been sending out resumes, attending job fairs, registering with temp agencies and doing ''everything else possible'' to try to find a job. Finally, after no real prospects, she decided it was time for ''one last, big try.''
 She took $2,000 she had saved to use toward a down payment on a house, and instead rented space on a billboard on northbound Interstate 95 in Bridgeport. The imposing 14-by-48-foot billboard, with her likeness and the phrase ''Hire Me'' in giant letters, looms over drivers. 
 ''I'm a single mother with three kids. I needed to be working yesterday,'' said Ms. Stocking, 37, who lives in East Hampton. ''I had to put myself out there for them and myself. I love to work and can pretty much do anything. I'm hoping the billboard was a good investment.''
 She said she chose Bridgeport for the billboard because she believes Fairfield County offers the best opportunities for a midlevel marketing or executive assistant position. Before she was laid off in July, she was director of sales and marketing for a crisis management training firm in Middletown.
 An executive at Lamar Advertising Company, which rented Ms. Stocking the billboard, said he was surprised that more people were not doing the same thing.
 ''With jobs the way they are, you need to set yourself apart and give yourself an edge,'' said Paul Macari, vice president and general manager of Lamar's Fairfield County office. ''This is a great way to do it.''
 State Department of Labor statistics count 96,382 unemployed Connecticut residents for the two-week period ending April 2, the latest statistics available. That's close to a 90 percent increase from the same period in 2008.
 Labor Department officials would not comment on Ms. Stocking's billboard. But Linda Kobylarz, a veteran career consultant whose clients, among others, include the state's Department of Economic and Community Development, sees it as a sign of the times, so to speak. ''Extreme times call for extreme measures,'' she said.
 Ms. Kobylarz, the secretary of the National Career Development Association, said she sees the billboard as a ''gigantic cold call'' and is ''intrigued'' by Ms. Stocking's willingness to take a chance. 
 No doubt that anyone looking for a job needs to invest in his or her self, Ms. Kobylarz said. But while innovation and creativity are key qualities that many employers look for, only rarely do they replace proven experience and skills, she added. 
 ''Getting noticed may get you in for the interview, but then you need to show you have the skills to get the job done,'' Ms. Kobylarz said. 
 Mr. Macari said that while Ms. Stocking's billboard is the first of its kind he has seen in Connecticut, similar ''hire me'' billboards have cropped up elsewhere. Ms. Stocking, in fact, got the idea and the advice from Mark Heuer, a Milwaukee resident who made national headlines for advertising himself on a similar billboard last month.
 A strong believer in networking, Mr. Heuer used his experience to guide Ms. Stocking not only on how to create a cost-effective billboard, but also what information to include on her accompanying Web site, hirepasha.com.
 ''One thing I've learned in life is that help can come from the weirdest places,'' Ms. Stocking said. ''Who would have thought that a guy from Milwaukee might be the one who helped me change my life? But he gave me a lot of great advice, including how to offset the huge cost of the billboard space.''
 Those cost-saving measures included Ms. Stocking's 16-year-old daughter taking the photograph for the billboard and Ms. Stocking using self-taught graphic skills to design it.
 So far, Ms. Stocking said, she has received some offers for entry-level positions that she said she would consider if it came to that. But she said she could not afford to live on minimum wages.
 ''I know things might not work out the way I want them to, but I can't think about that right now,'' Ms. Stocking said, with her eyes full and her voice cracking. ''I've put myself out there and now need to be confident that something great is going to happen.''

HEADLINE: THE WORKING FOREST

BYLINE: By ROBERT SULLIVAN. 
Robert Sullivan is the author most recently of ''The Thoreau You Don't Know.''

 BODY:
Over the winter, David Foster wanted to cut down some trees. His neighbor didn't want him to. Foster is the director of the Harvard Forest, a 3,500-acre experimental forest in the middle of Massachusetts. When you are the director of an experimental forest, people aren't sure you should be cutting down trees. ''We're cutting an acre of forest, nonnative conifers,'' he told me calmly on a day in February, while grabbing some snowshoes. A forest ecologist will tell you that if you cut down some woods -- not all the woods, but some of them -- a new forest will quickly replace them. There's a joke in Massachusetts that if you forget to cut your lawn, you will have a forest. For an ecologist, tree-cutting can be a stimulus plan that actually works.
 This cycle of forest succession is an observation that Foster attributes to Henry David Thoreau; when Foster is walking in the forest, something he does a lot, he will spot some young white pine trees, for example, in a freshly cut field and say, ''There's Henry Thoreau for you!'' 
 The forest is back in New England. It returned, counterintuitively, while the population increased: Massachusetts, the third most densely populated state, is on the Top 10 list of most forested states. The forest is back to what we think of as Thoreauvian levels, even though, as Foster will tell you, the woods had been cut down by the time Thoreau was writing. ''When Thoreau wrote 'Walden,' '' Foster likes to note, ''New England was at the peak of deforestation.'' 
 Meanwhile, the forest no one knew existed is threatened, not just by the ax this time but by parking lots and housing developments. According to Massachusetts Audubon, between 1971 and 1999 the land considered developed increased to 24 from 17 percent of Massachusetts, while ''wildlife habitat,'' which is defined as forest, wetlands and open water, declined from 70 to 64 percent. The second chance to save the returned forest has concerned Foster for the past few years, and now a plan he helped develop, called Wildlands and Woodlands, or W & W, has been moving through conservation circles like an aggressive invasive species. It suggests preserving 2.5 million acres in Massachusetts, or half the area of the state, from development. As opposed to old-style conservation, which primarily establishes protected public lands, W & W proposes conserving large, aggregated chunks of private land. Radically, it proposes that the land stay in private hands, allowing it to be used for limited purposes, like logging or recreation, as a way to encourage land stewardship rather than strip malls. ''This isn't restricting development,'' Foster says. ''It's directing it.''
 Foster is an ecologist and an environmental historian -- a paleoecologist -- concerned with the long-term processes that have shaped the land, like fires, floods, 18th-century forestry practices and Colonial farming. Tall and lanky, Foster is often in fleece and jeans, a camera around his neck. He is always clicking: a photo of a 200-year-old hemlock tree, of evidence of the 1938 hurricane, of a stone wall in the woods that would have, in Thoreau's time, been in a field, a field that time turned into woods. It can seem as if Foster is trying to freeze-frame the precise state of the New England ecology for future reference. On that February day, as he strapped on his snowshoes and set out the back door, he recalled the time he was chided by a group of colleagues on a train in British Columbia. He photographed all the clear-cuts, forest burns and dead trees while everyone else looked away. They dubbed him Dr. Death. ''I said, hey, for me it's all about dynamics,'' he said, crunching onto a forest trail. ''It's all about change.''
 The Harvard Forest, too, is about change. Established in 1907, the Harvard Forest resembles a regular forest, but snowshoeing through, you soon begin to notice the little yellow flags planted in a snow patch, the metal measurement bands around the trees, the fence around a stand of saplings to protect them from the moose that have come back to Massachusetts, not in stray pairs but in herds. Experiments are everywhere, visible and not: cables run underground to heat the soil in one patch of woods; in another, fans are being set up to blow hot air. ''It's a forest of many observations,'' Foster said, pressing forward.
 One particular observation -- the one Foster is heading toward -- has stunned even those deeply interested in forests. This same New England forest that people did not even know existed has been doing a better job of keeping carbon out of the atmosphere than anyone imagined.
 ''O.K., here's Julian,'' Foster said as we reached the foot of an industrial staircase seemingly built to nowhere, anchored to a pole that was once a boat's mast. Julian is Julian Hadley, an ecophysiologist on staff at the Harvard Forest. ''Watch the ice on the steps,'' Hadley said as we climbed. Up at the wobbly top, the sonic anemometer, in concert with other instruments, measures the flux or exchange between the atmosphere and photosynthesizing trees -- the inhale of carbon, called the uptake, and the exhale of oxygen and water.
 The past few years of carbon monitoring at the Harvard Forest have shown that the so-called midlatitude forests of the United States (the forests stretching up from the Carolinas into New England and Canada and the Midwest) are reducing the global increase in carbon by more than 10 percent. The Northeast forest doesn't hold as much carbon as, say, the Amazon. But the Harvard Forest has shown that the rate of carbon-holding is changing in surprising ways. When you balance out the carbon taken in and released, the Northeast forest retains two to four tons of carbon per hectare every year, in part because the Northeast, with relatively young trees, isn't creating as much carbon in the form of decomposing trees and foliage. ''The forest is growing and increasing its uptake of carbon,'' Hadley says. In the East, in fact, as forests hold more and more carbon, the rate of new carbon storage uptake is surpassing the Amazon's. Suddenly, with this new discovery, the forest of the East, back from devastation, is a big and important player in global carbon storage. 
 This science might sound unrelated to land conservation, but this is where Foster comes in. After snowshoeing back to headquarters, he checked the mail. The irate neighbor is now more irate -- a letter arrived equating the Harvard Forest's tree-cutting with Middle Eastern aggression -- and this had Foster talking about the value of working forests, which got him back to carbon, the big point being that the forest is a machine, a machine that goes into overdrive each spring, as the green leaves bloom in what is known to forest ecologists as a ''leaf out.''
 ''When the great, green wave of leaf out spreads across the Eastern U.S., the entire earth's atmosphere will change,'' he said. ''Atmospheric scientists at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii will see the carbon decreasing in the atmosphere. The forest is producing oxygen. It's cleaning the air. It's purifying the water. You try to explain to people that this is a huge natural machine that is working for you, and that we have to invest in it because that's what we do -- we invest in infrastructure.''
 Wildlands and Woodlands is a 24-page color booklet that Foster helped write and publish in 2005; it looks less like an academic paper than a how-to kit. As opposed to a lot of papers that fall like trees in a forest, this one has ended up being a blueprint. At its most basic, W & W proposes leaving areas designated as wildlands untouched. These are forests drawn from land that is already set aside -- ecologically vibrant core forests, like state and federal wilderness areas. The rest of the protected forest would be woodlands, which would connect to the wildlands and enhance them, by facilitating the movement of animals, the propagation of plants and the improvement of the forest as a carbon-sucking tool, because the healthier the forest, the more carbon it sucks. The woodlands would be conserved as forests but managed in ''an ecologically sustainable manner.''
 ''Ecologically sustainable manner'' is a scary phrase to an environmentalist; in the West it has been used to justify intensive clear-cutting, for instance. But W & W does not see a contradiction between protecting the forests and logging them, as well as using them for other sustainable activities like hunting, snowmobiling, horseback riding and paintball battling. ''Managed woodlands are important in fulfilling connections between people and nature,'' the plan says. Foster argues, in other words, that we need to get back into the woods, on an everyday basis, both with walking stick and ax.
 ''That's where producing local wood is like using local food,'' Foster says. ''Now we tend to do it in places we don't see. And we're going to preserve our land, but, hell, we live in houses and we like the wood. Where's it coming from? It's going to come from British Columbia and Malaysia -- and cutting it is going to do damage to much more pristine areas and without oversight. Here in Massachusetts, we've got oversight. You can't produce all your wood in the Massachusetts forest, but if you obtain your resources locally, people might pay more attention to how their resources are used. Also, people might live more sensibly if they knew where their resources were coming from.''
 The report is practical, subdued, nondoctrinaire and full of science, as well as lots of Foster's photos. Its core is a call to put down the rhetorical arms, and it radically recasts how forests are viewed. The new forest, as described in W & W, is both a natural and an economic entity. Forests provide traditional sources of income, but the plan also raises the question that if we give tax credits to factories that cut their emissions, might there be economic support for forests that not only pull carbon from the air but also clean the water that we would otherwise filter via costly water-filtration plants? 
 Efforts to conserve land along W & W lines have popped up around New England, and conservation groups around the nation like the plan, too. ''David Foster put it together in this accessible and cogent way and said we can reverse these trends,'' says Laurie Wayburn, president of the Pacific Forest Trust, a land trust based in San Francisco. ''This is a very visionary way of recognizing the inevitability of development but not the uncontrollability of where and how this development takes place.''
 W & W, in its methods, is modern land conservation written backward. It involves landowners selling their development rights, through something called a conservation easement, to a state or nonprofit agency, which holds those rights ''in perpetuity'' (meaning for as long the United States maintains its current government and system of laws). In a W & W scheme, although the owner can't put a subdivision on the land, he or she still owns it and can continue to live on the land and carry out limited logging or farming, or rent out a vacation home. 
 In a typical plan, the owner would sell the development rights at 75 percent of their market value, with the remaining 25 percent eligible for treatment as a charitable deduction under federal and state law. The owner profits from the sale of the rights and the decrease in taxes. Groups of landowners are encouraged to work together in regional partnerships, or what W & W describes using the Hobbit-esque term Woodland Councils, several of which are already in operation around New England.
 Selling a conservation easement is a fairly obscure legal agreement. ''You only come across it when somebody dies,'' says Keith Ross, a forester turned real estate broker who pioneered using such easements to preserve 760,000 acres of woods and streams in Maine called the Pingree tract. ''People who are very wealthy -- they know about it. The average Joe doesn't deal with the estate tax. But it allows land to be in private ownership and to be perpetually protected.''
 Ross is now working on the Western Massachusetts Pilot Aggregation Project, a Pingree deal writ small (more landowners with lesser acreage) that still takes a big bite of land, 12,600 acres. It's a regional scheme, and he has enlisted Scott Sylvester, a forester who has overseen logging jobs in the area for decades. W & W operates on the idea that local foresters are trusted by landowners and uniquely situated to work with them. As naturalists they recognize ecologically valuable land; as loggers they value the economy of scale implied by larger tracts. ''You may have six different owners and houses on the property, which makes it more difficult to do a timber sale or salvage the trees after an ice storm or prevent disease,'' Sylvester said. 
 A result of aggregating land parcels is a situation not unlike the one inside the Adirondack Park and Forest Preserve, where land is protected under the New York State constitution. In the case of the Adirondacks, private landowners are grandfathered into the public preserve. In the case of W & W, the public reserves are, in a sense, being grandfathered onto the private land -- to make for an Adirondack-ification of the Eastern United States, before the forest that has quietly returned is quietly developed away. 
 Some wilderness advocates criticize the sale of conservation easements. ''I call them development easements,'' says Jonathan Carter, the director of the Forest Ecology Network, a wilderness advocacy group in Maine. As the Green candidate for governor in Maine, he criticized the Pingree sale and similar arrangements, calling for more wilderness areas and arguing that timber companies would use easements to destroy what is left of the forest. And yet, even as a critic, he is on the same page as W & W in many ways, having spent a week in March visiting members of Congress, urging them to link forest conservation with greenhouse-gas reduction. ''Just as we pay farmers not to grow crops, we ought to pay landowners not to cut trees,'' he says. 
 David Foster sees the choice as not between wilderness and managed woodlands but between managed woodlands and sprawl, and he considers the former to be a much better buffer for wilderness areas. (W & W is the flip side to smart growth, the rural component of urban planning.) Longtime landowners, he notes, often have a natural inclination toward land conservation, even if financial pressures have historically pushed them toward selling out to the new superstore, the racetrack developer or the mall. ''Most people think that landowners want to get the most money they can out of the land -- that they want to squeeze every nickel they can out of it,'' Foster says. ''But people have never asked. So Keith comes along and pulls together a thousand people and says, 'Would you be interested in getting 75 percent of the development rights?' and you could stay on the land and manage it as you have been managing it, as good stewards. And they all jump. But nobody has offered them a chance to do it before.''
 The Harvard Forest plan begins in the woods of Vermont, with David Foster and Henry David Thoreau, where over sum-mers during graduate school, on family property, Foster was slowly building a cabin. He had graduated from Connecticut College, where, early on, when he was a religious studies major, his high-school girlfriend (now wife) persuaded him to take a botany course, which changed everything. In his cabin he was reading and rereading Thoreau's journals -- volumes and volumes of daily notes on the woods and the working landscape of antebellum New England. In the journals, Foster began to notice sights and sounds in Thoreau's 19th-century landscape that were at odds with the landscape around his cabin in the woods: Thoreau described bells, cows and everywhere axes chopping wood, while it was quiet around the Vermont cabin. Foster eventually wrote a book on the journals, titled ''Thoreau's Country,'' in 1999. ''I thought about the nature of Thoreau's woods,'' he wrote, ''which he described as being very open and tame, filled with woodchoppers at their work, children gathering chestnuts and sassafras shoots and early-rising farmers traveling to market.'' As he walked through the Vermont woods, he began to find stone walls among the trees and the lilac bushes that are vestiges of farmhouses -- signs of civilization deep in nature. 
 In 1983, Foster joined the Harvard faculty as a professor of forest ecology, becoming the director of the Harvard Forest in 1990. In the meantime, he was asked to be on the board of the Mount Grace Land Conservation Trust, a small nonprofit in a nearby town. ''I grew up in southern New England and I love New England passionately, but I'm not a conservationist; I'm an ecologist,'' he says he was thinking at the time.
 As Foster the ecologist learned more about local conservation, he developed what would become his standard W & W presentation, the story of the forests of New England, which he gives in meeting halls or in walks through the woods. The history portion goes roughly like this: Forests are burned by Native Americans, cut by Colonial farmers, until, by the time Thoreau takes a temporary living place at Walden Pond, deforestation is at its peak -- only 20 percent of the woods remain. Walden is set in a vista of stumps. By the time Thoreau dies, in 1862, people are moving away from the farms of New England and the East, to the cities, to work in factories, or to the West, to start new farms. The woods grow back. The woods thrive. But now, Foster's presentation goes, the woods are disappearing again, this time thanks to bulldozers rather than axes. ''Currently, Massachusetts loses approximately 40 acres of open space daily to development,'' according to the W & W report. 
 The W & W report emerged after Foster brought together various groups of ecologists, environmental historians, foresters and other academics at the Harvard Forest and elsewhere. Dave Kittredge, the extension forester at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, had been studying private landowners' relationship to their land, and Brian Donahue, an environmental historian at Brandeis, had been working on suburban forestry. An activist plan was a big step for Foster, as an academic, but when you talk to him about it, you get the feeling that he had reached a point in his life where he wanted to do something with his knowledge. ''People said, 'You're jeopardizing your credibility by saying what should happen,' '' he says, ''and you know, we all looked at each other and said, first of all, science is not as objective as people think it is. And second, it's time we worked on something we believe in.''
 By the end of the winter, Foster had patched things up with the neighbor, or patched them up as well as he could. In the Sisyphean attempt to mediate landscape interests, there are always brush fires.
 ''Some of the wilderness purists kind of scoff at the idea'' of W & W, he told me. ''They say: 'It's not really going to be wilderness. Wilderness is Glacier National Park.' You get the attitude from the people who are interested in forest management that says, 'Well, why would you want to set something aside that could be harvested?' Then you get the people who are worried about everything that could happen in the world, and they say: 'Well, what if it blew down? Or what if you got an invasive species? What if some chestnut blight got in? What would you do?' And you go, 'You'd just leave it.' ''
 Foster has spent a lot of time thinking about what it means to manage a forest, and he has concluded that managing nature means making choices, and one of those choices might be doing nothing at all. ''That's an active management decision,'' Foster says. ''They think management decision means I have to have a chain saw in my hand. But the idea is that you're making a very conscious, well-conceived decision on this particular place to do nothing. Just think about how fascinating it is, and Thoreau was fascinated with this, too. Take a landscape that has been fields and has stones walls running through it and has all this old millwork, and you just let it gradually become wilder and wilder and wilder and just study it or just appreciate it.''
 Foster ended our walk with a trip to the Harvard Forest dioramas -- incredibly detailed Playmobil-scale dioramas that document the change in the New England landscape from before the Colonial period to the early 20th century. Lately he has taken to focusing on one diorama in particular, the one he thinks of as a centerpiece, which pictures Richard T. Fisher, who was the founder of the Harvard Forest, sitting in an old-growth grove with Nathaniel Shaler, the Harvard dean of science whose idea it was to set aside a forest for observation. 
 When Foster stares quietly into the diorama, you get the idea that he has thought about the scene for a long time. ''What do you see?'' he finally asks, professorially. ''You see them sitting there contemplating.'' Foster seemed to be willing himself into the scene, too. ''They are hunkered down in old growth,'' Foster says. ''And what does that say to us? It's these guys learning from nature and then applying nature to management.'' Foster has a kind of whispered shout going, and he is trying to hold in his enthusiasm and failing, though no other visitors are there, and he is ultimately in charge of the museum, after all. ''See, it has the W & W thinking right there,'' he says. ''You have to sit down and you have to learn from nature, but you have to manage.''

HEADLINE: The Ponzi Workshop

BYLINE: By CHARLES MCGRATH. 
Charles McGrath, former Book Review editor, is a writer at large at The Times.

 BODY:
One of the biggest growth areas in higher education these days is creative writing. In 1975, there were 52 degree-granting writing programs in American colleges and universities, and in 2004 there were more than 300. In his new book, ''The Program Era: Postwar Fiction and the Rise of Creative Writing,'' Mark McGurl, an associate professor of English at the University of California, Los Angeles, suggests that for this to happen in an era when American education has generally become more practical and vocational is not quite as odd as it seems. 
 Creative writing programs are themselves vocational training of a sort, he points out, and most of the people teaching in them are themselves holders of advanced degrees in creative writing. Probably a majority of American writers make a considerable part of their living not by writing, in fact, but by teaching others how to write and how to teach writing. 
 That there might be a Ponzi element in all this is something Mr. McGurl never considers. He thinks that writing programs are the best thing that ever happened to American fiction, and he pursues his case not on economic grounds -- the great number of writers whose careers have been subsidized, in effect, by the university -- but aesthetic ones. The programs, he says, have enabled a great flourishing of postwar American fiction, and from the merits of the work he deduces the merits of the system that fostered it. 
 In many ways his case is inarguable, if for no other reason than that writing programs are now an inescapable fact of cultural life in America. It's hard to think of a single important American writer to come along in the last 30 years who didn't log at least a couple of semesters in an M.F.A. program somewhere.
 In the 1940s and '50s, Americans who wanted to become writers went to Paris. Now they go to Palo Alto or Iowa City. And except for being more expensive than Paris, writing school doesn't seem to have harmed these generations of writers, despite the naysayers who complain that the programs turn out competent but unoriginal practitioners of whatever style happens to be in vogue. To judge from various memoirs and testimonials, most writing school alumni would probably say their time in the classroom helped.
 Just how the programs help is something that Mr. McGurl tends to be incurious about. Except for Paul Engle, head of the famous program at Iowa for a quarter-century, he pays little or no attention to any of the great mentors associated with the writing program movement -- writer-teachers like Frank Conroy, also at Iowa; John Barth, at Johns Hopkins; or Donald Barthelme, the subject of a new biography by Tracy Daugherty, at the University of Houston. 
 The actual process of tuition is hard to generalize about, so his book is, instead, full of incomprehensible diagrams, theoretical analysis and sentences like ''Technomodernism identifies with the 'emptiness' of pure formality -- that is, with the systemacity of the system itself, drawing the machine to itself in a form of ontological prosthesis.''
 ''The Program Era'' may, in fact, be a symptom of why creative writing is so popular. If stuff like this is what you get to read in regular English class, then no wonder students would rather write texts of their own.
 Much more entertaining is ''The Writer's Notebook: Craft Essays From Tin House,'' which is a pretty fair summary of where actual writing instruction is at these days. Most of the essays originated in writing workshops run by the literary magazine Tin House, and they include advice on sex writing by Steve Almond, on what you can learn from Shakespeare by Margot Livesey, and on revision by Chris Offutt, who compares the process to ''draining the kitchen sink and seeing what's in there, which is usually a mess.'' 
 He also says, ''There are no rules. . . . Don't pay any attention to someone who tells you what you should be doing.'' 
 That you learn to write by writing, by seeing what works and what doesn't, is the consensus here, and much of the advice offered is along the lines of the swing tips offered by golf pros -- little thoughts that work for a while and then have to be replaced by other thoughts. One contributor points out, for example, that ''show, don't tell'' is a good principle to keep in mind, except when it works better to ''tell, don't show.''
 In ''The Program Era,'' Mr. McGurl does have some smart things to say about the evolution of this creative writing movement -- he documents it as part of the rise of progressive education in general -- and about the many paradoxes involved when universities get in the business of trying to structure, codify and reward artistic endeavor. Not the least of these is that few of even the most ardent teachers of creative writing believe it can really be taught. Probably the best that can be expected is that the programs identify and nurture talent that is already there. The downside, though no one seems terribly worried about it, is that with new programs springing up every year, a lot of costly nurturing of nontalent takes place as well. 
 What this means is that we are conceivably approaching a state in which there are more writers in America than there are readers and, even more alarming perhaps, in which writing detaches itself from the marketplace and becomes, as it was back in the 17th century, a profession practiced only by teachers and by those who can afford to do it for nothing.

HEADLINE: The Art of Fencing: En Garde!

BYLINE: By GERRI HIRSHEY

 BODY:
EVERY family has its comic tales, and one of our favorites is ''Daddy and the Woodchuck.'' That Looney Tunes scenario, seared into memory about a decade ago, began with the shrieking of our two children: ''Mom, there's a woodchuck stuck in the fence!''
 My husband and I ran out to find the fat fiend about two feet up the vegetable garden fence, with his head and forelegs through the 3-by-5-inch wire mesh and his middle stuck tight. His hind end wiggled desperately. Mommy may have said a few bad words. Daddy grabbed a shovel. 
 We had been on the lookout for a rapacious varmint; the day before, something had breached my garden's stalwart defenses -- a five-foot cedar post and wire fence erected to deter rabbits and deer, augmented by 18 inches of chicken wire buried along the perimeter to thwart burrowing types. Yet somehow, three harvest-ready broccoli heads had been gnawed to stumps. 
 Clearly, the furry perp was back for seconds. Just as my husband neared the fence, the panicked woodchuck popped through, bolted out of the gate and led a merry Elmer Fudd chase through bramble patches and around stumps. My Kansas-born spouse, grandson of flinty farmers on both sides, might have popped him -- if he had been able to catch him. 
 Once the children and I recovered from belly-busting laughter, I grabbed a roll of chicken wire from the shed and began the tedious chore of sheathing the bottom three feet of fence with another layer. The unlovely double wiring is still holding, and the lesson we learned that day was a page straight from ''The Art of War'' by the ancient warrior-sage Sun Tzu, often paraphrased as ''Know thy enemy.'' 
 It's a helpful corollary to the paramount 21st-century horticultural imperative: I garden, therefore I fence. 
 Learning wildlife habits has since sharpened our defensive tactics. We now know that rodent types can push their flat skulls into improbably slim spots, so any new fencing is of finer-gauge chicken or rat wire, or dense plastic netting. White-tailed deer have landing and enclosure anxiety: they won't leap even a three- or four-foot fence if there is an obstacle or another row of fencing a few feet before or beyond it. Thus some people dare to surround their veggie patches with handsome picket or willow fences, and then string two or three strands of low trip wire fences outside them. 
 We have also learned that deer, especially fawns, will do a determined limbo beneath economical plastic mesh fencing if it isn't anchored to the ground with earth pins or strong wire.
 As growing deer pressure in the New York region continues to devastate gardens and forest undergrowth, plenty of people I know have just given up; friends have downsized to a few deck containers after having three months of toil and cosseting destroyed at the peak of ripeness by a fence-breaching marauder in a single August night. 
 I refuse to surrender, but I have acquiesced to another tenet of garden defense: Choose your battles. Enclosing our three acres would be prohibitive and impossible, owing to a right of way that our neighbors use through the property. So you have to find ways to maximize the minimal space you can protect -- in our case, the 20-by 35-foot fenced fortress.
 These days, my garden paths are crowded with ancillary containers: bushels of potato plants, laundry tubs with cucumbers and squash that can clamber up the fence. Along another path, I've planted an extra crop of snap peas and snow peas that poke greedy tendrils up through all that double fencing. I use every inch, and I'll admit that by July, things look a tad ragtag. But daily, I pick baskets full of edibles -- and a few frivolous things as well.
 I love growing flowers. And for a while, watching the destruction -- from agapanthus to zinnias -- I despaired. A solution presented itself when, after a nasty tussle with tomato mosaic virus, I took a break from growing them for a season to let the soil detox. 
 I spaded some lily bulbs into the vacant raised bed. They bloomed so extravagantly that I didn't have the heart to lift and move them later. I had always underplanted my tomatoes and peppers with stinky marigolds that are believed to repel some insect pests. Why not stuff both vegetables and flowers into the available space in the enclosure?
 Now it's happy symbiosis: morning glories and jasmine drape the wire fencing. Sweet peas and black-eyed Susan vines climb the snow pea trellis; more lilies grow outside the raised beds in the corners of the garden. When the spring asparagus harvest is done and the plants ''fern out,'' giant chartreuse ''Envy'' zinnias, burgundy-petaled sunflowers, blowsy cosmos and nicotiana grow beside them, tall enough to raise their heads to the sun. I have pots of flowers through October. And with the addition of a pair of old iron chairs, my practical agrarian cage has become a pretty place to rest. 
 Not that I'm so busy plucking petals that I let my guard down elsewhere. Since the deer have become bold enough for patio dining -- our deck is just a foot off the ground -- I have stretched cheap, expandable willow fencing where they've been stepping up to gnaw container flowers and vegetables. A whiskey barrel by the kitchen door is handy for cut-and-come-again mesclun and herbs, but the critters treated it as their own salad bowl until I rigged a dome of bird netting over it.
 There is also the indelicate defense that our appalled teenagers call the Big Stink: spray-on deer repellent. The one I have found most effective is a pungent concoction aptly named Liquid Fence. Mercifully, it is odorless when dry. Properly applied -- I mix it from concentrate and use a gallon sprayer -- it really does protect toothsome landscaping like the stand of pretty lacecap hydrangeas I've propagated over a decade. Late-evening spraying is preceded by a loud warning announcement and the rapid slamming of windows.
 There is one final caveat in garden defense: Good fences do not make good neighbors where chipmunks and squirrels are concerned. You just can't defend against them -- though I have seen gardens with netting stretched across the top to thwart them. I have learned to tolerate the collateral damage of nibbled tomatoes and cukes, though it's hard. I just wish they wouldn't taunt me. 
 Some chipmunks -- rats with racing stripes -- dare to sit on the garden fence as I work, cheek pouches distended by a juicy cherry tomato or a lily bulb. Just for spite, I sometimes take the beagle in with me to harass them for a bit. Maybelle is a noisy and ineffective hunter. But like the woodchuck follies, her frenzied yips make me laugh out loud at Nature's infinite jest.

HEADLINE: Getaways That Are 'Guilt Free'

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
SURE, you'd like to take a vacation. But with layoffs hitting your best friends and your own company hinting at pay cuts, how can you justify it? 
 Consider the guilt-free vacation. To counter customers' reluctance about jetting off for conspicuous consumption during a recession, travel companies are pushing trips that emphasize service, values and personal fulfillment. The message: If there is more involved than frivolous pleasure, you don't have to feel bad about dropping all that cash on a splashy vacation.
 Abercrombie & Kent, a high-end tour operator perhaps best known for its elite safaris, is offering Philanthropic Journeys (www.abercrombiekent.com/philanthropy), a collection of luxury tours that include elements of volunteering or giving back to the visited community. On sale now is a two-week trip, Fighting Climate Change in Antarctica, from $5,697 a person if booked by June 30. Travelers see penguin colonies, visit a working scientific station and help deliver equipment designed to measure the impact of global warming in the region. 
 Taking a slightly different tack, Virtuoso, a network of upscale travel agents, is using the banner slogan ''Return on Life'' to promote trips. ''It's about spending time on what matters most to you,'' says the pitch on www.virtuoso.com/returnonlife, its Web site. ''Maybe it's a personal journey to your favorite destination. Perhaps it's creating wonderful vacation memories with family, friends or your significant other. It may be that you want to get back to nature.'' The destinations include 10-night family trips to Vietnam and Cambodia from $3,605 a person or seven-day Alaskan cruises for $3,295 a person. 
 ''Even people who have money to spend are feeling somewhat a sense of guilt in spending money when reading and hearing of difficult times for so many other people,'' said Edward Piegza, president of Classic Journeys, a tour operator based in La Jolla, Calif. ''But if they can see their spending is actually having a positive impact in some way, they are more able to justify to themselves that their travel is doing good.''
 IN January, Jill Stanley, a retired personal assistant from Washington, took a 12-day Conservation Safari, operated by Abercrombie & Kent as part of its Philanthropic Journeys program. The trip demonstrated joint charity work the company has done with Friends of Conservation, an environmental organization that works with locals to develop sustainable ways of living in harmony with nature. ''We did the safari thing,'' she said, ''but they also took you around to see what A & K and the F.O.C. had done to help the area.''
 On the trip, which cost about $10,800 a person, Ms. Stanley visited an orphanage for children whose parents had died of AIDS and spent time with a Masai village and learned about reforestation efforts in the region. ''It made me feel good that we were able to plant trees or give in our name for somebody in the Masai Mara,'' she said. ''It's much more rewarding than going and sitting on the beach.''
 Companies offering more affordable volunteer vacations report that bookings for do-good trips haven't dropped as much this year as those for more traditional vacation packages. Sierra Club Outings, which offers a series of ''service'' trips in which volunteers can help eradicate invasive plants in Channel Islands National Park in California ($695) or maintain trails in the Red River Gorge in Kentucky ($375), said its domestic trips were down by 16 percent for the first three months of the year overall, compared with the same period last year. But service-trip bookings were down just 9 percent.
 In some cases, volunteer vacations have even been growing. Projects Abroad, which runs volunteer programs overseas, said bookings were up 20 percent this February from February 2008, with some of the travelers recently laid off but others simply looking for vacations that involve service. Options range from teaching soccer in Moldova for two weeks ($1,795) to teaching English in Nepal for three months ($3,295).
 For other travelers, the urge to imbue a trip with a sense of purpose is fulfilled in more personal ways. 
 ''We are getting more requests for trips they can share with family and friends, such as celebrating a milestone birthday or anniversary,'' said Pamela Lassers, a spokeswoman for Abercrombie & Kent. ''They want to rent a villa or a barge in Europe and then invite friends and family to join them. Or plan a private tented safari to celebrate a 50th birthday. Or host a family reunion at a ranch in Colorado.'' 
 Virtuoso's Return on Life campaign was created in response to a similar trend toward trips that focus on spending time with loved ones. ''I really think people are putting their lives in perspective,'' in light of the recession, said Kristi Jones, president of the travel agency network. ''There is this need for people to feel reconnected and rejuvenated, but not in a self-indulgent way.''
 For Globus, a major tour operator, bookings are down overall, said Steve Born, vice president of marketing, but religious tours, family packages and dream trips like Galapagos cruises ''are stronger or on pace with last year.'' 
 Faith-based trips, like pilgrimages to Jerusalem or other places of religious significance are resilient partly because travelers view them not just as vacations but also as ''an expression of faith,'' Mr. Born said. ''It's not a commitment they feel they can break.'' 
 Globus is also offering another kind of vacation customers may find easy to justify -- the fast, affordable trip. The company recently introduced 14 Guilt-Free Getaways from 4 to 10 days each, starting at around $100 a day -- trips ''that won't tax pocketbooks or keep travelers away from their daily responsibilities too long,'' according to its Web site, www.globusjourneys.com/Guilt-Free-Getaway-Vacations. 
 For families limited by school and activity schedules, Mr. Born said, the timing of vacations is pretty much predetermined, and even this year ''it's just a matter of where and how.'' And given the stress of the economy, many people may feel they need a vacation now more than ever. 
 ''I think people need things to look forward to in this economy,'' said Jill Walsh, a mother of three from San Diego, who along with her in-laws has been planning a summer family trip to celebrate her husband's parents' 50th wedding anniversary. ''What do you work hard for and save for if it's not something to have memories?''
 To keep costs down, the family plans to rent a house in Glacier National Park in Montana. ''Four to five special days just with the family -- who knows if that opportunity with Grandpa going on 82 will happen again?'' she said. ''It's an investment in memories for a lifetime.''

HEADLINE: Jones Beach Hit Hard By Budget Cuts to Parks

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
A SUMMER day at Jones Beach could be a lot different this year.
 The East Bathhouse pool, used by almost 14,000 people last summer, will be closed. So will the West End 2 ocean swimming beach, which had attendance of about 10,000 last summer. The Field 1 ocean swimming beach, which was previously open all summer weekends, will be open only three major weekends. And the Zach's Bay swimming area will have a shorter season.
 Those changes are a result of a $1.6 million cut in the state parks budget for Long Island announced earlier this month. The cuts to the $24 million budget for Long Island's state parks affect five other parks, too, but the biggest impact will be felt at Jones Beach. 
 Eileen Larrabee, a spokeswoman for the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, said the cuts were needed because despite efforts to make up for the loss of 16 percent of the department's operating funding over the last two years, a $5 million shortfall remained. About 100 parks and historic sites across the state will see some reductions in services, Ms. Larrabee said, but the cuts for Long Island parks are the greatest. 
 That has some local state legislators upset.
 Assemblyman David G. McDonough, a Republican from Merrick whose district includes Jones Beach, said: ''Long Island contributes more to the state than any other area. Jones Beach is the world's largest public beach, and this is the worst place they can attack.'' 
 State Senator Charles J. Fuschillo Jr., also a Republican from Merrick, agreed.
 ''Families who are trying to save money in this economy by not going away on vacation will be relying even more on Jones Beach and other local parks for recreation,'' he said. ''It is a shame that Long Islanders must suffer these service cuts while being asked to pay more in taxes and fee increases.''
 Ronald Foley, regional director of the state parks office for Long Island, said the department tried to spread the shortfall among all state parks. ''Some of the difference was made up by increasing fees for activities like golf and camping, as well as the annual entrance fee, and hiring fewer seasonal employees,'' he said. 
 For example, about 50 lifeguards usually hired annually at Jones Beach to replace those who do not return will not be added. 
 But when those changes reduced the deficit by only half, Mr. Foley said, ''We had to figure out what we could close or change that would affect the smallest number of people.'' 
 The primary users of the East Bathhouse pool during the week were day campers, Mr. Foley said. They will have use of the West Bathhouse pool.
 The West End 1 beach has been closed for 10 years and is now the home of the Theodore Roosevelt Environmental Nature Center. 
 With the additional closing of the West End 2 beach, elected officials and lifeguard supervisors have raised concerns that the remaining beaches will be crowded and that there will be a greater burden on fewer lifeguards.
 Tom Donovan, president of the Jones Beach Lifeguard Corps, which represents 487 lifeguards at the various state parks on Long Island, said the summer ''will be quite challenging.''
 ''SURE, we're concerned that cutting back on the beaches will overcrowd other beaches,'' he said. ''With 50 fewer lifeguards, we have fears of chaotic situations that can create potential risks like medical issues or lost children.''
 The other cuts planned for parks on Long Island are: closing Caleb Smith State Park Preserve on Mondays and Tuesdays (previously closed on Mondays only) and reducing public fly-fishing hours; closing Caumsett State Historic Park early on weekdays (at 5 p.m.); shortening the swimming season by four weeks at Heckscher State Park; closing the carousel at Hempstead Lake State Park on weekdays; shortening the summer season by four weeks at the Field 2 beach area at Robert Moses State Park; and reducing theater, concert and cultural programs at all the parks. 
 Ms. Larrabee said she was optimistic that the changes would be only for the short term.
 ''While of course we don't know what will happen with the economy, we hope to return to a full operating schedule next year,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Refurbishing Normal

BYLINE: By ROB WALKER

 BODY:
'NORMAL' BATHROOMS
 Last year, The Journal of Industrial Ecology published a comprehensive analysis of the ''consumption drivers of the Danish bathroom boom.'' O.K., that sounds pretty esoteric. But the study's authors, Maj-Britt Quitzau and Inge Ropke, were getting at a bigger idea that's easy to relate to: How do consumers decide, in our relationship with material culture, what is ''normal''? The authors documented how the ways in which some Western homeowners answered that question between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s had some negative ecological consequences. 
 Clearly our notions of ''normal'' change as a result of innovations or economic circumstances or even the vagaries of fashion. Quitzau and Ropke were looking at the way people in one country think about one room, but the pattern is familiar. A century ago, having a bathroom at all was ''a sign of status,'' they wrote. Gradually the bathroom became normal, as did more frequent showering and so on. And around the mid-1990s, a new wave of bathroom remodeling transformed a previously function-oriented and hygienic aesthetic into one of ''identity formation.'' 
 Consumers spent more and more time in the bathroom with a new array of personal-care products needing more space. Double sinks offered togetherness; elaborate spa tubs offered escape. Now a showroom of sorts, the bathroom required high-end materials. Additional bathrooms eliminated wait time; even television sets and radios popped up in what was becoming, for some, a ''retreat.'' Not surprisingly, the cumulative effect included using a lot more water and energy. Observers of the American remodeling business have seen similar trends. One bathroom addition that's been popular in recent years: ''body spray'' showers that blast you from multiple directions, a no-doubt luxurious experience that uses a tremendous amount of water. 
 Today, given that many Americans' consumption patterns have been affected by the economic slowdown, it's interesting to consider whether a version of normal might emerge that is more environmentally sound. There's at least some anecdotal evidence for this, but it's tentative; the shifts Quitzau and Ropke documented shouldn't be expected to disappear in a year or two. Lately, Home Depot has pulled the plug on an effort to cater to luxury remodeling projects, and the construction business in general is slumping. But the downturn seems to be making more homeowners interested in efficiency -- a new motivation for exploring ''green'' ideas, even when they involve higher upfront costs. For now, notes Sal Alfano, editorial director of Remodeling, a trade publication, ''green is alive and kicking.'' 
 That said, there are hurdles to this theoretical new normal. For one, remodelers who specialize in eco-friendly projects say many homeowners still tend to focus on green stuff rather than green performance. It's easier to imagine friends being impressed by the virtue of your recycled-glass bathroom tiles than by properly sealed air-conditioning ducts, even though more systemic projects have ''orders of magnitude'' more impact, says Paul Eldrenkamp, president of Byggmeister Inc., a builder in Newton, Mass. But since redefining what's normal is invariably a step-by-step process, maybe one small green decision can lead to another. Michael Anschel, founder of Otogawa-Anschel Design-Build in Minneapolis, helped create a variety of eco-oriented certification tools that give homeowners a checklist that ideally prods them to keep green-ifying with every home project. Benchmarks a consumer can track make for ''better backyard-barbecue conversation,'' he suggests. 
 A tougher barrier may be that consumers simply dislike anything that feels like a step backward. ''No one has ever said, 'My water pressure is too high' or 'I want one sink instead of two,' '' says Michael Strong of Brothers Strong, contractors in Houston. Quitzau and Ropke suggest it would certainly take a long time for what they call our ''bathroom dreams'' to prize sustainability and efficiency over the notions they wrote about. In the short term, Quitzau told me in an e-mail message, the typical homeowner may simply postpone renovation decisions (and use the body spray less often) and hope that things return to, you know, normal. Interestingly, one of Strong's tactics in prodding clients to go greener is to get their children involved in renovation decisions; kids these days, he observes, are often more knowledgeable about eco-issues than their parents are. Maybe a new normal will take another generation to set in.

HEADLINE: Max Is Back, and He's Madder Than Ever

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

DATELINE: HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. 

 BODY:
 WHEN I first rode the new-for-2009 VMax from the Star Motorcycles division of Yamaha, there was something familiar in its manner that I couldn't quite place. Something to do with how I felt after each ride, walking away with my hands tingling and ears ringing -- a feeling that I imagine jackhammer jockeys know all too well.
 The VMax is a hulking machine: straddle the beast, grab the handlebars, fire it up and feel the ground shake as an angry roar erupts from the 197-horsepower V-4 engine. The bike's rocket-launcher quad exhausts snort like an aggrieved warthog -- an image reinforced by the gaping air-intake snouts on either side of the engine.
 The VMax will rip through a quarter-mile run in 10 seconds. It doesn't carve sweeping corners; it grinds them into submission. Traffic isn't so much handled as exorcised. 
 It took several days, but this beast's hint of familiarity finally came to me: years ago, when my dad and I were building a corral, we rented a gas-powered post-hole digger. The unwieldy contraption would drive an auger about four feet long into the hard-packed ground for anyone gutsy enough to grab the handlebars on either side and fire it up.
 With a fury I've seldom experienced, the digger would obliterate everything in its path as it began gouging its way toward the center of the earth. Riding the VMax was a lot like going a few rounds with that digger. 
 Even parked, the VMax looks as if it is sizing you up -- a penned rodeo bull waiting for a cowboy. What do you have planned for the next eight seconds, sodbuster?
 The VMax earned its reputation for raw power decades ago. The original 1,198 cc V-Max first arrived as a 1985 model; in motorcycle years, that's an eternity. Offered for more than two decades, it was one of the longest-lived, least-changed motorcycles ever built. 
 Twenty-five years ago, the V-Max (the name was hyphenated then) had to overcome a good deal of skepticism. Would an unusual-looking, Japanese-made, 4-cylinder, water-cooled, shaft-driven power cruiser sell in America? Remember, this was the land of the free, home of the brave and birthplace of the cult of air-cooled Harley-Davidson V-twins.
 But the V-Max's 133-horsepower V-4 proved to be a wake-up call for thrill-seekers, who quickly became addicted to the visceral straight-line acceleration. Never mind that the V-Max turned corners as nimbly as a container ship and was a handful to stop. It was just ugly enough, with its tortured plumbing, to be bulldog-beguiling.
 But as the years passed, the V-Max kept selling. Other makers began to consider the virtues of a such a modern, high-output engine in a cruiser. Even Harley-Davidson, in conjunction with Porsche, came out with a water-cooled power cruiser, the V-Rod, for 2002.
 But the V-Max remained unchanged. Why? Yamaha says it spent nearly a decade fiddling with prototypes. Progress came when it decided that any new V-Max must have a 200-horsepower engine. More power was needed after competitors raised the ante.
 The designers preserved the quintessential V-Max look, but the engineers changed virtually everything else. A new V-4 engine now displaces a stout 1,679 cc. Claimed horsepower at the crankshaft is 197 at 9,000 r.p.m. The torque, worthy of a pile-driver -- 122 pound-feet -- peaks at 6,500 r.p.m. That merely makes the new VMax (now without the hyphen), according to Star, ''the most powerful series-production motorcycle ever.'' Top speed is electronically limited to 137 miles an hour. 
 A 5-speed transmission is fitted -- a 6-speed might have been too fussy and fragile -- it has a slipper clutch intended to permit downshifts without skidding the rear tire.
 Bringing the power into the 21st century required dumping the old flex-prone steel chassis. So a cast-aluminum frame, using the engine as a stressed member for added rigidity, was developed, and there's a new alloy swing arm. Power is sent to the fat 200-millimeter-wide rear tire via a shaft drive. 
 The new chassis curbs unruly behavior. With so much power and low-end torque, performing a wheelie ought to be easy, but with this one it isn't.
 The thick 52-millimeter front fork is adjustable for preload as well as for compression and rebound damping, and has 4.7 inches of travel. Similar adjustments can be made on the rear shock. Tools-free knurled knobs allow easy dialing of settings at both ends (a screwdriver is needed to adjust front compression). The rear end also has a hydraulic preload adjuster that can be altered on the fly.
 When it comes time to shed speed, the '09 VMax comes through with standard antilock brakes with Brembo master cylinders operating a pair of 6-piston front calipers up front and a single rear caliper. Keeping up with the latest trends, the rotors are wave-style, displaying a scalloped design around the perimeter. 
 Despite all the attempts to keep weight in check -- the generous use of aluminum components and plastic trim -- the VMax weighs in at a disappointing 683 pounds, the better part of 100 pounds more than its predecessor. Many exterior trim parts, including the fenders, side covers, seat cowls and faux fuel tank covers (the real 4-gallon gas tank is under the seat), are available in carbon fiber as accessories, but they are dear: a set of carbon-fiber air intake scoops, which look very cool, costs $1,000 extra. 
 The weight, coupled with the thirsty V-4, results in fuel economy that topped out at around 30 miles a gallon in my testing; press the VMax hard and you can expect a drop into the teens. I once used two gallons to travel 35 miles.
 This is already an expensive motorcycle, with a $17,990 price tag. But an exclusive clientele is all that is sought. Star said the first-year production of just 2,500 units was mostly pre-sold. 
 It is possible to loaf around town like a responsible citizen, although the bike is a bit unwieldy at lower speeds. Can the VMax meet everyday transportation needs? Yes, if those needs include 2.7-second runs from zero to 60 m.p.h., as it did in testing by Cycle World. 
 This is a motorcycle meant for experienced riders. Excessive enthusiasm on cold tires could have disastrous consequences. Looking for a politically correct two-wheeler? Buy a scooter. 
 The essential character of the VMax has changed from an ultimate performance bike to one that's more about big numbers. Yes, it has gaudy horsepower numbers, but its biggest number is its weight, which handicaps its abilities on the road or the track, leaving it to lag behind the top supersport machines.

HEADLINE: The PC Doesn't Have to Be an Anchor

BYLINE: By RANDALL STROSS. 
Randall Stross is an author based in Silicon Valley and a professor of business at San Jose State University. E-mail: stross@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FOR years, portable computers were second-class citizens in the Republic of Computing. These were the auxiliary machines, adjuncts to the muscle machines on or below the desk. They were expensive, underpowered and, in the early years, much too large for anyone then to call them ''laptops'' or ''notebooks.'' In 1983, the Compaq Portable weighed 28 pounds, more than enough to set one's shoulder throbbing halfway down an airport concourse; it cost $2,995 for one floppy-drive or $3,950 for two. 
 Today, notebooks are second class no more. More notebook machines will be sold worldwide this year than desktops, the first time in the industry's history, according to the research firm IDC. In the United States, the milestone has already been reached: last year, notebook sales passed those for desktops. 
 J. T. Wang, chairman of Acer Inc., says he expects its shipments of desktop PCs to fall 5 to 10 percent in the second quarter, versus the period a year ago. But shipments of its notebook PCs will probably rise 35 to 40 percent in the same period, Mr. Wang said.
 Here's some of the most telling evidence of the notebook's ascendance: At Fry's Electronics in Palo Alto, Calif., the notebooks take up more shelves than desktops: no fewer than 59 models of Windows notebooks are on display.
 The growth in the notebook segment, even during the recession, should be understood as part of a larger shift from stationary to mobile computing. It's the same trend that contributes to growing sales of smartphones, which also serve as featherweight computing devices. 
 A relatively new category of device, the netbook -- a small, extremely light and extremely inexpensive notebook -- is enormously popular. For computer hardware companies, portable computing is where innovation abounds.
 The premium that consumers have paid for the privilege of having a portable computer has shrunk greatly or, in some cases, disappeared -- thanks to advances in semiconductor technology, increased competition and other factors. This month, AT&T introduced into two test markets, Atlanta and Philadelphia, a $99.99 mini-laptop for customers who commit to a two-year data plan. Other carriers may experiment with offering free mini-laptops to subscribers. 
 In 2004, only 2 percent of notebook computers sold in the United States cost less than $800. In 2008, some 35 percent did, according to data collected by the NPD Group, another research firm.
 Prices for desktops, which averaged about half the price of notebooks five years ago, had less room to fall, but indeed they have. At Fry's, an eMachines system, made by a unit of Acer and having 3 gigabytes of memory and a 320-gigabyte hard drive, sells for $379.99. It isn't even the least expensive one on the shelf. Hewlett-Packard, under its Compaq brand, offers a slower model with less memory for only $269.99. 
 Concerning H-P's decision to do battle at the low end of the market, as well as the high-end segments, John Cook, vice president for marketing in its consumer PC business unit, said: ''You have to show up; you have to meet those price points. We wanted to go head to head with eMachines, and the Compaq brand has been very useful: we call it internally our 'street fighter.' ''
 The desktop units of H-P and eMachines are responding to a shared challenge: more shoppers who are looking for machines that provide only ''good-enough computing,'' according to Doug Bell and David Daoud, analysts at IDC. Last month, the two released a five-year forecast for PC sales worldwide, saying that sales of desktop PCs in the United States would ''consistently shrink throughout the entire forecast period.''
 Mr. Cook hopes to sell high-end PCs to those needing a professional ''creation station'' and to families wanting home entertainment hubs. But he says he knows there are ''a whole bunch of people who are very value-conscious.' '' 
 Prices at the low end have tugged down those in every other segment. Even the computers that Mr. Cook calls ''high end'' now cost only $800 to $900. 
 STEPHEN BAKER, vice president for industry analysis at the NPD Group, is concerned that many netbook customers do not realize that the tiny machines do not have the same performance as a full-size laptop. ''People are seduced by the netbook's low price,'' he said.
 Netbooks' limitations can be remedied, however. With the help of semiconductor companies that also supply cellphone manufacturers, netbooks are poised to improve their performance in what matters most to their users -- what Mr. Cook at H-P refers to as ''information snacking.''
 A netbook does not need the world's most powerful microprocessor on board, because the constant connection to the Internet endows even the least expensive version, or an even smaller smartphone, with the supplemental power of acres of server computers that reside in the cloud and provide the power of a virtual supercomputer.
 When netbooks display Web pages with a nice snap, and still go all day on a single battery charge, the desktop will be outnumbered at an even faster rate -- eventually making it a vestige of an earlier time, before computing became fully mobile and genuinely personal.
 The inert desktop is as aptly called a ''personal computer'' as a grandfather clock is called a ''personal time-keeping device.'' It's always at your service -- until you leave the room.

HEADLINE: Career Switching: What to Know

 BODY:
Nonprofit work, from fund-raising for local charities to leading international aid organizations, is popular with career changers who, after years in business or feeling disaffected in their jobs, want to give back or infuse their work with meaning. Leaders advise retraining, or at least readjusting your for-profit worldview. 
 JOB MARKET In this economy, it's anybody's guess. But if history is a guide, the field will outpace employment rates in commercial and government sectors. Even with marketplace uncertainty, forecasters at the Center on Wealth and Philanthropy at Boston College stick by the lower end of a 2005 estimate of $21 trillion to $55 trillion in charitable gifts through 2052. The Bridgespan Group (www.bridgespan.org), which helps executives make transitions to nonprofits, says the field will need 640,000 new senior managers by 2016 -- worst-case scenario, 330,000. 
 EXPECTED EARNINGS Salaries vary with an organization's size, location and scope but can be 20 percent to 50 percent less than in the for-profit world. Career changers with nonprofit degrees or certificates can add $20,000 to $40,000 to earnings, with a starting salary that could reach $60,000, according to the Association of Fundraising Professionals. Chief executives draw an average of $115,000, up to nearly $1 million for major foundations. 
 Women, who make up more than 70 percent of the nonprofit workforce, earn significantly less: those who are fund-raisers make an average $66,626, compared with $85,848 for men.
 WHERE TO GET TRAINING Case Western Reserve, Indiana University, Seton Hall and the University of San Francisco are the seniors of the field, with nonprofit degrees and certification established in the late 1980s and '90s. Since then, the number of schools has ''mushroomed,'' says Roseanne Mirabella, a professor at Seton Hall, who has compiled details on 292 undergraduate, graduate and certificate programs (academic.shu.edu/npo/). Regis University has a Master of Nonprofit Management degree that can be earned completely online. Columbia just began one in fund-raising management through its school of continuing education. New York University created its Master of Science in Fundraising in 2006 and also offers courses for professional credentials as well as certificate programs.

HEADLINE: Commuters Suspect Right: Their Ranks Are Thinning

BYLINE: By DIANA MARSZALEK and ANNIE CORREAL

 BODY:
WITH a daily round-trip commute between Westport, Conn., and White Plains, Chris Herrmann knew all too well the nuances of traffic along the route --that brake lights and subsequent backups would begin in certain spots and that Thursday nights preceding long weekends were especially long drives.
 Not anymore, however. ''About six months ago something just changed,'' said Mr. Herrmann, 47, a radio station program director. 
 ''It's almost as if they told 30 percent of the drivers to stay home,'' he said, adding that his commuting time has dropped from more than an hour on bad days to as little as 35 minutes now. ''I have rarely been caught in traffic since.''
 Mr. Herrmann's experience is not unique, nor is it limited to drivers.
 According to transportation officials, the number of commuters using trains, buses, roads and bridges that serve Westchester is down by as much as 7 percent -- a phenomenon they say is most likely tied to higher unemployment that has grounded would-be commuters at home.
 ''A lot of it is related to the downturn in the economy,'' said Aaron Donovan, spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the Metro-North Railroad and bridges like the Henry Hudson, Whitestone and Robert F. Kennedy (formerly the Triborough).
 ''There's less need for daily travel -- and for daily travel around our region,'' Mr. Donovan said, adding that area roads and mass transit experienced similar declines during other tough economic times, like the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
 According to Metropolitan Transportation Authority figures, the number of Metro-North passengers was down 1.8 percent in January compared with January 2008. What makes that drop more significant was that in 2008, Metro-North had the greatest number of passengers, 83.5 million, in its history, Mr. Donovan said. That number represented a 3.9 percent increase over 2007.
 ''I've noticed a steady decline over the months,'' said John Rodriguez, 39, who works in advertising on Madison Avenue and commutes from Eastchester on the Harlem Line. 
 The decrease in ridership comes as the M.T.A. faces a growing budget shortfall, has proposed service cuts and is seeking more state aid.
 However, fewer commuters is not the primary cause of the M.T.A.'s financial woes, Mr. Donovan said. The larger problem stems from decreased revenue provided by real estate transfer taxes set aside for the M.T.A. 
 ''Those taxes are tied to the health of the economy,'' Mr. Donovan said, ''and those revenues are down more than 50 percent so far this year.''
 The amount of traffic on roadways has dropped even more than the train ridership has, the authority said. Traffic on M.T.A. bridges and in tunnels fell 7.3 percent during the period from January 2008 to January 2009.
 Traffic numbers amassed by the New York State Thruway Authority, which collects tolls in New Rochelle and Yonkers and on the Tappan Zee Bridge, show that the number of cars on Westchester roads has fallen. 
 The number of cars on the Tappan Zee dropped 3.37 percent in 2008 from 2007, authority figures show. The number of cars that crossed the bridge in January and February was down 6.46 percent from those months in 2008. 
 In New Rochelle, the number of cars passing through toll booths declined by 4.58 percent in 2008 from 2007. In January and February, the number of cars was down 5.8 percent from those months in 2008.
 In Yonkers, toll-paying traffic in 2008 was down 5.82 percent from 2007, according to the authority's data. In January and February, traffic was down 11 percent from those months in 2008. 
 The number of riders on Westchester Bee-Line buses in January and February dropped by about 4 percent from the previous year, said Lawrence C. Salley, the Westchester County commissioner of transportation. Overall ridership in 2008 was up by 6 percent from 2007.
 With a variety of factors, like snowstorms and holidays, affecting passenger numbers, he said it was too early to tell whether the economy is behind the dip in riders in January and February.
 Other transit officials, however, are more convinced that less-crowded roads and transit are primarily a sign of tough times.
 Though periodic dips in traffic can be pegged to many causes -- road construction, high gas prices and alternative routes -- State Department of Transportation officials said they believed the present decline is more likely tied to the economy, particularly because it has persisted after other problems, like last year's high gas prices, have subsided, said Eileen W. Peters, a department spokeswoman.
 The premise that fewer jobs mean fewer commuters is based not only on the decline in traffic counts but also on the long-term analysis of commuter patterns.
 People's trips to and from work account for 30 percent of travel, meaning a significant percentage of road and transit use is reduced when unemployed workers stay home, said Jeffrey M. Zupan, who, as a senior fellow for transportation at the New York City-based Regional Plan Association, studies traffic and transit-related issues in the metropolitan area.
 Travel is further reduced when unemployment runs high because nonworking individuals are less likely to drive to activities like shopping or entertainment, he said.
 That premise is also exemplified by declining numbers on the Long Island Rail Road, which serves a larger number of commuters than Metro-North and has therefore been hit harder by the economic crisis, Mr. Zupan said.
 M.T.A. figures show that the number of riders on the Long Island Rail Road, the busiest commuter railroad in the country, was down 4 percent in January, compared with January 2008 -- a significantly larger decrease than the one experienced by Metro-North.
 That difference, however, jibes with previous studies that show Metro-North serves riders traveling to and from New York City for a wide variety of reasons, compared with the heavier commuter orientation of the L.I.R.R., Mr. Zupan said.
 Meantime, travelers say they have mixed feelings about the newfound ease of their trips -- but, given the alternative, would rather keep commuting regardless of conditions.
 Peter Lonergan, 58, a clothing company executive from Weston, Conn., said he saw the changes to the New Haven Line commute between Connecticut and Manhattan that he has made for about 20 years.
 ''The parking lots are not as full,'' he said. ''There are less people coming to New York for work.''

HEADLINE: Why Credit Lines Are Drying Up

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
HOME equity lines of credit, sometimes known as Helocs, have been a popular financial tool for homeowners precisely for times like now, when it helps to have a monetary cushion in case of job loss or some other unforeseen fiscal glitch.
 These lines of credit essentially replaced savings accounts as the fallback, with many financial advisers counseling homeowners to keep a $50,000 line open at all times. 
 But that fallback is evaporating. Lenders in the past year have made it much more difficult to qualify for home equity lines of credit, and even those who do get them will pay a much steeper price in interest -- about 5 percent, in fact, which is higher than the average long-term mortgage.
 During the real estate boom years, home equity lines of credit commonly carried interest rates that varied in accordance with the so-called prime rate. Those with good financial histories could expect their interest rates to float about one half of a percentage point below the prime rate.
 Roughly a year ago, though, banks changed the terms of these loans -- along with nearly every loan in which borrowers took equity out of their homes. As the economy and housing market declined, it made little sense for banks to lend money on an asset that was becoming less valuable by the week, and in an environment where borrowers had a diminishing ability to repay.
 The first sign of a hiccup for home equity credit lines came in the middle of last year, when many banks began canceling unused portions of homeowners' lines of credit. Such measures presaged interest-rate increases. Since July 2008, the average interest rate paid on a home equity line of credit has been rising, even as the prime interest rate has fallen. The prime rate now holds steady at 3.25 percent. 
 In New York last week, the average rate for a home equity line of credit was 5.38 percent, according to Bloomberg News. In Connecticut it was 5.07 percent, and in New Jersey, 4.74 percent.
 Why the disparity? According to Cameron Findlay, the chief economist at LendingTree, an online mortgage lender and broker, New Jersey's borrowers have defaulted on credit lines at a lower rate than in many other states, and property values are dropping less sharply. So New Jersey's residents enjoy better interest rates. (And, no, if you live in New York you cannot jump across the border and get better rates from a New Jersey lender.) 
 This is not to say that it is any easier to get a home equity line of credit in one state than another. Mr. Findlay says borrowers with credit scores of at least 720, and a stable income that they can document, are good candidates for these loans if they have more than 20 percent equity in their homes.
 For a buyer to qualify for a traditional first mortgage, its monthly payment -- including interest, taxes, insurance and any association fees -- must not exceed 31 percent of his or her gross monthly income.
 Banks will also examine the borrower's combined debt-to-income ratio, which includes monthly debt payments like credit cards and auto loans. If, along with the first mortgage, a person's combined monthly debt exceeds 38 percent of their monthly income, banks will not offer a loan, according to Mr. Findlay. 
 On home equity credit lines, he said, banks will more closely scrutinize the combined debt-to-income ratio -- for instance, looking further into the borrower's past credit card bills to determine whether he or she tends to spend freely.
 Mr. Findlay said that another reason for the increasing expense of home equity credit lines was the diminishing number of banks offering these loans and the resulting lack of competition. 
 Banks that are struggling to reach profitability, he said, have had to allocate their money carefully, choosing the loan products with the biggest profit potential. In the current market, that is 30-year fixed-rate mortgages.
 Those homeowners who borrowed against their equity credit lines during the boom, meanwhile, should be thankful for the sub-3 percent rates they now enjoy. 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Findlay says that if the bank has not cut your equity line, you can start to breathe more easily. 
 ''If they were going to cut yours,'' he said, ''they probably would have already done it by now.''

HEADLINE: BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED

BYLINE: By CLIVE THOMPSON. 
Clive Thompson, a contributing writer for the magazine, writes frequently about technology.

 BODY:
Shai Agassi stood in a warehouse on the outskirts of Tel Aviv one afternoon last month and watched his battery-swapping robot go to work. He was conducting a demonstration of the curious machine that is central to his two-year-old clean-energy company, which is called Better Place. Agassi's grand plan is to kick-start the global adoption of electric cars by minimizing one of the biggest frustrations with the technology: the need for slow and frequent recharges. The robot is the key to his solution. Unlike most electric-car technologies, which generally require you to plug your car into a power source and recharge an onboard battery for hours, the Better Place robot is designed to reach under the chassis of an electric car, pluck its battery out and replace it with a new one, much the same way you'd put new batteries in a child's toy.
 Agassi told me previously that his goal was five minutes or less for the whole process. ''If we can't do this in less time than it takes to fill your gasoline tank,'' he said, ''we don't have a company.'' 
 On the day of the presentation, a group of investors and employees milled around, peering down with interest at the mechanism. The robot -- a squat platform that moves on four dinner-plate-size white wheels -- scuttled back and forth along a 20-foot-long set of metal rails. At one end of the rails, a huge blue battery, the size of a large suitcase, sat suspended in a frame. As we watched, the robot zipped up to the battery, made a nearly inaudible click, and pulled the battery downward. It ferried the battery over to the other end of the rails, dropped it off, picked up a new battery, hissed back over to the frame and, in one deft movement, snapped the new battery in the place of the old one. The total time: 45 seconds.
 Agassi -- a 41-year-old Israeli-American with a piercing stare -- beamed. ''Check this out,'' he said, dragging me over and pointing at a set of thick two-inch metal hooks on the frame. The latches use the same technology as those used ''to hold 500-pound bombs in place on bombers,'' he explained. Designed to release bombs with millisecond precision, the technology is also perfectly suited to keeping batteries safely inside the cars, yet allowing them to be extracted in a blink. Agassi obviously enjoyed the swords-to-ploughshares imagery too.
 Electric cars have long been a fetish object for environmentalists: electricity can be produced from wind, solar or nuclear sources with little or no CO2. But now even the auto industry seems to be taking the idea of the alt-car seriously. When the Big Three filed their restructuring plans earlier this year, all aggressively emphasized their intentions to begin producing electric vehicles and hybrids. General Motors has promised to begin selling its electric-powered Volt sedan next year. Toyota and other manufacturers have their own offerings as well.
 Yet all these alternatives suffer from a common problem: refueling. The most advanced electric car currently for sale, the Tesla Roadster, runs for no more than 250 miles on a charge, and others can do only 50 miles or so; then they require two or more hours of plug-in time to recharge. The problem of refueling is so significant that fans of electric cars have a phrase for it: range anxiety, the nagging fear that you'll run out of juice before you can find a charge spot and be stranded at the side of the road. It is the major reason that most Americans, even as they cheer on the development of low- or no-emissions vehicles, are leery of actually buying one. And if people won't buy them, carmakers won't make them.
 Agassi aims to solve this problem. Going country by country, his start-up firm has begun to construct what it hopes will ultimately be a worldwide network of millions of small-scale ''charging spots,'' parking-meter-like posts scattered around downtown areas and along highways. But crucially, he is also building roadside robotized battery-swap stations that provide fresh, fully charged batteries without having to wait hours for a charge. It's a dual system: on most days, his customers would charge their cars by plugging into a charge spot at home or at work; a long drive would entail pit stops every 100 miles or so for a battery swap. Agassi plans to make his money by buying electricity in bulk from solar arrays and wind farms and then reselling it to his customers.
 The idea is a little odd, to say the least: a car with a replaceable battery? It is also extraordinarily bold, requiring carmakers to fundamentally rethink the way they build cars. But Agassi, a charismatic entrepreneur who walked away from one of the world's top software jobs, is ''amazingly persuasive,'' Shimon Peres, the president of Israel and an admirer of Agassi's, told me. In barely two years, Agassi has persuaded investors to contribute $400 million, and several countries and states -- including Israel, Denmark and Hawaii -- have offered him lucrative tax breaks. The French automaker Renault is spending $600 million over three years to develop a car with swappable batteries, to be released in 2011. In Israel, where Better Place has already installed hundreds of its signature blue car-charging stations, Agassi is credited with convincing the nation's jaded political class that they have an opportunity to actually wean their country off oil. But the question is whether he can convince the most important group of all: customers.
 ''Some people say I'm missing the fear gene,'' Agassi mused when we first met in Tel Aviv in February, and I couldn't entirely tell if he was joking. Agassi has darkly brooding eyebrows and a square jaw, and carries himself with a granite self-confidence that is striking, even unsettling. When he came down from the hotel penthouse he was staying in -- he lives in California with his wife but travels to Israel often for business -- he greeted me in the lobby dressed in a sleek black suit with no tie. ''He has very high self-esteem,'' Idan Ofer, head of the Israel Corporation and Better Place's first big investor, told me. ''He sees himself as a world-recognized figure.''
 At age 14, Agassi persuaded his father to buy him an Apple IIe by promising him 10 percent of his ''lifetime profits'' from writing software. It turned out to be an excellent deal: at age 21, the younger Agassi founded TopTier Software -- which made portals to help companies organize their internal information -- and sold it nine years later to the German software giant SAP for $400 million. SAP put him in charge of developing new software for Fortune 500 businesses.
 ''I've learned every industry in the world,'' Agassi told me as we drank coffee in the hotel's business lounge. ''One day, it would be Apple and Sony. The other day it would be BP and Chevron.'' By 2007, Agassi had built his division at SAP from zero sales to $2 billion annually, and he was being groomed to replace the C.E.O.
 Agassi never regarded himself as a particularly ardent environmentalist. But in 2005, he attended a meeting of young global leaders at the World Economic Forum at Davos where they discussed the question ''How would you make the world a better place?'' After giving it some thought himself, he ultimately decided the answer was: By ending the world's addiction to oil, which would mean finally getting people to drive electric cars. Hybrids, he argued, were a half-measure. Alternative fuels like hydrogen or natural gas or biofuels weren't going to be readily available anytime soon. Only electricity fit the bill. It is plentiful, already widely distributed and can be generated from extremely low- or zero-emissions sources like solar or wind farms.
 The only way to get consumers to use electric cars, Agassi realized, was to solve the problem of refueling. That meant, to begin with, that some entrepreneur would have to build networks of recharging spots, going country by country. As he crunched the numbers, what really struck Agassi was how lucrative a business like this could be. Powering a car by electricity -- even relatively expensive ''clean'' energy like wind or solar -- costs far less than powering it by gasoline. The Tesla all-electric sedan, for example, uses about 1 cent of electricity per mile. A comparable gasoline car uses 16 cents of gasoline per mile. And with the United States market for automobile gas at roughly $275 billion, Agassi figured that a company controlling a world network of charging stations would become so profitable so quickly that it could subsidize its customers' electric cars, much the way mobile companies give out free phones to people who sign two-year contracts. The electric-car business, in fact, could function like the mobile-phone industry: you could pay, say, $10 for 1,000 miles, $20 for 3,000 miles, or perhaps a few hundred a month for unlimited driving.
 ''If I can give you miles in a more convenient, cheaper way than gasoline, you will take them,'' Agassi says. ''If your neighbor is driving an electric car and paying me only $30 a week for the electricity, you're going to buy an electric car, too. If I do it without killing your kids and the planet, then it won't even matter if it's cheaper or not; you will just do it.''
 In 2006 Agassi delivered a speech about his idea at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy, and then went back to his job at SAP. A week later, the phone rang; it was the gravelly voice of Shimon Peres. The Israeli president had been in the audience, and he practically commanded Agassi to quit SAP. ''You have to do this thing,'' Agassi remembers Peres telling him. ''If you don't do this, why would anybody else do it?'' Agassi also had another motive: SAP's existing C.E.O. had announced he was staying on for another two years, pushing back Agassi's possible ascension. He announced his resignation.
 Within months, he had acquired crucial political and financial backing for Better Place. Peres's support helped; the president wanted Israel to be the company's first test market, and Peres began working as an icebreaker inside the government, getting skeptical politicians to begin designing tax incentives and cheap debt to finance the firm. ''I convinced the ministers,'' Peres said. ''I helped him to break through.'' Peres also brokered an introduction to Carlos Ghosn, the C.E.O. of Renault-Nissan, who agreed to make the first cars with compatible batteries.
 Agassi received his first investment -- $200 million from Israel Corporation, a firm that owns many oil refineries -- after a single conversation with the C.E.O., Idan Ofer. ''He didn't have to sell the CO2 story,'' Ofer told me. ''Climate change is real. The CO2 equation has gone haywire. And coming from the oil business, I know that oil is becoming more and more difficult to find -- I mean, this planet, how much oil can you have?''
 But Agassi realized he needed one more breakthrough: some way to rapidly charge a vehicle. No drivers, he knew, will tolerate a two-hour wait to recharge when they're on a 500-mile haul. Then one day, he and an automotive engineer were chewing over an impractical method for quickly replenishing batteries. The engineer wondered aloud: Wouldn't the fastest way to charge an electric car be to simply replace the battery?
 It was, Agassi says, his ''aha'' moment. The auto industry's conceptual error, he says, is in regarding the battery as a built-in component of the car, like a gas tank. Instead, you could think of the battery as more analogous to gas itself -- an entity that goes in and out of a car as needed, owned not by the driver but by the company that sells you the fuel. Think of the problem that way, Agassi realized, and the recharging company could refill its customers' cars using battery technology and the existing electric grid without making any radical new technological innovations. The solution to electric cars lay not in re-engineering the battery but in re-engineering the car.
 To get a sense of what it would be like to actually use the Better Place system, Tal Agassi -- Shai's 33-year-old brother, who works as his global manager for infrastructure -- took me for a drive around Tel Aviv in a Renault Megone, a luxury sedan that had been converted to run on electricity.
 The car pulled into a parking lot that had been outfitted with Better Place's electric charging posts -- triangular columns that look a little like parking meters. Tal took a charging cord from the car's trunk; it was an inch thick and one end was topped by a nozzle that had several round, nubbly electric-socket prongs. One end plugged into the charging post; I took the other end, went to the car, flipped open a little flap and inserted the nozzle with a satisfying click. A blue Better Place logo began gently glowing on the meter, indicating that electricity was now flowing.
 ''We want to make the cord smaller and thinner, so it's more like a USB cord or a cord you use on your computer,'' Tal said. ''It's all about making people comfortable with the idea of using electricity in your car.'' Most customers, Agassi and Tal predict, will do the majority of their charging at home -- Better Place will include a charging cord free for any customer who signs a contract -- or while parked at work. They anticipate that their battery-swapping stations will be used for longer drives -- or in an ''emergency,'' like when someone forgot to charge up at home or needed to leave suddenly but hadn't finished charging. According to studies by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, almost 80 percent of American commuters travel less than 40 miles a day to work and back. Range anxiety is, in a sense, more about psychology than practical reality. Even today's average electric cars, with a 50-mile range, can cover most daily driving easily.
 Still, the anxiety can be hard to shake, as I discovered when we drove the Megone across Tel Aviv. When we started our journey, the battery stood at 90 percent; barely 15 minutes later, it was down to 75 percent. I found myself staring at the battery meter, realizing that if we kept up at this rate, we'd be risking a dead battery in another hour or so. That's another problem with electric cars: even if there are tons of charging spots, you still have to plan ahead.
 In an attempt to quell this anxiety, Better Place has designed software that effectively does the thinking on behalf of the customer -- providing directions to the nearest recharge location whenever the need arises. I headed back to the Better Place offices, where I met Barak Hershkovitz, a former doctor who is designing the in-car software. Turning on a modified G.P.S. device, Hershkovitz picked a route that a driver might select -- from, say, Tel Aviv to a town nearby. The device displayed the location of every charge spot and battery-swapping station along the way. With the G.P.S. mounted in your car, the computer would determine whether you could make your drive without charging; if you needed a swap, it would guide you to the most convenient swap station. When you parked to plug in, the system would tell you how full your battery will be depending on how long you charge. Hershkovitz showed me a virtual example. His on-screen car drove up a charging spot with a battery 49 percent full. The system told him that if he plugged in for one hour while shopping, it would rise to 66 percent. Another half-hour would get him to 79 percent.
 ''Now let's go to Sderot,'' he said, picking as his next destination the embattled Israeli city on the border of Gaza. ''It's a town which is under rocket attacks. Let's say that I'm afraid to park there, so I'm not going to charge.'' The system quickly identified two places where he could swap batteries along the highway leading to and from Sderot, so he could drive the entire 100-mile journey there and back without needing to park and charge.
 ''Electric vehicles are software-driven vehicles,'' Alan Salzman, Agassi's main American investor, told me. In his view, this makes Agassi -- who spent years designing precisely this type of complex software for mobile-phone and courier firms -- well suited for the job. ''You need a software-industry guy,'' Salzman added. ''He's the Steve Jobs of clean energy.''
 It is an apt comparison, perhaps even more so than Salzman intended. The automobile is going through a transition quite similar to the computer industry of the early 1980s, when nobody knew which company was going to dominate -- Microsoft or Apple? I.B.M. or Wang? -- and a company needed a talented pitchman like Jobs to make a compelling case for its own model. 
 The race to produce alternative-fuel cars is certainly confusing to consumers, because automakers are pursuing five or six different options. Many are planning to produce hybrids like the Toyota Prius, which includes a regular gasoline engine and an electric motor. In hybrids, an electric motor starts the car moving from a standing stop, saving precious gasoline, and the batteries charge whenever the car brakes. But a hybrid typically can drive only a short distance on electric power alone, so it improves the gasoline fuel economy by perhaps only 30 percent. A more ambitious alternative is the plug-in hybrid, which contains an additional battery and can be plugged in to get the charge as high as possible. These cars can drive for longer on pure electricity -- Toyota's plug-in Prius, due out next winter, runs for at least 10 miles at highway speed, but eventually the gas engine needs to take over.
 Electric cars, meanwhile, are coming in a variety of formats. Some are all-electric, like the Tesla Roadster. But other vehicles are not. The Chevrolet Volt, due out next year, runs for 40 miles on its batteries, and after the batteries die, a small gasoline engine under the hood turns on, powering a turbine that generates more electricity to drive the car. This ''range extender,'' as it is called, may become a common feature in the coming wave of electric cars, because it solves range anxiety in a way that is elegant, if not emission-free: if you can't find a place to plug in, you can just gas up.
 Perhaps the most ambitious cars are those that are powered by alternative-energy fuel-cells that take hydrogen and convert it to electricity to drive the car's motor, producing only a trickle of water as a byproduct. But hydrogen is not widely available. Last summer, Honda began releasing its fuel-cell Clarity -- but will do so only in small numbers (150 cars). And the only U.S. market for it is in California, where hydrogen can be bought in a handful of stations.
 So where does Agassi's Better Place fit into this electric universe? Because Agassi plans to buy only ''clean'' electricity, from wind and solar farms, Better Place customers will be, in theory, producing nearly zero emissions. But Agassi requires the cooperation of automakers. To use the charging spots, the electric ports on any car must be designed to work with the Better Place nozzle (or include an adapter); to reap the benefits of Agassi's battery-swapping stations, the entire car must be built so the battery can be removed from beneath. This is a serious engineering challenge: the batteries in electric cars can weigh hundreds of pounds.
 No carmakers other than Renault have announced plans to design cars to suit Agassi's grid. Sue Cischke, Ford's group vice president for Sustainability, Environment and Safety Engineering, told me that she found Better Place's battery-swapping ''an interesting concept.'' She continued: ''It solves this range-anxiety problem, and it's also a way to solve this problem of battery cost.'' But it requires carmakers to all agree to design cars around one standard-size battery bay. Cischke says she thinks it's too early to settle upon a single battery standard, because battery technology is still advancing, producing new potential styles of battery each year. ''It's, in my mind, going to be a long time before we ever standardize the batteries,'' she said. ''The chemistry is still changing, and it's still a developing technology rather than a mature technology.'' Designing a car takes at least one year and often several; making the wrong call on a standardized battery could be economically fatal for a carmaker.
 When I talked to John Hanson, Toyota's manager of environmental communications, he was candid about the problems that automakers have shifting to new models and new fuel structures. That's why his company is beginning with such a tiny run of plug-in hybrids.
 ''There is no market,'' he said, for electric cars, hydrogen fuel cells or even plug-in hybrids. ''People say, 'If you build it they will buy it,' but we don't know. Can we sell these in significant volume? Significant volume is important so that the manufacturer can make a profit, and you need significant volume if you're going to have a positive effect on the environment. What good does it do if we only sell 500 a year? We sell 175,000 Priuses alone in North America. Those are the kind of volumes you need to have to make an impact on the environment. You cannot expect manufacturers to do this at a loss; there has to be a response by the market. So not only are we being asked to invest in a technology and bring it to market; we're being asked to create a market that doesn't exist yet.''
 Agassi regards the various gasoline-based ''range extenders'' in electric cars with undisguised contempt. Indeed, he regards cars that rely on any oil at all with a certain amount of derision -- not merely because they cause greenhouse gases, but because from his perspective, oil simply isn't a very efficient way to store energy. To Agassi, it is enormously wasteful both in terms of physics and of economics. Far better to simply trap the sun's energy with solar arrays -- or wind, which is generated by the uneven heating of the earth by the sun -- and put it directly into a car's batteries. 
 ''You always have to start with the science,'' Agassi says, riding shotgun in his sister's hybrid. ''There's nothing better than taking a photon, converting it to an electron and converting that to motion. Physicswise, you can't beat that. The rules of energy conservation say that the minute you turn energy into a molecule'' -- into oil -- ''you've lost. 
 ''Everybody says we have an energy-dependency problem,'' he continues. ''It's not true. We have an oil-dependency problem. We can't make oil. But all the rest of the energy we know how to make. Seriously. We know how to make it.'' He was working himself up into a intense, nerdy lecture. Agassi is an extremely charming guy; he has the born salesman's ability read people and connect with them. But he also has the obdurate quality I've seen in so many people who are drawn to computer programming and logical thinking. Once Agassi has convinced himself of the optimal solution to a problem, he develops a nearly pathological monomania about it, disgorging encyclopedic data to buttress his points. As we drove, he delivered a passionate disquisition on the superior physics of solar energy.
 How much total solar energy, I idly wondered, hits the earth every day?
 To my amazement, he fired back instantly with a figure precise to the terawatt. ''By the way,'' he added, ''that's just the land surface.''
 Agassi does not appear to be worried that the automakers aren't lining up behind him. He argues that he doesn't need them: Renault's commitment alone, he expects, can produce enough cars for the 25 million potential customers of the grids he is laying out in Israel, Denmark and Hawaii, his first test markets. Renault has not announced how many cars it will produce, though Olivier Floc'hic, a spokesman, told me that the company ''intends to arrive on the market massively in 2011. It's going to be about global volumes. We're not talking about niche.'' By 2015, he added, the company plans for between 10 and 15 percent of its annual production to be electric.
 The small size of Agassi's test markets is also an advantage. Anders Eldrup, the C.E.O. of Dong Energy -- the Danish firm that will sell its wind-farmed electricity to Better Place -- suspects the country would need no more than 150 swapping stations nationwide. If all goes well, Agassi figures he and Renault will make enough money that competitor automakers will quickly follow. And there's the potential of moving into China, where electric cars are expected to sell briskly to an emerging middle class that has never owned a car and thus is presumably less conditioned to feel range anxiety.
 But the United States's market will be much harder to crack. ''Covering the United States with battery-swap is hard,'' says Richard Lowenthal, the founder of Coulomb Technologies, a rival firm that is creating its own network of electric-car-charging stations, beginning with San Francisco and San Jose. In densely populated regions, Better Place's model ''could work really well,'' he says. ''But in the United States, we've got a lot of places where people don't go very often. I'm thinking of Montana.''
 The problem is ultimately political. Everyone agrees that the government will have to spend a lot to create enough demand for alternative-fuel cars. Automakers want subsidies to offset the cost of developing them; consumers want subsidies to buy them; and people who are building electric charging networks -- like Lowenthal and Agassi -- are straightforward about the fact that they, too, need government money. ''I don't need a government handout forever,'' Agassi says. ''But we do need something for, say, two years, until there are enough electric cars on the road to make a viable market.'' 
 Agassi was pleased to learn that Obama's stimulus package included $2.4 billion in development grants for electric cars and plug-in electric hybrids, as well as tax credits for customers and $300 million for state and local governments to buy electric vehicles. But even all that money would put only an estimated 600,000 electric vehicles on the road -- close to 2 percent of the U.S.'s 251-million-vehicle fleet. A recent report by the Boston Consulting Group argued that for 1.5 million electric cars to be on the road in the U.S., Europe and Japan by 2020, it would require $49 billion to develop the cars and batteries and $21 billion to build charging networks. It is possible that some of this money will come from Better Place's profits. But Agassi cannot do it alone. He has figured out a way to get the electric car rolling. It just needs a little push. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 10, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on April 19 about Shai Agassi, an Israeli-American entrepreneur who is developing electric-car batteries, misspelled the model of a car his brother drove around Tel Aviv while being interviewed. It was the Renault Megane, not Megone. The article also referred incorrectly to a report by a consulting firm about the cost of getting electric cars on the road. The figures of $49 million for developing cars and batteries and $21 billion for building charging networks referred to the creation of 17 million electric and low-carbon-dioxide-emitting cars for Europe, not 1.5 million electric cars for the United States, Europe and Japan. And the article misstated the percentage of total cars in the United States that President Obama's stimulus plan would actually put on the road; 600,000 cars is about one-quarter of 1 percent of the 251 million cars in the United States, not 2 percent.

 An article on April 19 about the development of electric-car batteries referred incorrectly to a report by a consulting firm about the cost of getting electric cars on the road, and a correction last Sunday misstated part of that cost. The amounts of $49 billion -- not million -- for developing cars and batteries and $21 billion for building charging networks referred to the creation of 17 million electric and low-carbon-dioxide-emitting cars for Europe; the amounts did not refer to 1.5 million electric cars for the United States, Europe and Japan.

HEADLINE: An Easier, Yet Uneasy, Commute to Work

BYLINE: By DIANA MARSZALEK and ANNIE CORREAL

 BODY:
FOR years, Andrew Bernstein and his neighbors could never find seats together on crowded Long Island Rail Road trains.
 During the last year, however, those seats have become easier to find. As the number of L.I.R.R. commuters has fallen, Mr. Bernstein, 49, can sit with friends when he makes the trip from his home in Hicksville to his accounting job in Manhattan.
 While that may make for a more enjoyable ride, commuters say there is an eerie quality to the newfound space on the train, the likes of which Mr. Bernstein said he could not remember in the last decade except under extraordinary circumstances. 
 ''The last time I saw this was after 9/11,'' he said. ''It's probably as bad today as it was then.''
 Mr. Bernstein's experience is not unique, nor is it limited to railroad commuters.
 According to transportation officials, the number of commuters using trains, buses, roads and bridges that serve Long Island is down by as much as 7 percent -- a phenomenon they say is most likely tied to higher unemployment that has grounded would-be commuters at home.
 ''A lot of it is related to the downturn in the economy,'' said Aaron Donovan, spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the L.I.R.R.; bridges like the Throgs Neck, Whitestone and Robert F. Kennedy (formerly the Triborough); and Long Island Bus, which serves Nassau County.
 Mr. Donovan said that area roads and mass transit experienced similar declines during other tough economic times, like the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
 According to Metropolitan Transportation Authority figures, the number of Long Island Rail Road riders in January was down 4 percent from January 2008. What makes that drop even more significant is that in 2008, the L.I.R.R., the busiest commuter railroad in the country, had the greatest number of passengers, 87.4 million, in its history, Mr. Donovan said. That was a 1.5 percent increase over 2007. 
 The decrease in ridership comes as the M.T.A. faces a growing budget shortfall, has proposed service cuts and is seeking more state aid. However, fewer commuters is hardly the primary cause of the M.T.A.'s financial woes, Mr. Donovan said.
 ''Generally speaking, lower volumes on the roads and trains and buses and on our bridges and tunnels contribute to the weaknesses in the M.T.A.'s revenue,'' he said. 
 But the real problem, he said, stems from lower revenue from real estate transfer taxes that are dedicated to the M.T.A. ''Those taxes are tied to the health of the economy,'' he said, ''and those revenues are down more than 50 percent so far this year.''
 The amount of traffic on roadways has dropped even more than train ridership has, the authority said. Traffic on M.T.A. bridges and tunnels fell 7.3 percent during the period from January 2008 to January 2009. The average number of weekday Long Island Bus riders fell 7.6 percent, Mr. Donovan said.
 The number of cars traveling the Long Island Expressway, among the most closely monitored roads in the state, has dropped as well, according to State Department of Transportation traffic counts. The average daily traffic on the L.I.E. in 2008 was down 1.93 percent from 2007.
 Though periodic dips in traffic can be pegged to a range of causes -- road construction, high gas prices and alternative routes -- Department of Transportation officials believe the current decline is more likely tied to the economy, particularly because it has persisted after other problems, like last year's high gas prices, have subsided, said Eileen W. Peters, a department spokeswoman.
 The premise that fewer jobs means fewer commuters is based not only on the decline in traffic counts but also in the long-term analysis of commuter patterns.
 Trips to and from work account for 30 percent of travel, meaning a significant percentage of road and transit use is reduced when unemployed workers stay home, said Jeffrey M. Zupan, who, as a senior fellow for transportation at the New York City-based Regional Plan Association, studies traffic and transit-related issues in the metropolitan area. 
 Travel is further reduced when unemployment runs high because people who are not working are less likely to drive to activities like shopping or entertainment, he said.
 In addition, it is not unusual for a transit agency like the L.I.R.R., which serves primarily commuters, to be hit somewhat harder in tough times than those that serve a wider range of travelers, Mr. Zupan said.
 For example, M.T.A. figures show that Metro-North Railroad ridership in January 2009 dipped only 1.8 percent from the previous year -- a smaller decrease than the one experienced by the L.I.R.R. That difference, however, jibes with previous studies that show Metro-North serves riders traveling to and from New York City for a wide range of reasons, compared with the heavier commuter orientation of the L.I.R.R., Mr. Zupan said.
 ''Long Islanders tend to use the railroad less for nonwork purposes than Metro-North riders,'' he said. ''Metro-North has surveyed their customers recently and issued reports about the fact that they are not just a commuter railroad anymore.''
 Meantime, travelers say they have mixed feelings about the newfound ease of their trips.
 Chris Olsen, 26, a Manhattan resident who travels to Farmingdale for work, said the smaller crowds on L.I.R.R. trains is a topic among his colleagues at their company, which provides staff for other companies. He said they see the decline in commuters as a sign of today's tough times.
 Caroline Bock, 46, a graduate student who lives in Old Bethpage and drives to City College of New York in Upper Manhattan every Wednesday, said her trip -- which includes the L.I.E. and the Cross Island Parkway, goes over the Throgs Neck Bridge and winds up on the Cross Bronx Expressway -- has shortened drastically, from as long as an hour and a half to as little as 45 minutes.
 While there are fewer cars on the road, Ms. Bock said she had also noticed a smaller number of trucks, which she said did not bode well for the economy.
 ''It probably means that there are less goods and less sales going on out there,'' she said. ''Whoever thought less traffic would be worrisome?''

HEADLINE: The End Is Near!(YAY!)

BYLINE: By JON MOOALLEM. 
Jon Mooallem, a contributing writer, last wrote for the magazine about teaching endangered whooping cranes to migrate.

 BODY:
The stage lights went up at the Panida Theater, a classy old movie house in Sandpoint, Idaho, and the M.C. stepped out of the dark with one finger high in the air. There was an uprising of applause and cheering. Then, shouting like a head coach before a bowl game, she said, ''Sandpoint, are you ready?'' 
 It was a Friday night last November. All around the little town of Sandpoint, beetles were blighting north Idaho's pine forests. The previous day, the U.N. reported that emissions from automobiles and coal-fired power plants were collecting in brown clouds over 13 Asian and African cities and blocking out the sun. Iceland's main banks had crumpled, and American auto executives were about to fly to Washington in private jets to plead for a bailout. Off the coast of Africa, Somali pirates were hijacking oil tankers. But the folks at the Panida Theater wouldn't stop clapping. The Sandpoint Transition Initiative, a new chapter of a growing, worldwide environmental movement, was officially coming to life. 
 The Transition movement was started four years ago by Rob Hopkins, a young British instructor of ecological design. Transition shares certain principles with environmentalism, but its vision is deeper -- and more radical -- than mere greenness or sustainability. ''Sustainability,'' Hopkins recently told me, ''is about reducing the impacts of what comes out of the tailpipe of industrial society.'' But that assumes our industrial society will keep running. By contrast, Hopkins said, Transition is about ''building resiliency'' -- putting new systems in place to make a given community as self-sufficient as possible, bracing it to withstand the shocks that will come as oil grows astronomically expensive, climate change intensifies and, maybe sooner than we think, industrial society frays or collapses entirely. For a generation, the environmental movement has told us to change our lifestyles to avoid catastrophic consequences. Transition tells us those consequences are now irreversibly switching on; we need to revolutionize our lives if we want to survive. 
 Transition's approach is adamantly different from that of the survivalists I heard about, scattered in the mountains around Sandpoint in bunkers stocked with gold and guns. The movement may begin from a similarly dystopian idea: that cheap oil has recklessly vaulted humanity to a peak of production and consumption, and no combination of alternative technologies can generate enough energy, or be installed fast enough, to keep us at that height before the oil is gone. (Transition dismisses Al Gore types as ''techno-optimists.'') But Transition then takes an almost utopian turn. Hopkins insists that if an entire community faces this stark challenge together, it might be able to design an ''elegant descent'' from that peak. We can consciously plot a path into a lower-energy life -- a life of walkable villages, local food and artisans and greater intimacy with the natural world -- which, on balance, could actually be richer and more enjoyable than what we have now. Transition, Hopkins has written, meets our era's threats with a spirit of ''elation, rather than the guilt, anger and horror'' behind most environmental activism. ''Change is inevitable,'' he told me, ''but this is a change that could be fantastic.'' 
 After developing the rudiments of Transition with a class he was teaching at an Irish college, Hopkins moved to the English town of Totnes, and, in 2005, began mobilizing a campaign to ''relocalize'' the town. The all-volunteer effort has since been busily planting nut trees, starting its own local currency and offering classes on things like darning socks in order to ''facilitate the Great Reskilling.''
 More than 80 other initiatives across England have followed, including one in Bristol, a city of nearly half a million people. Worldwide, there are now more than 150 official Transition Towns (communities with an active group of citizens), and last winter, trainers from Totnes traveled the globe to run workshops, leaving activists on three continents to begin the relocalization of their own communities -- autonomously and with whatever financing they can raise. (The Transition revolution is, loosely speaking, a franchise model.) Sandpoint, Idaho, was the second Transition Town in the United States after Boulder County, Colo. They have been joined by more than 20 others in the last year, including Portland, Maine; Berea, Kentucky; and even Los Angeles. But the American arm of the movement is expanding far faster than it is accomplishing anything, which is why the event in Sandpoint that night was so significant. The Sandpoint Transition Initiative was the first in North America to hold this kind of coming-out party, meant to engage the community in its work. This constituted Step 4 in the 12-step Transition Process laid out in Rob Hopkins's Transition Handbook, the jargon-filled manual at the center of the movement. The handbook calls this event ''A Great Unleashing.'' 
 The Transition Handbook reads like an imaginative take on a corporate-management text. It recommends techniques for building consensus, from bureaucratic-sounding protocols like Open Space Technology to an exercise in which people decorate a potato like a superhero. ''The Transition model,'' the founder of one English Transition Town explained to me, ''provides a structure, a foundation for organizing.'' And along with Transition's emphasis on hopefulness over fear, this rigorous playbook seems to set it apart from earlier grass-roots crusades. It is, Transition leaders say, what they hope will allow the movement to bring in the people that conventional activists have failed to reach and, just as important, keep everyone focused through the messiness and disillusionment every community-organizing effort encounters and many do not survive. 
 At the Panida, the keynote speaker was Michael Brownlee, the director of the Transition effort in Boulder and a representative of Transition U.S. -- an even newer group that is forming to help the movement spread in America. He was like the Transition equivalent of a middle manager flown in from corporate. 
 Brownlee gave his own variation of the standard PowerPoint presentation distributed at Transition trainings. Up on the screen behind him came a slide showing the three convergent emergencies that Transition aims to help us through: climate change, the unraveling of the global economy and peak oil. The theory of peak oil concludes that the productivity of the earth's oil wells will soon peak -- if it hasn't already -- and, once production falls short of demand, the market for our fundamental resource will rapidly spiral into chaos, potentially pulling much of society down with it. 
 Brownlee spelled out some probable outcomes, quoting peak oil's pantheon of thinkers: Oil hits $300 a barrel by 2013. Middle Eastern exports cease. Things we take for granted -- supermarkets, suburbs -- quickly become impossible, and the world sinks into an ''unprecedented economic crisis'' that will ''topple governments, alter national boundaries,'' incite wars and ''challenge the continuation of civilized life.'' Brownlee paused after reading that last quote. He hadn't even gotten to climate change and the implosion of the American dollar. 
 It was all surprisingly easy to imagine. Lately, an apocalyptic bile has been collecting in the back of America's throat. Our era has been defined by skyrocketing line graphs, and it's easy to wonder if we have finally pushed something just a little too far and are now watching everything start to teeter over. Maybe it's not our dependence on oil, but the carbon we have plugged up the atmosphere with. Or global population. Or credit derivatives. We're all starting to career down the other side of that hill -- which hill, specifically, is up to you. But it's the shadowy side, and none of us can see the bottom.
 In Sandpoint, though, people were trying to move the stale chatter of environmental collapse out of the health-food store and into the 21st century -- to pull each incongruous part of their community together and make their town, collaboratively, the blessed place they all knew it could be. At a time when so much fuzzy energy for change ricochets through our culture, and even Chevron ads ask us to use less oil and harness ''the power of human energy'' instead, Transition seemed to offer this sold-out theater in Idaho both a vision and a lucid, 240-page instruction manual with which to give it a try.
 Would it work? Nobody could say. But as Brownlee finished, and the crowd suddenly re-erupted into applause, even just trying it seemed to feel wonderful. Next, a group of kids raced onto the stage in Sgt. Pepper garb, holding inflatable guitars. Later came a ''sustainable performance arts'' troupe (they use biofuels when fire dancing) and a woman who sang about rain and peace. By the time the last guitar duo performed ''Here Comes the Sun,'' everyone in the room was so keyed up -- so ready to turn the impending dark age of peak oil and climate change into a renaissance -- that no one heard the slightest menace in the line ''Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting.'' Or if they did, they just kept singing along anyway.
 The second phase of the Sandpoint Transition Initiative's Great Unleashing weekend began the next afternoon. A four-hour meeting was called to divide people into working groups, Step 5 in the Transition Handbook. Each working group would focus on a necessity of the town, like food, energy or transportation. They would develop projects, then research and write a plan delineating what steps Sandpoint must take in order to relocalize over the next several decades. The Transition Handbook calls this crucial document an Energy Descent Action Plan. Producing one is Step 12. 
 More than 100 people turned out for the meeting in the gymnasium of a local charter school. Everyone wore name tags. Richard Kuhnel, who started the Sandpoint Transition Initiative with some like-minded friends in his living room, drew a shining sun on his. 
 Kuhnel, 54, is a smiling stick figure of a man, with wispy hair and a whitening beard. He has worked as a software designer on and off since he was a teenager but also has a degree in ''ecosocial design'' from Gaia University. (He is Austrian and moved to Sandpoint in 1995 with his wife, an alternative-medicine practitioner.) Kuhnel organized the initiative's first meeting early last year after returning from a pilgrimage to Totnes, where he attended one of the first Transition trainings. He was attracted to the movement, he told me, because it alone seems to understand how to persuade people to address the world's gloomiest challenges without shoving them into denial or depression. ''We are not fighting against something,'' Kuhnel told me. ''We are for something. I wanted to be part of the solution, positively responding to all these challenges here in Sandpoint.''
 Sandpoint is a town of 8,100 people, rimmed by the Cabinet and Selkirk Mountains and bordered by picturesque Lake Pend Oreille. Like many Western towns, it is the mottled product of a century of migration. Railroad workers were followed by timber workers. In the 1970s, young, long-haired back-to-the-landers arrived, and many persevered even as northern Idaho ossified into a conservative stronghold. Last year, after the rise of Sarah Palin, who is a Sandpoint native, a local magazine ran an account of the couple of months she spent there as an infant before moving to Alaska. ''I was in the eighth grade,'' a former baby sitter told the magazine. ''I held her.'' 
 Transition seeks to ''unleash the collective genius of a community,'' as Hopkins often puts it -- to unify a town behind a single, critical purpose. And at first glance, unifying Sandpoint might seem impossible. But those living on the land, whether out of a left- or right-wing ideology, do have a lot in common, including an astounding amount of resourcefulness. Peggy Braunstein, who came to Sandpoint from New York 27 years ago, told me that for her and her neighbors, many of whom live off the grid, life without oil ''isn't so overwhelming or shocking. People here have already lived a scaled-down life. We've already bartered and shared, canned together.'' A local green-tech entrepreneur told me that Transition should not have too much trouble ''bridging the rednecks and the hippies.'' (''The best way to bring them together is a Willie Nelson concert,'' he joked.)
 At the charter school, everybody found seats in a circle. Many balanced legal pads on their laps. Kuhnel's wife, Berta, began by asking everyone to join hands. She instructed them to close their eyes and transmit energy around the circle in a clockwise direction. ''We're going to journey into 2030 and see what's there for us,'' she said. She told them to feel their bodies lifting into the clouds, falling back to earth as rain, then joining a river, ''flowing forward in time.'' The river ran through Sandpoint. It was the future now, and Berta asked everyone to look around: ''What's the technology? Is there technology? How do we dream? How do we live?'' 
 Sandpoint's mayor, a painter and former hardware wholesaler named Gretchen Hellar, was sitting next to Berta. When I asked her later what she made of the exercise, Hellar told me: ''First of all, I'm not a good-feelings, touchy-feely kind of person.'' She added, ''People wanted to talk about where we can put community gardens, how can we make our downtown more viable.'' John T. Reuter, a Republican city councilman a few seats over, told me that when Berta told them to hold hands, he was looking around the room, counting up the people he knew Transition just alienated.
 The crowd split into groups of nine to draw their visions. Bruce Millard, a local architect who builds with straw bales, quickly emerged as his group's moderator. Quite tall, with a ponytail and mustache, Millard bent over and drew several circles on his group's sheet of paper with an orange crayon. He envisioned a hub-and-spoke system: many villages, each with a different specialty, with downtown Sandpoint as a trading post in the middle. 
 The group started brainstorming, assuming there would no longer be cars or a power grid. One village might grow food. Another should educate children. 
 ''Where are we going to put the corpses?'' someone asked.
 ''Eat 'em!'' said a woman in braids.
 ''Can you just make a rule that everybody's cremated?'' a somber-looking woman in a blazer asked. Her husband was sitting with his face in his hands.
 ''Well,'' Millard said, ''it takes a lot of energy to cremate people. Besides, now we're getting into rules.'' 
 Millard's sketch happened to look a lot like the master plan of Fourierism, one of the most popular secular utopian movements in American history. In the early 1800s, Charles Fourier, a Frenchman, proposed, in a series of jargon-filled writings, a self-sufficient community model called a ''phalanx.'' A central estate or ''phalanstery'' would be surrounded by tradesmen's workshops, cultural institutions and farmland.
 Fourier was horrified by what he saw at the outset of the Industrial Revolution. His fears may sound familiar: that dishonest lending and capitalism in general would lead to the enslavement of humans by big companies; ''industrial feudalism,'' he called it. And, not unlike Transition, he aimed to overhaul society one phalanx at a time. Fourier claimed to have reduced all possible human personalities to a number of essential types. From there, it was simple math. He calculated that if precisely 1,620 men, women and children were collected in a 6,000-acre phalanx, they would -- all by merrily following their individual passions -- end up satisfying all the phalanx's essential needs. ''The new amorous world,'' he wrote, would rise out of ''the new industrial world'' by the force of ''passional attraction.'' 
 By the mid-1800s, more than 15,000 Americans had experimented with Fourieristic living, many drawn to its promise during a severe economic downturn. But Fourier's belief that acute scientific modeling could bring disparate people together didn't hold. It reflected, the historian Carl J. Guarneri writes, ''the naive faith that . . . Baptists would get along with freethinkers and intellectuals would make great farmers.'' Arguments tore phalanxes apart. So did debt. All but eight failed within three years.
 It has been an American impulse since the Puritans: feeling the world racing in the wrong direction and withdrawing to a small, insular place to start over. Hippies came to Sandpoint in the 1970s for similar reasons: to live solitary, self-reliant lives. But going back to the land was tough, particularly since many never lived on the land in the first place. (''I couldn't build things with my hands,'' one man, once part of a small commune called Huckleberry Duckleberry, told me. ''It was futile.'') By the early '80s most had either moved into town or left the region. 
 Now, maybe because our various crises have escalated, or because it costs so much to disappear into your own parcel of wilderness, opting out no longer feels like a possibility. One of Transition's more oblique arguments may be that we can't escape anymore. We have to work together to remake the places where we already live. 
 By now, around the charter-school gymnasium, one group was imagining year-round farmers' markets in the buildings that would, by 2030, no longer be banks. Another discussed bicycle parking and nodded benignly at a man who pictured everyone living in caves with Internet connections. Millard's circle was ticking off ways they could travel between the villages they had drawn. ''O.K., so we're walking, we're bicycling, we're skiing,'' he said.
 ''Kayaking!'' someone offered.
 Peggy Braunstein spoke up, worried about the snowy north Idaho winters. ''We've got a problem,'' she said.
 ''There's no problems,'' Millard told her. ''In a dream there's no problems. There's only solutions.''
 Karen Lanphear, who has been steering the Transition Initiative alongside Richard Kuhnel since its inception, found this portion of the meeting excruciating. ''I thought we squandered at least an hour or an hour and a half of people's time,'' she told me later. Lanphear is a commanding woman of 62 with short, styled gray hair and a doctorate in education. In many ways, she is Kuhnel's temperamental opposite. She feeds off his visionary energy but felt compelled to run their earliest meetings with timed agendas. 
 In the six weeks before the Unleashing, Lanphear met with the Downtown Sandpoint Business Association, the University of Idaho extension office and the branch manager for U.S. Bank. She was the keynote speaker at the Greater Sandpoint Chamber of Commerce's monthly Women in Business luncheon and penned six editorials on Transition for the local paper. Lanphear told me she has a gift for ''building coalitions.'' This was apparent. But it wasn't clear if everyone she briefed had the same frame of reference. Karl Dye, head of the Bonner County Economic Development Corporation, told me, ''All the things Transition's doing basically line up with what we're trying to do, which is create better-paying jobs.'' He saw a lot of promise in Lanphear's group, though he also said: ''If you start a business to produce food locally and there are opportunities to make money by taking it to other areas, you're going to do it. You may believe in Transitions and local production and local consumption, but hey, man, we're still Americans.''
 At the time of the Great Unleashing, most people in Sandpoint presumably hadn't heard anything about Transition. But the ones who had often found a way to interpret the movement as extensions of their own visions. Having watched second- and third-home owners, retirees and tourists rush into Sandpoint, many latched on to Transition's vague promise of building a better, quainter community. A minister told me she was glad that Transition wasn't ''a greenie, hippie, far-out thing.'' But Michael Boge, the City Council president, seemed to complain of exactly that, telling me he didn't understand why the group had to cheapen a good idea by ''inventing a new word for it and wrapping themselves in that catchphrase.'' (The new word Boge objected to wasn't ''Transition''; it was ''sustainability.'') Still, Boge, who owns five drive-in restaurants and is active in a long-distance motorcycling club called the Iron Butt Association, told me that he felt allied with Transition's ideals. ''I've bitched about this to my friends for years: we need to make a concerted effort to get off fossil fuels,'' he said. ''And I truly believe that with the country and God behind us, we can do it.'' Transition was a prism, offering a slightly different view of Sandpoint depending on how each person turned it, but always shooting out lots of rainbows. 
 Transition's message is twofold: first, that a dire global emergency demands we transform our society; and second, that we might actually enjoy making those changes. Most people I met in Sandpoint seemed to have latched onto the enjoyment part and run with it. The vibe was much more Alice Waters than Mad Max. (Jeff Burns, a local food activist who joined the food working group, was a conspicuous exception. ''Some people on the food group want to feel good,'' he told me, ''and some people want to figure out how to feed 40,000 people in case the trucks stop rolling.'')
 Michael Brownlee, the keynote speaker from Boulder, sat silently in his chair during the charter-school meeting. That night, he told me that the unflinching cheeriness of everyone involved made him optimistic. But he also worried that people didn't yet understand that ''just because you're passionate about a particular issue like transportation or water or local food doesn't mean that you have the skills to do the research, analysis or planning around that issue.'' He later added, ''If I knew how to convey how serious, how urgent the situation is without sending people into fear and helplessness, it would take a great burden off of me.''
 During the next few days, I surprised myself by actually arguing with people in Sandpoint about whether they were doing Transition properly -- with enough intensity, given the stakes. ''I can't live with the ambiguity of pending disaster,'' Lanphear told me. ''I was raised to believe there are no problems without solutions.'' She said she didn't believe things would become as bad as Brownlee and others predicted. She had a lot of faith in the ethic and ingenuity of younger generations and also told me, contradicting what seems like a central tenet of Transition, ''I think technology is going to be one of our saving graces.'' 
 A few months after the Sandpoint Un-leashing, I went to a meeting of the new board of Transition U.S. in Sebastopol, Calif., north of San Francisco. The organization had just partnered with the Post Carbon Institute, another peak-oil-focused nonprofit group, and received $280,000 of seed money. The board had signed the lease on its new headquarters 12 days before I arrived. 
 Transition U.S. is designed to offer guidance to Transition initiatives forming around the country and to organize trainings. Already it had communicated with activists in more than 900 communities. Jennifer Gray, who started the second Transition Town in England and then went to California to found Transition U.S. last year, was spending most of her time fielding phone calls and e-mail messages. She took it as a good sign that no one in Sandpoint was reaching out to her. 
 Transition insists that initiatives be completely bottom-up organizations. There's no central oversight, and the movement is expected to evolve slightly differently wherever it springs up. The trajectory of each initiative shouldn't be controlled too tightly even by its local leaders; Step 11 in the handbook is really more of a mantra: ''Let it go where it wants to go.'' Like a Fourierian phalanx, a Transition Town should be the product of the passions of its residents -- all of its residents, equally. Unlike Fourierism, though, Transition doesn't claim its method is mathematically guaranteed to succeed. It simply posits that our best hope is to ''unleash the collective genius of the community'' and hope all the right pieces spill out. ''We truly don't know if this will work,'' Rob Hopkins asserts in a mission-statement-like document called the ''Cheerful Disclaimer!''
 Consequently, the structure Transition sets forth is intentionally very minimal, and improvisation is encouraged. The handbook's 12 steps needn't be done in order (Hopkins now calls them the 12 ''ingredients''), and communities are free to skip ones they don't find useful. Ultimately, the most profound thing Transition offers isn't a methodology at all but a mood. 
 ''The genius of the Transition message, as I see it, is that it takes what we should be doing to avert these crises and turns it into something that sounds inviting and positive and uplifting,'' Richard Heinberg, a Transition U.S. board member, told me in Sebastopol. Heinberg is an icon of the peak-oil fringe and the author of the seminal, comfortless book ''The Party's Over.'' In 2007, he published a wider-ranging volume called ''Peak Everything.'' Still, Heinberg said he worries that Transition risks losing people in the elation it inspires. He has been debating with Hopkins whether, in addition to devising a long-term descent, Transition should emphasize preparing for disasters that Heinberg says are unavoidable or already unfolding, like volatile gas prices or ''being sideswiped by economic catastrophe and weather disruptions.''
 Eventually he expects the energy grid to weaken or shut off entirely and, like Michael Brownlee, he told me he considers martial law or worse persecution possible as resources become scarcer. Jennifer Gray, meanwhile, told me she expects ''a big population die-off.'' Heinberg said, ''There's nothing wrong with being motivated by fear if there's something to be genuinely afraid of.''
 I returned to Sandpoint in late February. The 11 working groups formed at the charter school in November were meeting regularly. They ranged in size from half a dozen to about 20 people and were all filing minutes to a steering committee as they plotted their first projects. 
 Jennifer Gray describes one of Transition's goals as creating a ''parallel community,'' putting things like local power generation or local food networks in place to survive the slow crumbling of our current ones. But for the most part, the projects evolving in Sandpoint seemed designed to make the town's current infrastructure a little greener and more livable. One group hoped to facilitate energy audits, making Sandpoint's buildings more efficient users of the energy grid. The mobility working group, meanwhile, was planning to install a barrel of brightly colored flags at a dangerous intersection downtown. Pedestrians could pick up a flag and cross the street waving it, making themselves more visible to automobile traffic. Ideally, one member told me, they would persuade the city to put a traffic light there, ''but that's two, three years down the road.'' 
 I was also surprised by the degree to which Transition members were intermixing with city authorities. Shortly after the Great Unleashing, Shelby Rognstad, a young cafe owner and an early Sandpoint Transition Initiative board member alongside Kuhnel and Lanphear, was appointed to the town's planning and zoning commission -- a significant position, because Sandpoint was writing its first new comprehensive plan in 30 years. Rognstad spent the winter reading thick books on urban planning and cut down his involvement with Transition significantly. His outlook was changing. ''Philosophically, I want to look 100 years down the road and just shoot for that vision,'' he told me. ''But the city's only going to go for what's real and achievable right now, in this fiscal year, in this election cycle.'' He said he was thinking of running for office.
 Kuhnel was serving on the mayor's advisory council on sustainability, a panel that was assessing a proposal by Transition's food working group for an organic community garden.
 By all estimates, the food group was far ahead of the others. When Jeff Burns approached the city about doing a garden as a first project, the parks director immediately pulled out satellite maps and started recommending plots. The parks director and the mayor had already scouted locations for gardens and were only waiting for some kind of volunteer organization or beautification committee to come and ask for one. Transition was given a third of an acre of an unused athletic field near the center of town and agreed to help keep the rest of the property weed-free in exchange. The food group had already lined up donations of seeds and tools and had a built-in pool of exuberant volunteer gardeners. A groundbreaking party was planned for early May. 
 And so, the Sandpoint Transition Initiative was taking its first steps. They were baby steps and, it seemed, pointed in only the general direction of the revolutionary postcarbon future the Transition Handbook had called them toward last fall. Other working groups are now volunteering to help the Chamber of Commerce, which happened to be starting its own ''buy local'' campaign. Transition Initiative members will organize a contest to design the campaign's logo and will go around town, asking shop owners to hang up posters. Lanphear told me, ''As long as we get the work going in the right direction, it doesn't matter who gets the glory or the credit.'' Richard Kuhnel chose to see it in an even more positive light. He told me, ''I feel whoever wants to participate and whose ideas are aligned with ours, that's who the Sandpoint Transition Initiative is'' -- whether those people know it or not.
 ''I love Richard's energy,'' Councilman John T. Reuter told me during my last afternoon in Sandpoint. ''I can't say that enough times. I just think he's the best thing since sliced bread. But I guess I can't really say that because sliced bread is a problem -- that's part of the industrial-food complex. So he's better than that! Richard is the best thing to recover us from the crime of sliced bread.''
 Reuter is 25. Bearded but otherwise baby-faced, he is one of three City Council members under the age of 31. He comes from a family of Greek Orthodox sheep ranchers in southern Idaho and now heads the county Young Republicans. He talks fast, scurrying through wry digressions like a comedian at a Catskills resort. 
 ''Have you read Rob what's-his-name's book?'' he asked me, meaning the Transition Handbook. Almost before I could answer, he said, ''I read that whole thing.'' Reuter didn't like it, though. ''There's no question oil is a limited quantity,'' he said, adding that we should prepare for a life without it. But the handbook struck him as overly pessimistic, resigning humanity to the sort of druidic life people at the charter school were romanticizing. ''I guess I don't celebrate the loss of energy the way some of the people in the Transition group do,'' he said. ''I like having a dishwasher.''
 What Reuter said he felt was wonderful about the Sandpoint Transition Initiative was how quickly it was rejuvenating people's faith that the changes they craved were worth working for. ''To say the group has only created a community garden so far really isn't sufficient,'' he told me. ''It's something really more substantive: they're bringing people to the process.'' It was easy to argue that at the initiative's core, in place of any clearly defined philosophy or strategy, was only a puff of enthusiasm. But Reuter seemed to argue that enthusiasm is an actual asset, a resource our society is already suffering a scarcity of. ''There's just something happening here that's reviving people's civic sense of possibility,'' he later said. ''Politics is 'the art of the possible,' right? I think what the Transition Initiative is doing is expanding what's possible in people's minds. It is expanding people's ability to dream bold. And that's what we need to do: dream bold. Because people have been limited by their own imaginations.'' 
 More than anyone else I had spoken to in Sandpoint, including the initiative's own organizers at times, Reuter was able to articulate a cohesive understanding of what Transition was actually doing. The movement wasn't going to unify everybody in Sandpoint, he said: ''I know that's their dream, but I just don't see it happening.'' But it was inspiring for Reuter to watch the group emerge as one fervently turning gear in the larger mechanism of self-governance. 
 ''It's like any other civic organization,'' he said approvingly. It wasn't a very romantic notion, and maybe achieving that status so easily was a sign that the initiative wasn't really tackling the level of paradigm-busting work Transition wants to awaken us to. Maybe that will turn out to be regrettable. But, as utopian movements go, it also struck me as an unusually constructive outcome.
 Writing an Energy Descent Plan or building a parallel community -- bridges to carry us over the terrible time ahead and into a world we long for -- wasn't going to be Transition's strength or its usefulness, as Reuter saw it. ''Government used to be the place in our community where people came together and made civic decisions,'' he told me. ''That's what we should do again, and that's what's going to bring us back together: not having government be this force somehow outside of us, that's bearing down on us or annoying us, but as a force that we actually embrace and want and that does what we want.'' 
 Reuter had a utopian vision, too: the one laid out in the U.S. Constitution. And the Sandpoint Transition Initiative seemed to be moving Sandpoint closer to that ideal in its own small way, even though it was working out of a totally different handbook. They were managing to make the functioning democracy in their town a little more productive. For a wide range of not-always-consistent reasons, people in Sandpoint decided that Transition could help them build the world they wanted. And now, only because enough people stepped forward and made that decision, Transition actually looked like a good tool for the job. They were picking it up by whatever handle they grasped. They were swinging it as earnestly as they could.

HEADLINE: New York's Newly Jobless Find $430 a Week in Benefits Doesn't Go Far

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Lose your job in Boston, Pittsburgh, Seattle or Trenton and you could collect $544 or more per week in unemployment benefits. But get laid off in New York City, as almost 200,000 workers have in the past year, and the most you can collect is $430 a week.
 Despite its high cost of living, New York pays less to its unemployed than about two dozen other states, including all of its neighbors. New York's benefits have not been raised by lawmakers in Albany in more than a decade, making it particularly difficult for jobless residents of the metropolitan area to pay for food, rent and health insurance.
 Michael Sklar, 51, said he had resorted to asking his parents for financial help after several months of trying to support his family of three on the unemployment pay he collects from New York State. The federal unemployment insurance system was designed to temporarily replace about half of a laid-off worker's lost income, but Mr. Sklar's benefits amount to just one-fifth of what he said he had earned as a senior systems analyst for Sony Music Entertainment in Manhattan before he was dismissed in late August. 
 Most of his unemployment pay goes toward the $1,300 a month he pays to maintain the health insurance his family had obtained through Sony. To cover the rest of the family's expenses, including college tuition for his son, Mr. Sklar has been using his severance pay and savings, he said. He and his wife have cut out frills like movies and eating out. They occasionally attend free cooking classes at a Mexican restaurant in Hackensack, N.J., for the meals that come with them.
 Mr. Sklar, who lives in Fort Lee, N.J., said that he had considered filing for bankruptcy but avoided doing so by borrowing from his parents, who are in their 80s. ''I shouldn't have to turn to my parents, as a 51-year-old man, and ask for money,'' he said.
 Supporting a family on unemployment benefits can be a challenge anywhere in the country, even in Massachusetts, where the unemployed can collect more than $650 a week, the most in the nation. But the situation has become more acute in New York because its state unemployment insurance system does not adjust the level of benefits annually to account for inflation, as its neighboring states do.
 The unemployment pay that Alison Moran collects each week is just $25 more than she received the last time she was out of work, eight years ago. And that increase is only a result of the federal stimulus package.
 When Ms. Moran was dismissed in March from her position handling internal communications for a publishing company, she had a sense of deja vu about her unemployment pay.
 ''I was sort of surprised that it hadn't changed,'' said Ms. Moran, who lives with her husband in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. The state's top rate had been $405 per week since 1998 before it was temporarily increased to $430 by the Obama administration's stimulus spending.
 Legislation is pending in Albany that would raise New York's benefits gradually over the next few years to $625 a week. The measure, which has the support of organized labor but is opposed by business groups, has not moved out of committees in the Assembly or the Senate, said a spokesman for Susan V. John, an assemblywoman from Rochester who leads the Labor Committee.
 The proposed raises would have to be paired with an increase in the payroll tax that finances the insurance system, something that lobbyists for the business community have successfully fended off for years.
 Until state lawmakers agree to change the system, jobless New Yorkers will be left with benefits that would not cover the average rent on a studio apartment in Manhattan, still averaging nearly $2,000 a month. In Massachusetts, the maximum weekly benefit, excluding add-ons for dependents, is $653. It is $609 in New Jersey, $544 in Connecticut and $583 in Pennsylvania. Washington State's $566 benefit will rise to $611 in May. 
 Most New Yorkers who were earning more than $42,000 a year before they lost their jobs qualify for the maximum benefits. In New York City, nearly half -- 43 percent -- of the beneficiaries collect the top benefit of $430, according to the State Labor Department. Those who receive less than the maximum also collect less than they would in other states.
 The last time Ms. Moran lost a job, a few weeks after the 9/11 terrorist attack, she was just over 30, single and living in a rental apartment. Even then, the adjustment to living off unemployment checks was not easy, she said. ''It was tough to get by then,'' she recalled. ''But at least it covered the rent. Now we have a mortgage.''
 Ms. Moran has been able to obtain health insurance through her husband's job with the city. Otherwise, she said, it would have cost more than $900 a month to maintain the health plan her former employer provided.
 Still, her reduced income and the fear that her husband could also be laid off have caused them to change their spending habits in a hurry. He takes his lunch to work; dinners out and ordering in are rare; and they have put off vacation plans.
 Even younger, less encumbered New Yorkers are finding it hard to stretch unemployment benefits to cover life in the city.
 Cara Weissman, who cast reality shows on one of the MTV cable networks before she lost her job in December, said she was saving the cost of a monthly MetroCard by riding her bicycle from her apartment in Astoria, Queens. Some days, she pedals an hour and 20 minutes to the Fairway market in Red Hook, Brooklyn, and makes lunch of the free samples while she buys her groceries, she said.
 Ms. Weissman, 27, said there had been ''a steady three years where I really didn't have to worry about where my next paycheck was coming from.'' When she was told of her dismissal, she was shocked to learn how little she would receive from the state.
 ''I always thought it was a little bit more than that,'' she said. ''I thought it was 500 and something, or more.''
 More than a week's benefits are eaten up each month by the $514 premium she pays to maintain the health insurance she had through Viacom, which owns MTV, Ms. Weissman said. 
 ''I'm cutting down on luxuries I used to enjoy, such as taking the subway,'' she said. ''I don't go out as much as I used to, and if I do, I don't drink as much. I'll look for any happy hour I can find.''
 Plus, she said, she has found that ''friends are more likely to buy you a drink when you are out of work.''

HEADLINE: Getting on the Dole

BYLINE: By RACHEL AVIV

 BODY:
Last summer, Casey Hall lost her job as assistant manager of a gym and found herself face to face with an empty refrigerator. A sophomore at Southern Oregon University majoring in French and international studies, she was broke. It was food stamps, she says, ''or eat 99-cent boxes of Ramen and essentially starve.'' 
 As the economy continues to sputter, more young people are getting help from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. In Massachusetts, the number of college students receiving food stamps increased 27 percent from January 2008 to January 2009. The numbers of recipients who are 18 to 24 and living on their own in Oregon and Florida, which track by age, have risen by 31 percent and 52 percent respectively.
 Applicants must submit proof -- paycheck stubs, student loan documents -- that their net monthly income is at or below the poverty line, or $867 a month (the same cutoff as for nonstudents).
 Ms. Hall, who lives with a roommate off campus, is taking 20 credits and works part time at a clothes store. She now receives $175 a month, a sum that buys the majority of her groceries.
 She says she used to assume people receiving government assistance were ''abusing the system'' but has since re-examined her biases. Still, she conceals her benefits card when she scans it at the grocery checkout. 
 ''I grab the card with a really wide grip so no one can see the cover of it,'' she explains. ''It's so stupid. But I want to swipe it as quickly as possible so I can just put it back in my purse and move on.''

HEADLINE: W.P.A. Projects Left Their Stamp on the Region

BYLINE: By TERRY GOLWAY

 BODY:
WHEN the world's finest male golfers find themselves struggling to break par at this year's United States Open at Bethpage State Park in June, chances are they won't blame their plight on stimulus spending. But perhaps they should. After all, the rolling hills of the Bethpage Black golf course in Nassau County are a legacy of government efforts to create jobs and public works projects during the Great Depression.
 And when young professionals in search of housing tour a lovely Art Deco apartment complex in Jersey City with a magnificent view of lower Manhattan, they probably won't reflect on the vision of the city's fabled mayor, Frank Hague. But they ought to, because Hague put up the buildings in the 1930s, albeit for use as a medical center, not as a condominium project. 
 Bethpage State Park and the old Jersey City Medical Center were expanded with labor provided by the Works Progress Administration, one of the vaunted New Deal programs that put millions of people to work around the country during the Great Depression. They make up what the historian Nick Taylor called the ''invisible legacy'' of Depression-era public works projects in the New York region. ''That legacy is all around us,'' said Mr. Taylor, author of ''American-Made: The Enduring History of the W.P.A.'' ''We just don't see it because we take it for granted.'' 
 Suddenly, however, the work of the W.P.A. and other New Deal agencies has re-emerged as a model for the Obama administration's massive economic stimulus program, with its hundreds of billions devoted to rebuilding and modernizing the nation's infrastructure. Efforts like the W.P.A.'s flood-relief work in Hartford and the agency's expansion of Bear Mountain State Park in Orange County were typical labor-intensive jobs programs that left a physical stamp of Depression-era federal intervention.
 But the W.P.A. did more than build or improve highways, parks, schools and hospitals. Artists executed murals still on display in government buildings on Long Island and throughout Connecticut. Writers compiled archives in New Jersey towns that had limited or no organized records. Actors and other performers entertained audiences through the Federal Theater Project, a vibrant part of the W.P.A. 
 ''There's this stereotype that people who worked for the W.P.A. were all raking leaves,'' said Natalie A. Naylor, emeritus professor of history at Hofstra University and former director of the university's Long Island Studies Institute. ''That's not really accurate at all. You had music programs and art programs in addition to construction projects.'' 
 The city of Norwalk, Conn., has one of the nation's largest surviving collections of W.P.A. murals, thanks to a restoration effort in the 1980s that preserved nearly two dozen in the old Norwalk High School, now City Hall. The rescued artwork is on display there, while other murals decorate Norwalk Community College, the city's public library and maritime aquarium, and other public places.
 Though many of the murals depict scenes from local history, several are more exotic: Five murals by an artist named Arthur G. Hull illustrate imagined scenes from the travels of Marco Polo. The Hull murals are on permanent display in the Norwalk Transit District's headquarters. A spokesman for the Transit District, Louis Schulman, said the agency ''persuaded the city to twist our arm to use some federal money to document the city's mural collection.'' The agency photographed each mural and published a book about the collection several years ago.
 The scenes that decorate the headquarters of South Side Hose Company 2 on Long Beach Road in Hempstead, Long Island, are closer to home. There, on the walls of a second-floor conference room, are six W.P.A. murals showing the history of firefighting from colonial times to the early 20th century.
 In New Jersey, the W.P.A. commissioned an outdoor sculpture titled ''Light Dispelling Darkness'' by the artist Waylande Gregory. The sculpture, an optimistic piece depicting the victory of education and science over the forces of war, greed and materialism, has been restored and remains on public view in Middlesex County's Roosevelt Park in Edison, itself a W.P.A. project named in honor of the agency's patron. 
 The jobless, whether they raked leaves or designed works of art, were not the only people who received help from the W.P.A. Local officials like Robert Moses and Hague gained extraordinary power and access to federal dollars, albeit for different reasons. Moses, a Republican who ran for governor of New York in 1934 against Herbert H. Lehman -- the candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt had handpicked to succeed him -- benefited from W.P.A. spending because of the vast array of shovel-ready projects he had lined up on Long Island and elsewhere. Hague, who served as Jersey City's mayor from 1917 to 1947, developed a mutually beneficial political alliance with Roosevelt during the 1932 presidential campaign, when he turned out an enormous crowd for a Roosevelt rally on the Jersey Shore in Sea Girt. ''Roosevelt noticed that,'' said Thomas F. Banit, a history professor at Kean University in Union. ''He would have been satisfied with 5,000 people. Instead, Hague turned out over a hundred thousand.'' 
 One out of every seven W.P.A. dollars was spent in New York City in the mid-1930s, according to Mr. Taylor. Beyond the five boroughs, however, Jersey City became the epicenter of W.P.A. activity in the region. About $50 million in federal dollars flowed into Jersey City during President Roosevelt's first two terms, allowing Mayor Hague to build, among other things, the huge medical center that became his pride and joy. He named the center's maternity hospital for his mother, Margaret, and he kept a secret, paneled office of his own in the complex.
 ''It was three times bigger than the city needed, but Hague was thinking of trying to create a greater Jersey City out of Hudson County's smaller cities,'' said the historian Thomas Fleming, whose father, Thomas J. Fleming Sr., was a Democratic leader in the city's old Sixth Ward during Hague's era. The medical center moved out of the giant complex several years ago, and a number of the buildings have been converted to residential units.
 Jersey City may offer a cautionary tale about the ways in which extraordinary federal spending can become entangled with the ambitions and political machinations of local politicians. By the late 1920s, Hague seemed to be a spent force in Jersey City. He barely won re-election in 1929, and as the presidential election of 1932 approached, Hague threw his support behind New York's former governor, Alfred E. Smith, a Democrat who had lost the 1928 presidential election to Herbert Hoover. Smith, however, lost the nomination to his successor in Albany, Roosevelt. Hague found himself aboard the wrong horse, but he shrewdly made amends by orchestrating the Sea Girt rally for Roosevelt. That November, Hague's machine and influence turned out a huge vote for Roosevelt. The president remembered Hague when the time came to dole out the Depression-era's stimulus dollars.
 ''The W.P.A. was a godsend to Hague,'' said Mr. Fleming. ''Virtually every person who got a W.P.A. job in New Jersey was told he got it thanks to Frank Hague.'' The mayor was careful to make sure his patron received all due recognition. When the W.P.A. finished construction of a new sports complex in Jersey City, Hague named it Roosevelt Stadium. The ballpark, which served as home of baseball's Jersey City Giants, was torn down in 1985.
 According to Mr. Fleming's 2005 memoir, ''Mysteries of My Father,'' the elder Mr. Fleming regularly sent unemployed Jersey City residents to see the local W.P.A. administrator in the city, who found jobs thanks to his political contacts. But one supplicant was beyond such help. ''He was the son of one of Hague's enemies,'' Mr. Fleming recalled. His father used his political contacts to find the man a job in Newark, out of Hague's reach.
 Jersey City was hardly the only place where W.P.A. spending and politics became intertwined. The longtime mayor of Boston, James Michael Curley, was denied control over federal spending because, several historians have written, he did not turn out numbers for Roosevelt as Hague and other allies did. In New York City, Roosevelt and the head of the W.P.A., Harry L. Hopkins, kept W.P.A. spending and other federal money out of the hands of the Tammany Hall political machine, in part because it was the avowed enemy of one of Roosevelt's favorite Republicans, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia. A Roosevelt confidante, Edward J. Flynn, who controlled the Bronx Democratic Party, also had a hand in distributing W.P.A. money in his borough and elsewhere.
 Roosevelt's critics inevitably charged that the White House treated the W.P.A. as an arm of its political operation. Representative John J. O'Connor of Manhattan, a Democratic critic of the New Deal, charged in 1938 that the White House was using W.P.A. labor and money to support a primary challenge against him. O'Connor was one of several Democrats whom Roosevelt sought to defeat in the 1938 primaries because of their opposition to the New Deal, but only O'Connor lost. Flynn managed the campaign of O'Connor's opponent, James H. Fay.
 ''Politics played a role in the W.P.A., but Roosevelt told the nation in a fireside chat that he wanted to hear from citizens about ways to improve federal spending,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''He wanted to make sure taxpayers were getting their money's worth at the local level. Local politicians who had the ability to produce plans for projects were funded. Those who didn't, weren't.''
 Officials in the New York region were quick to take advantage of Washington's wish to spend as much money as quickly as possible. Hague, for example, had already begun work on the Jersey City Medical Center before Roosevelt's election. The W.P.A. money allowed him to expand the complex into the nation's third-largest medical facility. At Hague's insistence, the center offered medical care to all Jersey City residents regardless of their ability to pay.
 W.P.A. money and labor played a critical role in Connecticut in the aftermath of a huge hurricane in 1938 which killed more than 90 state residents. Hundreds of W.P.A. workers were dispatched to Hartford to build sandbag walls along the Connecticut River in the city's South End, enabling the city to avoid blowing up a dike elsewhere to help divert the river.
 On Long Island, Robert Moses began building his network of parkways and parks before the W.P.A. was created, but the new federal spending allowed him to expand his ambitions. W.P.A. money also filtered down into the Island's towns and villages. Schools, courthouses, firehouses and other government buildings were decorated with murals, many of them depicting scenes from Long Island history. 
 ''The artists researched local history and then depicted it in their artwork,'' Professor Naylor said. ''The idea was to record the memory of certain periods of history.''
 Oyster Bay was the center of Long Island's W.P.A. arts projects, perhaps because it was the home of Roosevelt's distant relation -- the other President Roosevelt, Theodore. The Oyster Bay post office was decorated with four sculptures by the Italian-born sculptor Leo Lentelli, while the town's post office featured six fresco murals, including one depicting Theodore Roosevelt and his children.
 For golfers, a visit to Bethpage offers an opportunity to play like the pros -- or not -- and a chance to reflect on the W.P.A.'s legacy to the world of missed fairways and unplayable lies. The park, like Hague's medical center, was begun before the W.P.A. was founded. But with the assistance of W.P.A. workers, the scope of the project expanded. The park's clubhouse and four of its five courses, including the legendary Black course, were either built or improved with federal relief funds and labor.
 ''We have some original stuff left in the clubhouse,'' said Dave Cataldo, park superintendent at Bethpage. One of the clubhouse's signature rooms, the Lenox Room, ''is just about intact,'' he said. Golf's greatest names will use the clubhouse when Bethpage Black plays host to the United States Open from June 18 to 21. Tiger Woods will be looking to defend his title, and to recreate his winning performance from 2002, when the Open was last played at Bethpage. 
 The diversity of projects developed by the W.P.A. during the 1930s is astonishing, Mr. Taylor said. In New Jersey, unemployed white-collar workers were assigned the task of creating archival records and surveys in towns like Garfield, North Arlington and Rutherford, among others. ''So many things might not exist if the W.P.A. hadn't been able to match the talents of workers with specific assignments,'' Mr. Taylor said. 
 That creativity certainly provides an object lesson for today's stimulus spending, which thus far has emphasized big public works projects, not arts and culture. Today's work force has changed dramatically since the 1930s, said Mark Wasserman, a history professor at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. 
 ''The work force is more white collar now, and white-collar workers don't have the skills to build bridges,'' Professor Wasserman said. ''It's a different world now.''
 Perhaps, but renewed interest in the work of the W.P.A. suggests that in some ways, things may not have changed much at all.

HEADLINE: For Home, Long Road To a Sale

BYLINE: By David Kocieniewski

 BODY:
Although central Essex County has remained an oasis from the worst of the nation's real estate meltdown, there is still the occasional housing horror story -- like the sorry tale of 572 Prospect Street in Maplewood. 
 A gracious six-bedroom brick Tudor -- with wood floors, high ceilings, a one-bedroom carriage house and nanny's suite -- the house was put up for sale in the heady days of March 2007 at an asking price of $899,000. Within a month, the owners received an offer within $40,000 below the asking price. A deal never materialized, but in an era of bidding wars and easy credit -- when Maplewood homes routinely sold for 99 percent of asking price -- it was completely reasonable to expect that another buyer might come along to snatch it up soon. 
 Instead it sat on the market for more than two years, though today, listed at $649,000, the owners are in contract with a prospective buyer -- pending approval from the bank, which is negotiating with the sellers because the purchase price does not cover the full value of the remaining mortgage. 
 The home's descent from a prized property to short sale is a tale of good intentions and bad timing. After initially pricing the home aggressively, the owners dropped the price to $874,000 in May of 2007, then took it off the market the following month. With the national real estate market's weakness beginning to seep into New Jersey, they instead tried to rent the home in November of 2007. 
 But when no tenants surfaced by the following spring, the home was re-listed last April at $779,000, then reduced the following month to $754,000. 
 Down, down, down went the asking price. In November, with the economy in free fall, it dropped to $649,000.
 The lesson of the home, according to Barbara Lawrence, the listing agent, is the importance of pricing correctly.
 ''Because if you put yourself in a position of having to chase the market, there's no way of knowing where it will lead,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Consumers and Investors Turn Optimistic

BYLINE: By MARV SALTER

 BODY:
The leading indexes closed just slightly higher on Friday, but that was enough for each to end the week with a net gain. 
 Early in the week, the markets fell on news of disappointing retail sales and wholesale prices. But investors turned hopeful on signs that the overall economy might be stabilizing. One of those signs came from the beleaguered banking sector. Citigroup and JPMorgan, for example, posted quarterly earnings that beat analysts' expectations.
 Also of note was a Reuters-University of Michigan survey showing that consumer confidence is higher than it has been since Lehman Brothers collapsed in September.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.6 percent, to close at 8,131.33. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.5 percent, to 869.60. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index added 1.2 percent, to 1,673.07.
 Crude oil settled at $50.33 a barrel on Friday, up 35 cents for the session but down $1.84 for the week.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.95 percent from 2.92 percent the previous week. MARV SALTER

HEADLINE: Harvard Unplugs the Coffeepot

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Even the nation's richest university is cutting back. The mighty Harvard still holds nearly $29 billion in its endowment, after taking an $8 billion hit last year. But like other institutions that watched coffers wither in the stock market crash, it has taken major steps to preserve funds. It has put a freeze on faculty salaries and staff hiring and delayed construction of its new campus in the Allston area of Boston. And there's a broader belt-tightening mentality on campus. Consider: 
 Two of six elevators at the Holyoke Center, an administrative complex, have been shut down, and its bathrooms are being cleaned less frequently. Staff members have to empty their own recycling bins. 
 Sleepy students (and professors) at the Barker Center, the nerve center of the humanities departments, will no longer enjoy free coffee on Friday mornings. A sober placard blames the economy.
 A reindeer ice sculpture that once charmed faculty at the Business School's holiday party failed to make an appearance in December. ''Our holiday party was appropriately scaled back in terms of decorations,'' a spokesman explains.
 The Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard's largest division, is lowering the temperature in its administrative and academic buildings, from 72 degrees to a chill-inducing 68, and will temper air-conditioning in the summer. Potential savings: $600,000 a year. In another cost-saving green initiative, the annual course catalog, a well-thumbed almanac the size of a phone book, will be online-only in the fall. 
 The admissions office will downsize the information booklet it sends to prospective undergraduates. With the travel budget slashed 50 percent, it will cut back visits to high schools next year. William R. Fitzsimmons, the dean of admissions and financial aid, says he hopes the change will make recruiting more effective: ''We can go directly to the student instead of this hope that somebody might show up at the school.''

HEADLINE: Helping Women Reach Their Potential in Math

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
THE explanations vary, but the fact remains: Many women are not reaching their full potential in math, and that can hold them back in the job market. Allannah Thomas is working to change that through Helicon, a nonprofit group in New York specializing in math instruction for low-income women. 
 ''You'll get better jobs, better pay, more interesting work and have a future'' by improving math skills, Ms. Thomas recently told a group of two dozen women. She was about to review fractions, mixed numbers and other basics to help them with tests for job training programs. The class was part of a program at Nontraditional Employment for Women, which trains women for skilled jobs in construction and other industries. 
 Ms. Thomas formed Helicon in 1999 to address a lack of math proficiency among low-income women. As the sole instructor, she has taught more than 5,000 women (and many men, too) about basics of bookkeeping and has helped them prepare for G.E.D. tests. She has instructed prospective retail workers about percentages, for example, and offered other industry-specific math for job seekers who hope to work as bank tellers or in health care. 
 Her clients include trade unions, job training and placement organizations, social service agencies and hospitals. She also teaches many classes pro bono. 
 Nationwide, women are underrepresented in many jobs that require strong math skills. Women comprise only 13.5 percent of workers in architecture and engineering occupations, and only 2.5 percent in construction-related occupations, according to 2008 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 Beth Casey, professor of applied developmental and educational psychology at Boston College, who studies gender differences in math, says research suggests that boys start to gain a small advantage in math in middle-school years, and that the advantage increases in high school, though by smaller amounts in recent years. 
 Gender differences are greater in math that depends more on spatial reasoning, such as geometry, measurement and calculus, Dr. Casey said. This may affect job choice, with men more likely than women to enter fields like engineering and carpentry.
 The reason that men and women differ in math skills is a matter of debate. It is not a clear-cut issue, as biological and environmental factors interact, Dr. Casey said. ''Women are not universally worse than males in math,'' she said.
 What often holds girls back is self-confidence; it drops sharply in middle school and is considered a reason that so many women don't choose math-related fields, she said. But ''many girls and women have the potential to improve their spatial skills to the point of being very successful'' in fields that require those abilities, she said. 
 Ms. Thomas first observed these issues as a high school math teacher two decades ago. And when she worked in a variety of social service jobs in the 1990s, she came into contact with many women who struggled with math, which prompted her to start Helicon.
 While working in social services, she met women who wanted to start or expand businesses; some who could breeze through the verbal part of business plans were stymied by the math sections in market research and fiscal analyses. Other women -- nurses' aides and home health care workers who hoped to become nurses -- often had their dreams dashed by an inability to do the math required for training entrance exams. (Test takers might be asked to convert adult doses of medicine to various doses for children, based on their weight, for example.) And she saw women who had difficulty with the math section of the G.E.D. test compared with the other sections. In New York, women's failure rate on the math section is consistently higher than men's, according to data from the state Department of Education.
 In her current work, she says she has found that while individual abilities vary, almost everyone can improve. She recounted how several years ago, a woman whose math skills were at a fourth-grade level came to one of her classes. After taking an eight-week intensive review of basic math and several other math prep classes, she got a score of 98 percent on the entrance test for Carpenters' Union, Local 608 -- the highest in the class, Ms. Thomas said. 
 Ms. Thomas's style of teaching has been called math boot camp because it emphasizes traditional basics: memorization of multiplication tables, for example, and the use of timed quizzes and tests. By mastering fundamentals in rote learning, she said, math becomes second nature and inspires confidence. 
 One former student, Roselyn Colon, 31, of the Bronx, said: ''If her first attempt doesn't work, she tries other strategies until you learn it.'' Another former student, Heather McHale, 36, of Queens, said, ''She's old school. You do it again and again until it sticks.'' 
 Both women took several of Ms. Thomas's classes last year and in September became apprentices in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 3, making $11 an hour with yearly raises. After a five-and-a-half-year apprenticeship, they will earn about $47 an hour, they said. .
 SOME women who take the classes have strong math skills that may just need polishing. One of Ms. Thomas's former students, Matilde Santana, 45, of Queens, said, ''I was pretty strong in math,'' but hadn't used some of the skills for about 20 years. She worked in the fashion industry for 13 years, but was unemployed for two before taking Ms. Thomas's classes a few years ago. 
 She has worked at Consolidated Edison since September 2006 as a general utility worker and was promoted in March. ''I strongly believe if I had not taken her course,'' the situation would have been completely different, Ms. Santana said.

HEADLINE: 18 Years In the Making

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER. 
Ron Lieber writes the Your Money column for The Times.

 BODY:
Want to pick up the tab at Harvard for a child born today? It will probably cost about half a million dollars come 2027. 
 Hey, at least you have 18 years to plan. Parents footing the bill for tuition this fall are facing down a perfect storm of ugliness. Unemployment is rising, while bonuses and commissions aren't what they once were for those who still have jobs. Others have no equity left in their homes thanks to declining housing prices. Those who do may have trouble finding a bank willing to hand out home equity loans that they can use to pay for college.
 Beyond a more generous tax credit, President Obama's moves so far don't add up to much for most middle-class families. For low-income students, Mr. Obama wants to guarantee Pell grant financing levels and to match inflation increases, and his stimulus package provides more Pell and work-study money. He is pushing to change the way federal loans are dispensed and to expand access somewhat to federal loans. But students who borrow already graduate with an average debt of $22,700. 
 Meanwhile, the devastation in the stock market has eroded not just families' savings but university endowments that underwrite scholarships and grants. 
 How bad is it? Earlier this year, Kevin McKinley, a financial planner and college savings expert at McKinley Money in Eau Claire, Wis., received his first-ever referral from a psychotherapist, who thought the patient could reduce anxiety by seeing a financial professional.
 ''That's not something that happens when the markets are doing well,'' Mr. McKinley says.
 Still, if you can break the process of saving for college into smaller pieces, it starts to seem more manageable. Start by reminding yourself that almost nobody can save enough to pay for four years of private education, let alone for more than one child. That's not the goal here.
 Mr. McKinley suggests an approach he calls ''20-20-20.'' Take the current average cost of attending four years at a public university: roughly $60,000. Save $20,000 before your child begins college by putting aside $50 a month starting at birth and assuming a 6 percent annual return. Then, pay $20,000 out of current income while the student is in college. Finally, have your child take out $20,000 in federal student loans over four years. The $200 monthly payments afterward are not a horrible burden for people in their 20s to bear, and they'll be debt free once the 10-year payback period is over.
 ''It's all doable with several very small sacrifices,'' Mr. McKinley says. 
 You can aim higher, or lower, but the longer you wait to start, the more money you'll probably need to borrow later. Better, then, to start at the birth of your first child and follow as many of the steps below as you can.
 NEWBORNS AND TODDLERS
 For most people, the best way to save for a child's college education is still through a 529 savings plan. With 529s, you deposit after-tax money, but any earnings are free of taxes as long as you spend them on tuition, room, board and other postsecondary educational expenses. 
 You can look up your state's plan at savingforcollege.com, a directory of college saving plans and advice. Most states have their own accounts, and many have two different kinds: investment accounts and prepaid accounts (it's too early in the life cycle to discuss the prepaid variety, so more later on those). 
 Investment accounts are a bit like 401(k)'s in that you can usually choose from a handful of mutual funds and other investments, including one that gets less aggressive as your child's date of college matriculation nears. (Just be sure that the fund manager's definition of ''aggressive'' is similar to yours; some 529 investors have been surprised at the extent of their recent losses.)
 Credit cards can help feed your savings. Some will reward you with refunds into a 529 account based on how much you spend. The Fidelity 529 College Rewards American Express card, for instance, gives you 2 percent back on all purchases as long as you deposit it into your Fidelity 529 account, including the plans it runs for individual states. (Anyone can invest in any state's 529 investment plan; you aren't limited to your own state's). 
 Card earnings alone can easily add up to five figures after 20 years, depending on how much you put on the plastic annually. A few caveats, though. If you carry a balance or pay bills late, the interest and fees will more than wipe out the rewards. Credit card companies also often reduce rewards over time. And to maximize earnings, you'll have to give up using your other credit cards to collect frequent-flier miles. 
 The Upromise college savings program offers several ways to earn cash for a 529, including 1 percent back on most purchases on its MasterCard; refunds based on what you buy at grocers that link their discount cards to Upromise; and bonuses for shopping at partner retailers online and eating in affiliated restaurants. 
 Lisa Roll, a financial adviser in Glen Gardner, N.J., has saved about $7,500 toward her two sons' college expenses in the eight years she has been enrolled in Upromise. She even enlisted her mother-in-law, who can contribute her spending power to Ms. Roll's account through Upromise's friends-and-family system. ''I went to their house and took her wallet and signed up all of her grocery and credit cards,'' she says, adding that she also installed a Web browser toolbar that will help remind her mother-in-law to shop online at partner retailers. 
 THE PRESCHOOL YEARS
 Once the grandparents tire of buying baby gear and cute outfits, you might sit them down for a conversation about how they can make a more lasting cash contribution to your toddler's future. This isn't always the easiest conversation to have.
 ''In most otherwise healthy families, the willingness of grandparents to save generally exceeds the willingness of parents to broach the subject with the grandparents,'' Mr. McKinley says. ''That's good. It shows that parents aren't money-grubbing. But it means it's usually the grandparents' duty to bring the subject up.''
 If you're a grandparent and your financial plan for retirement is secure, putting aside just one Social Security check a year for 18 years could pay for a good chunk of a child's college education.
 The question, however, is where to park that money during the intervening years. Grandparents can set up their own 529 accounts, which come with a few advantages. ''If something were to happen and they really needed the money, they could take it back out of the 529 and pay taxes and penalties,'' says KC Dempster, director of program development at the consultants College Money in Marlton, N.J. If there's a falling out with the kids or the grandkids, they can also change the beneficiary and bestow their largesse on a more-favored family member. 
 Families wishing to qualify for financial aid, however, should keep in mind that a growing number of colleges and universities are asking whether grandparents or others have set up 529 accounts for a student and taking it into account when awarding their own grants.
 Kalman A. Chany, president of Campus Consultants in New York City, advises that grandparents simply give money to the parents, who can then deposit it in their own 529. Many accounts will accept gifts from grandparents. Upromise facilitates 529 giving, too, as does Freshman Fund, an online gift registry.
 One other big financial decision looms during the preschool years: when (or if) to have another child. If you have two children in college at the same time, your eligibility for financial aid grows significantly. ''My instinct would be that there are still a lot of people out there who don't understand how this works,'' Ms. Dempster says. ''They space their children out because the thought of two tuitions and room and board at the same time freaks them out.'' 
 Mr. Chany says, only half-jokingly, that the best option may be to have twins. 
 GRADES ONE TO NINE
 One decision you'll eventually face is whether to put some (or all) of your savings into a prepaid 529 plan. Not every state offers one, and some states' plans are closed to new investments. The rest, however, let you essentially pay today for tuition and fees in the future.
 There are a number of catches here, depending on the state. You can usually participate only in your own state's plan, and it often covers only tuition and fees. (Another plan, called the Independent 529, allows you to pay for member private colleges and universities around the country.) 
 There are also a number of ways states calculate the current ''price.'' While the idea of locking in a price may sound tempting, it's crucial to understand exactly what $1,000 today will buy you when your child finally goes to college. What sort of discount do you get for prepaying part of the tuition each year? And what happens if you're in a state plan and your child decides to attend an out-of-state university?How much of a return will your money have earned in that case? In the Independent 529 plan, for instance, your money won't have earned more than 2 percent annually (nor can it lose more than 2 percent a year). That sounds good right about now, though investments in stocks over the next 15 years will probably do better. 
 By the time middle school draws to a close, you should have a clearer sense of your financial picture than you had 13 or 14 years earlier, and whether you'll have a shot at qualifying for financial aid. The government's expected family contribution calculator at www.fafsa4caster.ed.gov can help on this front.
 Now you have to decide what to tell your child about the money situation and when. Mr. McKinley warns about revealing too much too soon. ''Most kids are just so clueless about where they're going to go and what they're going to do,'' he says. ''It just adds one more pressure to start talking about it in eighth or ninth grade.''
 By early in high school, however, colleges are already marketing to potential students. ''If there are financial constraints, it's important for the child to understand that,'' says Mr. Chany, who is also the author of ''Paying for College without Going Broke'' (Princeton Review, 2007). ''I think it's not a good idea for them to spring surprises on the child'' late in the process. 
 That said, he adds, perhaps the worst move is to forbid a student to apply to a dream school simply because of money worries. ''All you need is one of the child's friends with similar financial circumstances to get in and get a nice financial aid package and be able to afford it,'' he says. ''And then the child says to you for the rest of their life: 'Why didn't you let me apply to that school?'''
 Freshman year in high school is also a good time to ratchet back investments in stocks, if you've had an aggressive asset allocation in your 529 funds so far. If you're in a target-date mutual fund, with the date of your child's matriculation in its name, check to see what percentage of the fund is in stocks and then reallocate your savings to something safer if you feel the need.
 10TH AND 11TH GRADES
 This is the moment to consider whether to hire an adviser who will examine your income and assets to better position your aid application. This can easily cost $1,000 in fees, but it may pay for itself if you receive more grants or qualify for better loans because of it. 
 Whether you hire an adviser or try to sort out the financial aid applications on your own, remember that colleges and universities currently consider the year from Jan. 1 of junior year to Dec. 31 of senior year as the ''base'' year for figuring out what the family can afford to pay for the first year of college. 
 That means that if you're going to make any big changes to qualify for more aid, you need to do it between Jan. 1 of sophomore year and Dec. 31 of junior year -- and start planning those moves even sooner. 
 What sort of moves might you make? 
 Since financial aid offices will tap some of your assets in calculating what you can afford to pay, there's no shame in spending them down a bit sooner than you might have. If you need a new roof or new car, spend the money before the base year arrives. And pay down credit card debt. A big balance doesn't win you a break when applying for aid, but colleges could tap your cash.
 Mr. Chany suggests a number of other ideas. Since colleges generally take more from your income than they do from your assets, the base year or right before is a great time to start your own business (assuming your income will fall for a while in the start-up years). And to lower the income number that the financial system uses, front-load individual retirement account contributions before the base year.
 By now you may be wondering about the ethics of all of this money moving. Do not lie on financial aid forms, but aid planning, like tax planning, is perfectly legal and appropriate. 
 SENIOR YEAR 
 Just as students should apply to at least one college where they know they will be accepted and happy, add at least one school your family is certain you can afford. 
 ''If you're going to get need-based aid, then you have to target the colleges that have money to give it,'' says Ms. Dempster of College Money. ''Otherwise, the entire exercise has been pointless.''
 The student also has to fit the college personally before you worry about money. ''If not, they may drop out or transfer or do poorly,'' she says. ''They'll end up doing things that make college last longer, and that just makes it more expensive.''
 Then, finally, comes application time, a process you'll repeat at least three more times because you have to refile each year. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid and other forms you may encounter are intimidating. Fill them out anyway, even if you don't think you'll win grants from your chosen college, because you never know where you might end up or how your financial circumstances may change. 
 If grandparents wish to step in at this late stage, be aware that giving money to parents or making tuition payments directly to the college can have a big impact on aid eligibility. Consider paying off the child's loans (or the parents') after college graduation.
 Some of you are reading this with aid offers for your high school seniors in hand. If you are, you now know that a fair bit of randomness takes hold once you apply. Financial aid officers can and will do what they want and sweeten packages for more desirable students. While many a parent tries to play one offer off another, Mr. Chany points out: ''The decisions of the financial aid officer are final and cannot be appealed to the government. It's worse than dealing with the I.R.S. There's no tax court.''
 All the more reason, then, to start early. ''Parents beat themselves up about having done nothing and then continue to do nothing because they think it's hopeless or scary,'' he says. ''That's the worst thing that anyone can do. The longer they wait, the harder it's going to get.''

HEADLINE: The Aura Of Arugulance

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif. 

 BODY:
 The first thing I wanted to do in the Bay Area was go out to Skywalker Ranch and ask George Lucas about a disturbing conversation we'd had at an Obama inaugural party in Washington.
 Lucas, the creator of ''Star Wars,'' had told me that I had gotten Dick Cheney completely wrong, that Cheney was no Darth Vader. I felt awful. Had I been too hard on Vice?
 Lucas explained politely as I listened contritely. Anakin Skywalker is a promising young man who is turned to the dark side by an older politician and becomes Darth Vader. ''George Bush is Darth Vader,'' he said. ''Cheney is the emperor.'' 
 I was relieved. In ''Star Wars'' terms, Dick Cheney was more evil than Darth Vader. I hadn't been hard enough on Vice!
 Lucas was on his way to Europe and didn't have time to elaborate in person. But he sent me this message confirming our conversation: ''You know, Darth Vader is really a kid from the desert planet near Crawford, and the true evil of the universe is the emperor who pulls all the strings.''
 Sated, I went over to talk to the other celestial celebrity in San Francisco who inspires cultlike devotion for what she does with green cooking rather than blue screens: Alice Waters, who has created her own mythical empire of healthy food with her cookbooks, edible gardens in public schools and renowned Berkeley restaurant Chez Panisse.
 Waters has been much in the news lately as the fairy godmother of the White House organic vegetable garden, an idea she has been pushing since 1993. Instead, Bill Clinton installed a seven-seat hot tub on the South Lawn. Though he loved to eat, Bill was more a consumer of fast food than slow food, as Waters calls her movement to persuade Americans to sup on simple, locally grown foods free of pesticides and herbicides. 
 The 64-year-old Waters, who got her taste for revolutions in the '60s in school at Berkeley with the antiwar and women's movements, wears a gold peace sign on a necklace. But with her radiant skin and her mesmerizing, hesitating arias about the sensual pleasures of food, she seems more like a '30s movie actress than a graying hippie. (I'm not surprised to find out she loves Turner Classic Movies and Hollywood's vintage hotel, Chateau Marmont, that she named her restaurant after a character in Marcel Pagnol's 1930s trilogy of movies, and that she thinks of her restaurant as theater.)
 She wasn't invited to the opening of the White House garden, and she understands why the Obamas would want ''to keep a kind of distance from me and from that whole celebrity chef'' aura. Barack Obama got upset during the campaign that he was painted as a finicky elitist after he complained about the price of arugula at Whole Foods.
 She's well aware of the criticism leveled at her in blogs for condescension and food snobbery. In a post on Friday called ''Alice in Wonderland,'' National Review stirred the pot against her: ''The truth is, organic food is an expensive luxury item, something bought by those who have the resources.''
 She says wryly: ''I'm just put into that arugulance place. I own a fancy restaurant. I own an expensive restaurant. I never thought of it as fancy. People don't know we're supporting 85 farms and ranches and all of that.
 ''And so my first thing I say, it's going to cost more and I want to pay for my food. I go to the farmers' market; it makes me feel like I'm making a donation.''
 Since the Obamas haven't taken her up on her offer of a ''kitchen cabinet,'' she wants to do her first TV show called ''The Green Kitchen.'' She can do a soliloquy on the ''discernment'' of choosing the most ambrosial orange. But she also says that a recession is a time when people need to learn the basics -- ''a kind of everyday cooking, in a really tasty way. We're really trying to take the 'ie' out of foodie.''
 She says she's sick of hearing about diets and obesity in America, and believes neither would be so prevalent if her European-style ''delicious revolution'' succeeded. 
 Waters is a visionary. She imagines a ''peace garden'' on the Gaza Strip that would employ people ''from all sides.'' She imagines a high school where the kids could run the whole cafeteria themselves, learning math, nutrition, art and food. She imagines starting gardens at Monticello and Mount Vernon that would ''become the source of all food in the White House.'' She imagines food being covered on the front page and the business page -- not the food page, or on TV by ''lesser'' reporters like ''the weatherman.''
 Her most ambitious vision involves President Obama, who didn't want beets in his garden. ''I would just like to serve him some golden beets sometime that were roasted in the oven, that were not overcooked, that were dressed with a lovely little vinaigrette, maybe even diced in a salad,'' she says in her seductive way. ''Squeeze 'em with a little lime. It's fantastically nutritious.''

To the Sports Editor:
 As I watched the final round at the Masters, I was mesmerized by the perseverance with which Tiger Woods recovered his stroke and charged up the leader board only to fall short at the end. 
 I have also always been impressed by the respect Tiger has shown for the legends of golf -- Sam Snead, Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus. Tiger has earned more money than all three of them combined. 
 Much of his wealth comes from corporate sponsorships, including Buick. Unfortunately, Buick had to sever its relationship with Tiger because of the downturn of the American auto industry.
 As the owner of an Ohio steel-tubing company that supplies the automotive industry and has been severely affected by the economic downturn, I'd like to see Tiger do his part to help our nation get on the road to economic recovery by aiding Buick by continuing as its spokesman without pay.

HEADLINE: Warming Relationships in a Warm Locale

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago 

 BODY:
President Obama, seeking to warm up relations with Latin America as he meets many of the region's leaders for the first time, spent Saturday here playing down his celebrity and casting himself as the new kid on the block.
 ''I have much to learn,'' Mr. Obama declared. 
 It was the first full day of the Summit of the Americas on this lush and mountainous Caribbean island. With 33 other Western Hemisphere leaders and thousands of delegates and a raucous press corps squeezed into a Hyatt Regency hotel, Mr. Obama found it tough to keep a low profile. 
 Everybody seemed to want a piece of him. 
 The president was mobbed during the opening plenary session by delegates elbowing their way toward him for photographs -- among them Ruben Blades, the Panamanian singer and actor, who accompanied Panama's foreign minister to the session.
 Later, as the leaders gathered for their official ''family photograph,'' Prime Minister Stephenson King of St. Lucia produced a copy of Mr. Obama's memoir, ''Dreams From My Father,'' and asked the president for his autograph. Mr. Obama asked someone the date -- he wanted to record it with his signature -- and obliged.
 Climate change, security and the global economic crisis, which especially threatens some of the impoverished nations represented here, were high on the official agenda. The discussion was so lively, said Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, that at one point Prime Minister Patrick Manning of Trinidad and Tobago lamented that all of the leaders had overrun their allotted time.
 All, that is, except the newest one: Mr. Obama.
 Canadian's Perspective
 It's tough to be from Canada at the Summit of the Americas. With fiery Latin American leftists like Presidents Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and Hugo Chavez of Venezuela dominating the stage, nobody here is paying much attention to the buttoned-down folks from the land up north.
 Prime Minister Stephen Harper tried to correct that on Saturday. 
 First, he appeared before the cameras walking alongside a certain other leader from North America, a possible political plus for him in Canada, where Mr. Obama is popular. Later, in a brief interview, the prime minister offered his observations on the summit meeting. 
 The talk turned, not surprisingly, to you-know-who.
 ''Look, in Canada, we're used to the American president being the celebrity,'' Mr. Harper said, professing not to mind being in Mr. Obama's shadow. 
 He went on, ''What's interesting is that his desire, his clear desire to listen -- not necessarily to agree but to listen -- has won him a lot of friends.'' 
 It has been striking to see Mr. Obama mingle with the multicultural array of leaders here, and Mr. Harper was asked if he thought the president's race was helping him forge new relationships. Mr. Harper said he believed that race had some effect -- especially because Mr. Obama is ''of mixed extraction, which is the more common reality once you get south of the United States'' -- but added that ''in the end, the personality and the policies, these are the things that matter.''
 As for the other big draw here, Mr. Chavez, Mr. Harper said he was not surprised to see the Venezuelan leader strike up a relationship with Mr. Obama. 
 ''My observation: President Chavez is a character, and notwithstanding his hard-line ideology that I am a firm opponent of -- be under no illusion about that -- he's actually an affable and gregarious and open personality,'' Mr. Harper said. ''And for whatever reason, he seems in a particularly good mood this weekend, and we're all grateful for that.''
 History Lesson
 As Mr. Obama said he had much to learn, he found a willing teacher: Mr. Chavez.
 The Venezuelan president, parading about the Hyatt in a bright red shirt with a horde of photographers following his every move, worked hard to cozy up to Mr. Obama. On Saturday, a day after their much-publicized handshake, Mr. Chavez showed up with a gift for his American counterpart, a paperback copy of a 1971 book, ''The Open Veins of Latin America: Five Centuries of the Pillage of a Continent,'' by Eduardo Galeano, an Uruguayan journalist and historian.
 The book, an anti-capitalist tractate that details the consequences of 500 years of domination by Europe and the United States, was perhaps an unsurprising selection by Mr. Chavez, whose leftist politics put him so at odds with former President George W. Bush that he repeatedly called Mr. Bush ''the devil.''
 But there were other reasons that the tome might not have been exactly what Mr. Obama, a best-selling author, was expecting. For one thing, it is in Spanish, a language the president does not speak. 
 ''I thought it was one of Chavez's books,'' Mr. Obama said later. ''I was going to give him one of mine.''

HEADLINE: Stimulus Money Hits the Supermarket, Then the Roads

BYLINE: By DUNSTAN A. MCNICHOL

DATELINE: Ewing 

 BODY:
 EFFECTIVE this month, 231,000 New Jersey families who use food stamps to help cover the cost of their groceries received an additional 13.6 percent to spend. The increased aid is part of the first stage of the federal government's $787 billion economic stimulus plan that is trickling out to states and cities. At the ShopRite supermarket here, just outside of Trenton, the cash registers are already ringing up the extra sales.
 Worth about $30 a month to the typical food stamp recipient -- and $91 million a year across the state -- the additional benefits are among the first of the federal stimulus dollars to reach New Jersey. 
 William Carey, the manager of the store, said it is too soon to say how much difference the extra food stamp money will make in the broader local economy.
 ''It's going to take a couple of months to tell whether it's going to make a noticeable change,'' he said. ''People are holding onto their money. Even if they have a little extra, I'm not sure what they'll spend it on.''
 State officials are more optimistic as they prepare for the influx of the $17.5 billion New Jersey and its residents are scheduled to receive during the two years the stimulus program is expected to be in place.
 ''It's real. It's not a figment of people's imagination,'' Gov. Jon S. Corzine said to reporters after addressing a roomful of enthusiastic heavy-construction contractors on Monday at a conference in Trenton. ''The money is coming very rapidly.''
 For the moment, the bulk of the federal dollars reaching New Jersey are working their way into the economy through individual transactions like those at the supermarket.
 Besides the additional food stamp allowances, many New Jersey residents have already started to see the first of an estimated $7.3 billion in direct tax relief that is coming in the form of a $400 federal income tax credit for each worker, a credit that in many instances is being used to reduce the amount of tax withheld from paychecks each week.
 Increased payments for the jobless, for child care and for Medicaid have also started to flow into the state.
 And more prominent results of the stimulus spending should start appearing before the end of the month, Governor Corzine said.
 In Lodi, for instance, work is scheduled to begin within days on a $47.6 million project to untangle a persistent bottleneck on Route 46 that has bedeviled commuters for decades.
 ''We're going to change all that, and we're going to put 500 people to work at the same time,'' the governor said, referring to the Lodi project, at the contractors' conference, where he received a standing ovation after his remarks.
 Two other stimulus-funded projects, a $30 million bridge-painting job on Routes 1 and 9 and a $15.3 million bridge-painting program on I-280, have already been put out for bid and are scheduled to be awarded shortly, according to the State Transportation Department.
 Stephen Dilts, the transportation commissioner, said he planned to allocate half the state's $1.07 billion allotment of highway and mass-transit stimulus funding to approved projects by the end of this month. The full allotment should be spoken for by the end of June, Mr. Dilts said.
 That spending is on top of a $3.8 billion package of highway and mass transit projects the state plans to pay for with its own funds, borrowed money and federal aid. 
 United States Senator Robert Menendez applauded the state's aggressive use of the federal funds, saying the highway projects will translate into tens of thousands of jobs for contractors and for those in related industries.
 ''It's the designers; it's the engineers; it's the supplier that provides the materials,'' Senator Menendez said. ''The ripple effect is way beyond the highway contractors.''
 Local governments, too, are lining up for their share of the hundreds of millions of stimulus dollars available for improving sewer and water treatment plants, upgrading public housing and improving local roads.
 In a third-floor State Department of Environmental Protection headquarters conference space that state workers are calling the War Room, plans for about 500 public works projects worth a total of $2 billion are scattered about in various stages of review. Officials are trying to pare down a long list of applications for the $160 million in stimulus funding earmarked for New Jersey.
 ''We are close to having the project ranking completed,'' said Mark N. Mauriello, the commissioner of the environmental agency. ''It's moving really well considering we have more than 500 projects we're reviewing.''
 Four toxic Superfund sites also have been selected to compete for a share of $600 million in clean-up funds that the federal Environmental Protection Agency is to award from stimulus funding by May 1.
 And of 35 forest service projects nominated for stimulus funding last month, eight were accepted for final consideration to receive a share of the $500 million in forest fire reduction funds the stimulus program includes.
 In another corner of state government, the State Council on the Arts was awarded $399,900 from a $19.8 million arts fund included in the stimulus program.
 Mr. Corzine, who was enthusiastic about the big-ticket transportation projects in line for federal funding, said he was equally excited about smaller elements of the stimulus funding, like the $73.6 million the state is scheduled to receive for energy and conservation projects.
 ''There are so many pockets of opportunity for developing alternative energy and for improving the efficiency of buildings,'' he said. ''We will create literally thousands of jobs.''

HEADLINE: Rising Expectations on Cuba Follow Obama to Trinidad

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON and ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Ginger Thompson reported from Washington, and Alexei Barrionuevo from Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting from Port of Spain, and Damien Cave from Miami.

 BODY:
A day after President Obama pledged a new future in Washington's relations with Cuba, Latin American leaders insisted at a summit meeting in Trinidad that the future is now.
 That message followed the president throughout the day on Saturday and even upstaged a photo-op with Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada, when a reporter asked Mr. Obama whether he was taking tips from Canada's policy of open engagement with Havana. ''I take tips from Canada on a lot of things,'' he said with a smile, and kept walking.
And so it was that Cuba, the only country not invited to the fifth Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago, was a central focus of the meeting for another day. An exchange of conciliatory overtures between President Obama and President Raul Castro of Cuba has started a buzz of speculation about more substantive dialogue. And the crack in the door Mr. Obama had opened for new engagement with Cuba felt more like unlocking a floodgate. 
 For the first time, some diplomats said, the question being asked was when -- not whether -- the next move will be made. The meetings on Saturday made clear, however, that there remains deep disagreement about which country should make that move, and what it should be.
 President Obama spent much of the day in the capital, Port of Spain, trying to fend off the mounting pressure by saying that the ball was in Cuba's court. His aides outlined a series of steps that Cuba, the hemisphere's last remaining dictatorship, could do to demonstrate a willingness to open its closed society, including releasing political prisoners, allowing United States telecommunications companies to operate on the island and ending government fees on money sent to Cubans by relatives living abroad.
 ''We will continue to evaluate and watch what happens,'' said Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman. ''We're anxious to see what the Cuban government is willing to step up to do.''
 A senior administration official said, ''Don't expect big flashy meetings.'' Instead, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic issues, ''I think we are entering into a period of testing, maybe a period of testing on both sides.''
 But the hemisphere's leaders continued to press the United States to do more, expressing almost unanimous condemnation for its 47-year-old trade embargo.
 ''If the objective is to see change in Cuba,'' Mr. Harper of Canada said in an interview, ''it's hard to see how a trade embargo would do anything other than keep the economic system closed.'' 
 It is a debate the Obama administration, already grappling with a recession and two wars, had hoped to pre-empt before the meeting even began. Days before the president departed Washington for his first trip to the region, the White House announced it would reverse Bush administration restrictions on travel and remittances by Cuban-Americans to relatives in Cuba as a sign that the United States was prepared to move relations with Cuba in a new direction.
 How fast the administration intended to move was unclear. However, Julia Sweig, a Cuba expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the small but significant shift in policy has set off a chain reaction of expectations that the White House may have trouble controlling. ''This is starting to feel as if the ground is moving beneath our feet,'' she said.
 The Cuban-American community is no longer solidly supportive of the embargo. American businesses are eager to increase trade with Cuba. Both houses of Congress have introduced measures to end all restrictions on travel to Cuba and ease parts of the embargo. And Latin American leaders have rallied against the current United States policy as an anachronistic holdover from the cold war. 
 ''Latin America has been opposed to the embargo for some time,'' said Phil Peters, a Cuba expert with the Lexington Institute. ''But the unanimity and the insistence with which they have spoken are different.''
 Robert Pastor, who served as the Carter administration's chief Latin America adviser, said: ''What's required is for us to think about normalization with Cuba more like we think about normalization with Vietnam. We never made normalization with Vietnam dependent on them becoming a democratic, market economy.''
 Still, there were signs that domestic politics, both in the United States and Cuba, could stand in the way of engagement. Opposition to improved relations with Cuba may no longer have the monolithic hold it once did on Cuban-Americans, but it remains a potent political force. 
 Ninoska Perez Castellon, a Miami radio host, criticized Latin-American leaders for condemning the United States embargo, but not the Cuban government's repression against its own people.
 Ramon Raul Sanchez, the founder of the Democracy Movement, a Miami-based exile group, echoed that sentiment. ''We question the Cuban claim of respect for sovereignty when it is willing to talk to the United States,'' he said, ''but it is not willing to talk to its own people, who have asked to talk about a variety of serious issues.''
 And in Cuba, questions remain about the intent and ability of Raul Castro to make changes that his brother Fidel long resisted. ''I do not believe that Raul Castro can move in, trying to sit down and talk to the United States, as long as Fidel is alive,'' said Andy S. Gomez, a senior fellow at the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami.
 At the summit meeting, Latin America's staunch opposition to the United States' policy toward Cuba made it difficult for President Obama to talk about anything else. The most theatrical moments were staged by presidents who have long been thorns in the United States' side: Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Evo Morales of Bolivia.
 But there was also pressure from the United States' closest friends in the region, aides to President Obama said, including offers from Brazil, Mexico and the Organization of Caribbean Nations, to serve as intermediaries between Cuba and the United States.
 Bharrat Jagdeo, the president of Guyana, said he told Mr. Obama on Saturday that he was pleased by the steps the United States had taken so far to change relations with Cuba, but he pressed him to lift the embargo.
 He said he did not know whether the United States or Cuba should make the next move.
 ''I don't know who is going to pick up the phone and call the other one,'' he said, ''but I am convinced it is going to happen.''

HEADLINE: 100 Hours at the Museum

BYLINE: By TAMMY LA GORCE

 BODY:
Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark and Gov. Jon S. Corzine are not expected to wear their pajamas to the Newark Museum's marathon 100th anniversary celebration, which includes a sleepover. 
 The two politicians are scheduled to be there to press the button that starts the clock ticking on 100 hours of free fun at the museum from Wednesday to Sunday. But Mary Sue Sweeney Price, director of the museum, does plan to be on hand for the slumber party, which is by reservation only, on Saturday. 
 ''I'm looking forward to it. I've never spent the night before,'' she said. ''I'll probably bring a lawn chair.'' The sleepover is one of scores of activities the museum has lined up in an effort to attract new visitors as well as regulars from across the state and beyond. 
 Given the recession, the trumpeting of the word ''free'' should help, and not just in luring families with small children. In addition to a puppet-making workshop (April 26), a performance of ''Free to Be...'' by Paper Mill Playhouse Children's Theater on Tour (April 23) and the cutting of a birthday cake (April 26), the museum has lined up laser light shows (April 22 to 25), sunrise yoga (April 23, 24 and 26) and a closing-night Motown revue party. 
 Big names on hand will include the radio hosts Joan Hamburg of WOR-HD, Bob Shannon of CBS-FM and Felix Hernandez of KISS-FM and WBGO-FM. For those who prefer their museum visits to highlight the scholarly, there will be lectures and tours of current exhibitions -- including the new science exhibit ''Skies Alive!'' -- dotting the schedule each day. 
 ''What I think is so unusual about doing 100 hours of continuous programming is the areas of interest it will open up to people,'' said Mrs. Price. She hopes that people who come to see the show on bird migration on Wednesday, for instance, will stay to hear a Tibetan monk chanting ''and then maybe move on to something else.'' 
 Newark Museum marathon, April 22 to 26. Information: newarkmuseum.org or (973) 596-6550.

HEADLINE: President Promises to Trim Federal Fat

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago 

 BODY:
President Obama said Saturday that he would soon announce ''the elimination of dozens of government programs shown to be wasteful or ineffective,'' and he used his weekly radio address to name two new high-level officials to assist him in that effort. 
 The president said that in his cabinet meeting on Monday -- the first time the full body will meet -- he would ask department and agency heads to propose specific ways to cut their budgets by eliminating inefficient programs.
 Mr. Obama, who is in this island nation for a gathering of leaders of the Western Hemisphere, often uses his weekly address to talk about energy, health care or the economy. On Saturday, he used it to announce the appointments of Jeffrey Zients, a management consultant and entrepreneur, to be chief performance officer, and Aneesh Chopra, Virginia's secretary of technology, to be chief technology officer.
 ''If we're going to rebuild our economy on a solid foundation, we need to change the way we do business in Washington,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We need to restore the American people's confidence in their government -- that it is on their side, spending their money wisely.''
 Mr. Obama has put accountability and transparency at the center of his domestic policy, and he pledged on Saturday that his administration would carefully rethink the way government works. He is hardly the first president to do so; most presidents vow to eliminate waste and inefficiency in government, only to run into resistance on Capitol Hill.
 ''This starts with the painstaking work of examining every program, every entitlement, every dollar of government spending and asking ourselves: Is this program really essential?'' the president said Saturday.
 In appointing Mr. Zients, Mr. Obama is filling a post that initially was to have gone to Nancy Killefer, who withdrew in February amid questions about failure to pay taxes for a household employee.
 In the Republican response to Mr. Obama's address, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California announced a new feature on the Web site of the Republican whip called Washington Watch Report. 
 The report, republicanwhip .house.gov/WashingtonWatch, says it intends to be a ''one-stop shop to learn about examples of government waste that have been uncovered by House Republicans.'' It focuses on spending in the $787 billion economic stimulus plan.

HEADLINE: Immigration Reform

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Obama to Push Immigration Bill as One Priority'' (front page, April 9):
 President Obama, like his predecessor, President George W. Bush, pushes for amnesty for 12 million illegal immigrants. 
 Forget the fact that we are in a deep recession and that Americans need all the jobs they can get. This amnesty is plain and simple wrong. It undermines the rule of law that is critical for this nation to stand as a republic.
 America should remain a safe haven for its own citizens, and for millions more who seek entrance to this country through legal channels. These illegal immigrants have no business being here in their present status. This nation has no business offering these lawbreakers a pass to citizenship.
 Regardless of the hardships that may result to these lawbreaking individuals, they must be held accountable for their own actions. This nation must not place itself in the role of enabler to those who decided to cross a vulnerable border to invade the society of a foreign nation, and then feed on the fruits of that nation's good will with impunity. This is wrong.
 One can only hope that Americans in great numbers, and at all levels, will stand up and oppose amnesty for these illegal immigrants.
 Bob Jack North Las Vegas, April 9, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Immigration reform must value the families of United States citizens and legal permanent residents. Currently, even United States citizens face separation from their spouses for up to 10 years because of draconian penalties imposed for irregular status. Citizen children have no means to legal status for the parents who support and raise them. Backlogs for family-based visas separate even nuclear family members for years.
 Changes removing these impediments should be made immediately and not be sidelined by debate about economic impact. Citizens and residents who petition for family members must already sign affidavits of financial support for their noncitizen relatives.

HEADLINE: Why Isn't The Brain Green?

BYLINE: By JON GERTNER. 
Jon Gertner, a contributing writer, often writes about business and the environment.

 BODY:
Two days afterBarack Obama was sworn in as president of the United States, the Pew Research Center released a poll ranking the issues that Americans said were the most important priorities for this year. At the top of the list were several concerns -- jobs and the economy -- related to the current recession. Farther down, well after terrorism, deficit reduction and energy (and even something the pollsters characterized as ''moral decline'') was climate change. It was priority No. 20. That was last place. 
 A little more than a week after the poll was published, I took a seat in a wood-paneled room at Columbia University, where a few dozen academics had assembled for a two-day conference on the environment. In many respects, the Pew rankings were a suitable backdrop for the get-together, a meeting of researchers affiliated with something called CRED, or the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions. A branch of behavioral research situated at the intersection of psychology and economics, decision science focuses on the mental processes that shape our choices, behaviors and attitudes. The field's origins grew mostly out of the work, beginning in the 1970s, of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, two psychologists whose experiments have demonstrated that people can behave unexpectedly when confronted with simple choices. We have many automatic biases -- we're more averse to losses than we are interested in gains, for instance -- and we make repeated errors in judgment based on our tendency to use shorthand rules to solve problems. We can also be extremely susceptible to how questions are posed. Would you undergo surgery if it had a 20 percent mortality rate? What if it had an 80 percent survival rate? It's the same procedure, of course, but in various experiments, responses from patients can differ markedly.
 Over the past few decades a great deal of research has addressed how we make decisions in financial settings or when confronted with choices having to do with health care and consumer products. A few years ago, a Columbia psychology professor named David H. Krantz teamed up with Elke Weber -- who holds a chair at Columbia's business school as well as an appointment in the school's psychology department -- to assemble an interdisciplinary group of economists, psychologists and anthropologists from around the world who would examine decision-making related to environmental issues. Aided by a $6 million grant from the National Science Foundation, CRED has the primary objective of studying how perceptions of risk and uncertainty shape our responses to climate change and other weather phenomena like hurricanes and droughts. The goal, in other words, isn't so much to explore theories about how people relate to nature, which has been a longtime pursuit of some environmental psychologists and even academics like the Harvard biologist E. O. Wilson. Rather, it is to finance laboratory and field experiments in North America, South America, Europe and Africa and then place the findings within an environmental context.
 It isn't immediately obvious why such studies are necessary or even valuable. Indeed, in the United States scientific community, where nearly all dollars for climate investigation are directed toward physical or biological projects, the notion that vital environmental solutions will be attained through social-science research -- instead of improved climate models or innovative technologies -- is an aggressively insurgent view. You might ask the decision scientists, as I eventually did, if they aren't overcomplicating matters. Doesn't a low-carbon world really just mean phasing out coal and other fossil fuels in favor of clean-energy technologies, domestic regulations and international treaties? None of them disagreed. Some smiled patiently. But all of them wondered if I had underestimated the countless group and individual decisions that must precede any widespread support for such technologies or policies. ''Let's start with the fact that climate change is anthropogenic,'' Weber told me one morning in her Columbia office. ''More or less, people have agreed on that. That means it's caused by human behavior. That's not to say that engineering solutions aren't important. But if it's caused by human behavior, then the solution probably also lies in changing human behavior.''
 Among other things, CRED's researchers consider global warming a singular opportunity to study how we react to long-term trade-offs, in the form of sacrifices we might make now in exchange for uncertain climate benefits far off in the future. And the research also has the potential to improve environmental messages, policies and technologies so that they are more in tune with the quirky workings of our minds. As I settled in that first morning at the Columbia conference, Weber was giving a primer on how people tend to reach decisions. Cognitive psychologists now broadly accept that we have different systems for processing risks. One system works analytically, often involving a careful consideration of costs and benefits. The other experiences risk as a feeling: a primitive and urgent reaction to danger, usually based on a personal experience, that can prove invaluable when (for example) we wake at night to the smell of smoke.
 There are some unfortunate implications here. In analytical mode, we are not always adept at long-term thinking; experiments have shown a frequent dislike for delayed benefits, so we undervalue promised future outcomes. (Given a choice, we usually take $10 now as opposed to, say, $20 two years from now.) Environmentally speaking, this means we are far less likely to make lifestyle changes in order to ensure a safer future climate. Letting emotions determine how we assess risk presents its own problems. Almost certainly, we underestimate the danger of rising sea levels or epic droughts or other events that we've never experienced and seem far away in time and place. Worse, Weber's research seems to help establish that we have a ''finite pool of worry,'' which means we're unable to maintain our fear of climate change when a different problem -- a plunging stock market, a personal emergency -- comes along. We simply move one fear into the worry bin and one fear out. And even if we could remain persistently concerned about a warmer world? Weber described what she calls a ''single-action bias.'' Prompted by a distressing emotional signal, we buy a more efficient furnace or insulate our attic or vote for a green candidate -- a single action that effectively diminishes global warming as a motivating factor. And that leaves us where we started.
 Debates over why climate change isn't higher on Americans' list of priorities tend to center on the same culprits: the doubt-sowing remarks of climate-change skeptics, the poor communications skills of good scientists, the political system's inability to address long-term challenges without a thunderous precipitating event, the tendency of science journalism to focus more on what is unknown (will oceans rise by two feet or by five?) than what is known and is durably frightening (the oceans are rising). By the time Weber was midway into her presentation, though, it occurred to me that some of these factors might not matter as much as I had thought. I began to wonder if we are just built to fail.
 Columbia's behavioral labs are located underground and consist of a windowless suite of bright, sparsely furnished rooms with whitewashed cinder-block walls and gray industrial carpet. Each lab has a common area with a small rectangular table; adjacent to the common area are several tiny offices equipped with Dell computers. Depending on the experiment, test subjects, who are usually paid around $15 to participate and who are culled largely from Columbia's student body, can work on tests collaboratively at the table or individually in the private offices.
 Each lab room is also equipped with a hidden camera and microphone. One afternoon in February, I sat in a small viewing room and watched, on a closed-circuit television monitor, a CRED experiment being conducted down the hall by Juliana Smith, a graduate student at Columbia. Three subjects were dealing with several quandaries. The first involved reaching a consensus on how to apply $5 billion worth of federal funds to wind-energy technologies. Should they spend it all on conventional wind turbines? Should they invest some (or all) of the money on an as-yet-unproven technology that would employ magnetic levitation to create a huge, long-lasting, superefficient wind-powered generator? After the group came to a consensus in each of the test segments, its members were asked to go into the offices and figure out their own individual decisions.
 When I first heard about these particular experiments at CRED, I assumed they were meant to provide insight into our opinions about wind power. It turned out the researchers had little curiosity about what we think of wind power. Because CRED's primary goal is to understand decision-making in situations of uncertainty, the wind-turbine question -- should we spend money on building turbines now with a proven technology or should we finance technologies that might be more efficient someday? -- was intriguing not for its content but for the way it revealed how our minds work. The familiar variables were all there: uncertainty, time, potential gains, potential losses.
 For the researchers, it was crucial to understand precisely how group dynamics shaped decisions during the experiment. In Weber's view, many important environmental choices (building codes, for instance, or vehicle purchases) are made by groups -- households, companies, community boards and the like. And various experiments at CRED have established the ease of getting random individuals to cooperate; in one test, simply giving some subjects a colored sticker, a blue star, say, and telling them they were on the ''blue-star team'' increased group participation from 35 percent to 50 percent. (Just seating them together at a table increased participation rates to 75 percent.) ''So cooperation is a goal that can be activated,'' Weber told me one morning. Her point was that climate change can be easily viewed as a very large ''commons dilemma'' -- a version, that is, of the textbook situation in which sheepherders have little incentive to act alone to preserve the grassy commons and as a result suffer collectively from overgrazing. The best way to avoid such failure is by collaborating more, not less. ''We enjoy congregating; we need to know we are part of groups,'' Weber said. ''It gives us inherent pleasure to do this. And when we are reminded of the fact that we're part of communities, then the community becomes sort of the decision-making unit. That's how we make huge sacrifices, like in World War II.''
 A few days before visiting Columbia's behavioral labs, I watched a test run of the same experiments at a large conference table at CRED's nearby offices in Schermerhorn Hall. Student subjects, two men and one woman, debated the two windmill scenarios. ''We should put more money in project A,'' one said. Another countered, ''But science grows exponentially, so I think we should put more in B.'' An impassioned discussion about wind turbines went round and round.
 I sat between Weber and Michel Handgraaf, a member of CRED and a professor of psychology at the University of Amsterdam. Handgraaf, who had already started running a similar experiment in Amsterdam, leaned over and whispered to me: ''You'll notice they're saying, 'This has so-and-so effect over so many years' -- that's analytical. But then often they're saying, 'But I feel this way' -- that's emotional.'' In short, what Handgraaf and Weber were hearing wasn't a conversation about the best wind turbine but a tussle between the subjects' analytical and emotional methods of risk assessment. These experiments would be run with 50 different groups in New York, Handgraaf told me, and the conversations would be recorded and scored for data. The data were in the words. They were in how individuals parsed uncertainty and future trade-offs; they were in the phrases they used as they navigated between thinking and feeling; they were in the way the subjects followed a winding path to a consensual decision, soothing worries or explaining technical information to one another or appealing to the group's more courageous instincts.
 Embedded deep within the experimental structure was another inquiry, too. The subjects in half of the 50 test groups would first make their decisions individually and then as a group; the other half would make group decisions first and individual ones second. Weber and Handgraaf were fairly confident, based on previous work, that the two approaches would produce different results. In Amsterdam, Handgraaf told me, he had already seen that when subjects made decisions as a group first, their conversations were marked far more often by subtle markers of inclusion like ''us'' and ''we.'' Weber, for her part, had seen other evidence that groups can be more patient than individuals when considering delayed benefits. ''One reason this is interesting is that it's general practice in any meeting to prepare individually,'' Handgraaf said. Or, to put the matter another way: What if the information for decisions, especially environmental ones, is first considered in a group setting before members take it up individually, rather than the other way around? In Weber's view, this step could conceivably change the decisions made by a corporate board, for example, or a group of homeowners called together for a meeting by a public utility. Weber's experiments have also looked at how the ordering of choices can create stark differences: considering distant benefits before immediate costs can lead to a different decision than if you consider -- as is common -- the costs first. Here, then, is a kind of blueprint for achieving collective decisions that are in the world's best interests, but I asked Weber if that wouldn't that skew the natural decision-making process.
 ''We tend to always wonder,'' she replied: ''What's that person's true preference? What do they really want? I think that's the wrong question, because we want it all.'' People have multiple goals. If group involvement or the ordering of choices changes the process of making a particular decision, and in turn the result -- whether because it tweaked our notions of risk or because it helped elevate social goals above individual goals and led to better choices for the global commons -- that isn't necessarily a distortion of our true preference. There is no such thing as true preference.
 At the moment, about 98 percent of the federal financing for climate-change research goes to the physical and natural sciences, with the remainder apportioned to the social sciences. In science-policy-speak, that leftover percentage is typically referred to as ''human dimensions'' research, an omnibus description for studies on how individuals and groups interact with the environment. Paul Stern, a psychologist who heads the Committee on Human Dimensions of Global Change at the National Research Council in Washington and whose work includes looking at how people consume energy in the home, told me that human-dimensions work usually falls into one of three categories: the human activities that cause environmental change, the impacts of environmental change on people and society and the human responses to those consequences. Much of CRED's research is about the human responses to the experiences (or anticipated experiences) of climate change. What makes CRED's work especially relevant, though, is that various human attitudes and responses -- How can there be global warming when we had a frigid January? What's in it for me if I change the way I live? -- can make the climate problem worse by leaving it unacknowledged or unaddressed. Apathetic and hostile responses to climate change, in other words, produce a feedback loop and reinforce the process of global warming.
 Lab experiments in the social sciences, like the ones I witnessed at Columbia, are sometimes criticized for their counterfeit drama. After all, how often do we actually get to disburse $5 billion from the Department of Energy on windmills? Also, is the real world made up entirely of Columbia University students? These factors don't necessarily affect the knowledge that researchers can gain about human decision-making processes; lab experiments on investment decisions, for instance, have long been shown to offer useful insights into our real-world investment choices. Nonetheless, fieldwork has a value that can't always be reproduced in a lab. The lab experiment designed by Weber and Handgraaf actually took a cue from research done by another CRED member, Ben Orlove, an anthropologist at the University of California, Davis, who studied farmers in southern Uganda. In 2005 and 2006, Orlove observed how the behavior of the region's poor farmers could be influenced by whether they listened to crucial rainy-season radio broadcasts in groups or as individuals. Farmers in ''community groups,'' as Orlove described them to me, engaged in discussions that led to a consensus, and farmers made better use of the forecast. ''They might alter their planting date,'' he said, ''or use a more drought-resistant variety of seed.'' Those in the community groups also seemed more satisfied with the steps they took to increase their yields.
 In 2005, Anthony Leiserowitz, a CRED member who directs the Yale Project on Climate Change, began a multiyear field project when he drove to Anchorage in a camper with his wife and 2-year-old son. ''I had worked on some national studies about American perceptions of climate change,'' he told me, ''and one of the clear findings was -- and still is -- that most Americans think about climate change as a distant problem. Distant in time, and distant in space.'' In Alaska, however, there was already evidence of melting permafrost, insect-driven tree mortality and diminished sea ice. Leiserowitz saw a natural opportunity. The possibility that society won't act decisively on global warming until we experience a shattering realization -- a Pearl Harbor moment, as the climate blogger and former Department of Energy official Joe Romm recently put it -- aligns with our tendency to respond quickly to the stimulus of experience and emotion, but slowly to a risk that we process analytically and that may be rife with uncertainties. Leiserowitz simply wondered if Alaskans, now living in a state of easily perceived climate changes, could illuminate how -- and by how much -- direct experience could change attitudes.
 Traveling the state, Leiserowitz interviewed scientists, journalists, environmental leaders, politicians and -- in the remote northwestern city of Kotzebue -- indigenous tribal leaders. He also commissioned a survey. His data showed that the majority of Alaskans had indeed detected a change in climate and attributed it to man-made causes; they also said they believed warming would have significant impacts on Alaska and the world. But Leiserowitz found deep perceptual gaps between urban Alaskans, whose experience of climate change was limited, and rural residents. (People living in Kotzebue, for instance, were experiencing a threat to their culture from the erosion of sea ice, which limited their ice fishing.) In sum, Alaskans were no more worried than the American public as a whole about climate change. And they were no more inclined than typical Americans to see it as a serious threat to themselves or to their communities. About half of them, in fact, considered climate change a long-term problem that required more study before acting. 
 Among other things, the results suggested that experience of climate change is a relative thing: something happening to another part of your state, or to a different cultural group, doesn't necessarily warrant a change in your own response. It likewise hinted at the complexity of instilling feelings of climate-related urgency in Americans. If you don't think or feel there's a risk, why change your behavior? In response, researchers like Leiserowitz have investigated messages that could captivate all different kinds of audiences. Reaching a predominantly evangelical or conservative audience, Leiserowitz told me, could perhaps be achieved by honing a message of ''moral Christian values,'' an appeal possibly based on the divine instruction in Genesis 2:15 to tend and till the garden.
 Over the past few years, it has become fashionable to describe this kind of focused communication as having the proper frame. In our haste to mix jargon into everyday conversation, frames have sometimes been confused with nudges, a term made popular in a recent book, ''Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness,'' written by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein when they were academics at the University of Chicago. (Sunstein later moved to Harvard Law School and has since been nominated as the head of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.) Frames and nudges are not precisely the same; frames are just one way to nudge people by using sophisticated messages, mined from decision-science research, that resonate with particular audiences or that take advantage of our cognitive biases (like informing us that an urgent operation has an 80 percent survival rate). Nudges, more broadly, structure choices so that our natural cognitive shortcomings don't make us err. Ideally, nudges direct us, gently, toward actions that are in our long-term interest, like an automated retirement savings plan that circumvents our typical inertia. Thaler and Sunstein explain in their book that nudges can take advantage of technology like home meters, which have been shown to reduce electricity usage by making constant feedback available. These appeal to our desire for short-term satisfaction and being rewarded for improvement. Or a nudge might be as simple as a sensor installed in our home by a utility that automatically turns off all unnecessary power once we leave for the day -- a technology, in effect, that doesn't even require us to use our brains. ''I think the potential there is huge,'' Thaler told me recently, when I asked him about environmental nudges. ''And I think we can use a whole bag of tricks.''
 Leiserowitz and Weber spend a fair amount of time talking to scientists and policy makers about how to translate their insights into possible frames and nudges. In Weber's view, CRED was established because the traditional model of using decision research -- in which physical scientists doing a study might seek the input of psychologists at the end to help them frame their findings -- seemed both backward and ineffective. ''By then it's too late,'' Weber said, ''because you haven't explored all the initial options that would have been more beneficial.'' In other words, Weber says he believes decision science isn't only about structuring choices or finding the right frame to get a better outcome; it's about identifying useful information that can be used for innovative products, policies and scientific studies. At the National Research Council, Paul Stern offered the example of a climatologist who had been discussing climate change with cherry farmers in several Michigan counties. The farmers didn't care about future temperatures as much as the date of the last spring frost. ''No one has been interested in trying to predict the date of the last spring frost,'' Stern told me, but maybe they should be. ''They've been trying to predict average temperature and heat waves.'' Weber likewise envisioned a similar application in technology or government policy. ''Whatever you design as the most cost-effective or technologically feasible solution might not be palatable to the end users or might encounter political oppositions,'' she said. Behavioral research could have helped you see such hurdles ahead of time. ''You could have designed a way to implement it better. Or you could have thought about another solution.''
 Over the winter, the Obama administration began working on regulations for carbon-dioxide emissions, arguably the most important climate-related policy ever undertaken. While many economists favor the simplicity of a carbon tax, it seemed every person of influence in the United States government agreed that a cap-and-trade policy -- in which carbon emissions are capped and firms can buy and sell credits -- was preferable. Perhaps this was understandable: the poisonous associations of the word ''tax'' appear to doom it as a policy. And yet this assumption can obscure what actually happens in the minds of Americans on this issue. Not long ago, David Hardisty, a student of Weber's, led an experiment in which a 2 percent fee added to an airline ticket was described to various subjects as either a carbon ''tax'' or a carbon ''offset.'' The subjects were told the fee would finance alternative-energy and carbon-reduction technologies. Hardisty predicted he would get different results from Democrats and Republicans, and that was indeed the case. Democrats were willing to pay a fee for an offset or a tax; Republicans were willing to pay for an offset but not a tax. Clearly, the tax frame affected the outcome -- very much so for Republicans.
 A more interesting part of the experiment came next. Hardisty asked his subjects to write down their thoughts, in order, as they decided whether to pay the tax or the offset. Why should this matter? We've long understood that many of us find the word ''tax'' repellent, but we don't know precisely how it repels us. For the past few years, Weber and her husband, Eric Johnson, a professor at Columbia's business school, have been looking at how we construct our preferences when making a choice; they theorize that we ''query'' ourselves, mustering evidence pro and con from memory as we clear a path to a decision. The order of the thoughts matters -- early thoughts seem to sway our opinion, biasing subsequent thoughts to support the early position. For Republicans in the experiment who considered a carbon tax, their early thoughts were strongly negative (''I will be old and dead by the time this world has an energy crisis'') and thus led to conclusions that were overwhelmingly negative, too. That's why they rejected the tax. Yet for the same group, the word ''offset'' actually changed the way subjects processed their choice. In their thinking, they considered the positive aspects of the offset first -- the financing of clean energy -- and found the overall evidence positive and acceptable. Indeed, in a follow-up study by Hardisty, merely asking people to list their thoughts about the fee in one order or another (pros first or cons first) affected their preference, regardless of whether they were Democrats or Republicans.
 So in terms of policy, it may not be the actual tax mechanism that some people object to; it's the way a ''trivial semantic difference,'' as Hardisty put it, can lead a group to muster powerful negative associations before they have a chance to consider any benefits. Baruch Fischhoff, a professor at Carnegie Mellon and a kind of elder statesman among decision scientists, told me he's fairly convinced a carbon tax could be made superior to cap and trade in terms of human palatability. ''I think there's an attractive version of the carbon tax if somebody thought about its design,'' Fischhoff told me, adding that it's a fundamental principle of decision research that if you're going to get people to pay a cost, it's better to do it in a simple manner (like a tax) than a complex one (like in cap and trade). Fischoff sketched out for me a possible research endeavor -- the careful design of a tax instrument and the sophisticated collection of behavioral responses to it -- that he thought would be necessary for a tax proposal to gather support. ''But I don't think the politicians are that informed about the realm of the possible,'' he added. ''Opinion polls are not all that one needs.''
 One objection to potential nudges, whether on carbon taxes or household energy use, is that they can seem insidious. ''They empower government to maneuver people in its preferred directions,'' Thaler and Sunstein note in their book, ''and at the same time provide officials with excellent tools by which to accomplish that task.'' Thaler and Sunstein conclude that a crucial principle is to always preserve choice as an option (nudging people with a home energy meter, for instance, is fine as long as they can opt out of using it). Weber and David Krantz, two of the co-directors of CRED, have given the matter a good deal of thought, too. ''People need some guidance over what the right thing to do is,'' Krantz told me. But he said that he was doubtful that you could actually deceive people with decision science into acting in ways that they don't believe are right. ''Remember when New York tried to enforce its jaywalking laws?'' he asked. ''You can't enforce stuff that people don't believe should be done.''
 When I raised the issue of possible ethical dilemmas with Weber, she countered by claiming that government constantly tries to instill behaviors that are considered to be in society's best interest. ''There's no way around it,'' she told me. ''We're always trying to push some agenda.'' Take the decision to allow certain kinds of mortgages and securities to be sold that are now considered disastrous. In doing so, according to Weber, ''we were privileging certain people, and certain institutions. And for a long time we were pushing the idea that everyone should own a house.'' As for the question of manipulation, Weber contended that there is no neutral, ''value-free way'' of presenting people with information. ''I think you have to take it as a given that whatever we do, whether it's what we currently do or what we plan to do,'' she said, ''has some value judgment built into it.'' The crucial question, at least to her, is whether (and when) we want to use the tools of decision science to try and steer people toward better choices. If our preferences aren't fixed the way we think they are -- if, as Weber has argued, they're sometimes merely constructed on the spot in response to a choice we face -- why not try new methods (ordering options, choosing strategic words, creating group effects and so forth) to elicit preferences aligned with our long-term interest? That has to be better, in Weber's opinion, than having people blunder unconsciously into an environmental catastrophe.
 In fact, any potential climate disasters, at least to a behaviorist like Weber, would likely signal the start of an intriguing but ultimately dismal chain of events. A few years ago Weber wrote a paper for the journal Climatic Change that detailed the psychological reasons that global warming doesn't yet scare us; in it, she concluded that the difficulties of getting humans to act are inherently self-correcting. ''Increasing personal evidence of global warming and its potentially devastating consequences can be counted on to be an extremely effective teacher and motivator,'' she wrote, pointing to how emotional and experiential feelings of risk are superb drivers of action. ''Unfortunately, such lessons may arrive too late for corrective action.''

HEADLINE: Notre Dame and the Obama Invitation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Degrees of Acceptance at Notre Dame,'' by Richard V. Allen (Op-Ed, April 12): 
 Mr. Allen argues that President Obama should not be awarded an honorary degree by Notre Dame because of his support for abortion rights. He reasons that because Catholic doctrine opposes abortion, according Mr. Obama this honor would be an implicit and hypocritical endorsement of anti-Catholic policy positions.
 But Mr. Allen's reasoning is highly suspect. He and his alma mater clearly had no such moral qualms awarding an honorary degree to George W. Bush, whose positions on pre-emptive war and the death penalty are now infamous. Catholic doctrine opposes these entities no less vociferously than it does abortion, yet Mr. Bush was apparently allowed to receive his degree without a similar protest. 
 As a Catholic Democrat, I supported Mr. Obama because I believed that the sum of his policy positions -- ending war, fighting poverty and working for social justice -- were aligned with my own values. Mr. Allen is entitled to his own opinion of Mr. Obama, and Notre Dame is free to give accolades to whomever it deems fit. But Mr. Allen would do well to apply some intellectual consistency to his arguments instead of knee-jerk, politically motivated emotionality.
 Roger Shih San Antonio, April 12, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Many American Catholics recognize that the debate over President Obama's appearance at Notre Dame is not primarily about abortion. It is about the proper place of debate and dissent within the Catholic Church. 
 The church hierarchy has worked for almost three decades to turn American Catholics into single-issue voters on abortion, and in the process, to reassert ecclesiastical authority over the Catholic community. 
 Of course, if opposition to abortion is the only nonnegotiable issue for Catholics, then the Republican Party becomes the only moral choice for Catholic voters. Together with a majority of Americans, millions of Catholic voters have rejected this simplistic perspective on the challenges facing our country.
 The ethical dilemmas at the heart of the abortion debate are complex. The same is true for capital punishment, war and the myriad economic and social policies that carry life and death consequences. Notre Dame is precisely the place where these difficult conversations should be welcomed.
 Liesl Haas San Jose, Cost Rica, April 12, 2009
 The writer is a member of the Notre Dame class of 1990.
 To the Editor:
 Reflecting on the University of Notre Dame's decision to invite President Obama to speak at commencement and to award him an honorary degree, Richard V. Allen contends that the university should not award the president an honorary degree since his stance on abortion contradicts the Catholic Church's views. 
 Yet surely Mr. Allen realizes that at that same commencement, degrees will be awarded to hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of graduating students whose views on abortion and other issues, like gay rights, are not in accord with those of the university and the Catholic Church. 
 Awarding a degree -- whether earned as a student or given as an honorarium -- should not have to be predicated on total agreement with the church or the university. Congratulations to Notre Dame for this decision; I hope that it will not be rescinded.
 Joan Cichalski Little Silver, N.J., April 13, 2009
 To the Editor:
 In noting that Notre Dame University awarded an honorary degree to Ronald Reagan, Richard V. Allen completely undermines his contention that Barack Obama should not receive a similar honor. President Reagan was not in sync with several of the church's strongly held positions: opposing the death penalty, the importance of helping the poor and advancing the basic rights of workers. 
 It would be a huge mistake for Notre Dame, or any Catholic school, to restrict itself to awarding honorary degrees only to those who agree with the church's position on one issue, whatever that issue may be. My wife, my daughter and I all hold degrees from Notre Dame, and unless it is to be a ''university'' in name only, it must certainly have the freedom to honor a president with whom there is some disagreement, whether it is Ronald Reagan or Barack Obama.
 John M. O'Connor Montclair, N.J., April 12, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Next the traditionalists will want to vet the orthodoxy of Notre Dame's quarterbacks. Well, maybe not if we're 11 to zip and U.S.C. is coming to town.

HEADLINE: Flirting With Cuba, Courting a Hemisphere

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
SINCE Fidel Castro gave up power last year, the long standoff between Cuba and the United States has taken on the measured rhythms of a minuet, delicate steps from Havana met with restrained advances from Washington, each side hiding behind a pose of purpose that may mask their true intentions. 
 In his first 100 days after formally taking over for his ailing older brother, Raul Castro made it seem as if he was interested in changing Cuba's relationship with the United States. He quickly lifted a number of restrictions so that Cubans on the island could stay at tourist hotels, buy cellphones and toasters, and in certain cases, farm state land, things Fidel Castro never allowed. 
Some parts of ''la familia Cubana'' -- the extended family of Cubans on the island and Cuban-Americans in the United States -- welcomed the steps as long overdue indicators of a new, post-Fidel era. But many others in the family felt the steps were superficial, and a year later, it appears that they were mostly right. Those changes have not turned out to be the precursors of a major shift toward freedom, democracy or a better life for the Cuban people. It is not even clear that Fidel Castro, who has not been seen in public in over two and a half years, is not still pulling the strings. Political prisoners remain in prison, cellphones remain luxuries for the few, and Cubans are no freer to express their opinions.
 Now it is Washington's turn to lead. Last Monday, before the end of his first 100 days in office, President Obama fulfilled a campaign promise to lift restrictions so Cuban-Americans could visit relatives on the island as often as they like and send them as much money as they want. Mr. Obama also said he would make it possible for American companies to vastly increase cellphone service in Cuba, enabling Cubans whom Raul Castro allowed to buy cellphones to actually get to use them. 
 Once again, reaction to the changes is split, with some members of la familia Cubana feeling the moves don't go nearly far enough, and should have been extended to all Americans, as a bill before Congress proposes. In that, they agree with Fidel Castro himself, who wrote that he considered the moves ''positive although minimal,'' because the 47-year-old economic embargo was left in place. Others say that lifting the restrictions gives the Castro brothers too much without their giving anything in return. Lincoln and Mario Diaz-Balart, Cuban-American brothers who represent southern Florida in Congress, issued a joint statement calling the changes ''a serious mistake'' that will help the Castro regime, rather than force it to change. 
 But Mr. Obama is appealing to a broader audience than just Cubans and Cuban-Americans, politically powerful though the latter may be. It was no accident that the reshaping of Cuba policy came at the beginning of the equivalent of a Latin American sweeps week. Given all the other issues on the president's plate, Latin America is not likely to remain in the spotlight for long. But for at least this last week, it has been near impossible to miss the administration's outreach to the region.
 After the new Cuba policy was announced, the president made his first visit to troubled Mexico, where he heard President Felipe Calderon call for an end to the Cuba embargo. From Mexico City, Mr. Obama flew to Port of Spain in Trinidad to meet with Latin American leaders at the fifth Summit of the Americas. There he worked to regain some of the prestige and influence the United States has lost in the region over the last decade. 
 All the countries of the Americas are taking part in the summit conference except Cuba, which was excluded because it does not have a democratically elected leader. Although not physically present at the meeting, Cuba was clearly at the center of attention.
 White House aides have said the changes in Cuba policy were not a response to pressure from Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, or other leaders in the region who, to a country, oppose the American policy toward Cuba and planned to use the Trinidad conclave to press for an end to the embargo. Rather, the aides framed the changes as an attempt to reach out directly to the Cuban people, and beyond. Jeffrey Davidow, the former ambassador to Mexico who is directing the administration's efforts at the summit, called the Latin America trip ''part of the process of re-engaging with this hemisphere.'' 
 Despite that White House description, analysts of American policy toward Latin America said they thought the announcement of measured changes to Cuba policy just before the conference was an effort to defuse tensions at the meeting, and to send a broader signal to the hemisphere. For example, Daniel P. Erikson, an analyst at the Inter-American Dialogue who recently published a book on United States-Cuba relations, said that the new Cuba policy was more restrained than might have been expected from the new administration because Mr. Obama was trying to reach two separate constituencies -- all parts of la familia Cubana, as well as his fellow leaders in the hemisphere, who would find it difficult to believe that Washington is turning a page in Latin American relations if it clung to its hard line against Cuba. 
 Mr. Obama has said he is unwilling to lift the embargo before Cuba begins to address the gravest human rights violations, and in Mexico he said the next move was up to Havana. Raul Castro then responded that Cuba was willing to discuss everything with the United States, so long as it was between equals. 
 And so the minuet continues. But it is being played out at a time when Cuba, in many ways, simply does not matter as much as it did before. Cuba no longer represents much of a threat, either to the United States or to other governments. The Castros are exporting doctors, not revolution, and the Soviet menace 90 miles from Florida evaporated long ago.
 The United States, in fact, has new hemispheric priorities -- like handling a bellicose Mr. Chavez and strengthening bonds with the political and economic powerhouse that Brazil is becoming. Managing expectations about his policy toward Cuba enables the president to gain ground and leverage for dealing with these and other more pressing issues in the hemisphere. In other words, the biggest problem Cuba presents to the United States now is that it is still a problem at all.
 A final resolution of American-Cuban enmity in these times would probably not bring drastic changes affecting many beyond those members of la familia Cubana who yearn for reunification, and the travel industry. And the global economic meltdown dampens even those expectations. The Cuban economy is so battered now that it would be overwhelmed by American competition. By postponing reconciliation for so long, the Castro brothers may end up having cheated Cuba out of a chance to gain what they seemed to want most all these years -- a relationship of equals with the colossus up north.

HEADLINE: Major Plans, Softer Stands

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama is well known for bold proposals that have raised expectations, but his administration has shown a tendency for compromise and caution, and even a willingness to capitulate on some early initiatives. 
 It was inevitable that Mr. Obama's lofty pledge to change the ways of Washington would crash into the realities of governing, including lawmakers anxious to protect their constituents and an army of special-interest lobbyists. 
 Mr. Obama has not conceded on any major priority. His advisers argue that the concessions to date -- on budget items, for instance -- are intended to help win the bigger policy fights ahead. But his early willingness to deal or fold has left commentators, and some loyal Democrats, wondering: where's the fight? 
 ''The thing we still don't know about him is what he is willing to fight for,'' said Leonard Burman, an economist at the Urban Institute and a Treasury Department official in the Clinton administration. ''The thing I worry about is that he likes giving good speeches, he likes the adulation and he likes to make people happy.'' 
 So far, he said, ''It's hard to think of a place where he's taken a really hard position.''
 In some of his earliest skirmishes, Mr. Obama eventually chose pragmatism over fisticuffs. 
 Congressional Democrats effectively killed his proposal to slash farm subsidies by nearly $1 billion a year, and forced him to retreat partially on a plan to require private insurers to pick up more of veterans' health costs. They also got him to shelve the idea of a commission to buttress Social Security's finances. 
 And Thursday, Mr. Obama suggested that he would not fight in Congress to renew an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. It was the latest example of the pragmatic approach he adopted after winning the presidency by promising to challenge entrenched interests and put the public good ahead of political expedience. 
 Mr. Obama's top aides dismiss suggestions that he has shied from confrontation, saying they ignore his achievements, the need to move quickly to address economic woes and the fights he has picked against some big interest groups in Washington, including components of the Democratic base, like organized labor. 
 Pragmatism, they add, is an Obama hallmark, and among the changes he promised -- and has delivered -- is a break from his predecessor's often uncompromising style. 
 The extent to which he is willing to yield to lobbyists, Congressional committee leaders and interest groups, however, will be determined as the White House tackles health care and other big issues on a list that seems to grow: immigration, for instance, is now in the mix.
 ''We're not taking on a fight; we're taking on a multiple-front fight because we've taken on a series of entrenched interests across the waterfront -- from education to health care, and the defense industry, and the lobbying industry as a whole,'' the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, said. ''There will be a scorecard at the end of which ones we won and which ones we didn't, but every one of those policy challenges have been initiated by us.''
 Mr. Obama's allies point to his winning the second $350 billion in financial bailout money from a reluctant Congress; a pay-equity law for women; expanded government health insurance for children, including -- at his insistence -- legal immigrant children; and the $787 billion economic recovery bill that reached his desk, as demanded, by mid-February. 
 All that may end up looking easy compared with the fight on health care, which will most likely require him to stand up to hospitals, doctors, insurance companies and their patrons in Congress. He might have to finance the plan in a way that raises costs for the middle class, perhaps by taxing employer-provided health benefits -- an idea he attacked in the campaign. 
 Facing Democratic opposition in Congress, the White House seems prepared to give up on several tax proposals, including a limit on deductions that the wealthiest taxpayers can claim for charitable donations and state and local taxes, which was supposed to help pay for health care legislation -- raising doubts about how the president will finance it. 
 Wider Democratic majorities in Congress, while beneficial to the White House agenda, also mean a wider range of demands to be met. 
 Representative Charlie Melancon, a Louisiana Democrat and leader of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog coalition, praised the president's willingness to make concessions. ''If you go into the budget, you'll see there were concessions that were agreed to by the White House that were allowed to be put in by the Blue Dogs,'' he said. ''There was a little pushback, but they understood.'' 
 Experts on the presidency say that Mr. Obama, after promising profound change during the campaign last year, may have no choice but to continue talking big. 
 ''If Obama is too timid, if the White House is too cautious,'' said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian, ''it is going to make him look too opportunistic. He made all these promises during the campaign, he talked so boldly, he stirred all our hopes, and now he is not following through.'' 
 On complex issues like health care, Mr. Dallek said, there is advantage in angling for the final say. 
 ''It's kind of a technique to keep power in your hands,'' he said. ''Let these guys in the House, let the folks in the Senate battle with one another, battle it out. They are going to have to come to the president and have him adjudicate.'' 
 Administration officials say the approach to the economic stimulus bill is likely to be a model for dealing with Congress and interest groups, reflecting a style that fits the president's temperament and a West Wing with deep experience on Capitol Hill. Even before Mr. Obama took office, the stimulus started with a draft in the House that reflected his bottom line, his spending priorities and more tax cuts than many liberal Democrats wanted. Harder negotiations occurred in the Senate, where Democrats remain short of the votes needed to overcome Republican filibusters. 
 In the end, there was no grandstanding about big ideas. Instead, Mr. Emanuel and the budget director, Peter R. Orszag, set up shop in the office of the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and worked through the final demands to get the votes to clinch an agreement. 
 The administration seems content to let Democrats like Senator Max Baucus of Montana, a moderate to conservative, and Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California liberal, take the lead on health care, knowing that Mr. Obama can flex his political muscle later. 
 It does not hurt that Jim Messina, once chief of staff to Mr. Baucus, is a deputy White House chief of staff, or that Philip M. Schiliro, Mr. Waxman's former chief of staff, is Mr. Obama's chief liaison to Congress.

HEADLINE: Capitalism After The Fall

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 THE recession will end. No one is marking the calendar, least of all President Obama, but the president is hinting at an audacious ambition as he waits for that inevitable if distant day: a redefining of American capitalism.
 In a series of comments in recent weeks, Mr. Obama has begun to sketch a vision of where he would like to drive the economy once this crisis is past. His goals include diminishing the consumerism that has long been the main source of growth in the United States, and encouraging more savings and investment. He would redistribute wealth toward the middle class and make the rest of the world less dependent on the American market for its prosperity. And he would seek a consensus recognizing that an activist government is an acceptable and necessary partner for a stable, market-based economy.
 ''We cannot rebuild this economy on the same pile of sand,'' he said last week.
 In beginning to articulate a long-term approach, the president is putting an early stamp on a debate of historic importance -- and ideological underpinnings -- just getting under way in the United States and around the world. 
 For the better part of half a century after World War II, democratic capitalism built its modern framework against the backdrop of its death match with totalitarian Communism. In the two decades since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the American model of capitalism, largely unchallenged by ideological alternatives and increasingly dominant around the world, drifted toward what conservatives viewed as a more pure form of economic liberty and what liberals came to view as misguided free-market fundamentalism.
 But now, as the United States and other nations look for lessons in the wreckage from the excesses of that period, political leaders are confronting uncertainty about what economic structures and values should define capitalism's next chapter. Even before the current crisis, there were calls to rethink basic assumptions about the economy. Growth during the Bush presidency was slower than in any decade since before World War II, and incomes for most families have been growing slowly for much of the last three decades.
 Mr. Obama is stepping into the debate characteristically intent on avoiding polarizing labels, and his advisers describe his philosophy in terms of pragmatism rather than ideology.
 They said that the president's approach is based on a belief that recent economic cycles were driven too much by financial engineering; reserved most of the fruits of good times for the wealthy; relied excessively on foreign capital to finance domestic debt; and ultimately gave way to painful busts. Mr. Obama, they said, simply wants a more stable economic model.
 ''It's a strategy directed at having a somewhat different and healthier expansion than we've had in the past, driven by a sense that the expansion is likely to be more secure and its benefits more widely shared,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the White House's National Economic Council.
 But economic policy is never just technocratic, especially not when times are tough. 
 Conservative activists whipped up emotional anti-tax, anti-Obama ''tea parties'' around the country to mark tax-filing day last week, saying the White House was headed down a path of fiscal profligacy that would ultimately require broad tax increases. And the prospect of a Democratic administration pushing the United States to the left is seen by many conservatives as a political rallying cry.
 Arthur C. Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative research organization, said of the administration, ''They want much more of a European-style social democracy in which people are far less exposed to the vicissitudes of a market economy, and they want to have much easier access to manipulating the private-market economy.'' 
 Mr. Brooks said it was ''overheated and silly'' to suggest that Mr. Obama was leading the United States into socialism, but that even an effort by the administration to ''file off the rough edges of capitalism'' would no doubt prompt a continued strong backlash from people who object to the direction the president is heading. ''Of course conservatives are overstating the case against him because they want to win again, just like the left massively overstated the case against Bush,'' he said.
 Those on the left who have criticized Mr. Obama for being too timid in addressing the immediate crisis are similarly concerned that he will miss an opportunity to reshape American capitalism more fundamentally once the economy recovers. And even liberals allied with him suggest that the risk is that his ambition will prove too limited rather than too expansive.
 ''Again and again, Obamanomics, as well as his instincts in other areas of domestic policy, has been animated by a bold vision of what we need to do but has been quite cautious in practice,'' said Robert Reich, who was labor secretary under President Bill Clinton and advised Mr. Obama in the campaign.
 ''The benefit is that he can feel his way,'' Mr. Reich said. ''The downside is that none of the initiatives may be quite bold enough to solve the problems at the scale they present themselves.''
 The economic philosophy that Mr. Obama developed during the presidential campaign drew from across the ideological spectrum even as it remained rooted on the center-left. As that philosophy has been tested in practice through his early months in office, the president has if anything become more comfortable with an occasionally intrusive government as a counterweight to market forces that are now so powerful and fast-moving that they cannot be counted on to be self-correcting when things go wrong. He regularly rebuts conservative criticism on that score by pointing out that it was George W. Bush, just before he left the White House, who put the government in the business of deciding which financial institutions would fail and which would be allowed to survive. 
 Yet if Mr. Obama's position brings the United States full circle from Ronald Reagan's nostrum that government is the problem, it also stresses continuity and a commitment to the most basic conservative tenets: the power of markets as an engine of innovation and prosperity, and the necessity of economic growth for improving incomes and living standards.
 ''There is a vibrancy to our economic model, a durability to our political model and a set of ideals that has sustained us through even the most difficult times,'' Mr. Obama said on his recent trip to Europe when asked about the decline of the American version of capitalism.
 He would be willing to use the usual liberal policy tools to redistribute wealth after a recent period in which the gains have gone primarily to a relative few at the top of the income scale. But he would stress personal responsibility rather than entitlement. He would promote trade, but codify the Democratic push of the last 15 years for more labor and environmental protections in trade agreements.
 If more activist government is the most controversial aspect of his long-term approach, the most ambitious might be his aspiration to reduce the degree to which the United States is a consumer-driven economy -- or at least to develop policies that recognize the likelihood that consumer demand cannot grow at the rates it has been without being accompanied by a growing and destabilizing mountain of debt.
 ''We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity -- a foundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest, where we consume less at home and send more exports abroad,'' Mr. Obama said in his economic speech last week.
 Embedded in that approach is a far-reaching implication: that the rest of the world should no longer count on the United States to snap up imported goods or run up large trade deficits.
 It is by no means clear that Mr. Obama has the policy tools needed to bring about that kind of change; we are, after all, fundamentally a consumer society. His advisers point to his support for innovative ways of increasing personal savings. 
 To drive economic growth in the place of debt-fueled consumption, Mr. Obama is banking on the emergence of alternative fuels, pollution-limiting technology, health care technology and other new industries linked to broader policy goals. 
 But the viability and scale of those opportunities is open to debate. And some of the administration's own policies suggest that there are limits to Mr. Obama's willingness to bolster investment in new production capacity at home. His unwillingness so far to confront China aggressively over its currency and trade practices, for examples, leaves many American manufacturers at a disadvantage. 
 Even with the economy and the financial markets showing a few tentative signs of improvement, which may be deceptive, it will be some time before Mr. Obama has the luxury of focusing on the long run. Still, in his first three months in office he has not been reluctant to think big -- and there may be no better time to start redirecting an economy as huge and complex as this one than when it is in flux.

HEADLINE: Debt Settlement Firms Offer Promises but Little Help

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
Tyna Carter, burdened with $25,000 in credit card debt, did not want to be a deadbeat. After looking for help on the Internet, Mrs. Carter, a West Virginia homemaker, wound up in the hands of a sweet-talking ''credit specialist'' from Texas.
He claimed his company, Credit Solutions of America, could set her on the road to a debt-free life. But what really happened, Mrs. Carter says, is that Credit Solutions pocketed nearly $4,000 of the couple's income, a little bit each month. Now they are in a deeper hole than ever.
It is a pervasive problem these days. With the economy on the ropes, hundreds of thousands of consumers are turning to ''debt settlement'' companies like Credit Solutions to escape a crushing pile of bills.
As many as 2,000 settlement companies operate in the United States, triple the number of a few years ago. Settlement ads offering financial salvation blanket radio and late-night television. 
Consumers who turn to these companies sometimes get help from them, personal finance experts say, but that is not the typical experience. More often, they say, a settlement company collects a large fee, often 15 percent of the total debt, and accomplishes little or nothing on the consumer's behalf.
State attorneys general are being flooded with complaints about settlement companies and other forms of debt relief. In North Carolina, complaints doubled last year, while in Florida they tripled, spokeswomen for the state attorneys general said. In Oregon, complaints have quadrupled since 2006.
The rapid rise of debt settlement is the result of two colliding forces: Americans owe more on their credit cards than ever, a result of the spending binge of the last decade. But as the recession deepens, their ability to pay is declining.
Kaulkin Ginsberg, a consulting firm, estimated that the amount of consumer credit at risk of default increased in February by $5 billion, to $24.5 billion.
High credit card rates and fees have been a point of contention for consumer advocates. On the NBC program ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday, the administration's chief economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, said President Obama planned to crack down on abusive credit card lending that forces Americans to pay excessive interest rates.
For many consumers, their only hope for solvency is to get their balances down to a manageable level. But the card companies -- concerned for their own solvency -- are not inclined to let them off the hook.
Debt settlement companies claim they help both creditor and consumer by bridging the abyss between them.
''There is overwhelming demand for this service,'' said Robby H. Birnbaum, a lawyer who is a board member of the Association of Settlement Companies, a trade group. ''People want to avoid bankruptcy, and this is their last resort.''
In practice, however, the debt settlement firms frequently manage to please no one. An executive of the American Bankers Association, representing the credit card industry at a recent forum, labeled debt settlement companies ''very harmful'' to both creditor and consumer. Even debt collectors are upset, saying the settlement companies prevent them from collecting.
The premise of debt settlement is simple: A consumer stops trying to pay even the minimum on his cards. Instead, he accumulates money in an account that the settlement company promises to use to strike a bargain with creditors. Confronted with the certainty of some money now versus the possibility of no money later, the card company settles for 40 cents on the dollar or less.
Even if the goal makes sense, achieving it can be difficult.
Once the consumer stops paying the minimums, the card companies increase efforts to collect. Their fees and interest charges do not stop. They may sue. The consumer's credit score falls through the floor.
Long before making any attempt at a deal with creditors, the settlement companies take a fee. Credit Solutions deducted $233 from the Carters' checking account for three months, and then $116 a month for the next 27 months -- a total of about $3,825 by early this year.
It was a fee Mrs. Carter and her husband, Willard Carter, a miner who retired after he was injured, could ill afford -- especially since, by their account, the company put little effort into their case.
''After they got their money, they ran,'' said Mrs. Carter, 51.
The Carters went to the West Virginia attorney general's office in January, joining a flood of that state's citizens complaining about debt relief schemes. ''We're being overwhelmed,'' an assistant attorney general, Norman Googel, said.
Since 2005, Mr. Googel and his colleagues have successfully pursued cases against 14 companies promoting debt relief and debt settlement, resulting in refunds to 3,443 consumers, and they are pursuing more. And yet, he said, the complaints keep coming.
On March 26, Credit Solutions was sued by the State of Texas, which accused it of engaging in ''false, deceptive and misleading acts and practices.''
The suit says the company misrepresents its success rate, noting that the company's own data ''show that over 80 percent of the debts enrolled in the program do not settle.'' Those debts that are settled, the suit says, are for higher amounts than the promised 40 cents on the dollar.
Credit Solutions said it would not comment on pending litigation.
The settlement companies are the latest response to an old question: How can debt-ridden people avoid bankruptcy?
The first answer was nonprofit credit counseling, which began in the 1960s. The counselors, financed by the credit card industry, helped consumers formulate debt management plans and negotiated lower interest rates.
Counseling lost some of its appeal after creditors largely stopped offering the concessions needed to get people solvent again. The National Foundation for Credit Counseling, an umbrella group for legitimate counseling services, announced last week that the country's top 10 credit card issuers had agreed to make changes to provide additional relief.
The diminishing effectiveness of nonprofit efforts created an opening for commercial settlement companies. Debt settlement is not regulated by federal law, as debt collection is, though general fraud and deceptive-marketing laws may apply. The Federal Trade Commission has successfully pursued seven cases against debt settlement companies since 2001, but one of the agency's commissioners, J. Thomas Rosch, said that such cases take time and staff.
''I favor self-regulation that's not a fig leaf,'' Mr. Rosch said.
After inquiries from The New York Times, Credit Solutions sent a full refund to the West Virginia couple, the Carters, saying it was committed to customer satisfaction. The company blamed ''communications problems'' for troubles with the Carters' account.
The Carters need every penny of their refund. They now owe much more than when they enrolled with Credit Solutions three years ago. For instance, interest and fees have increased the balance on one of their cards to $18,000, from $8,000.
''I was trying to do the right thing,'' Mrs. Carter said, ''but it didn't work that way.''

HEADLINE: A Blast, an Ambush and a Sprint to Escape a Taliban Kill Zone

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

 BODY:
ALIABAD, Afghanistan -- The two Army lieutenants crouched against boulders beside the Korangal River. Taliban gunfire poured down from villages and cliffs above, hitting tree branches and rocks and snapping as the bullets passed over the officers' helmets.
An American platoon was pinned in the riverbed, which had blossomed into a kill zone. One squad and the radio operator were trapped in a wheat field on the far side. An improvised bomb had just exploded in their midst. The blast wave had blown the soldiers down, and, though the platoon did not yet know it, killed a soldier on the trail.
The platoon leader, company executive officer and another squad crouched exposed at a stream junction, trying to arrange help as the bomb's smoke drifted through the misty rain. A third squad was on the slope behind them, returning fire.
Two footbridges separated the three American groups. No one could run across them during fire like this. 
Another pitched firefight in a ravine in eastern Afghanistan had begun, shaped by factors that have made the war against the Taliban seem unending: grueling terrain that favors ambushes and prevents American soldiers from massing; villages in thorough collaboration with insurgents; and experienced adversaries each fighting in concert with its abilities and advantages.
The Taliban fighters had struck with surprise, stealth and familiarity with the ground, executing the sort of ambush that Afghan guerrillas have mastered for generations.
The Americans, seasoned by years of war here and in Iraq, would seek to create an intricately violent response, designed to undo the odds, save the pinned soldiers and kill the insurgents who, for a moment, had shown themselves.
Second Lt. Justin R. Smith, the platoon leader, called for help from an artillery battery, then radioed Sgt. Craig W. Tanner, the squad leader on the opposite side. Each man had found what cover he could. The platoon would fight where it was.
''Lead element: stand by where you're at,'' the lieutenant said. ''If you come back across the river you're going to expose yourself.'' He glanced across the water at his radio operator, Specialist Robert Soto. ''Soto!'' he shouted. ''Stay there! Stay! There!''
There are moments in many firefights that verge on chaos. This was one of them. Specialist Soto's ears were ringing. He could not hear. ''We gotta move!'' he shouted.
--
The American patrol had left Korangal Outpost, the base for Company B of the First Battalion, 26th Infantry, on Wednesday, roughly an hour before the ambush. Its mission had been to enter the village of Laneyal and meet with local elders.
Preparing for the mission, the company's Second Platoon had predicted a fight. The platoon had ambushed a Taliban unit a few days before, killing at least 13 insurgents. The Taliban would want revenge, said Sgt. First Class Thomas Wright, the platoon sergeant, and a patrol to Laneyal meant a walk into a bad village.
Afghanistan is myriad wars within a war, with varying terrain, climates, economies and insurgent groups creating a puzzle of shifting contests for influence. The Korangal Valley is the center of one of the most vicious contests of all.
Relatively few Arabs or foreigners come here, the company's officers say. But the Korangalis, a hardened and isolated people with their own language, have managed to lock the American Army into a bloody standoff for a small space for more than three years.
The Korangalis have fought, the officers say, in part because they support the Taliban and in part because they are loggers and the Afghan government banned almost all timber cutting, putting local men out of work.
Korangal Outpost itself symbolizes the dispute. It occupies a former sawmill, and the mill's displaced owner is a main organizer of the insurgency. The Taliban pay the best wages in the valley now, the officers said.
Company B's relations with local villagers are cordial but ultimately unhelpful, undermined by deception. After the platoon ambushed the Taliban patrol several days earlier, for instance, elders arrived at the outpost to say that the Americans had shot up a search party of local men who were looking for a lost girl. The company commander, Capt. James C. Howell, told the elders it was one of the most ridiculous lies he had ever heard.
--
The platoon reached Aliabad, the village on the slope opposite Laneyal, and began the descent down a stone staircase to the river. On the way down they met Zarin, an elder from Laneyal, who was heading up.
Zarin exchanged pleasantries and shook hands with Company B's executive officer, First Lt. John P. Rodriguez, and bounded quickly away.
The platoon continued on. With several soldiers remaining in Aliabad with guns aimed at the opposite side, two squads and the officers crossed a narrow footbridge and reached a point where two branches of the river converge.
Then the lead squad crossed the second bridge, entering a terraced wheat field. The Taliban let the first five men cross, then detonated the bomb under Pfc. Richard A. Dewater, 21, as he walked up the trail. It was a huge explosion, heaving dirt and rock high in the air.
The Taliban opened fire. The ambush was on.
Lieutenant Smith asked Sergeant Tanner for a report. The blast had blown the sergeant off his feet, spinning him around and throwing him down. He was disoriented. He said he thought he had all of his men.
As the firing neared its peak, Lieutenant Smith ordered the men around him to disperse so they could not all be struck by a single burst of fire. Then he provided covering fire so the artillery observer and a machine gun team could run back across the first bridge, gain elevation in Aliabad and cover the squad in the field.
A soldier caught in an ambush -- looking for safety while returning fire, with ears ringing and skin pouring sweat -- can feel utterly alone, trapped in a box of crisscrossing lead and terrifying sound, with death an instant away.
He is actually part of something more complicated. Bullets flew down into the riverbed from three sides. But as the lieutenants worked their radios, soldiers outside the kill zone were trying to erode the Taliban's opening advantage.
Within the platoon, the squad in the rear of the column set up its machine guns and was firing on several of the Taliban shooting positions. A group of Afghan National Army soldiers, directed by a Marine corporal, was also firing.
In American firebases on ridges along the valley, soldiers with heavier machine guns and automatic grenade launchers focused on Afghan buildings in three villages -- Donga, Laneyal and Darbart -- from where the trapped platoon was taking fire.
Farther back, at Company B's outpost, a pair of Air Force noncommissioned officers was directing aircraft into position, while two 120-millimeter mortars were firing high-explosive and white phosphorus rounds at targets the platoon had identified.
Alternately crouched and standing on the open rock spur, the lieutenants rushed to influence the fight and plan an escape from the trap. Once the American response began to build and the Taliban firing subsided, Lieutenant Rodriguez told Lieutenant Smith, they would throw smoke grenades along the river bank and pull back.
Specialist Soto could not wait. After mortar rounds began landing, he and a photographer for The New York Times dashed down the bank, splashed into the chest-deep brown river, lunged across the current and crawled out on the opposite side.
They staggered up the Aliabad slope and slipped behind a building as the platoon's guns fired, covering their dash. They had made it out of the worst of the kill zone.
The Taliban kept firing. The American squad in the wheat field, perhaps 50 yards away, radioed that insurgents were getting closer and that the soldiers risked being overrun. At almost the same time, Air Force Staff Sgt. Kenneth Walker radioed Lieutenant Rodriguez with news that the first 500-pound aircraft bomb was about to strike.
''They're going to do the drop in, like, 30 seconds!'' Lieutenant Rodriguez shouted to Lieutenant Smith. ''Let your boys know!''
The aircraft had arrived just in time. A Taliban fighter appeared behind a stone fence. He was almost atop the soldiers in the field.
''We got muzzle flashes,'' Lieutenant Smith said, and now the Americans had clear targets. The stones beside where the Taliban fighter had stood began to splinter as the platoon's bullets struck it. Then the satellite-guided bomb whooshed in and exploded.
Two stray rocket-propelled grenades landed to the lieutenants' left side. But the Taliban's firing decreased, as if the insurgents, experienced with American tactics, had sensed the battle shifting and were being ordered back.
The platoon threw smoke grenades, obscuring visibility in the riverbed. Five soldiers appeared at the edge of the green stand of wheat, running toward the officers.
They leapt into the water. The two lieutenants had spent the fight exposed; now they ran back across the first footbridge. The platoon climbed the steep staircase into Aliabad and took cover.
As the soldiers panted for air, they cursed Zarin, the elder who had walked through the kill zone just before the ambush; he had set them up, they said.
Two more airstrikes blew apart two buildings on the opposite side from where the Taliban had been firing. The battle quieted.
Pfc. Rogger J. Webb looked at Specialist Soto, the last man to cross the bridge before the bomb had exploded on the trail. ''Man, I thought --'' he said.
''You thought I was gone?'' Specialist Soto said.
Private Webb nodded. The platoon did a head count and came to an awful realization: Private Dewater was missing. He had walked into the wheat field with the squad. He had not run out.
Private Webb swore. Had the Taliban captured him? Had he been struck during the fight? The soldiers did not know. The platoon retraced its steps toward Laneyal as the sun set.
--
Back at the outpost, American and Afghan soldiers flowed out into the darkness. The Afghans would scour the riverbed in case the missing soldier had ended up in the water. The captain told the platoons to be prepared to search every house in the villages, in case the Taliban had dragged him off.
Wearing night-vision equipment, the platoon combed the ambush site in the rain. The company waited for news. At 8:10 p.m., Specialist Soto's strained voice came over the radio.
''Break, break, break,'' he said, using the convention for stopping all conversations.
Everyone knew what it meant. Lieutenant Smith's voice replaced Specialist Soto's. ''We found him,'' he said. The first explosion had killed Private Dewater and lifted his body into a tree.
''Roger,'' the captain answered. ''Understand all.''
Sgt. Matthew R. Kuhn climbed the branches to free the missing man. In an instant, Second Platoon's mission had changed. It would carry Private Dewater on the first steps of his journey home.
The soldiers gently rested their friend onto a stretcher, organized into teams of litter bearers and began the long walk back, over the two footbridges, up the Aliabad staircase and past the other soldiers and Marines, who provided security and stood quietly in respect.
He was the fourth member of Second Platoon killed during nine months in the valley.
When the platoon reached its outpost at midnight, the company's commander, Captain Howell, was waiting. The soldiers gathered in the darkness. The captain spoke of his pride in the platoon and offered the first of many words of condolence.
''There is nothing I can say or anybody else can say that will bring Dewater back,'' he said, and reminded the platoon of its own ambush of the Taliban the week before. ''But the best thing we can do for him is to continue to do the type of stuff that you guys did the other day.''
The soldiers headed for the plywood shacks where they live, for the remainder of a night in which almost no one would sleep.
In the morning they disassembled and cleaned their weapons and recalled their friend as they played his favorite song: ''Nothing Else Matters,'' by Metallica. A heap of their bloody clothes burned in a small fire.
Private Dewater had been a combat replacement in the platoon: ''A real humble dude, and totally positive about everything we did,'' Specialist Soto said.
His body had already been flown off the outpost by helicopter in the night, the next step of the trip back to the United States.
A few hours later, the soldiers slipped into their body armor and helmets, hoisted their weapons and walked back out for an overnight patrol.

HEADLINE: Selling to the Anxious

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
First, retailers enticed struggling consumers with deep discounts. Then they dangled buy-one-get-one free deals.
The latest recession tactic? Guaranteed financial help in the event of a job loss.
With countless workers hoarding cash and fearful of joining the swelling ranks of the unemployed, American companies are trying to stimulate demand with a new twist on an age-old retailing strategy: money-back guarantees.
In the last couple of months all kinds of companies -- car manufacturers, home builders, airlines, apparel chains, cellphone carriers -- have started promising their customers financial assistance, refunds, even free services, if they lose their jobs.
JetBlue will refund plane tickets. Virgin Mobile USA will waive up to three months of cellphone service charges. Walgreens will allow members of its in-store clinics to stay enrolled free if they lack health insurance. 
The Minnesota Timberwolves basketball team will refund season tickets for games not yet played. And the builder Bigelow Homes will pay the mortgage while the homeowner is out job hunting.
Last month, Bigelow mailed 15,000 fliers to Chicago-area residents promoting its ''recession-proof'' homes in Aurora, Ill.
''I saw the flier and thought 'Hmm, that is interesting,' '' said Desiree Miller, who lives about 20 minutes outside of Aurora and has been renting for about a decade.
She had no intention of buying a house, but the words ''recession-proof'' tempted her enough that she took a tour of the development. A day after stepping inside a home with three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a two-car garage, Ms. Miller plunked down a deposit.
She figured home prices were unlikely to go much lower, after falling more than 20 percent statewide in the year that ended in February. Also, beyond the job-loss guarantee, Bigelow promised that if the value of her home did decrease, it would pay her the difference.
''It really is a good time to buy a house, and with everything else they put behind it, it just made it a good decision,'' Ms. Miller said, referring to depressed prices and low interest rates. ''Those guarantees just helped solidify that decision.''
The recession-proof home pitch has not unearthed throngs of buyers, but Michael Venetis, Bigelow's vice president for sales and marketing, said, ''we sold six homes that we can attribute directly to that promotion.''
Companies offering these extreme guarantees -- which typically require documentation to verify a job loss -- said they were a direct response to research showing that a growing number of consumers were worried they might lose their jobs.
Notably, the programs are not as expensive to companies as they might seem, retailing scholars said, since the offers are usually for a limited time and few people wind up taking advantage of the offers.
Bryan Baldwin, a spokesman for JetBlue, said the airline created its guarantee after noticing a change in ticket-buying habits.
''People were booking closer to their travel date, and we thought that could be an indication of people not feeling as comfortable making their travel arrangements as many months in advance,'' Mr. Baldwin said.
JetBlue's best deals are the ones booked furthest in advance, though. So in February the company announced that if customers lost their jobs, they could get a refund on their unused tickets. Last month the airline extended the guarantee to protect people who also bought JetBlue vacation packages.
At the men's retailer JoS. A. Bank, the $199 suit sale is nothing new. But for the first time the company said it would refund the price of a suit bought from March 16 to April 9 if the buyer had lost his job. Even better: the buyer can keep the suit.
''If we take a suit back we're going to give that suit to charity anyway -- it's been worn,'' said Jerry DeBoer, the company's senior vice president for marketing. ''You can go use it for the new job.''
Companies like JetBlue and JoS. A. Bank acknowledge that their guarantee programs were inspired in part by Hyundai Motor America. The car company began offering a job-loss guarantee called ''Assurance'' in January after realizing that tactics that typically lured shoppers -- like low-interest financing and cheap leases -- were not working.
Chris Hosford, a spokesman for Hyundai, said company executives sympathized with nervous consumers. ''We all got it because we all felt it too,'' he said. ''We have friends who have lost their jobs.''
Indeed, the recession guarantees can help retailers give the impression that they are not ''tone deaf,'' as Eric T. Anderson, a professor of marketing at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, put it. ''They're trying to say 'We get what's going on your side,' '' he said.
Hyundai's guarantee allows consumers who have lost their jobs to return a new car within a year of the purchase date. Another program, announced in February and offered until April 30, added 90 days of payment relief to the existing protection plan. Other car companies, like Ford and General Motors, followed suit with their own job-loss guarantees.
The Hyundai guarantee was among the reasons Doug Maran of Pembroke Pines, Fla., bought a limited-edition Sonata last week.
''You never know what's going to happen day to day anymore, why not?'' he said, testing his car's Bluetooth system as he climbed in for the first time on Friday.
Executives at Hyundai and other companies say that providing job-loss insurance has helped lift sales.
''Our research shows that about 10 percent of our sales from the first quarter of this year have come directly from that program,'' Mr. Hosford said.
Ted Johnson, chief marketing officer for the Minnesota Timberwolves, said that in the first six weeks of the team's promotion, ''we sold three times the number of tickets as the same time last year and doubled our revenue in new sales.''
Still, despite early signs of success, some scholars contend that the guarantees will be short-lived and will not generate significant sales.
''I don't think that would be the best way of doing it,'' said Claes G. Fornell, a professor at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, and director of the National Quality Research Center there.
''Warranties and guarantees, they reduce the risk of buying, that is true,'' Professor Fornell said. But, he said, consumers today care more about saving money than being insured against job loss. The national savings rate, in fact, has skyrocketed.
Guarantees are nothing new. They have been used for decades to reassure customers worried about the staying power of a new product or service. Guarantees linked to a consumer's work jitters, though, are unique to this deep recession.
''They're trying to move into a new area of risk reduction which is a little bit unusual,'' said Professor Anderson of the Kellogg School. ''These are just indicators of what's going on in the mind of the consumer.''
The new guarantees are intended not to give away suits or cellphone service, but rather to offer peace of mind. After all, the national unemployment rate rose to 8.5 percent last month, from 8.1 percent in February. And economists say the rate could soon climb into the double digits, as it already has in states like California and Michigan.
''I think the fear of job loss is relatively high right now,'' said Robert C. Blattberg, a professor of marketing and retailing who has held positions at Carnegie Mellon and Northwestern University, ''and even though it may only be two in one hundred, you're still afraid you are one of the two.''

HEADLINE: Porsche Introduces a Sedan in China, the Biggest Auto Market

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
Porsche unveiled its entry into the luxury sedan market here on Sunday night, the eve of the Shanghai auto show. It was the latest confirmation of the importance of the Chinese auto market and the first time that Porsche has entered a new market segment at an auto show outside Europe or North America.
 Auto sales rose 10 percent last month in China to a record, and exceeded sales in the United States for the third month in a row as the world's largest single-country market. That has prompted automakers from around the world to pay particular attention to the Chinese market, with a range of models to be introduced here. 
 Subcompacts and very small and simple minivans are the fastest-growing segments of the Chinese market. But China has also emerged as the world's second-largest market after the United States for a growing number of luxury car brands, and become the focus of energetic marketing by luxury manufacturers.
 The global economic slowdown, which trimmed Chinese growth to a still respectable 6.1 percent in the first quarter, has hurt luxury car sales, although less than in many other markets. Luxury car sales fell 8 percent in the first two months of this year compared with the period a year ago, according to the research firm J. D. Power and Associates.
 ''This year there will be some impact, but when the economy recovers, this segment will also grow,'' said Yale Zhang, a Chinese market forecaster in the Shanghai office of CSM Worldwide, a global automotive consulting firm.
 Not one of the models to be unveiled at the Shanghai auto show, which starts on Monday, has drawn more discussion in the auto industry than Porsche's entry, the Panamera. It is Porsche's first sedan after more than six decades of manufacturing sports coupes and, since 2002, the Cayenne car-based sport utility vehicle.
 Klaus Berning, Porsche's executive vice president for sales and marketing, acknowledged that the timing for entering a new market segment was difficult but said the company had received enough orders that it expected to meet its goal of selling 20,000 a year. ''The current orders already make us very comfortable and optimistic,'' he said.
 Company executives said that the car would start at $89,800 in the United States and more, sometimes much more, in countries with higher taxes. The turbo version with a V-8 engine will cost 2.5 million yuan, or $366,000, in China, which has stiff import taxes and heavy taxes on family vehicles with large engines.
 Porsche executives said that they expected the car to have better fuel efficiency than most luxury sedans, describing this as necessary for ''social acceptance'' at a time of international worries about global warming. They did not provide gas mileage statistics for the Panamera, however.
 A dark gray Panamera rolled onto a stage Sunday night on the 94th floor of the 1,614-foot Shanghai World Financial Center, the tallest building in mainland China, having been wedged nearly vertically into an elevator barely wide enough for the task. With long, smooth lines, the Panamera looked like a Porsche -- arguably more so than the much taller Cayenne.
 The rounded sides of the Panamera's front end are considerably higher than the hood, and the length of the front end compared with the passenger compartment preserves the image of power projected by the 911 series and the less expensive Boxster. With a long low rear window, the Panamera avoids looking like a lower-riding version of the Cayenne, which has been much scorned by sports car enthusiasts.
 To attract performance-car enthusiasts, the Panamera comes with a rear spoiler that automatically deploys from the back of the car at high speeds, using the air flow over the vehicle to help keep the rear wheels tightly pressed to the pavement for better control.
 In Asian countries like China with high levels of income inequality, wealthy car buyers frequently have chauffeurs. While Porsche purists tend to believe that the driving experience is the whole point of buying a Porsche, offering a spacious back seat could make the Panamera competitive as a chauffeured car.
 In an indication of how far the Panamera is from Porsche's traditional offerings, the company estimates that 90 percent of the car's buyers will be new to Porsche.

HEADLINE: Editorial Voice of an Influential Atlanta Newspaper May Move to the Right

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
In the 1950s and '60s, under Ralph McGill, The Atlanta Constitution infuriated conservative white readers with its liberal views, especially on segregation.
 Cynthia Tucker, the editorial page editor of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, has been heir to that tradition, provoking anger with strongly worded positions to the left of the region's popular opinion, like attacking the case for war against Iraq. She has also criticized figures revered on the left, and in Atlanta in particular, like the heirs of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
 But last week, the newspaper announced that Ms. Tucker would move to Washington, continuing to write her Pulitzer Prize-winning column, but not working on editorials and not setting the paper's official stance on issues. In fact, most of the editorial board will be replaced in May, a move that could create a different -- and perhaps less liberal -- voice for one of the country's leading regional papers. 
 Ms. Tucker and three others will leave the board, but will continue to write their columns. The paper's editor, Julia Wallace; the senior managing editor, James Mallory; and the publisher, Doug Franklin, will join the editorial board, a role they did not play before. Andre Jackson, who joined the board last year, will become the editorial editor. In addition, the paper recently hired two conservative columnists.
 Ms. Wallace said she expected the board to continue in the direction set in the last year or so, publishing fewer editorials, and avoiding hot-button ideological issues. 
 ''We have moved to a different kind of editorial that's much more about community issues and less about, 'let me opine on national issues,' '' she said.
 The new board members have not made their political views public. Asked about her own, Ms. Wallace said, ''I want to be about making Atlanta a better place.''
 Mr. Jackson, who Ms. Wallace said would write the editorials, was quoted last year in The Journal-Constitution as saying, ''I'd classify myself as center-right on fiscal and economic issues and a centrist to slightly center-left on many, but not all, social matters.''
 To some longtime readers inside and outside the paper, the changes add up to a stance that will be more conservative over all, and more averse to controversy.
 ''I think they're trying not to offend,'' said Kenneth Edelstein, a blogger and former editor of Creative Loafing, an Atlanta alternative weekly. ''It's definitely a move to the right, and it's a real change for a paper that was the most important progressive voice in the South for a long time.''
 Viewed historically, the last few years were an anomaly, with a single major editorial voice in town. Atlanta had two papers, the more liberal Constitution and the more conservative Journal, until their parent company, Cox Enterprises, merged them in 2002.
 Some Journal-Constitution editors said that what concerned them was not the political stance, but the fact that the top editors and the publisher would be on the board. Those editors insisted on anonymity, for fear of angering their bosses.
 At most major American newspapers, the newsroom, the editorial page and the business operations are run separately. In theory, that arrangement helps keep news and editorials free from adverse influences.
 ''If the business side is involved, there's a concern that advertisers or politicians will influence,'' said Kelly McBride, ethics group leader at the Poynter Institute, a school for journalists in St. Petersburg, Fla. And without separate news and editorial management, she said, ''it will be harder to maintain the perception that news coverage is independent of the official stance.''
 The new arrangement ''is not very unusual, but it's more typical of a paper in a smaller market,'' she added.
 Ms. Wallace said that at a time of severe cutbacks -- her news staff was recently cut by 30 percent -- ''this is not the biggest thing newspapers have to worry about.'' She also said the new editorial board would challenge powerful interests.
 For Ms. Tucker, the move to Washington could raise her already-high national prominence. She has written editorials for 17 years, at The Constitution and then at The Journal-Constitution.
 ''I have been contemplating a move to Washington off and on for seven or eight years now,'' she said. With a new administration taking office, and knowing ''that my staff would be shrinking,'' she said, the timing seemed right.
 She said she did not know what the new editorial board would be like, ''but editorial pages ought to draw controversy.''

HEADLINE: Cable Wars Are Killing Objectivity

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com http://twitter.com/carr2n

 BODY:
Apparently there is an ingredient in tea that causes hysteria when given to cable news anchors. How else to explain the coverage of the tax day tea parties on Wednesday, which was the day when we procrastinators finally mailed the check to the feds?
 The movement -- if that's what it is -- was spawned by a rant on Feb. 19 from the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange during a live report by the CNBC reporter -- if that's what he is -- Rick Santelli, suggesting that it was time to organize a ''tea party'' to protest government spending on failed mortgages. 
 The cable news networks took it from there. Fox News, after running more than 100 promos about its coverage of the event, which did a pretty effective job of marketing them at the same time, had wall-to-wall coverage on the anointed day and dispatched four of its leading hosts around the country to perform a kind of hybrid task, covering events that they also seemed to be leading.
 And in the increasingly politicized environment between the covered and coverers, Susan Roesgen of CNN, covering a tax protest in Chicago, could not have been more contemptuous of the people she was interviewing, shaking her finger at them and shouting them down. In a move that I'm sure freaked out her bosses, she suggested that the protests were ''antigovernment, anti-CNN.''
 Rachel Maddow of MSNBC frantically belittled the rhetoric and motives of those involved in the tea party events, even as she spent oodles of air time on the rallies. 
 Cable news stations have been criticized for ''event-izing'' all manner of minor news occurrences -- President Obama's first news conference comes to mind. But the Tax Day Tea Party was all but conceived, executed and deconstructed in the hothouse of cable news wars. 
 It used to be that cable networks would dispatch reporters to the same event and then head back to the studio where shouters from various sides would have it out. Now, in a kind of Hearstian twist, the news media are supplying both the pictures and the war. 
 ''Bring your kids and experience history,'' Glenn Beck advised on Fox News as he invited people to join him at the Alamo for a tax day protest, because, he said, ''our kids are being sold into slavery.'' 
 It was a kind of al fresco Howard Beale moment, an opportunity to gather in a group and shout about very real rage -- these are scary times for all working people -- that is nonetheless inchoate and unnameable. The burden being placed on the American economy and future generations is a significant issue -- according to fivethirtyeight.com, more than 300,000 people attended rallies in 346 cities -- but the event that gave voice to those concerns was far from spontaneous.
 The numbers that drove the fervor are not the kind that appear on a 1040 form. Last Wednesday night from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m., Fox News had an average of almost 3.4 million viewers, up more than a million compared with its average in March. MSNBC got a bump as well, with 250,000 more viewers, while CNN was only slightly up.
 In a sense, we seem to be returning to the days of the party press, where news outlets reflected viewpoints of specific wings of political thought. So perhaps the invocation of an event that took place in 1773 is not that far off the mark. 
 Even if the historic message of no taxation absent representation doesn't really scan because the current president won election decisively in a free and open election, the Tea Act that drew the scorn of colonials was, at bottom, a bailout of the East India Company, which was close to bankruptcy after huge misadventures in India. With bankers thumbing rolls of federal billions, the homage to the original Boston Tea Party was not quite a non sequitur. 
 ''The original tea party was something of a media event,'' said Robert J. Allison, professor and chair of the history department at Suffolk University and author of ''The Boston Tea Party.'' ''The papers at the time were very politicized and did a lot of campaigning during the run-up to the event.''
 He added: ''When you think about it, they could have done worse than a bag of tea in terms of symbols. As a historian, I am charmed and fascinated that something that provoked the original revolution still has such resonance.''
 The tea references are not the problem. When a media company sets itself as the party of opposition, it can have unforeseen consequences. The theatrics make it hard to tell where talk of secession -- the governor of Texas made a veiled threat -- states' rights and stringing up public officials transforms from hyperbole to reality. 
 The president was likened to Hitler on various posters at rallies, and a sign in Lafayette Park read, ''Stand Idle While Some Kenyan Destroys America? I Don't Think So.'' 
 The Fox Business reporter Cody Willard got in the spirit of things covering a Boston rally by suggesting that conservatives and liberals were ''both fascists who are taking my money and building up corporate America with my welfare.''
 You have to worry whether something that was intended to goose ratings and kick up debate could metastasize when it meets some of the baser urges of the fringe, among people who don't come out to rallies but are sitting in a basement steeped in their own misanthropy. 
 ''Together, they will draw a line in the sand, here, where it was originally drawn, live, at the Alamo,'' Mr. Beck said as Ted Nugent served up tasty guitar fills. Then Mr. Beck inveighed against Washington, the media, Democrats, Republicans, politicians -- you know, everyone who was not standing there at the Alamo.
 It had all the earmarks of a stump speech, replete with soaring applause lines and calls to action. But let's remember: the only thing Mr. Beck and the rest are running for is first place in the demo.

HEADLINE: Exxon Mobil Tops Wal-Mart To Lead a Poorer Fortune 500

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Exxon Mobil unseated Wal-Mart Stores in the 2009 Fortune 500 list, during what the magazine called the worst year ever for the country's largest publicly traded companies. 
 Fortune's list, released Sunday, ranked companies by their revenue in 2008. Exxon, which is based in Irving, Tex., took in $442.85 billion in revenue last year, up almost 19 percent from 2007. The company also had the biggest annual profit, earning $45.2 billion.
 Wal-Mart had held the top spot for six of the last seven years but fell to No. 2 this year. Still, the retail giant's 2008 revenue climbed 7 percent to $405.6 billion, as the battered economy sent more consumers searching for bargains. The company, which is based in Bentonville, Ark., had $13.4 billion in annual profit, an increase of about 5 percent.
 But overall earnings for the companies on the list plunged 85 percent to $98.9 billion from $645 billion in 2007. It was the biggest one-year decline in the 55-year history of the Fortune 500 list.
 Energy companies continued to dominate many of the top positions, as last summer's skyrocketing oil and gas prices more than compensated for their plunge in the fall. Chevron held on to third place with $263.16 billion in revenue, up 25 percent. ConocoPhillips climbed one place to fourth, with $230.76 billion in revenue. General Electric, the diverse conglomerate whose troubled financial arm has been weighing on recent results, rose one notch to fifth. 
 General Motors fell two spots to sixth, as revenue fell 18 percent and losses totaled $30.86 billion in the imploding car market. Ford Motor followed, with $146.28 billion in revenue.
 Among the hardest hit in 2008 were financial services companies, Fortune said. Banks, securities firms and insurers took cumulative losses of $213.4 billion, accounting for almost 70 percent of the total dollar decline from the peak year of 2006, the magazine said.

HEADLINE: Small-Town Big Spending

BYLINE: By TOM BROKAW. 
Tom Brokaw, a special correspondent for NBC News, is the author, most recently, of ''Boom! Talking About the '60s.''

 BODY:
DURING these uncertain times we've yet to hear a phrase with the resonance of Franklin Roosevelt's ''The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,'' but there are a couple of minor-chord expressions that should have staying power.
 One is the observation of Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, that ''you never want a serious crisis to go to waste.'' Another comes from my boss, Jeff Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, who has warned, ''This is not a cycle; it's a reset.'' 
 Taken together, these remarks challenge us to go beyond trying to quickly fix the immediate problems of toxic mortgages, risky banks, a struggling American car industry and escalating health care costs. If the American people are tuned into the need to change the irresponsible, inefficient practices and systems that created those problems, why not enlist them to take the next step and radically change the antiquated public structures that exist beyond the Beltway?
 Here are a few examples. It's estimated that New York State has about 10,500 local government entities, from townships to counties to special districts. A year ago a bipartisan state commission said that New Yorkers could save more than a billion dollars a year by consolidating and sharing local government responsibilities like public security, health, roads and education. 
 One commission member, a county executive, said, ''Our system of local government has barely evolved over the past one hundred years and we are still governed by these same archaic institutions formed before the invention of the light bulb, telephone, automobile and computer.'' 
 In accepting the commission's recommendations, Gov. David Paterson promised to work diligently to put the changes into effect. When his budget was presented this spring it included several of the proposed changes, but it immediately met stiff resistance even from members of his own party who were determined to protect their parochial interests. It appears that few of the original recommendations will survive. 
 In my native Great Plains, North and South Dakota have a combined population of just under 1.5 million people, and in each state the rural areas are being depopulated at a rapid rate. Yet between them the two Dakotas support 17 colleges and universities. They are a carry-over from the early 20th century when travel was more difficult and farm families wanted their children close by during harvest season.
 I know this is heresy, but couldn't the two states get a bigger bang for their higher education buck if they consolidated their smaller institutions into, say, the Dakota Territory College System, with satellite campuses but a common administration and shared standards?
 Iowa, next door, is having its own struggles with maintaining population, especially among the young. As the Hawkeye State's taxpayers grow older and less financially productive, the cost of government services becomes more expensive.
 Yet Iowa proudly maintains its grid of 99 counties, each with its own distinctive courthouse, many on the National Register of Historic Places -- and some as little as 40 miles away from one another. Each one houses a full complement of clerks, auditors, sheriff's deputies, jailers and commissioners. Is there any reason beyond local pride to maintain such duplication given the economic and population pressures of our time? 
 This is not a problem unique to the states I have cited. Every state and every region in the country is stuck with some form of anachronistic and expensive local government structure that dates to horse-drawn wagons, family farms and small-town convenience.
 If this is a reset, it's time to reorganize our state and local government structures for today's realities rather than cling to the sensibilities of the 20th century. 
 If we demand this from General Motors, we should ask no less of ourselves.

HEADLINE: Erin Go Broke

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
''What,'' asked my interlocutor, ''is the worst-case outlook for the world economy?'' It wasn't until the next day that I came up with the right answer: America could turn Irish.
 What's so bad about that? Well, the Irish government now predicts that this year G.D.P. will fall more than 10 percent from its peak, crossing the line that is sometimes used to distinguish between a recession and a depression. 
But there's more to it than that: to satisfy nervous lenders, Ireland is being forced to raise taxes and slash government spending in the face of an economic slump -- policies that will further deepen the slump. 
 And it's that closing off of policy options that I'm afraid might happen to the rest of us. The slogan ''Erin go bragh,'' usually translated as ''Ireland forever,'' is traditionally used as a declaration of Irish identity. But it could also, I fear, be read as a prediction for the world economy.
 How did Ireland get into its current bind? By being just like us, only more so. Like its near-namesake Iceland, Ireland jumped with both feet into the brave new world of unsupervised global markets. Last year the Heritage Foundation declared Ireland the third freest economy in the world, behind only Hong Kong and Singapore.
 One part of the Irish economy that became especially free was the banking sector, which used its freedom to finance a monstrous housing bubble. Ireland became in effect a cool, snake-free version of coastal Florida.
 Then the bubble burst. The collapse of construction sent the economy into a tailspin, while plunging home prices left many people owing more than their houses were worth. The result, as in the United States, has been a rising tide of defaults and heavy losses for the banks.
 And the troubles of the banks are largely responsible for putting the Irish government in a policy straitjacket.
 On the eve of the crisis Ireland seemed to be in good shape, fiscally speaking, with a balanced budget and a low level of public debt. But the government's revenue -- which had become strongly dependent on the housing boom -- collapsed along with the bubble. 
 Even more important, the Irish government found itself having to take responsibility for the mistakes of private bankers. Last September Ireland moved to shore up confidence in its banks by offering a government guarantee on their liabilities -- thereby putting taxpayers on the hook for potential losses of more than twice the country's G.D.P., equivalent to $30 trillion for the United States.
 The combination of deficits and exposure to bank losses raised doubts about Ireland's long-run solvency, reflected in a rising risk premium on Irish debt and warnings about possible downgrades from ratings agencies. 
 Hence the harsh new policies. Earlier this month the Irish government simultaneously announced a plan to purchase many of the banks' bad assets -- putting taxpayers even further on the hook -- while raising taxes and cutting spending, to reassure lenders.
 Is Ireland's government doing the right thing? As I read the debate among Irish experts, there's widespread criticism of the bank plan, with many of the country's leading economists calling for temporary nationalization instead. (Ireland has already nationalized one major bank.) The arguments of these Irish economists are very similar to those of a number of American economists, myself included, about how to deal with our own banking mess. 
 But there isn't much disagreement about the need for fiscal austerity. As far as responding to the recession goes, Ireland appears to be really, truly without options, other than to hope for an export-led recovery if and when the rest of the world bounces back.
 So what does all this say about those of us who aren't Irish?
 For now, the United States isn't confined by an Irish-type fiscal straitjacket: the financial markets still consider U.S. government debt safer than anything else. 
 But we can't assume that this will always be true. Unfortunately, we didn't save for a rainy day: thanks to tax cuts and the war in Iraq, America came out of the ''Bush boom'' with a higher ratio of government debt to G.D.P. than it had going in. And if we push that ratio another 30 or 40 points higher -- not out of the question if economic policy is mishandled over the next few years -- we might start facing our own problems with the bond market.
 Not to put too fine a point on it, that's one reason I'm so concerned about the Obama administration's bank plan. If, as some of us fear, taxpayer funds end up providing windfalls to financial operators instead of fixing what needs to be fixed, we might not have the money to go back and do it right. 
 And the lesson of Ireland is that you really, really don't want to put yourself in a position where you have to punish your economy in order to save your banks.

HEADLINE: As a Budget Gets Tighter, Police Battle Rising Crime

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C. 

 BODY:
Sgt. E. M. Marsh peers into the darkness, through the rain-speckled windshield of his Chevy Impala police cruiser, and recognizes the sinewy man in the black stocking cap.
 ''I locked this guy up already,'' he says, as his headlights flood the parking lot of an apartment complex north of downtown. ''A year ago, he was breaking into every house in this neighborhood, stealing laptops, DVD players.''
 Now he is back out in the world, carrying a rolled-up yoga mat in one hand and two cooking pots in the other. ''I just found these in the trash,'' the man insists as Sergeant Marsh leans against his front fender and questions him. ''I didn't do nothing.'' 
 Sergeant Marsh's mustachioed lips yield a beleaguered grin. ''Write down what he's got in his hands,'' he tells two patrol officers at the scene as he allows the man to melt back into the drizzly night. ''When somebody reports something missing out of their car, y'all will know where to look. I can guarantee you, he ain't doing no yoga.'' 
 With the punishing economic downturn, police officers in many American cities are confronting what they describe as a surge in property crime. At the same time, many are being forced to improvise and make do with less: The recession is shrinking the finances of local governments, limiting the resources of police departments. 
 Columbia, smack in the center of South Carolina, the state with the second-highest unemployment rate in the nation, saw property crimes increase by 14 percent last year from their 2007 level, according to the police department.
 ''Burglaries, auto breaks, anything pawnable gets stolen,'' Officer George Potash said.
 National crime statistics and academic literature generally support the notion that property crime tends to increase with unemployment, said Geoff Alpert, a criminologist at the University of South Carolina. 
 ''When people get desperate, they're going to feed their family,'' said Sheriff Leon Lott of Richland County, whose jurisdiction includes parts of Columbia and its suburbs. 
 Sheriff Lott has noticed a pronounced increase in insurance fraud and credit card scams in recent months. ''When you catch people and ask them why they did it, they'll say: 'I'm desperate. I can't pay my bills.' ''
 When the economy falters, struggling local governments fail to add enough police officers, which indirectly elevates crime, said James A. Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston.
 Columbia has long suffered crime rates running two and three times the national average. The city has a new police chief, T. C. Carter, a former Marine with a confident bearing and an iron handshake. 
 Chief Carter has won the confidence of city leaders and police officers on the beat with his plans to expand the police force and heighten its presence. On his watch last year, violent crime dropped by 22 percent compared with 2007. 
 Still, Chief Carter is encountering resistance from city government on his hopes to add 189 officers over the next five years -- 87 investigators and 102 patrol officers.
 At City Hall, an imposing 19th-century granite building, Steven A. Gantt, the acting city manager, wishes he had more money to offer his police chief. But with a budget deficit of around $1 million and with revenues from building permits and business licenses shrinking, the money simply is not there to expand the force swiftly.
 ''That's going to have to be something that gets phased in over a good period of time,'' Mr. Gantt said.
 Throughout the neighborhoods of the city, this is bad news.
 ''Why can't we get a step up in patrol?'' asked Mary Myers, president of the tenant association at the Gable Oaks apartment complex in the northern part of the city, condemning what she says is a marked increase in drug dealing and gang-related violence in recent weeks. 
 ''It's going to get worse,'' Ms. Myers said. ''You've got guys who have kids, who are on the hook for child support. If selling drugs is the only way they can get the money, they're going to do it. It's quick money. Even the ones that had jobs and got laid off and can't find other jobs, if they got to sell drugs or rob somebody, they got to do what they got to do.'' 
 The southern part of town, where most of Columbia's residents live, is divided into 11 patrol districts. On a recent evening, as on most nights, a complement of seven officers patrols the whole terrain, leaving four areas uncovered.
 In the Brandon Acres-Cedar Terrace neighborhood -- some 250 homes spread over a former plantation -- the number of burglaries last year roughly quadrupled compared with years past, said Tige Watts, who leads the local community association. His home was among those broken into.
 ''They were in and out in about two minutes,'' said Mr. Watts, who rushed home from his office, alerted by a security system, only to discover that a box full of watches and jewelry was already gone. 
 ''I think the criminals have kind of gotten a sense that the area is unwatched,'' Mr. Watts said.
 In Richland County, the force has managed to expand in recent years. Still, the downturn is affecting the sheriff's department. Deputy Steven Tapler grew frustrated after being dispatched repeatedly to the same abandoned house, a foreclosure. Teenagers ordered a pizza, had it delivered to the darkened house and robbed the deliveryman. Adults used the place as a drug den. When the county contacted the Florida-based bank that owns the house to seek action, nothing happened.
 So in January, Deputy Tapler and a friend took their own power tools to the house and boarded it up with plywood. No more calls.
 ''It has solved the issue,'' Deputy Tapler said. ''You've just got to find new ways to do things.'' 
 As he cruises Columbia's streets, Sergeant Marsh -- a 17-year veteran of the force whose great-grandfather was the city fire chief -- uses a GPS unit he had to buy himself to find his way through a mazelike subdivision. His aging Impala lacks a computer. Every time he needs to check a license plate or look up a crime history, he must radio dispatch and have them do it.
 In his trunk, Sergeant Marsh carries a riot gun that dates back four decades. It fires one gas canister at a time, in contrast to the modern systems that can fire up to eight rounds at once. Some patrol officers are now doubling up in cars because of a shortage of serviceable vehicles.
 ''We're still policing as if it were the '70s,'' Sergeant Marsh said, praising the new chief for his push to modernize. ''This guy has come in here and tried to put us in the 21st century.''
 The trouble is that these early years of this new century are all about retrenchment.

HEADLINE: Nebraska's Troubled Children

 BODY:
Nebraska has failed to provide adequate counseling and mental health services for troubled children and their families. State legislators were rightly shamed and vowed to change that last year, after desperate parents used a loophole in the law to surrender three dozen children as old as 17 to the state. 
 With the loophole closed and the controversy gone from the headlines, state lawmakers may be tempted to back away from their promise to swiftly develop programs to help troubled families. That would be a tragedy for Nebraska families that are struggling with troubled children.
 Even the desperate move of making a child a ward of the state is no guarantee that the child will get needed help. Indeed, a startling case now unfolding in juvenile court in Omaha shows that Nebraska's mental health apparatus, such as it is, is hobbled by bureaucratic ineptitude. 
 Judge Christopher Kelly has held the state's Department of Health and Human Services in contempt for repeatedly ignoring court orders requiring the provision of specific services for a profoundly disturbed teenager who had been made a ward of the state.
 As portrayed in the court record, the department is an administrative quagmire where court orders are dismissed out of hand and case workers meet obstacle upon obstacle when seeking timely treatment for clients who often have profound psychological problems. 
 The Legislature needs to straighten out this mess. But lawmakers must first act on a package of bills aimed at helping families like the ones that came to wit's end last year and abandoned their children. 
 A pending bill that would create a hotline for families to call is all to the good. But it will be meaningless unless lawmakers put significant new money into community-based mental health treatment for children and counseling services for families that are having trouble coping. Another bill would add thousands of children to the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or S-chip, with the federal government paying more than 70 percent of the cost. 
 Some lawmakers will want to use the economic downturn as an excuse to backpedal on these crucial reforms. But by helping children living with their families now, the state will be able to avoid the much higher costs of institutionalization or imprisonment later on.

HEADLINE: Economic Woes Don't Keep Fans From Turning Out for Coachella

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

DATELINE: INDIO, Calif. 

 BODY:
What does it look like when the concert industry exhales in relief? Tens of thousands of illuminated cellphones, swaying in the night.
 That's what happened at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival here on Saturday, when M.I.A., the Sri Lankan-British rapper who was performing for the first time since giving birth two months ago, sang her hit ''Paper Planes.'' The festival grounds lighted up all around with hand-held fluorescence, mirroring M.I.A.'s own glow-in-the-dark outfit.
 Even as the recorded music industry contracts, the live music business continues to flourish. Coachella, in the scorching but majestically beautiful desert east of Los Angeles, is the year's first major festival and a bellwether for the all-important summer touring season. Paul Tollett, the president of Goldenvoice, the promoter behind the festival, now in its 10th year, said that despite the economy it was a success. 
 ''Anyone that has a business in 2009 is just trying to make sure that you dodge a bullet,'' he said. ''But this went beyond that. We're super happy.''
 Final attendance figures will not be available until Monday for the festival, which ran from Friday through Sunday and featured Paul McCartney, the Cure, Morrissey, Leonard Cohen, the Killers and Franz Ferdinand. But organizers said this year would probably be its third largest. (The most popular was in 2007, with Rage Against the Machine, Bjork, Red Hot Chili Peppers and attendance of 186,000.) 
 Though promoters around the country report strong early ticket sales for festivals and summer tours, the recession is causing jitters. This year Coachella, which has the most glamorous reputation of all American festivals, began selling tickets on layaway, and 18 percent of its customers took that option, Mr. Tollett said. 
 The proliferation of big festivals, like Bonnaroo near Nashville and Lollapalooza in Chicago, has not been without casualties. This year Langerado in Miami shut down, citing the economy. The Pemberton Festival in British Columbia is on hiatus after only one year, although its promoter, Live Nation, said the problem was permit delays.
 Advance ticket sales for Lollapalooza, scheduled for Aug. 7 to 9, began three weeks ago without any confirmed lineup and were strong, said Charles Attal of C3 Presents, the promoter. But he added that corporate sponsorship money -- crucial to keeping ticket prices down -- is becoming harder to secure.
 ''If any of us think our festivals are going to last forever, they're crazy,'' he said. ''If you start inching up the price and don't deliver a solid product, you're going to be in trouble.''
 Three-day passes for Lollapalooza begin at $190 and will go higher as the event approaches. (Lollapalooza organizers said this weekend that the festival would feature Jane's Addiction, Beastie Boys, Kings of Leon, Depeche Mode and more than 100 other acts. The full lineup is to be announced Tuesday.) Coachella's weekend tickets went for $269. Bonnaroo, running June 11 to 14, with Bruce Springsteen, Phish, the Beastie Boys, Nine Inch Nails and others, is $249.50, and also has a layaway plan.
 Festival promoters hope that two concert-industry truisms hold for the summer. First, that at a time when the average ticket price for a major touring act is nearly $67, fans will be attracted to the value of 100-plus acts for four or so times that amount; and second, that the lure of a blue-chip headliner will be enough to overcome customers' frugality.
 At Coachella, that strategy seemed to be working. Many fans said they were feeling the economic pinch but had made sacrifices elsewhere in their budgets specifically to attend the festival.
 Xanthe Faulkner, 26, said her job as a sommelier in Vancouver, British Columbia, allowed her to see ''how the economy drops a little more every day,'' since customers increasingly opt for cheaper wines. She and her boyfriend, Chadderton Thornton, 29, camped along the way on the three-day drive, and their tastes matched Coachella's eclecticism: by Saturday afternoon their two favorite shows had been put on by Leonard Cohen and P.O.S., an underground rapper from Minneapolis.
 Jose Dulce, 34, an unemployed technology consultant from San Diego, came to Coachella for the music and to be with friends. He carpooled and piled into a rented room with nine other people, he said.
 ''I'm definitely worried about the economy, but I still scraped up $285 to come for three days,'' Mr. Dulce said. 
 Mr. Tollett, Coachella's promoter, said ticket-buying patterns had changed, for festivals as well as for the concerts and club shows his company presents throughout Southern California. Now more patrons buy tickets closer to the event, making it harder to judge the popularity or unpopularity of a concert in advance. That can frazzle nerves as a show approaches, but as long as the fans eventually come, he said, everything is O.K.
 ''As long as we have our little time in the California desert,'' he said, ''we're fine.''

HEADLINE: As Costs Fall, Companies Push to Raise Internet Price

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Internet service providers want to end the all-you-can-eat plans and get their customers paying a la carte. 
 But they are having a hard time closing the buffet line. 
 Faced with rising consumer protest and calls from members of Congress for new regulations, Time Warner Cablebacked down last week from a plan to impose new fees on heavy users of its Road Runner Internet service.
 The debate over the price of Internet use is far from over. Critics say cable and phone companies are already charging far more than Internet providers in other countries. Some also wonder whether the new price plans are meant to prevent online video sites from cutting into the lucrative revenue from cable TV service. 
 Cable executives say the issue is not competition but cost. People who watch or download a lot of movies and TV shows use hundreds of times more Internet capacity than those who simply read e-mail and browse the Web. It is only fair, they argue, that heavy users should pay more.
 ''When you go to lunch with a friend, do you split the bill in half if he gets the steak and you have a salad?'' Landel C. Hobbs, the chief operating officer of Time Warner Cable, asked recently in a blog post defending the company's now abandoned plan.
 Still, critics say the image of Internet providers as restaurants about to go broke serving an endless line of gluttons simply does not match the financial or technological realities of the industry. 
 They point out that providers' profit margins are stable, and that investment in network equipment is generally falling.
 These plans to charge for above-average Internet use ''are unjustifiable for almost everywhere in the country except for rural America,'' Richard F. Doherty, the research director of the Envisioneering Group, a consulting firm that studies cable technology.
 Cable or telephone networks have little in common with a restaurant, the critics say, because there is no electronic equivalent of food to buy. If all Time Warner customers decided one day not to check their e-mail or download a single movie, the company's costs would be no different than on a day when every customer was glued to the screen watching one YouTube video after another.
 That is because their networks are constantly being expanded to handle ever-greater peak periods. It is the modern equivalent of how the old AT&T was said to have built the long-distance network to handle the number of calls expected on Mother's Day. 
 ''All of our economics are based on engineering for the peak hour,'' said Tony Werner, the chief technical officer of Comcast. ''Just because someone consumes more data doesn't mean they drive more cost.''
 Yet even as the providers continually upgrade their networks, the cost of the equipment needed to do so is shrinking steadily, reflecting the well-worn economics of computing.
 Indeed, the equipment needed to add capacity to any household costs a fraction of one month's Internet service bill. Comcast, the nation's largest cable provider, has told investors that doubling the Internet capacity of a neighborhood costs an average of $6.85 a home.
 The cost of providing Internet service is about to fall even more, as cable companies install new technology, called Docsis 3, that will both increase their capacity and allow them to offer much faster download speeds. 
 So far, however, companies in the United States have chosen to use Docsis 3 as an opportunity to offer far more expensive Internet plans. Comcast has introduced a new 50-megabit-per-second service at $139 a month, compared with its existing service that costs about $45 a month for 8 megabits per second. Time Warner just announced it will charge $99 for 50 megabits per second.
 By contrast, JCom, the largest cable company in Japan, sells service as fast as 160 megabits per second for $60 a month, only $5 a month more than its slower service. 
 Why so cheap? JCom faces more competition from other Internet providers than companies in the United States do. 
 Cable systems in the United States use the same technology and have roughly the same costs. Comcast told investors that the hardware to provide 50-megabits-per-second service costs less than it had been paying for the equipment for 6 megabits per second. 
 Questions about the speed, availability and affordability of Internet service in the United States will be central to the study Congress has required from the Federal Communications Commission next year. And cable and phone executives are worried that the commission may call for more regulation of Internet service, which currently is free from any government price controls. 
 Time Warner Cable abandoned its plan to expand a test of what it called ''usage-based pricing'' in four cities after Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, announced his opposition to the idea in a meeting with Glenn A. Britt, the company's chief executive.

HEADLINE: Councilman Wants to Put Distance Between Schools and Fast Food

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
Just in from the department of not-so-surprising news: a study has found that young teenagers tend to be fatter when there are fast-food restaurants within one block of their schools. 
 The report found an increased obesity rate of at least 5.2 percent among teenagers at schools where fast-food outlets were a tenth of a mile -- roughly one city block -- or less away. 
 To remedy that, Eric N. Gioia, a city councilman from Queens, wants to stop fast-food restaurants from opening so close to the city's schools. 
 ''With the proliferation of fast-food restaurants directly around schools, it's a clear and present danger to our children's health,'' said Mr. Gioia, who proposed the ban at a news conference at a school opposite a McDonald's in TriBeCa on Sunday. 
 ''A fast-food restaurant on the corner can have a terrible impact on a child's life,'' he said. ''Obesity, diabetes, hypertension -- it's a step toward a less healthy life.''
 Under Mr. Gioia's proposal, new fast-food restaurants would be prohibited within a tenth of a mile of schools; existing locations would be exempt. 
 Immediate proximity played a crucial role in obesity, according to the report, the Effect of Fast Food Restaurants on Obesity, by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and Columbia University. If a fast-food restaurant opened a quarter-mile or more from a school, obesity rates were not affected. 
 The study, which was published in February, culled data over eight years from 1,047 California high schools. It found that caloric intake could increase 30 to 100 calories a day depending on the proximity of a fast-food restaurant and that the effect was greatest for students who were Hispanic and female. 
 Pregnant women, the study said, were more likely to gain more weight if they lived within a tenth of a mile from a fast-food outlet. Some health advocates cheered Mr. Gioia's proposal, saying it was one step among many that had to be taken to fight what has been described as a national obesity epidemic. According to data released last May by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 32 percent of schoolchildren in the country were overweight or obese.
 ''I don't think we're taking this crisis seriously enough,'' said MeMe Roth, president of National Action Against Obesity, who joined Mr. Gioia at the news conference. 
 If a child has visible belly fat, Ms. Roth said, the child is probably overweight. 
 ''You should imagine them as they age,'' Ms. Roth said. ''They're going to be pricking their fingers off and on all day long, checking their blood sugar. Toes and feet will be amputated. Many of these kids go on to have blindness. That's why we need to do at least this.''
 Mr. Gioia said the ban should be accompanied by other tactics to fight childhood obesity, like easing access to food stamps, putting greenmarkets in poor neighborhoods and educating children about healthy eating. 
 He said he also looked at the neighborhoods in the city with the highest obesity rates and found 28 fast-food restaurants within a tenth of a mile of a school. In East Harlem alone, where the obesity rate is about one in three, Mr. Gioia found that 18 schools had fast-food restaurants within a tenth of a mile. 
 ''If we're not willing to move harmful substances away just one block, what are we willing to do?'' Mr. Gioia said. 
 Yet one critic, Rick Berman, the executive director of the Center for Consumer Freedom, a group supported by the food and restaurant industries, countered that the association between fast food and obesity did not prove causation. For example, he said, some states with a high density of fast-food outlets have comparably low obesity rates. 
 ''It's the exercise and energy equation that has a whole lot more to do with obesity than people eating a hamburger or salad,'' Mr. Berman said. ''And quite frankly, salads are available at fast-food restaurants.'' 
 But an author of the study, which was published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, said the report factored out most extraneous variables, and indeed showed cause and effect.
 ''We looked at restaurants that open beside a school and whether that changes the fraction of students that are overweight,'' said Janet Currie, chairwoman of the economics department at Columbia University. ''And it does.''

HEADLINE: In New Jersey, Uncertainty for Measures Offering In-State Tuition to Illegal Residents

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
Champions of a proposal to allow illegal immigrants in New Jersey to pay in-state college tuition could be forgiven for believing, after years of frustration and defeat, that their cause may finally have momentum. 
 A blue-ribbon panel convened by Gov. Jon S. Corzine to study immigration matters unanimously supported the proposal in a report issued last month, and the governor has also endorsed the idea. Meanwhile, a new, more liberal wind blows in Washington.
 But even the most hopeful immigrant advocates in New Jersey concede that these developments may not be enough to push the proposal, which is outlined in several bills, through the State Legislature, particularly during a recession and in a year in which the governor and the entire Assembly faces re-election. 
 Choosing his words carefully, Shai Goldstein, executive director of the New Jersey Immigration Policy Network, said, ''We're cautiously optimistic.'' He paused, then added: ''There's been pushback on this.'' 
 The bills, versions of which have languished for years in the Legislature, would allow an illegal immigrant who had attended a New Jersey high school for at least three years and graduated to be eligible for in-state tuition at a publicly supported college or university. (College tuitions and fees paid by out-of-state students are on average more than 90 percent higher than those for New Jersey residents, the panel said.) 
 Illegal immigrants, advocates argue, should not be penalized for their parents' actions. Also, they say, allowing students access higher education will encourage more immigrants to excel in high school, multiplying the state's intellectual capital and empowering its work force.
 ''Maintaining a well-educated work force is integral to New Jersey's economic vitality as demand for high-skilled labor begins to outpace supply,'' the immigration panel's report said. 
 Ten other states, including New York, have granted in-state tuition to illegal immigrants. Of the six states with the largest foreign-born populations, only New Jersey and Florida have not passed legislation providing the benefit. Similar measures were defeated in recent weeks in Colorado and Arkansas.
 By some estimates, according to the immigration panel's report, there are about 28,000 illegal immigrants enrolled in New Jersey's high schools. Ronald K. Chen, New Jersey's public advocate and the panel's chairman, said it was hard to calculate how many students each year might take advantage of the in-state tuition, but he said they might number in ''the very low four figures.'' 
 Marisol Conde-Hernandez, 22, is the kind of New Jersey resident the legislation is designed to help. She was born in Puebla, Mexico, and was brought to the United States by her mother when she was 18 months old. 
 Ms. Conde-Hernandez excelled in school, graduating from South Brunswick High School with a 3.5 grade-point average and a resume filled with extracurricular activities, even while she was working full time to help support her family. She enrolled at Middlesex County College and then at Rutgers University, where she is a junior majoring in sociology. 
 Since she is not a legal resident, she pays full tuition and fees at Rutgers, and works full time as a waitress to cover what she expects will total more than $20,000 for two years' worth of credits. 
 She has become politically active, joining the lobby for immigration reform and pushing for the passage of the in-state tuition bills. She decided to speak publicly, in spite of her family's illegal status, in order to help future students and ensure ''that their dreams don't get completely crushed,'' she said. 
 Immigrant advocates say Ms. Conde-Hernandez is a rare exception. When faced with few prospects for affordable higher education, they say, most illegal immigrants underperform in high school or drop out.
 Opponents say that the measures could result in illegal immigrants taking college slots from legal residents and would cost the state money that could otherwise be used to benefit citizens. 
 Christopher J. Christie, the leading Republican challenger to Governor Corzine in this year's election, called the governor's support of the measures ''astonishing.'' 
 ''We need to focus our efforts on providing tax relief for middle-class New Jerseyans,'' he said in a statement. 
 The bills' supporters acknowledge that this may not be the most opportune political climate in which to push for passage. Anti-immigrant sentiment is high, they say, particularly during a recession that has made many Americans even less tolerant about providing jobs and public education for illegal immigrants. 
 Moreover, Governor Corzine faces a tough re-election battle, and few think he will expend much political capital on the proposal. Democratic assemblymen may also shy away from the issue to help shore up support among more conservative voters.
 Indeed, some legislative offices have been swamped by e-mail messages and phone calls railing against the proposal. 
 ''It's dead; it's going nowhere,'' declared William Gheen, president of Americans for Legal Immigration, a North Carolina-based organization that opposes benefits for illegal immigrants and has been lobbying against in-state tuition measures around the country. 
 But immigrant advocates in New Jersey say they are going to press hard for passage of the bills. ''People demagogue this for ideological reasons,'' said Mr. Goldstein of the New Jersey Immigration Policy Network. ''We're talking about simple fairness.''

HEADLINE: Common Stock Offers Leeway In Bank Rescue

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama's top economic advisers have determined that they can shore up the nation's banking system without having to ask Congress for more money any time soon, according to administration officials.
 In a significant shift, White House and Treasury Department officials now say they can stretch what is left of the $700 billion financial bailout fund further than they had expected a few months ago, simply by converting the government's existing loans to the nation's 19 biggest banks into common stock.
 Converting those loans to common shares would turn the federal aid into available capital for a bank -- and give the government a large ownership stake in return. 
 While the option appears to be a quick and easy way to avoid a confrontation with Congressional leaders wary of putting more money into the banks, some critics would consider it a back door to nationalization, since the government could become the largest shareholder in several banks.
 The Treasury has already negotiated this kind of conversion with Citigroup and has said it would consider doing the same with other banks, as needed. But now the administration seems convinced that this maneuver can be used to make up for any shortfall in capital that the big banks confront in the near term.
 Each conversion of this type would force the administration to decide how to handle its considerable voting rights on a bank's board. 
 Taxpayers would also be taking on more risk, because there is no way to know what the common shares might be worth when it comes time for the government to sell them.
 Treasury officials estimate that they will have about $135 billion left after they follow through on all the loans that have already been announced. But the nation's banks are believed to need far more than that to maintain enough capital to absorb all their losses from soured mortgages and other loan defaults.
 In his budget proposal for next year, Mr. Obama included $250 billion in additional spending to prop up the financial system. Because of the way the government accounts for such spending, the budget actually indicated that Mr. Obama might ask Congress for as much as $750 billion.
 The most immediate expense will come in the next several weeks, when federal bank regulators complete ''stress tests'' on the nation's 19 biggest banks. The tests are expected to show that at least several major institutions, probably including Bank of America, need to increase their capital cushions by billions of dollars each.
 The change to common stock would not require the government to contribute any additional cash, but it could increase the capital of big banks by more than $100 billion.
 The White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, alluded to the strategy on Sunday in an interview on the ABC program ''This Week.'' Mr. Emanuel asserted that the government had enough money to shore up the 19 banks without asking for more.
 ''We believe we have those resources available in the government as the final backstop to make sure that the 19 are financially viable and effective,'' Mr. Emanuel said. ''If they need capital, we have that capacity.''
 If that calculation is correct, Mr. Obama would gain important political maneuvering room because Democratic leaders in Congress have warned that they cannot possibly muster enough votes any time soon in support of spending more money to bail out some of the same financial institutions whose aggressive lending precipitated the financial crisis.
 The administration said in January that it would alter its arrangement with Citigroup by converting up to $25 billion of preferred stock, which is like a loan, to common stock, which represents equity. 
 After the conversion, the Treasury would end up with about 36 percent of Citigroup's common shares, which come with full voting rights. That would make the government Citigroup's biggest shareholder, effectively nudging the government one step closer to nationalizing a major bank.
 Nationalization, or even just the hint of nationalization, is a politically explosive step that White House and Treasury officials have fought hard to avoid. 
 Administration officials acknowledged that they might still have to ask Congress for extra money. Beyond the 19 big banks, which are defined as those with more than $100 billion in assets, the Treasury has also injected capital into hundreds of regional and community banks and may need to provide more money before the financial crisis is over. 
 Treasury officials say they have more money left in the rescue fund than might be apparent. Officials estimate that the fund will have about $134.5 billion left after the Treasury completes its $100 billion plan to buy toxic assets from banks and after it uses $50 billion to help homeowners avoid foreclosure.
 In practice, the toxic-asset programs are not expected to start for another few months, and it could be more than a year before the Treasury uses up the entire $100 billion. Likewise, it will be at least a year before the Treasury uses up all the money budgeted for homeowners.
 But the biggest way to stretch funds could be to convert preferred shares to common stock, a strategy that the government seems prepared to use on a case-by-case basis.
 Ever since the Treasury agreed to restructure Citigroup's loans, officials have made it clear that other banks could follow suit and convert their government loans to voting shares of common stock as well.
 In the stress tests now under way, regulators are examining whether the big banks would have enough capital to withstand an economic downturn in which unemployment climbs to 10 percent and housing prices fall much further than they already have. 
 As their yardstick, regulators are expected to examine a measure of bank capital called ''tangible common equity.'' By that measure of capital, every dollar a bank converts from preferred to common shares becomes an additional dollar of capital.
 The 19 big banks have received more than $140 billion from the Treasury's financial rescue fund, and all of that has been in exchange for nonvoting preferred shares that pay an annual interest rate of about 5 percent. 
 If all the banks that are found to have a capital shortfall fill that gap by converting their shares, rather than by obtaining more cash, the Treasury could stretch its dwindling rescue fund by more than $100 billion.
 The Treasury would also become a major shareholder, and perhaps even the controlling shareholder, in some financial institutions. That could lead to increasingly difficult conflicts of interest for the government, as policy makers juggle broad economic objectives with the narrower responsibility to maximize the value of their bank shares on behalf of taxpayers.
 Those are exactly the kinds of conflicts that Treasury and Fed officials were trying to avoid when they first began injecting capital into banks last fall.

HEADLINE: SAG Members to Vote on Contract Much Like Initial Offer

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Members of the Screen Actors Guild will now have their say on a proposed new contract with the major Hollywood studios, after a majority of the union's national board voted on Sunday to accept a deal that is little changed from what the studios offered 10 months ago.
 In that time, members of the union's board have spent as much or more time fighting with one another for control of the negotiations process than in bargaining with the studios. 
 The proposed two-year contract is not retroactive to the expiration of the previous pact in June, so the actors have lost an estimated $65 million in compensation in the interim, according to the studios.
 The proposed contract, which was approved by 53 percent of the national board, with 47 percent opposing, will offer actors a 3.5 percent annual increase in minimum payments for television and film work and, for the first time, includes a structure to pay actors for their work in projects made for the Internet. 
 ''We're eager to get our members back to work and to focus on the challenges ahead, particularly on initiating a comprehensive effort to thoughtfully plan for the future,'' said David White, the interim national executive director for the union.
 Some people tracking the business of Hollywood were left unimpressed by the proposed deal.
 ''It's going to be difficult for the union to put too positive a spin on this,'' said David M. Smith, an associate professor of economics at Pepperdine University, who has followed the talks closely. ''This is basically the same contract that they were offered months ago.'' 
 If approved, the new contract will last through June 2011, putting the union in position to bargain over its next contract in combination with three other Hollywood unions -- representing directors, writers and some television performers -- whose contracts expire around the same time.
 Ratification, which requires a majority of those voting among its 120,000 members, is not assured. A group that holds a majority of the positions on the union's largest division, representing actors based in Los Angeles, has said they oppose the proposal and will work to defeat it.
 Among those urging the rejection of the contract is Alan Rosenberg, the union's president, who saw his influence undercut when the board voted earlier this year to fire its national executive director and chief negotiator, Doug Allen, who Mr. Rosenberg picked for the post in 2006.
 According to people close to the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the talks, the agreement with the national board came in meetings involving the union and some of the top executives at the major studios, including Robert A. Iger of the Walt Disney Company and Barry M. Meyer of Warner Brothers.
 The new contract, if approved, will allow the major movie studios to begin work on films they hope to get into theaters next year. While the actors union had granted exemptions to many small productions that allowed them to start projects, the larger studios did not want to begin work on big films when it looked like the union was on the verge of a strike-authorization vote.
 Television production was less affected, but mainly because most new television projects, which are now shooting pilot episodes and being evaluated by the broadcast networks for addition to next season's schedules, signed contracts with a rival union, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. 
 That, combined with the slowdown in film production and the national recession, has squeezed the actors union's finances. An analysis of the union's financial statements published last week by the SAGwatch blog reported that the union's expense had jumped 26 percent over the last three years while membership rolls had grown by only 3 percent and income from dues and agency fees rose just 5 percent.
 The Hollywood unions achieved some victories in the later rounds of negotiations at a time when organized labor remains on the defensive in many sectors of the economy, said Stephen F. Diamond, an associate professor of law at Santa Clara University. 
 In addition to negotiating wage increases of 10 percent over three years, the unions added new jurisdiction over an emerging area of content -- namely, works created for and transmitted over the Internet. ''They ought to be proud of what they did,'' Mr. Diamond said.

HEADLINE: But Can Obama Make The Trains Run on Time?

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
As they seek to jolt the economy out of recession, President Obama's Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve have set aside worries about future inflation.
 But one form of inflation -- rhetorical -- may become a short-term hazard for Republicans seeking an effective strategy to oppose Mr. Obama's activist-government agenda. As the Democratic Congress returns this week to juggle administration initiatives on energy, health care and financial regulation, the minority party faces an internal debate over striking the right tone.
 ''Rhetorically, Republicans are having a very hard time finding something that raises the consciousness of the average voter,'' said Saul Anuzis, a former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party who recently lost a bid to became national party chairman. 
 Workaday labels like ''big spender'' and ''liberal'' have lost their punch, and last fall, Senator John McCain of Arizona and Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska gained little traction during the presidential campaign by linking Mr. Obama's agenda to socialism. 
 So Mr. Anuzis has turned to provocation with a purpose. He calls the president's domestic agenda ''economic fascism.''
 ''We've so overused the word 'socialism' that it no longer has the negative connotation it had 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago,'' Mr. Anuzis said. ''Fascism -- everybody still thinks that's a bad thing.''
 Whether fellow Republicans think that is factually appropriate or strategically wise is another question.
 It's Been Tried Before
 In modern American politics, linking opponents to totalitarianism typically signals that the side making the link is losing. Yet sometimes it works.
 In his come-from-behind 1948 victory, President Harry S. Truman, a Democrat, likened a vote for the Republican challenger, Thomas E. Dewey, to a vote for fascism. Four years later, as a vice-presidential candidate trying to break the Democrats' 20-year grip on the White House, Richard M. Nixon ripped the Democratic nominee for president, Adlai E. Stevenson, as a graduate of the ''cowardly college of Communist containment.''
 Later, his onetime speechwriter Patrick J. Buchanan recalled, Nixon ''consciously kept the rhetoric cool'' -- even after the Democratic presidential challenger in 1972, George McGovern, compared him to Hitler. Ronald Reagan, a master of the temperate communication that fit the dominance of broadcast television, preferred humor to vitriol.
 But recent years have produced a boom market for harsher rhetoric, for reasons that include the polarization of the two political parties and the rising influence of cable television and the Internet. In 2004, for instance, The American Prospect magazine depicted an elephant's trunk curling around the neck of the Statue of Liberty with the headline: ''Stranglehold: The right-wing push for a one-party state.'' 
 Addressing President George W. Bush on MSNBC last year, the host Keith Olbermann declared, ''You're a fascist.'' 
 The epithet, commonly associated with Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy, gained new currency among conservatives with the publication of Jonah Goldberg's 2008 book, ''Liberal Fascism.'' This spring, an article in The American Spectator titled ''Il Duce, Redux?'' called Mr. Obama's goals, language and conception of government ''straight out of Mussolini's playbook.''
 Mr. Anuzis noted that the Fox News commentator Glenn Beck had picked up the theme, as did some participants at the antitax ''tea party'' rallies last week. Mr. Anuzis spreads the word on Facebook and Twitter.
 But that discomfits other conservatives who question its accuracy and political wisdom. 
 ''I don't think the word 'fascism' applies at all,'' said the CNBC commentator Larry Kudlow, a sharp critic of Mr. Obama's tax and spending policies. ''Barack Obama is not a dictator. He's a liberal.''
 Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster, said: ''If what you're trying to do is reach out to the middle, the more extreme the language, the less likely they are to pay attention. We sound like white noise in the background. It's like a yipping Chihuahua.'' 
 Smile When You Say It
 The sharper language partly reflects pent-up frustrations over Mr. Bush, who presided over spending increases and the government's $700 billion financial system bailout last fall. Now Republicans lament much more of the same from Mr. Obama.
 ''They're trying to figure out how to oppose a relatively popular president during an economic emergency,'' said Robert Kuttner, co-editor of The American Prospect, dismissing the fascism charge. ''That's not an easy thing to do.'' 
 The practical question for Republicans is how best to reach political independents, 60 percent of whom now approve of Mr. Obama's job performance. As his policies sink in, said William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard magazine, ''I think 'big-government-liberalism' is good enough.''
 Mr. Anuzis remains unconvinced. He notes that he does not call Mr. Obama himself a ''fascist.'' Rather, he applies the ''economic fascism'' label to government tax and regulatory policies that seek, in the words of one magazine's definition he cites, ''to achieve the utopian socialist ideal.''
 ''It's politically very incorrect only because we're not used to it,'' concluded Mr. Anuzis, who recently joined American Solutions for Winning the Future, a group led by Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker. But he acknowledged, ''You've got to be careful using the term 'economic fascism' in the right way, so it doesn't come off as extreme.''

HEADLINE: Afghan Women March, America Turns Away

BYLINE: By NADER NADERY and HASEEB HUMAYOON. 
Nader Nadery is a member of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. Haseeb Humayoon, a student at Middlebury College, has worked as a consultant to nongovernmental groups in Afghanistan.

 BODY:
LAST November, extremists on motorbikes opposed to education for women sprayed acid on a group of students from the Mirwais School for Girls in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Several young women were severely burned. Yet it did not take more than a few weeks for even the most cruelly disfigured girls to return to school. Like the crowds of women in Kabul this week who protested a new law that restricts their rights, the Mirwais students demonstrate unbending courage and resolve for progress. They don't fear much -- except that the world might abandon them. 
 That is why President Obama's Afghanistan-Pakistan policy speech last month and his administration's related white paper are worrisome: both avoided any reference to democracy in Afghanistan, while pointedly pushing democratic reforms in Pakistan. The new policy represents critical shifts -- such as a new emphasis on civilian work, and recognizing the regional nature of the problem and the inadequacy and abuse of resources. But a faltering commitment to the democratization of Afghanistan and ambiguous statements from Washington on an exit strategy have left us Afghans scratching our heads. 
 The Obama administration's bold declaration of what is to be defeated (Al Qaeda) and absence of equal zest for what is to be built (democracy) inspires a sense of deja vu. The last time the United States was seriously involved in Afghanistan, its goal was the defeat of the Soviet Union. But after that ''success,'' extremist militias greedy for power brought our society to its knees. In the absence of the rule of law and legitimate and democratic institutions, the militias' atrocities allowed the Taliban to rise to power and harbor those behind the 9/11 attacks. 
 To defeat the forces of oppression, Washington must promote and protect the ideals of democracy and human rights. It is true that Afghanistan has miles to go before it will be a real democracy. But why won't the new administration state a commitment to helping us get there? 
 First, with the economic crisis and other domestic priorities, there is a sense in Washington that helping Afghanistan democratize is either a luxury American taxpayers cannot afford or a charitable cause they can delay. This shows a misunderstanding of both what is needed to help Afghans build a real democracy and the lasting interest of the United States. 
 Second, there is a temptation among some in Washington to believe that if the zeal for democratic reform or women's and minority rights in Afghanistan were relaxed, Taliban insurgents would find ''reconciliation'' more attractive and the war would end more quickly. 
 This belief is encouraged by the radically conservative forces that have increased their influence since 2005 over the Kabul government, which has been backtracking on its commitment to rights like freedom of the press and equality under the law. This was exemplified by two events last month: the upholding of a 20-year jail sentence given to a young journalist for printing a controversial article from the Internet that was critical of the role traditionally assigned to women in Islam; and President Hamid Karzai's signing of a law affecting the country's Shiite minority that places restrictions on when a woman can leave her house and states the circumstances in which she is obliged to have sex with her husband. That law prompted the protests this week in Kabul. 
 It would seem that the escalating violence the country has suffered since 2005 would be a pretty convincing demonstration that giving up ground on democracy and human rights is not helping end this war. Rather, the Taliban has interpreted it as a sign of the weakness of the Afghan government and its international allies. The Afghan public, even as it faces an unpopular and brutal insurgency, is no longer sure if a government that is reluctant to stand up for human rights deserves support. Afghans are also aware that if their government does not honestly commit to judicial and legislative reforms, it will lose American and European public support. 
 Third, and perhaps most important, many Westerners still cling to incorrect assumptions about Afghans, which they use as excuses for abandoning democratization. One such belief is that Afghans are a ''tribal people'' who probably do not want a say in choosing their leaders. Others claim that because Afghanistan is a traditional Islamic society, any promotion of democracy and women's rights will be resented as an imposition of Western values. Another much-heard statement is that Afghans are ''fierce independent fighters'' who mercilessly defy external influence, so the United States better not get bogged down in this ''graveyard of empires.'' 
 These assumptions are wrong. In our first democratic elections, in October 2004, 11 million Afghans -- 41 percent of them women -- registered to vote. In a 2008 survey by the Asia Foundation, 76 percent of Afghans responded that democracy was the best form of government. An estimated 10 million people, one-third of the population, live in cities. Almost 65 percent of Afghans are under the age of 25. This dominant generation came of age not under the old tribal structures but in an Afghanistan whose traditional fabrics were torn apart by Soviet tanks and our long civil war. 
 As for women's rights, the troubles that brewed in Afghanistan during the 1990s -- civil war, followed by the Taliban's totalitarianism and harboring of Al Qaeda -- were in great part the result of the female half of our population being deprived of social and political participation. Like everyone else, Afghans crave security, justice, accountability, educational and employment opportunities, and a promise of a future. 
 Democracy and progress are not products to be packaged and exported to Afghanistan. Afghans have to fight for them. Last month, the two of us helped organize ''Afghanistan: Ensuring Success,'' a conference led by Zalmay Khalilzad, the Afghan-born former United States ambassador to the United Nations. Speakers included Afghans from all walks of life and there was broad agreement that, in the words of President Obama, it was time to ''pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off'' and strive for genuine democratic progress and self-reliance. 
 But as we approach Afghanistan's second democratic elections, in August, we cannot afford to have our allies falter -- through rhetoric or policy -- in supporting our nascent democratic forces. Those brave and burned young women of Kandahar did not give up. How could we?

HEADLINE: Chicago Confidential

BYLINE: By GARY GOEHL. 
Gary Goehl is writing a memoir of his career in Chicago politics.

DATELINE: Chicago 

 BODY:
 THE not guilty plea last week by Rod Blagojevich, the former Illinois governor accused of swapping state jobs for campaign contributions, brought back a flood of memories, even nostalgia. It reminded me of my days in office, when the art of buying a political position was considered all in a day's work.
 My services to the city of Chicago throughout the 1970s included exuberant participation in corrupt practices for which I pleaded guilty in 1984 and spent 18 months in federal prison. My venality may have known no bounds -- at the time of my conviction some said that I was the recipient of more illegal loans than any civic official in Chicago history -- but I was a relatively low man on the totem pole: a deputy sheriff and deputy county treasurer. As a protege of the Cook County treasurer, Ed Rosewell, however, I basically had the run of his office with the tens of millions of dollars that flowed through it. 
 If you had connections or could be useful to Rosewell, a close confidant to Mayor Richard J. Daley (the father of the current mayor, Richard M. Daley), you could count on me to, say, simply erase the taxes on your property, even going back several years. Another service I rendered to the banking community was to dump million-dollar chunks of county money in ''operating accounts'' -- the kind that paid no interest. In an era of stagflation, when interest rates were well into double digits, every million-dollar account I opened amounted to tens of thousands in annual profits for the lucky banker. As an expression of abiding gratitude, these bankers gave me cash donations for Rosewell, and basically carte blanche to write myself the interest-free loans that eventually led to my downfall. 
 One deeply appreciative steward of the public purse was a banker from suburban Chicago with strong ties to organized crime and friends in high places in the state capital, Springfield. It came as a little bit of a jolt, given my lowly station in Chicago's municipal pecking order, when he told me that he was considering having the governor name me state insurance director. That I knew nothing about the insurance industry was not a handicap in his eyes; he would effectively run the department himself. 
 When I asked him how he could get away with it, he explained that all such appointments were subject to free-market pricing, and that he had already forked over the requisite sum -- $50,000. In short order, however, my sponsor became entranced by the siren song he was using to lure me into the job. He decided to award it to himself. The announcement was followed by the Chicago news media's exposing his ties to organized crime, and he was obliged to withdraw.
 My own career flourished more anonymously for several years. On my $28,000 salary, I briefly grew as rich as a Madoff disciple, cavorted with gorgeous women in my Lake Shore Drive penthouse and enjoyed the company of mobsters on all-expense-paid visits to foreign resorts. The less savory side of all this was the retribution -- often bloody, sometimes lethal -- visited on operatives and finks less lucky than I. 
 There came a day when buddies of mine at the F.B.I. (where I had worked briefly) told me they knew pretty much everything I had been up to -- in truth, they didn't know the half of it! -- and offered to cut a deal if I would turn state's evidence against the big shots who had sponsored or condoned my crime spree. I declined the invitation, preferring silence and a stiffer sentence to the displeasure of certain gentlemen I might have had to mention in my conversations with federal investigators.
 All these years later enough of them have gone to their reward to make me a little less queasy about telling their stories. But evidently one thing hasn't changed: Political office still carries a price tag in the great state of Illinois.

HEADLINE: For Marijuana Advocates, Not-So-Secret Holiday Hints at Change

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
On Monday, somewhere in New York City, 420 people will gather for High Times magazine's annual beauty pageant, a secretly located and sold-out event that its sponsor says will ''turn the Big Apple into the Baked Apple and help us usher in a new era of marijuana freedom in America.''
 They will not be the only ones partaking: April 20 has long been an unofficial day of celebration for marijuana fans, an occasion for campus smoke-outs, concerts and cannabis festivals. But some advocates of legal marijuana say this year's ''high holiday'' carries extra significance as they sense increasing momentum toward acceptance of the drug, either as medicine or entertainment.
 ''It is the biggest moment yet,'' said Ethan Nadelmann, the founder and executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance in Washington, who cited several national polls showing growing support for legalization. ''There's a sense that the notion of legalizing marijuana is starting to cross the fringes into mainstream debate.'' 
 For Mr. Nadelmann and others like him, the signs of change are everywhere, from the nation's statehouses -- where more than a dozen legislatures have taken up measures to allow some medical use of marijuana or some easing of penalties for recreational use -- to its swimming pools, where an admission of marijuana use by the Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps was largely forgiven with a shrug. 
 Long stigmatized as political poison, the marijuana movement has found new allies in prominent politicians, including Representatives Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Ron Paul, Republican of Texas, who co-wrote a bill last year to decrease federal penalties for possession and to give medical users new protections. 
 The bill failed, but with the recession prompting bulging budget deficits, some legislators in California and Massachusetts have gone further, suggesting that the drug could be legalized and taxed, a concept that has intrigued even such ideologically opposed pundits as Glenn Beck of Fox News and Jack Cafferty of CNN. 
 ''Look, I'm a libertarian,'' Mr. Beck said on his Feb. 26 program. ''You want to legalize marijuana, you want to legalize drugs -- that's fine.''
 All of which has longtime proponents of the drug feeling oddly optimistic and even overexposed. 
 ''We've been on national cable news more in the first three months than we typically are in an entire year,'' said Bruce Mirken, the director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project, a reform group based in Washington. ''And any time you've got Glenn Beck and Barney Frank agreeing on something, it's either a sign that change is impending or that the end times are here.'' 
 Beneficiaries of the moment include Norml, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, which advocates legalization, and other groups like it. Norml says that its Web traffic and donations (sometimes in $4.20 increments) have surged, and that it will begin a television advertising campaign on Monday, which concludes with a plea, and an homage, to President Obama.
 ''Legalization,'' the advertisement says, ''yes we can!'' 
 That seems unlikely anytime soon. In a visit last week to Mexico, where drug violence has claimed thousands of lives and threatened to spill across the border, Mr. Obama said the United States must work to curb demand for drugs.
 Still, pro-marijuana groups have applauded recent remarks by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who suggested that federal law enforcement resources would not be used to pursue legitimate medical marijuana users and outlets in California and a dozen other states that allow medical use of the drug. Court battles are also percolating. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit heard arguments last Tuesday in San Francisco in a 2007 lawsuit challenging the government's official skepticism about medical uses of the drug.
 But Allen F. St. Pierre, the executive director of Norml, said he had cautioned supporters that any legal changes that might occur would probably be incremental. 
 ''The balancing act this year is trying to get our most active, most vocal supporters to be more realistic in their expectations in what the Obama administration is going to do,'' Mr. St. Pierre said. 
 For fans of the drug, perhaps the biggest indicator of changing attitudes is how widespread the observance of April 20 has become, including its use in marketing campaigns for stoner-movie openings (like last year's ''Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay'') and as a peg for marijuana-related television programming (like the G4 network's prime-time double bill Monday of ''Super High Me'' and ''Half Baked'').
 Events tied to April 20 have ''reached the tipping point in the last few years after being a completely underground phenomenon for a long time,'' said Steven Hager, the creative director and former editor of High Times. ''And I think that's symptomatic of the fact that people's perception of marijuana is reaching a tipping point.'' 
 Mr. Hager said the significance of April 20 dates to a ritual begun in the early 1970s in which a group of Northern California teenagers smoked marijuana every day at 4:20 p.m. Word of the ritual spread and expanded to a yearly event in various places. Soon, marijuana aficionados were using ''420'' as a code for smoking and using it as a sign-off on fliers for concerts where the drug would be plentiful.
 In recent years, the April 20 events have become so widespread that several colleges have urged students to just say no. At the University of Colorado, Boulder, where thousands of students regularly use the day to light up in the quad, administrators sent an e-mail message this month pleading with students not to ''participate in unlawful activity that debases the reputation of your university and degree.'' 
 A similar warning was sent to students at the University of California, Santa Cruz -- home of the Grateful Dead archives -- which banned overnight guests at residence halls leading up to April 20. 
 None of which, of course, is expected to discourage the dozens of parties -- large and small -- planned for Monday, including the top-secret crowning of Ms. High Times.
 In San Francisco, meanwhile, where a city supervisor, Ross Mirkarimi, suggested last week that the city should consider getting into the medical marijuana business as a provider, big crowds are expected to turn out at places like Hippie Hill, a drum-happy glade in Golden Gate Park. 
 A cloud of pungent smoke is also expected to be thick at concerts like one planned at the Fillmore rock club, where the outspoken pro-marijuana hip-hop group Cypress Hill is expected to take the stage at 4:20 p.m. 
 ''You can see twice the amount of smoke as you do at a regular show,'' said B-Real, a rapper in the group. ''And it's a great fragrance.''

HEADLINE: Hemisphere's Leaders Signal Fresh Start With U.S.

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago 

 BODY:
Leaders from the Western Hemisphere, inspired by a new American president, closed a two-day summit meeting proclaiming a new dawn for relations in the region, which had been marked by bitter disagreements in recent years with the United States.
 The antagonism seemed to melt away, replaced by a palpable enthusiasm for a new openness from the United States and hopes of improved relations for Washington with Venezuela and Cuba, which emerged as a core issue here. 
 The newfound togetherness was a turning point for the region, leaders here said, at a time when the ability to work together could prove critical to weathering the global economic crisis, which threatens to reverse gains the region has made in alleviating poverty in the past several years. 
 ''There was a spirit of good will that went way beyond the wildest dreams of any one of us,'' Patrick Manning, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, said Sunday.
 Some of that good will went too far for President Obama's critics in Washington, where seemingly friendly images of him with President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Mr. Obama's overtures to Cuba drew criticism from Republican lawmakers. 
 Senator John Ensign, Republican of Nevada, said on CNN that it was ''irresponsible for the president'' to be seen laughing and joking with ''one of the most anti-American leaders in the entire world,'' referring to Mr. Chavez.
 And Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, pointed to Cuba's estimated 200 political prisoners. ''Release the prisoners and we'll talk to you,'' he said of the Cuban government on Fox News Sunday, adding, ''Put up or shut up.''
 Mr. Obama defended his overtures at a news conference on Sunday, saying the handshakes and the polite conversation he shared with Mr. Chavez here were hardly ''endangering the strategic interests of the United States.''
 Wrapping up a four-day swing through Latin America, he said he believed he had paved the way for ''frank dialogue'' with countries like Venezuela and Cuba, whose relations with the United States have been badly strained.
 But he also sought to calibrate his message, saying Sunday that he had ''great differences'' with Mr. Chavez and insisting that freedom for the Cuban people would remain the guiding principle of his foreign policy.
 ''That's our lodestone, our North Star,'' Mr. Obama said. 
 Expectations had been low for the fifth Summit of the Americas, where Mr. Obama joined 33 other leaders on his first trip to Latin America and the Caribbean since taking office. The last such summit meeting, in Argentina in 2005, was marked by violent riots and anti-American rants by Mr. Chavez. 
 Leaders left here almost shell-shocked by the lack of tension at this year's gathering, with Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil's president, saying he was ''extremely surprised'' by what transpired. 
 Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada said, ''The most remarkable thing about this conference was the failure to fulfill expectations of great confrontation.''
 Despite the warm feelings, some old tensions remained. President Evo Morales of Bolivia confronted Mr. Obama during a private session on Saturday with a charge that the United States had plotted to assassinate him. Mr. Obama responded on Sunday, saying, ''I am absolutely opposed and condemn any efforts at violent overthrows of democratically elected governments.''
 And President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, an old Washington nemesis, sought to embarrass Mr. Obama in a nearly one-hour speech filled with anti-American vitriol in which he likened the American embargo of Cuba to the Berlin Wall.
 Summit meeting organizers on the island of Trinidad, which was transformed into a virtual police state for three days, tamped down Mr. Chavez's impulses to grandstand before the cameras by keeping the meetings closed-door. By the conference's end, Mr. Chavez said he was ready to send an ambassador to the United States.
 Still, Mr. Obama said Sunday that the Venezuelan leader's inflammatory rhetoric had been ''a source of concern,'' adding that ''the test for all of us is not simply words, but also deeds.''
 Mr. Obama said he was not worried about the political fallout, saying that he tries to figure out ''what's right in terms of America interests. And on this one, I think I'm right.''
 Hoping to push the process forward, leaders from Latin America and the Caribbean have volunteered to aid in a reconciliation between the United States and Cuba. ''Brazil would be able to help,'' Mr. da Silva said Sunday. In an interview published Sunday in the Spanish newspaper ABC, he said the United States should not wait for Cuba to take the next step in efforts to end their half-century of feuding.
 While Cuba did not dominate all the deliberations, it overshadowed closed-door discussions here about regional energy needs, climate change, regional drug policy and the global economic crisis. The leaders ultimately agreed to work to strengthen the Inter-American Development Bank to assist countries struggling with a lack of access to credit. 
 Mr. Manning said that the final declaration from Port of Spain did not properly reflect the current global crisis because negotiations over the document began more than a year and a half ago. 
 He denied that conflicts at the 2005 meeting, or Mr. Chavez's history of using such events to rail against the United States and others, had anything to do with keeping the leaders' discussions private. Public scrutiny ''stifles a full and free expression of views,'' Mr. Manning said, which ''could lead in some instances to posturing.''
 Mr. Chavez took the initiative Saturday, saying he was naming Roy Chaderton, Venezuela's representative to the Organization of American States, to be his new ambassador to Washington.
 Mr. Chavez had ejected the American ambassador to Venezuela in September, saying he had discovered an American-backed plot to remove him from power. Washington responded in kind. 
 The State Department said that Mr. Chavez approached Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to discuss returning ambassadors to their respective posts in Caracas and Washington. The State Department called it ''a positive development.''

HEADLINE: Staff Jobs On Campus Outpace Enrollment

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Over the last two decades, colleges and universities doubled their full-time support staff while enrollment increased only 40 percent, according to a new analysis of government data by the Center for College Affordability and Productivity, a nonprofit research center.
 During the same period, the staff of full-time instructors, or equivalent personnel, rose about 50 percent, while the number of managers increased slightly more than 50 percent. 
 The data, based on United States Department of Education filings from more than 2,782 colleges, come from 1987 to 2007, before the current recession prompted many colleges to freeze their hiring. 
 Neither the report nor outside experts on college affordability went so far as to argue that the increase in support staff was directly responsible for spiraling tuition. Most experts say that the largest driver of tuition increases has been the decline in state financing for higher education. 
 Still, the findings raise concerns about administrative bloat, and the increasing focus on the social and residential nature of college life, as opposed to academics. 
 ''On a case-by-case basis, many of these hiring decisions might be good ones, but over all, it's not a sustainable trend,'' said Pat Callan, president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education. 
 ''At a time when we're trying to do something to hold down tuition increases,'' Mr. Callan added, ''this gives us a pretty good clue where we ought to be looking. And it does raise questions about the conventional wisdom that you can't do anything to control tuition without affecting academic quality.''
 The growth in support staff included some jobs that did not exist 20 years ago, like environmental sustainability officers and a broad array of information technology workers. The support staff category includes many different jobs, like residential-life staff, admissions and recruitment officers, fund-raisers, loan counselors and all the back-office staff positions responsible for complying with the new regulations and reporting requirements college face. 
 ''A lot of it is definitely trying to keep up with the Joneses,'' said Daniel Bennett, a labor economist and the author of the center's report. ''Universities and colleges are catering more to students, trying to make college a lifestyle, not just people getting an education. There's more social programs, more athletics, more trainers, more sustainable environmental programs.'' 
 On average, public colleges have about 8 employees per 100 students, and private colleges about 9, according to the report. 
 In the 20-year period, the report found, the greatest number of jobs added, more than 630,000, were instructors -- but three-quarters of those were part-time. Converted to full-time equivalents, those resulted in a total of 939,00 teaching jobs, up from 614,000 in 1987. 
 The largest number of full-time jobs added, more than 278,000, were for support staffs, and grew to more than half a million positions in 2007, from 292,000 in 1987. Colleges also added some 65,000 management positions, almost all of them full time; all told, they had 185,000 managers in 2007, up from about 120,000 managers 20 years earlier. 
 ''Colleges have altered the composition of their work force by steadily increasing the number of managerial positions and support/service staff, while at the same time disproportionately increasing the number of part-time staff that provides instruction,'' the report said. ''Meanwhile, employee productivity relative to enrollment and degrees awarded has been relatively flat in the midst of rising compensation.''

HEADLINE: Sign Says IHOP, but Syrup Says Vermont

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: SOUTH BURLINGTON, Vt. 

 BODY:
For years, diners at the International House of Pancakes nationwide have slathered their pancakes, waffles and French toast in a variety of flavored syrups, like fluorescent strawberry and ''old-fashioned,'' the chain's artificially-flavored take on maple syrup. 
 The label ''old-fashioned'' was bound to raise red flags for many Vermonters, who will tell you it is neither old-fashioned nor maple syrup (corn syrup does not come from trees). 
 So when the land of piping-hot pancakes and fresh maple syrup became the 50th state to welcome an IHOP last month, the franchise owners sought permission to depart from the chain's standard fare. The IHOP here is the only one of about 1,400 in the United States, Canada and Mexico to serve real maple syrup. 
 ''You can't open up a Vermont pancake shop without Vermont maple syrup,'' said Sam Handy Jr., who is the restaurant's general manager and whose family owns the franchise. 
 The real stuff comes in a container on the side and costs diners an extra 99 cents. The restaurant buys it from Sugarman of Vermont, a confectionery in Hardwick, and sells about 180 containers a week. It is not yet listed on the menu, but news has spread by word of mouth. 
 ''It's important to Vermont,'' said Mr. Handy, who also wants to explore buying eggs and dairy items from Vermont farmers. ''It's a small state, and buying local is important.'' 
 Mr. Handy said he had given many IHOP trainers, who came from Arizona, California and Colorado to help open the restaurant, their first taste of real maple syrup.
 Robert MacRae, 49, moved to Vermont years ago from New Jersey, tasted its maple syrup and now will not use anything else. He gladly paid the extra charge. His dining companion, Anne Slomba, did not, then said she regretted it. 
 ''The taste is incredible,'' said Mr. MacRae, who had a side of pancakes with his omelet. ''This contributes to the Vermont economy. They're hard-working farmers trying to make ends meet.'' 
 National chains are not always well-received in Vermont, where mom-and-pop restaurants and stores flourish, but the IHOP is doing well. On a recent Saturday, the restaurant was full, with at least 12 parties waiting. 
 Marnie Fairchild, 21, Sophia Fraioli, 20, and Justin Deignan, 21, all students at the University of Vermont, dug into pancakes, hash browns and eggs. None of them knew real maple syrup was an option, and all said they would have ordered it if they had.
 ''I'm disappointed,'' Ms. Fraioli said as she looked at her pancakes, covered in ''old-fashioned.'' ''I ruined my pancakes.''

HEADLINE: Besieged Financier Emerges, Defiantly Accusing Others

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
R. Allen Stanford, the Texas financier accused of defrauding tens of thousands of bank depositors, said on Monday that he was not a thief. He denied that his operation was a Ponzi scheme and suggested that if any depositor money had been lost, it was largely a result of ''Gestapo tactics'' used by the government.
 ''I don't think there is any money missing,'' Mr. Stanford said. ''There never was a Ponzi scheme, and there never was an attempt to defraud anybody.'' 
 The government has said as much as $6 billion is missing.
 In an interview at his lawyer's office in Houston, a high-strung, emotional Mr. Stanford offered various theories about the problems that have engulfed his Stanford Financial Group and Stanford International Bank. 
 He allowed that some of the assets held by his organization on behalf of clients might have declined in value. As explanation, he cited the economic crisis and actions the government had taken against him in recent months. But in another part of the interview, Mr. Stanford suggested that if any fraud had been committed, James M. Davis, his former chief financial officer, was to blame.
 ''The investment and risk committee reported to Jim Davis, not to me,'' he said. ''The Stanford International Bank quarterly report was produced in Tupelo, Miss., under Davis's direction and signed off by him. I trusted his integrity.''
 Mr. Davis is cooperating with the government, and it seems increasingly likely he and Mr. Stanford will square off in court. 
 Through his lawyer, Mr. Davis has characterized himself publicly as little more than a dupe. ''Stanford told my client what the quarterly numbers for the firm had to be,'' said Mr. Davis's lawyer, David Finn. ''He used Davis. And if Davis didn't go along with it, he said he could easily find someone else who would.''
 Mr. Stanford replied, ''That is an absolute lie.''
 In the interview, Mr. Stanford swung between defiance and self-pity. He tapped his feet much of the time, and when he stopped tapping, his legs shook. He portrayed himself as a hard-working, honest man who loves his children and is dedicated to his former employees and investors. 
 He denied an accusation by the Securities and Exchange Commission that he had taken a $1.6 billion loan from his company without disclosing it, adding, ''the money was not going to me personally; it was going into investments.'' 
 Mr. Stanford has not been charged with a crime. In February, the S.E.C. filed a civil suit accusing him and two other executives of engaging in an international fraud, effectively shutting down the operation. Mr. Stanford has largely remained silent since then. But in one of a series of media interviews in his lawyer's office on Monday, Mr. Stanford took the gloves off. 
 Dressed in a somber blue double-breasted suit and conservative tie, he accused the S.E.C. of squandering the assets of his financial companies. He said the court-appointed receiver was a ''jerk'' whose aides, assigned to look for missing funds, ''can't find their rear end from a hole in a ground.''
 He said the credit cards in his wallet were worthless, he had been locked out of his apartment on St. Croix, his bank accounts were frozen and he did not even have money to pay his lawyer. 
 ''It's debilitating, devastating, horrific,'' he said. ''But I am going to fight for my name, and I am going to win.'' Still wearing the Stanford Eagle logo pin on his lapel, he pledged to work hard to get his investors' money back. 
 Mr. Stanford denied the allegation in the civil case that he had operated a ''massive Ponzi scheme.'' 
 In a Ponzi scheme, early investors are paid abnormally high returns with money from later investors. Ever more people are lured into the fraud until it eventually collapses.
 Mr. Stanford said that he had put his depositors' money into ''real assets backed up by real investments.'' 
 He said the S.E.C. ''took an organization that had a net value of about $3.5 to $5 billion and basically crippled it; they rendered it almost worthless.'' 
 His suspected fraud involved billions of dollars of certificates of deposit issued by Stanford International Bank, located on the island of Antigua. The instruments, paying unusually high returns, were marketed from Stanford Financial Group offices around the United States and Latin America. In recent weeks, receivers in the United States and Antigua have frozen assets, closed down Stanford operations and fired hundreds of employees. 
 Once the S.E.C. stepped in, Mr. Stanford said there was a ''ripple effect'' around the world with governments freezing assets of his various investment offices. Mr. Stanford's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, said any shortages were because ''investments have lost value because of the actions of the S.E.C. and the fall of the stock market.'' 
 In the interview, Mr. Stanford appeared to lay out a defense strategy that includes blaming Mr. Davis -- his chief financial officer and former roommate at Baylor University -- for whatever fraud might have occurred. 
 Mr. Stanford and Mr. Davis always seemed to be an odd couple, according to former employees of Stanford Financial Group. Mr. Stanford was known for his quick temper and taste for the high life, while Mr. Davis was seen as a soft-spoken religious man who started his own church in Mississippi and led prayers before business meetings.
 Now the relationship appears to be turning ugly. 
 Mr. Finn said Mr. Davis is telling federal investigators ''the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, and the truth implicates Mr. Stanford up to his eyeballs in fraud.'' 
 So far only Laura Pendergest-Holt, Stanford Financial's chief investment officer, has been charged criminally, with obstruction of justice. 
 An S.E.C. spokesman, John Nestor, said he would not comment on Mr. Stanford's assertions. ''We stand by the allegations of our complaint,'' Mr. Nestor said. 
 Mr. Stanford and Mr. Davis are accused of fabricating the performance of Stanford International Bank's investment portfolio.
 ''If bad things were happening, he never brought them to my attention,'' Mr. Stanford said of Mr. Davis. ''He did his job, and I stayed out of his hair.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 24, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the financier R. Allen Stanford of the Stanford Financial Group and his denial of federal accusations of fraud misspelled the surname of a spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has filed a civil suit against Mr. Stanford. The spokesman is John Nester, not Nestor.

HEADLINE: Up, Up and Out

BYLINE: By PAUL KANE. 
Paul Kane is a Marine veteran of Iraq and a former fellow with the International Security Program at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.

DATELINE: Silver Spring, Md. 

 BODY:
 ROBERT GATES, the secretary of defense, has proposed a budget overhaul that will go a long way toward improving our national security, but more can be done to meet his long-term goal: creating the right military for the 21st century. 
 Not since Henry Stimson's tenure from 1940 to '45 has a defense secretary been faced to the same degree with simultaneously fighting a war and carrying out far-reaching reforms. Yet there are three major changes Mr. Gates should add to his agenda, and they deserve President Obama's support. 
 First, the Air Force should be eliminated, and its personnel and equipment integrated into the Army, Navy and Marine Corps. Second, the archaic ''up or out'' military promotion system should be scrapped in favor of a plan that treats service members as real assets. Third, the United States needs a national service program for all young men and women, without any deferments, to increase the quality and size of the pool from which troops are drawn.
 At the moment, the Army, Navy and Marine Corps are at war, but the Air Force is not. This is not the fault of the Air Force: it is simply not structured to be in the fights in Iraq and Afghanistan. While Army, Marine and Navy personnel have borne the brunt of deployments, commonly serving multiple tours, the Air Force's operational tempo remains comparatively comfortable. In 2007, only about 5 percent of the troops in Iraq were airmen. 
 Yes, air power is a critical component of America's arsenal. But the Army, Navy and Marines already maintain air wings within their expeditionary units. The Air Force is increasingly a redundancy in structure and spending.
 War is no longer made up of set-piece battles between huge armies confronting each other with tanks and airplanes. As we move toward a greater emphasis on rapid-response troops, the Army has tightened its physical fitness regime and the Marine Corps has introduced a physically grueling Combat Fitness Test for all members. Yet an Air Force study last year found that more than half of airmen and women were overweight and 12 percent were obese. 
 Next, the current military personnel system is a peacetime bureaucratic construct that serves neither national security nor those who wear the uniform. Congress sets the level of manpower for each military service. Within this constraint, military planners have to decide how many riflemen, mechanics, cooks, medics, pilots and such there should be within the military's job types, known as Military Occupational Specialties. Then the Pentagon has to decide how many people will be retained in the ranks or promoted.
 The result is an ''up or out'' system that demands service members move up the ladder simply to stay in the military. Any soldier passed over for promotion twice must leave or retire. 
 Treating service members like so many widgets -- in particular, the enlisted men and women who make up 85 percent of the ranks -- is arbitrary and bad management. I have seen many fit, experienced officers and enlisted Marines arbitrarily forced out because there were only so many slots into which they could be promoted. 
 The military should develop a new accounting and personnel system that tracks the cost of developing its human capital and tallies each service member as an investment with a fixed value based on his education, training, experience and performance. This would reflect the departure of a valued service member as an asset lost, not a cost cut. Why are fit men and women who have served in combat, a human experience that a million dollars can't buy, being pushed out instead of retained for 15, 20, 30 years?
 Last, Mr. Gates should urge President Obama to confer with Congress and introduce national service at age 18 for all Americans. Under such a system, young people from all classes and backgrounds would either serve in the military or do other essential work like intelligence assessment, conservation, antipoverty projects, educational tutoring, firefighting, policing, border security, disaster relief or care for the elderly. The best qualified would be assigned to the military. 
 The 1.6 million Americans who have served in the current wars represent less than one percent of all citizens. We need to spread the risk and burden of fighting our wars. If more of our national leaders had been in uniform, or knew they might have children at risk in war, their decisions during military confrontations might be better. And this is not just about the struggle against terrorism: would New Orleans reconstruction have lagged so long if we had had a national service program in natural-disaster recovery? 
 President Obama has the political capital to make these critical changes. Given the urgency of war and money available under the economic recovery plan, now may be our best chance for decades to truly modernize America's defenses.

HEADLINE: One Struggle for a Nurses' Union Awaits the Vote on a Labor Bill

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The battle has ground on for 20 years. In 1989 and again in 1994, a clear majority of nurses at a Louisville, Ky., hospital signed cards saying they wanted a union. But each time a majority of the nurses later voted down the idea when it was put to a secret ballot. 
 Organized labor points to the fight at Norton Audubon Hospital as proof that America's labor laws need to be overhauled: judges ruled that management had prevailed by illegally intimidating and firing nurses.
 Nurses who want a union plan to try again, and they had expected a Democratic president and Congress to retool labor laws to make it easier to win. Instead, in Louisville and around the country, organized labor may be facing a major setback in the most contentious fight over labor laws since the 1940s. 
 Right now, unions seem to lack the 60 votes needed to block a Senate filibuster against the Employee Free Choice Act, the bill that would give workers the right to have their union recognized as soon as a majority signs cards calling for a union. The change would make it easy to bypass secret-ballot elections, which are traditionally harder for unions to win.
 With Congress returning Tuesday from a two-week recess during which unions deluged the airwaves with advertisements supporting the bill, labor leaders voice confidence that Congress would still enact some far-reaching legislation this year to make it easier to unionize -- and they are discussing making some modest changes in the bill to help firm up support. In recent months, corporate interests have lobbied vigorously against ''card check,'' as the bill is known, because it would most likely enable unions to add millions of members and increase labor's clout in Washington and at bargaining tables nationwide
 The battle is occurring after years in which organized labor has been on the defensive. Union membership has declined to 7.4 percent of private sector workers from 25 percent three decades ago. Labor leaders say the nation's laws have unfairly handicapped them. They say management has many advantages, including an ability to campaign against unions the whole workday, while union organizers are barred from company property. 
 Card check would be fairer, they argue, because workers could organize without the expensive, prolonged campaigns that precede secret-ballot elections in which management often presses workers to vote against the union and sometimes illegally fire pro-union workers. 
 ''The Employee Free Choice Act is critical to building an economy that works for everyone in this country again,'' said George Miller, Democrat of California, the chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee and the bill's chief sponsor in the House. ''The time has come to no longer coerce and intimidate workers who seek to have a say at work.''
 Management says the current process is fairer because workers are able to hear arguments from the union and management. Moreover, business leaders say, secret-ballot elections are more trustworthy than card check because union organizers can bully workers into signing pro-union cards. 
 ''Given the deceitful tactics unions employ when trying to get nurses to sign these cards, this is dangerous legislation that should not be enacted,'' Stephen A. Williams, president of the hospital's parent, the nonprofit corporation Norton Healthcare, wrote to the nurses in March. 
 In the Louisville fight, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that the nurses had changed their minds about the union in 1994 mainly because management conducted an often illegal campaign against unionization. 
 An N.L.R.B. judge concluded that management had committed so many serious violations of the law -- firing and demoting nurses, threatening to close the hospital if the union prevailed -- that it made the possibility of a ''free choice by the employees slight to nonexistent.''
 Ann Hurst, a pro-union nurse who the board said was illegally demoted, still remembers. ''They came after us with a vengeance,'' she said. ''They created a lot of fear about what would happen if we had a union.''
 Ms. Hurst complains that workers have to run a gantlet of threats, firings and bullying to obtain a union. She said that in 1989 such tactics caused the union to lose by 11 votes. After the 1994 effort, when Columbia/HCA owned the hospital, the N.L.R.B. found that management had violated the law in dozens of ways, including telling the nurses that if they unionized they would lose all their benefits and the hospital would be sold and their jobs would disappear.
 The N.L.R.B.'s rulings described weeks of psychological warfare. Management put television sets in the nurses' stations. ''They would show these horrible old movies showing miners' strikes and violence involving unions,'' said Betty Schmitt, a nurse who has since retired. 
 She said management put up signs reading: ''Be careful with whom you associate. You can be found guilty by association.'' Many nurses were scared to be seen talking to union supporters, she said. 
 ''It didn't feel like America,'' Ms. Schmitt said. ''It felt like Nazi Germany.''
 In 1994, the nurses voted 366 to 220 against unionizing -- a sharp reversal considering that a majority of 348 nurses had originally signed pro-union cards. Management said the nurses in the majority did not want to pay union dues or have an outside party speak for them.
 In a 1997 decision about that election, an N.L.R.B. judge ruled that management's law-breaking was ''so serious and substantial'' that he ordered the hospital to recognize and bargain with the union, the Nurses Professional Organization, since a majority had initially signed pro-union cards.
 In 2000, the N.L.R.B. in Washington upheld most of the judge's findings, but overturned his order that the hospital, which was now owned by Norton, bargain with the union.
 Linda Reece, an antiunion nurse, praised the current management. ''Norton is wonderful,'' she said. ''I have never felt so empowered. They really want feedback, and they implement what we want.'' 
 She said union supporters had tricked some nurses into signing pro-union cards by telling them the cards were merely to request information. An N.L.R.B. judge found no convincing evidence of that having happened.
 After the 2000 ruling, years of additional litigation followed over two nurses who had been fired and two who had been demoted. Ultimately Columbia/HCA paid $270,000 in back wages and Norton paid $172,000 to settle those charges. A new unionization election was scheduled for March 2008, and management again stepped up its campaign.
 Jennifer Smithers, a pro-union nurse, said a manager had tailed her around the hospital, to her home and to a City Council meeting where nurses criticized the hospital. Several pro-union nurses said that when they sat in the cafeteria, managers sat nearby to eavesdrop.
 ''It was this multimillion-dollar company versus the average working person,'' she said.
 The labor board postponed last year's election. An N.L.R.B. judge ruled that the hospital had illegally restricted Ms. Hurst from distributing union literature and threatened not to give scheduled raises if the nurses unionized.
 Jane Carmody, the hospital's interim president, defended Norton Audubon's practices, saying, ''Intimidation just isn't part of how we do business.'' 
 With the card-check bill in trouble, some Democrats and business leaders are floating a compromise proposal that calls for quick secret-ballot elections that would prevent long, contentious campaigns. 
 In recent days, Norton Audubon's management has declared victory because the union has withdrawn its request for an election. Union supporters say that with so many pro-union nurses leaving since 1994, they need to rebuild support, and that might not be easy, they say, because many nurses are frightened after seeing retaliation against some pro-union nurses.

HEADLINE: Times Wins 5 Pulitzers, for Coverage of War, Scandal, Art and the Campaign

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
The New York Times won five Pulitzer Prizes in journalism on Monday, the second-most in its history, for work on subjects as varied as America's wars in Asia, the sudden downfall of a political titan, art from ancient to modern and a history-making presidential campaign.
 The prestigious prize for public service went to The Las Vegas Sun for its exploration of a large number of construction worker deaths at some of that city's biggest building sites. 
 The St. Petersburg Times won two awards, including one in the national reporting category, for its PolitiFact project, which checks the truth of political claims. The other was won by Lane DeGregory, for feature writing. The award for PolitiFact broke new ground, in that most of the work was published on PolitiFact.com, but not in print. This was the first year that the Pulitzer committee accepted submissions of work that appeared primarily online. 
 The New York Times's five awards give it 101 since the Pulitzers were first awarded in 1917, by far the most of any news organization. Only twice has an organization won more than five in a year: in 2002, when The Times won seven, and last year, when The Washington Post won six. The Los Angeles Times won five in 2004.
 Speaking in the newsroom, Bill Keller, executive editor of The New York Times, said that while budget cuts have convinced many newspapers that they cannot pay for expensive work like investigations and overseas reporting, ''this paper has decided it can't afford not to do those things.''
 But ''prizes are not the reason we do what we do, or the measure of it,'' he added, saying that he was especially proud of The Times's coverage of the financial crisis, a finalist in the public service category that did not win a Pulitzer. In fact, no organization won for economic coverage.
 The Times won the prize for breaking news reporting, for its coverage of the rapid disintegration of Gov. Eliot Spitzer's political career when the newspaper revealed he had been a client of a prostitution ring.
 The Times's coverage of the war and political struggle in Afghanistan and Pakistan won for international reporting. And an examination by David Barstow of conflicts of interest among the military analysts who help television networks cover the wars in Asia won the Pulitzer for investigative reporting. 
 Holland Cotter of The Times won the prize for criticism, for his coverage of art that spanned continents and millennia. And Damon Winter won for feature photography, for his images of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
 The prize for breaking news photography went to Patrick Farrell of The Miami Herald for his images from Haiti of the destruction left by a hurricane.
 Several of the prizes indirectly highlighted the precarious state of American newspapers, going to papers that have adopted unorthodox printing and delivery practices. The Sun in 2005 became an insert inside The Las Vegas Review-Journal; The Detroit Free Press recently halted home delivery four days of the week and prints an abbreviated edition on those days. In January, The East Valley Tribune, in Mesa, Ariz., stopped printing three days of the week and laid off 40 percent of its staff -- including Paul Giblin, one of the reporters on its prize-winning project, and Patti Epler, the editor who guided it.
 The Free Press and The Tribune both won prizes for local reporting. The Free Press, and in particular the reporters Jim Schaefer and M. L. Elrick, were cited for uncovering the misconduct that sent Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick to jail. Ryan Gabrielson and Mr. Giblin of The Tribune won for a critical examination of a popular local sheriff.
 Bettina Boxall and Julie Cart of The Los Angeles Times won the prize for explanatory reporting, for their examination of wildfires in the West. 
 Eugene H. Robinson of The Washington Post, won for commentary; the award for editorial writing went to Mark Mahoney of The Post-Star in tiny Glens Falls, N.Y.; and Steve Breen of The San Diego Union-Tribune won in the editorial cartooning category.
 In the arts and letters, Elizabeth Strout won the fiction prize for her book, ''Olive Kitteridge.'' Lynn Nottage won the drama prize for ''Ruined.'' The poetry prize went to W. S. Merwin for ''The Shadow of Sirius.''
 Works on American history swept the nonfiction awards. Jon Meacham, editor of Newsweek, won the biography prize for ''American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House.'' The history prize went to Annette Gordon-Reed, for ''The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family.'' And Douglas A.

HEADLINE: No Job and Soon No Benefits, Race to Help Son Stay Cancer Free

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK; Brent McDonald contributed reporting.

DATELINE: HUMBLE, Tex. 

 BODY:
When Danna Walker left the second-floor conference room and returned tearily to her desk -- where someone had already deposited a packing box for her belongings -- her first thought was not of the 14 years she had worked for DHL or the loss of her $37,000-a-year salary. 
 It was of Jake. In three months, once her benefits ran out, how in the world would she provide health insurance for Jake, her mountainous, red-headed 21-year-old son, who had learned three years earlier that he had metastatic testicular cancer? 
 Since the day she was laid off in October, Ms. Walker and her husband, Russ, co-owner of a struggling feed store here on the outskirts of Houston, have mounted a largely fruitless quest to find affordable coverage for Jake's pre-existing condition. Their odyssey has become all too familiar to millions of newly uninsured Americans who suddenly find themselves one diagnosis away from medical and financial devastation. 
 The Walkers, both 46, are among nine million people who have lost employer-sponsored insurance since December 2007, according to projections by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Some have qualified for government insurance, and others have bought individual policies. But an estimated four million have joined the ranks of the uninsured, heightening the urgency in Washington to close the coverage gaps in American health care. 
 Like many others, the Walkers live on a knife's edge of risk. Without insurance to cover her high blood pressure or his diabetes, they defer doctors' visits when possible and obtain their prescriptions -- nine between the two of them -- for $4 apiece at Wal-Mart.
 But their primary concern has been finding insurance for Jake, who, after four operations, two stem cell transplants and round after grueling round of chemotherapy, has been cancer-free for a year. 
 He continues to face a significant threat of recurrence and requires regular monitoring for at least two years. His twice-a-year CT scans cost $3,000 each, and quarterly blood tests and X-rays run more than $1,000.
 Late last month, in a race against the clock, the Walkers obtained a short-term policy for Jake through Oklahoma State University, where he is a junior studying animal science on a scholarship. Doing so could be crucial to his future insurability because federal law allows insurers to deny coverage for pre-existing conditions when there has been a gap in coverage of at least 63 days.
 With a week to spare, they scraped together $335 to pay the quarterly premium by delaying a house payment and pleading with the power company for a 10-day extension. But the policy will expire on May 16, and its coverage limits will afford minimal protection against bankruptcy if the cancer returns before then.
 Now the Walkers face the possibility that Jake will no longer be seen at Houston's renowned M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, which they credit for his remission.
 ''You realize how vulnerable you really are,'' said Ms. Walker, who exhibits the maternal ferocity of a black bear. ''You just -- not give up -- but you just feel that you're at a loss, that you're at your wits' end. I ask myself, 'Do I really have to lose my home to save my son's life?' ''
 Neither of the Walkers has been able to land a job with the kind of large group coverage that would disregard Jake's health status. His cancer history effectively makes him uninsurable on the individual market. He is too old to qualify for Medicaid as a child, and it is virtually impossible in Texas to qualify as an able-bodied adult. 
 Because the Walkers own their modest house, they have been told they do not merit other government assistance. With little predictable income beyond Ms. Walker's $688 unemployment check every two weeks, the family cannot afford the state's high-risk insurance pool or continuation coverage through the federal Cobra law. 
 To date, Jake's treatment has cost nearly $2 million. Almost all of it has been paid by Cigna under a preferred-provider family policy that Ms. Walker paid $426.28 a month for through DHL, the troubled shipping company where she worked as a billing agent.
 Until last fall, Mr. Walker was the co-owner of a business that supplied DHL with trucks and drivers, but it too fell victim to downsizing. The feed store, the last in an area where suburbs are swallowing ranchland, has been losing money. 
 What has made the Walkers feel most helpless, though, is that their son has been left so exposed, after all he has endured. 
 ''Your job as a parent is to protect your children at any cost,'' Ms. Walker said. ''I really felt like I had let him down.''
 At 6-foot-2 and 285 pounds, Jacob Walker often dwarfs the prize livestock he parades in the show ring. He first noticed that his left testicle had become larger than the other as a senior in high school. He waited a few weeks to tell his parents so he would not miss the county fair, where his favorite heifer and goat both won grand-champion ribbons. By then, the cancer had spread to his abdomen, and he received a Stage 3 diagnosis.
 Over the next two years, surgeons would remove the testicle and slice off diseased sections of his abdomen and liver. The chemotherapy preceding the stem cell transplants was so toxic that it peeled his skin.
 Through it all, Jake maintained an optimistic determination. ''Life's tough,'' he would say. ''Sometimes you have to get a helmet and run with it.''
 His mother left the hospital once in 26 days during the stem cell transplants. When he started college online from his hospital bed, she read to him from his world-literature text. His father, not often given to emotion, started telling his son every day that he loved him, before going home to cry. During Jake's chemotherapy, his buddies in Future Farmers of America shaved their heads in solidarity.
 Late in 2007, Jake's doctors at Texas Children's Hospital told him that they had done all they could and gave him a 20 percent chance of surviving the next year. The Walkers were not ready to quit, and sought out Dr. Lance C. Pagliaro, a specialist at M. D. Anderson. 
 Dr. Pagliaro recommended an experimental chemotherapy regimen, and Jake has shown no sign of cancer since the treatments ended in March 2008. ''Needless to say, we're very pleased with how he's doing,'' Dr. Pagliaro said. 
 But during Jake's check-up in December, Ms. Walker told the hospital that her son would be uninsured at the end of January. She said a hospital official then told her that if she was not able to pay up front, she should take her son elsewhere. 
 Dr. Pagliaro pledged that he would do what he could to make sure that Jake would be seen. ''To deny him the relatively inexpensive follow-up that is so crucial,'' he said in an interview, ''just makes absolutely no sense.'' 
 But the doctor has yet to intercede with the business office about waiving fees, saying it would be premature. Last month, when the Walkers showed up for an appointment with Jake's oncologist, only a last-minute dispensation enabled him to be seen without payment in advance. The Walkers left with the impression they would be billed $700; the hospital says it will be $1,507. In either event, they have no way to pay it. 
 The hospital has suggested that Jake have his next tests elsewhere and send the results to Dr. Pagliaro to review, with payment to be negotiated in advance. 
 The Walkers are now completing the voluminous paperwork to apply for M. D. Anderson's charity care program for Texas residents. The hospital, which had $2.2 billion in net patient revenue last year, spent $209 million on such uncompensated care.
 But Dr. Ron Walters, the hospital's vice president for medical operations, said economic pressures had made it more difficult to assist patients who were not under active treatment. Dr. Walters said it had been ''good financial counseling'' to advise the Walkers to explore other options, and questioned whether they would qualify for charity care because they had assets. Among the criteria, he said, is whether a patient can receive comparable treatment elsewhere. 
 Dr. Walters said requests for deferred payment by uninsured patients had risen tenfold in four years. But Ms. Walker said she could not help taking the hospital's stance personally. 
 ''You feel like you've been kicked to the curb,'' she said. ''It's like, 'As long as you have insurance, we're willing to go over the moon to see you and make sure that everything is taken care of.' And the minute you don't, they don't want you.'' 
 The Walkers had not heard about the Texas Health Insurance Risk Pool, which provides coverage to 26,550 otherwise uninsurable people. Once they learned about it, they concluded they could not afford the most useful policy for Jake, a plan with a $1,000 deductible that would cost $414 a month.
 Now they are revisiting whether they might extend their P.P.O. coverage under Cobra, which allows laid-off workers to continue their insurance at full price for up to 18 months. When Ms. Walker first investigated, she learned it would cost $1,359 a month to replicate her coverage.
 The recently enacted federal stimulus package includes a 65 percent subsidy for nine months of Cobra coverage for the newly unemployed. That would reduce the Walkers' price to $476 a month, which they said they still could not afford. 
 They are now inquiring about whether they can cover only Jake. If they can find a policy for him for less than $200 a month, Ms. Walker said, she would find a way.
 ''It will happen,'' she said, ''if I have to walk up and down the street and collect tin cans.''

HEADLINE: Use Energy, Get Rich And Save the Planet

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
When the first Earth Day took place in 1970, American environmentalists had good reason to feel guilty. The nation's affluence and advanced technology seemed so obviously bad for the planet that they were featured in a famous equation developed by the ecologist Paul Ehrlich and the physicist John P. Holdren, who is now President Obama's science adviser. 
 Their equation was I=PAT, which means that environmental impact is equal to population multiplied by affluence multiplied by technology. Protecting the planet seemed to require fewer people, less wealth and simpler technology -- the same sort of social transformation and energy revolution that will be advocated at many Earth Day rallies on Wednesday. 
 But among researchers who analyze environmental data, a lot has changed since the 1970s. With the benefit of their hindsight and improved equations, I'll make a couple of predictions:
 1. There will be no green revolution in energy or anything else. No leader or law or treaty will radically change the energy sources for people and industries in the United States or other countries. No recession or depression will make a lasting change in consumers' passions to use energy, make money and buy new technology -- and that, believe it or not, is good news, because... 
 2. The richer everyone gets, the greener the planet will be in the long run. 
 I realize this second prediction seems hard to believe when you consider the carbon being dumped into the atmosphere today by Americans, and the projections for increasing emissions from India and China as they get richer. 
 Those projections make it easy to assume that affluence and technology inflict more harm on the environment. But while pollution can increase when a country starts industrializing, as people get wealthier they can afford cleaner water and air. They start using sources of energy that are less carbon-intensive -- and not just because they're worried about global warming. The process of ''decarbonization'' started long before Al Gore was born.
 The old wealth-is-bad IPAT theory may have made intuitive sense, but it didn't jibe with the data that has been analyzed since that first Earth Day. By the 1990s, researchers realized that graphs of environmental impact didn't produce a simple upward-sloping line as countries got richer. The line more often rose, flattened out and then reversed so that it sloped downward, forming the shape of a dome or an inverted U -- what's called a Kuznets curve. (See nytimes.com/tierneylab for an example.)
 In dozens of studies, researchers identified Kuznets curves for a variety of environmental problems. There are exceptions to the trend, especially in countries with inept governments and poor systems of property rights, but in general, richer is eventually greener. As incomes go up, people often focus first on cleaning up their drinking water, and then later on air pollutants like sulfur dioxide.
 As their wealth grows, people consume more energy, but they move to more efficient and cleaner sources -- from wood to coal and oil, and then to natural gas and nuclear power, progressively emitting less carbon per unit of energy. This global decarbonization trend has been proceeding at a remarkably steady rate since 1850, according to Jesse Ausubel of Rockefeller University and Paul Waggoner of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. 
 ''Once you have lots of high-rises filled with computers operating all the time, the energy delivered has to be very clean and compact,'' said Mr. Ausubel, the director of the Program for the Human Environment at Rockefeller. ''The long-term trend is toward natural gas and nuclear power, or conceivably solar power. If the energy system is left to its own devices, most of the carbon will be out of it by 2060 or 2070.''
 But what about all the carbon dioxide being spewed out today by Americans commuting to McMansions? Well, it's true that American suburbanites do emit more greenhouse gases than most other people in the world (although New Yorkers aren't much different from other affluent urbanites). 
 But the United States and other Western countries seem to be near the top of a Kuznets curve for carbon emissions and ready to start the happy downward slope. The amount of carbon emitted by the average American has remained fairly flat for the past couple of decades, and per capita carbon emissions have started declining in some countries, like France. Some researchers estimate that the turning point might come when a country's per capita income reaches $30,000, but it can vary widely, depending on what fuels are available. Meanwhile, more carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere by the expanding forests in America and other affluent countries. Deforestation follows a Kuznets curve, too. In poor countries, forests are cleared to provide fuel and farmland, but as people gain wealth and better agricultural technology, the farm fields start reverting to forestland. 
 Of course, even if rich countries' greenhouse impact declines, there will still be an increase in carbon emissions from China, India and other countries ascending the Kuznets curve. While that prospect has environmentalists lobbying for global restrictions on greenhouse gases, some economists fear that a global treaty could ultimately hurt the atmosphere by slowing economic growth, thereby lengthening the time it takes for poor countries to reach the turning point on the curve.
 But then, is there much reason to think that countries at different stages of the Kuznets curve could even agree to enforce tough restrictions? The Kyoto treaty didn't transform Europe's industries or consumers. While some American environmentalists hope that the combination of the economic crisis and a new president can start an era of energy austerity and green power, Mr. Ausubel says they're hoping against history.
 Over the past century, he says, nothing has drastically altered the long-term trends in the way Americans produce or use energy -- not the Great Depression, not the world wars, not the energy crisis of the 1970s or the grand programs to produce alternative energy.
 ''Energy systems evolve with a particular logic, gradually, and they don't suddenly morph into something different,'' Mr. Ausubel says. That doesn't make for a rousing speech on Earth Day. But in the long run, a Kuznets curve is more reliable than a revolution.

HEADLINE: Sex Ratio Seen to Vary By Latitude

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS BAKALAR

 BODY:
More boys than girls are born all over the world, but a new study has found that the closer people live to the equator, the smaller the difference becomes. No one knows why.
 The skewed sex ratio at birth has been known for more than a hundred years, and researchers have found a large variety of social, economic and biological factors that correlate with it -- war, economic stress, age, diet, selective abortion or infanticide and more. Teasing out the contribution of any single cultural or political variable has proved an almost infinitely complicated exercise.
 But latitude is a natural phenomenon, unaffected by cultural or economic factors. To look at its effect, Kristen J. Navara of the University of Georgia used the latitude of the capital city in 202 countries, as well as 10 years of data on sex ratio at birth and annual variations in day length and temperature. 
 To estimate socioeconomic status for each country, she used statistics on unemployment and gross national product. She also calculated a political instability index using an analysis of state failure and conflict published by the Fund for Peace, a research organization that combines 12 social, economic and political indicators to estimate the relative stability of the world's nations. 
 Then Dr. Navara performed a statistical analysis to figure out which variables affect sex ratio. The report appeared online April 1 in Biology Letters.
 The number of boys born was not related to socioeconomic and political factors, but there was a significant correlation between sex ratios skewed in favor of boys and latitude and the climate variables that go with it. African countries produced the lowest sex ratios -- 50.7 percent boys -- and European and Asian countries had the highest with 51.4 percent.
 The effect of latitude, Dr. Navara found, persisted across wide variations in lifestyle and socioeconomic status. There were large differences in sex ratio between tropical regions within 23 degrees of the equator and the temperate regions 23 to 50 degrees north or south, but no difference between the temperate regions and the subarctic north of 50 degrees. The population of people living south of 50 degrees was too small to be included in the analysis. 
 The correlation with latitude was unchanged even after excluding data from Asian and African countries that might have been skewed by abortion or the killing of baby girls. So sex selection by parents before or at birth does not explain the correlation.
 One expert not involved in the study questioned the validity of Dr. Navara's statistical technique. 
 ''There is no question that the vast majority of people in the tropics live in relatively poor and stressful societies,'' said Ralph Catalano, a professor of public health at the University of California, Berkeley. ''If you control for the stresses of poverty, who have you got left that the test turns on?''
 Dr. Navara defended her analysis. ''Statistical analyses involving human populations are always tricky,'' she said, ''but the analyses used here are robust and did not eliminate any variation that we would see in these populations.'' 
 There are some possible explanations, but none entirely satisfactory. It could be that there is some survival value in producing more girls in warmer regions, but it is unclear what this might be. There may be genetic or racial differences that could explain it, but the correlation persists over so many varied populations that this seems unlikely. Hamsters, mice and meadow voles also produce more male offspring during shorter days or colder weather, but the reasons in these animals are just as mysterious as they are in humans.
 No one even knows whether human sex ratios are skewed before or after conception. Could the quality of sperm at different temperatures cause the variation at the moment of conception? Or is there some event during gestation at warmer temperatures that causes more male fetuses, or fewer female, to spontaneously abort? 
 ''There's a possibility that humans might be responding to factors they were programmed to respond to a long time ago -- not cultural or socioeconomic, but climate and things like latitude,'' Dr. Navara said. ''What's interesting is that we may be seeing something that attests to our animal ancestry.''

HEADLINE: In Spain's Falling Prices, Early Fears of Deflation

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: VALENCIA, Spain 

 BODY:
Faced with plunging orders, merchants across this recession-wracked country are starting to do something that many of them have never done: cut retail prices.
 Prices dipped everywhere, from restaurants and fashion retailers to pharmacies and supermarkets in March. Hoping to increase sales, Fernando Maestre reduced prices by a third on the video intercoms his company makes for homes and apartment buildings. But that has not helped, so, along with many other Spanish employers, he is continuing to fire workers. 
 The nation's jobless rate, already a painful 15.5 percent, could soon reach 20 percent, a troubling number for a major industrialized country.
 With the combination of rising unemployment and falling prices, economists fear Spain may be in the early grip of deflation, a hallmark of both the Great Depression and Japan's lost decade of the 1990s, and a major concern since the financial crisis went global last year. 
 Deflation can result in a downward spiral that can be difficult to reverse. As unemployment rises sharply and consumers cut spending, companies cut prices. But if sales do not pick up, then revenue can decline further, forcing more cuts in workers or wages. Mr. Maestre is already contemplating additional job and wage cuts for his 250 employees.
 Nowhere is this cycle more evident than in Spain. Last month, it became the first of the 16 nations that use the euro to record a negative inflation rate. The drop, though just 0.1 percent, had not happened since the government began tracking inflation in 1961, and Spanish officials have said prices could keep dropping through the summer. 
 Some of the decline came as volatile food prices sank; the cost of fish fell 6.2 percent, and sugar was down 5.7 percent. But even prices in normally stable sectors like drugs and medical treatments fell 0.7 percent in March, and there were slight declines in footwear, clothing and prices for household electronics. 
 ''Alarm bells are going off,'' said Lorenzo Amor, president of the Association of Autonomous Workers, which represents small businesses and self-employed people. ''Economies can recover from deceleration, but it's harder to recover from a deflationary situation. This could be a catastrophe for the Spanish economy.''
 Deflation is not just a Spanish concern. Luxembourg, Portugal and Ireland have reported price drops, too. While the declines have been slight -- and prices rose modestly after factoring out food and energy prices, which can fluctuate widely -- other figures released this month suggest the risk of deflation is growing.
 In Germany, wholesale prices dropped 8 percent in March from a year ago, the steepest fall since 1987. In Japan, wholesale prices fell 2.2 percent on an annual basis. In the United States, the Consumer Price Index fell 0.1 percent in March, year over year, the first decline of its kind since 1955, though prices rose 0.2 percent excluding food and energy. 
 ''It doesn't mean it will spread here to the U.S., but we need to look closely at Spain and other places to understand the dynamic,'' says Simon Johnson, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund. ''It's like the front line of a new virus outbreak.''
 The trends have unnerved even well-established businesses. ''There is such a huge lack of confidence in the politicians, in the European Union and in the banks,'' said Arturo Virosque, 79, president of Valencia's chamber of commerce and the owner of a local logistics company. Ticking off crises going back to the Spanish Civil War in his youth, he said, ''this is different. It's like an illness.''
 After price cuts by competitors, Mr. Virosque's company reduced charges for storage and transportation, and slashed its work force to about 170, from 250. ''The worst thing is that we have to cut the young people,'' he said, because higher severance makes it too expensive to fire older workers. 
 While unemployment traditionally is higher in Spain than in much of Europe, the sharp increase has many here nervous. The jobless rate for those under 25 is at a Depression-like level of 31.8 percent, the highest among the 27 nations of the European Union.
 Before cutting prices in early 2009, Mr. Maestre ordered several rounds of job cuts at his company, Fermax, as sales of the intercoms collapsed with Spain's housing bubble.
 ''It's a question of survival for everybody,'' he said. Still, the lower prices have not translated into higher sales. Fermax's orders fell 25 percent in the first quarter. Prices for some intercom parts that he buys, like video screens, have also come down, but it is not enough to make up for the sales drought. ''Prices have to come down more and we will have to spend less,'' he said.
 The effects of this downward spiral are evident at Valencia's principal soup kitchen, in an imposing stone building constructed a century ago as an alms house. Each day, a line forms around the block by noon. The Casa de la Caridad, or House of Charity, is helping three times as many people as it did a year ago. More than 11,000 meals were served in March, and it expects to top 12,000 this month.
 As the economic decline has broadened, so has the range of people seeking help. In the past, most were out-of-work immigrants or the homeless, said the center's director, Guadalupe Ferrer. Today, ''it's more and more people like us who had a house, a respectable job, but are now unemployed.''
 The employed worry that falling prices will endanger their jobs as well. 
 Yolanda Garcia has worked as a butcher under the arches of Valencia's soaring Art Nouveau central market for a decade, but she's troubled that a drop in the price of chicken, to 5.99 euros a kilo, from 6.99, has not attracted more customers to her stall.
 ''Of course, we're worried the boss will have to reduce staff,'' said Ms. Garcia, 38, whose husband, a construction worker, was laid off two months ago.
 All this has made deflation, once a subject largely reserved for economists who studied the Great Depression, into front-page news here.
 The American economy is less vulnerable to deflation, in part because of the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates to near zero and increase lending by $2 trillion. The European Central Bank has also cut rates, though more slowly, and it has resisted the lending measures adopted by the Fed and the Bank of England to prop up spending. 
 When Spain had its own currency, the peseta, the central bank could have simply devalued it, or cut interest rates to zero. But that is not an option in the era of the euro, when monetary policy is controlled from the European Central Bank's headquarters in Frankfurt, said Santiago Carbo, a professor of economics at the University of Granada.
 ''If we enter into a deflationary period, we won't have the monetary tools to sort it out,'' Mr. Carbo said.

HEADLINE: Children In Peril

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
With so much attention focused on the banking system and arguments over bailouts, the plight of America's children in this severe economic downturn is getting short shrift.
 Official statistics are not yet readily available, but there is little doubt that poverty and family homelessness are rising, that the quality of public education in many communities is deteriorating and that legions of children are losing access to health care as their parents join the vastly expanding ranks of the unemployed.
 This is a toxic mix for children, a demoralizing convergence of factors that have long been known to impede the ability of young people to flourish. 
 ''It's actually quite frightening,'' said Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the Children's Health Fund in New York. ''We're seeing very unsettling reports of increased numbers of children in poverty. Those numbers may rise from about 12.5 million before the recession to nearly 17 million by the end of this year.''
 Dr. Redlener is a pediatrician who also is a professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. He co-founded the Children's Health Fund with the singer Paul Simon back in 1987 in response to a homeless crisis in New York City that saw families with small children wallowing tragically in squalid welfare hotels.
 Dr. Redlener and Mr. Simon raised enough money to purchase a medically equipped van that traveled the city to bring free health care to homeless kids.
 What is happening now, nationally, is overwhelming compared with the problems in New York City in the mid-1980s. ''We are seeing the emergence of what amounts to a 'recession generation,' '' said Dr. Redlener. ''This includes the children who were already living in poverty, but also millions more whose families had a reasonable chance of making it. Two years ago, they saw themselves as working class and middle class, but now many are unemployed or underemployed, and one of the results is that we're seeing growing numbers of children depending on emergency rooms for health care or going without care.''
 The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has noted that changes in food stamp enrollment closely track changes in poverty. Since the start of the recession, the number of people receiving food stamps has increased by 4.6 million, nearly 17 percent. According to the center, that's an indication of a substantial increase in poverty over the same period. And that's bad news for children.
 Similarly grim evidence is mounting with regard to homelessness. Surges in the number of families living in shelters are being reported by officials in communities across the country.
 ''This spike in homelessness,'' the center said, ''is worsening what was already a large and persistent problem. Even before the current recession, an estimated 1.6 million people, including 340,000 children, were homeless and living in emergency shelters or transitional housing over the course of a year. Many more adults and children were living on the street, in shelters for victims of domestic violence, or temporarily in the homes of friends and relations.''
 With unemployment expected to continue to rise for the foreseeable future, and with state and local governments staggering beneath the weight of budget deficits, there is no reason to believe that these problems -- and their profound negative impact on children -- will do anything but worsen.
 States from coast to coast are cutting social service programs. Arizona's child protection agency, for example, has cut back on its investigations of abuse and neglect reports. Similar cutbacks in socially beneficial and even life-saving programs for children are in the works in many states.
 Dr. Redlener described what is occurring as ''a quiet disaster.''
 The number of state-of-the-art mobile medical units operated by the Children's Health Fund has grown from one in 1987 to 37. In an effort to bring health care to some of the children most in need right now -- while at the same time drawing attention to the plight of children in general in these tough economic times -- Dr. Redlener is planning to deploy the distinctive blue vans to some of the communities hardest hit by the recession.
 The first stop will be Detroit this coming weekend. 
 ''We're going to take them to various parts of the country where there have been significant cutbacks in services,'' he said, ''and for a weekend we'll provide free health and dental care to children whose parents cannot afford to pay for care. We'll also refer every child that we see to an ongoing source of care in their community, if we can find one.''
 The goal, he said, in addition to helping as many children as possible, is to spark additional help for children from all quarters, government and private. ''Kids can't wait for the economic recovery to have their immediate needs cared for,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Programs to Help Banks Are Seen as Open to Fraud

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Treasury Department's most ambitious plans to rescue troubled banks -- partnerships between the government and private investors, backed by the Federal Reserve -- are inherently vulnerable to fraud and should not be started without stronger safeguards, a top government investigator warned in a report to be released Tuesday.
 The report also warned that the Treasury's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program has evolved into a $3 trillion effort of ''unprecedented scope, scale and complexity'' and comes with too little oversight and too little information about what companies are doing with the taxpayer money they are getting. 
 ''The American people have a right to know how their tax dollars are being used,'' wrote Neil M. Barofsky, the special inspector general assigned to monitor the bailout program, in his second report to Congress.
 Mr. Barofsky was particularly critical of the Treasury Department's refusal to demand detailed information from banks and other financial institutions about what they are doing with the money they receive.
 Noting the widespread public outrage unleashed over the Treasury's huge payments to the American International Group, the failing insurance conglomerate, Mr. Barofsky warned that Treasury officials were jeopardizing the credibility of their efforts by not requiring companies to disclose far more about their use of taxpayer money.
 ''Failure to impose this requirement with respect to the injection of yet another $30 billion into A.I.G. would not only be a failure of oversight, but could call into question the credibility of the government's efforts,'' he said. He was referring to bailout money that had been pledged, but not yet delivered, to the insurance giant.
 The inspector general was particularly pointed in his criticism of the Obama administration's plan to buy up questionable assets from banks. That plan calls for the Treasury to spend $100 billion to buy up troubled mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. 
 The plan also calls for multiplying the total volume of those asset purchases to almost $1 trillion by allowing private investors to borrow money at low interest rates from the Federal Reserve.
 Mr. Barofsky said the plan posed ''significant fraud risks,'' especially when it came to buying up securities backed by exotic mortgages made during the peak of the housing bubble, when the excesses of poorly documented loans and no-money-down loans reached their zeniths.
 The report said that the Federal Reserve intended its lending program, known as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, to finance new lending rather than to buy up existing assets. It warned that the Fed was not currently planning to examine the securities that it would finance, and would be relying instead on the evaluation by credit rating agencies that originally failed to spot the dangers of subprime mortgages.
 ''Credit ratings, cited as one of the primary credit protections in TALF as currently configured, have been proven to be of questionable value,'' the report said. ''The wholesale failure of the credit rating agencies to rate adequately such securities is at the heart of the securitization market collapse, if not the primary cause of the current credit crisis.''
 Mr. Barofsky also warned that the Treasury's plan might allow investors to double up on government subsidies for buying up troubled assets. The Public-Private Investment Program would have the Treasury invest alongside private investors. But the partnerships would also be able to borrow money from the Fed through ''nonrecourse'' loans. If the investments flopped, the investors could walk away from the loans and leave taxpayers with most of the losses.
 The Treasury and the Federal Reserve have not yet begun the asset purchase programs.
 The two agencies started up a limited version of the TALF program last month, which is mainly focused on financing consumer and small-business loans. 
 In February, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner announced the broader Public-Private Investment Program, which is aimed at buying up both mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. Part of the plan calls for marrying the public-private program with the Fed's lending program, but the program still appears to be at least a month or two away from starting.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said some of the inspector general's criticisms about buying up ''legacy assets'' -- usually troubled mortgage-backed securities -- made sense.
 ''There are a few problems with using the TALF program to buy up legacy assets,'' he said. ''First, it's rewarding the worst behavior -- buying no-doc loans.'' Second, he said, the public-private program ''is a very rich subsidy program to begin with. You have to ask whether it needs the extra enrichment of TALF, particularly when it involves the most egregious of mortgages.''
 Treasury officials had no comment on Mr. Barofsky's report. But Mr. Geithner is scheduled to discuss it on Tuesday at a hearing of a Congressional panel that oversees the financial bailout program. 
 Both the Treasury and the Fed have increased the amount of information they are making public about their various rescue plans. Treasury officials have pushed the banks to provide information about their lending volumes, and they are demanding more information about what banks are doing with their money. 
 But Treasury officials have argued that it is almost impossible to get meaningful information about how banks are using money under the troubled-asset program, in part because the money came with few conditions. Treasury officials have also noted that if the funds are allocated for one purpose, like mortgage lending, they free up other money that can be used for a very different purpose, like making acquisitions.

HEADLINE: South Korea Frees Blogger Who Angered Government

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
A blogger who criticized and angered the South Korean government but commanded a huge following online was freed from jail on Monday, after a court acquitted him of charges of maliciously spreading false information on the Internet. 
 The arrest of the blogger, Park Dae-sung, in January and his trial on charges of spreading false data in public with harmful intent, a crime punishable by as many as five years in prison, prompted debate over how much freedom of expression should be tolerated in cyberspace in this extensively wired country.
 Mr. Park, an unemployed 31-year-old who wrote about economic matters, gained an almost prophetlike status among many South Koreans after he correctly predicted the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the crash of the South Korean currency and the effects of the American subprime mortgage crisis on South Korea.
 In some of the hundreds of online commentaries he posted under his pen name, Minerva, Mr. Park wrote scathing attacks on the South Korean government's response to the global financial crisis, some of which contained factual errors. The government accused him of undermining the financial markets.
 In acquitting Mr. Park, Yoo Young-hyeon, a judge at the Seoul Central District Court, ruled Monday that there was no proof that Mr. Park ''had the intention to undermine public interest.''
 Judge Yoo said it was also difficult to believe that Mr. Park knew that some of his statements were false when he wrote them.
 In July and December, Mr. Park wrote that the government had banned financial firms and major corporations from buying dollars in an effort to arrest the fall of the South Korean currency, the won -- a statement the court said on Monday had been false but not criminal.
 Prosecutors had demanded an 18-month sentence for Mr. Park, accusing him of ''blatantly stoking fears among the people'' in an economic crisis. Quoting from his writing, they accused Mr. Park, who often used satire, of advising people to hoard daily necessities in anticipation of runaway inflation and to ''send children to orphanages.''
 Mr. Park, in a statement before the judge last Tuesday, said, ''South Korea may be the only country in the world where a man is tried because he criticized the government's foreign currency policies.''
 Prosecutors have a week to appeal the verdict.
 South Korean political parties have squabbled over Mr. Park's case. President Lee Myung-bak's governing Grand National Party has sought to regulate the country's online forums, prompting opposition parties to accuse the government of trying to silence its critics. The Democratic Party, the main opposition, on Monday called Mr. Park's trial ''an international embarrassment.''
 The government has denied wanting to suppress online freedom of expression, but it has long voiced concern about the influence of Internet rumors. Officials blamed online demagogues in part for huge protests last summer against American beef imports that paralyzed the government for weeks.
 Before his identity was exposed, Mr. Park, as Minerva, had cultivated an aura of mystery, describing himself at times as an old farmer or as a former Wall Street financial expert. After his arrest, many were surprised to learn that he was an unemployed graduate of a two-year community college who spent much of his time at home, scouring the Internet and reading mail-order books on finance.

HEADLINE: Immigration and the Unions

 BODY:
The very idea that unions would endorse legalizing illegal immigrants, as the country's two big labor federations did this month, strikes some as absurd. Americans have a hard enough time competing with cheap foreign labor. Why undercut them within our own borders? Especially with millions of citizens losing their jobs? 
 These questions deserve an answer since the bad economy will only strengthen the stiff winds of opposition that President Obama will have to fight if he is going to win the sweeping immigration overhaul he has promised. Legalization was already politically treacherous thanks to the tireless work of restrictionists who have spent years denouncing illegal immigrants as harmful to the country's health. They have long compared the undocumented to invaders and parasites; it's a very short distance from there to scabs. 
 To understand why that view is misguided, it helps to remember that the country has largely bought that argument and spent decades and billions to seal the border as tightly as possible. 
 It stages raids to pull people off assembly lines and out of their beds and cars. It has added hundreds of thousands of prison beds to hold illegal immigrants and enlisted local police officers to enforce federal laws. It has done everything it can to make illegal immigrants miserable in the hope that they will abandon their jobs, houses and citizen-children and tell everyone back home to forget about America. And how has that worked? It hasn't.
 The agricultural work force is still overwhelmingly undocumented, as are the workers doing other dirty or dangerous jobs in places like hotels, carwashes and restaurants. Soaring unemployment has hit both skilled and unskilled workers hard. But laid-off construction workers have not been lining up to plant onions or pick tomatoes, and a hidden population of 12 million undocumented immigrants has not begun a mass exodus anywhere. 
 Nor have the forces of global economic migration magically adjusted to fit the American mood. Thousands of workers still cross the border, although the numbers are down -- a sign of the downturn, particularly in home building. When the economy recovers, the flow will revive. (Economic forces are dynamic, even if our immigration policies are not.)
 The unions, at least, understand that there is a better way. They see immigration reform as an issue of worker empowerment. If undocumented immigrants undercut wages and job conditions for Americans -- and many do, by tolerating low pay and abuse and bolstering an off-the-books system that robs law-abiding employers and taxpayers -- it is because they cannot stand up for their rights. 
 ''Workers don't depress wages. Unscrupulous employers do,'' said Terence O'Sullivan, president of the Laborers' International Union of North America. Unemployment in his industry is above 21 percent. Nearly two million construction workers are out of work. So what does Mr. O'Sullivan want? Reform that allows immigrants to legalize. ''If we can free them so they can come out of the shadows, we can not only improve their lives, but all workers' lives,'' he said. 
 Eliseo Medina, the international executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, agreed. ''First and foremost, this is an economic argument,'' he said. 
 Making the pro-union case for reform is not necessarily going to be easy. Even as immigration has changed the face of many American unions, hostility to foreigners remains a problem among some of the rank and file. Mr. Medina said union leaders were going to have to work hard to make members understand that false populism was not on their side.
 ''You may not want to do this because you like Jose Rodriguez,'' Mr. Medina said, ''but this affects you. Your standard of living is not going to improve, and you're not going to be in a stronger position to solve your problems as long as you have all of these people out there without any rights -- without any ability to contribute. Things will only get worse, not better.''

HEADLINE: Deal to Privatize Chicago Airport Fails

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
A plan to privatize Midway Airport has collapsed, city officials said Monday.
 The agreement fell apart because private investors could not raise the necessary money, said Gene Saffold, Chicago's chief financial officer. 
 Midway would have been the first airport to go private under a Federal Aviation Administration pilot program.
 Mr. Saffold said that he believed a plan to lease Midway to private investors could be resurrected in the future but that it would probably have to wait until capital markets fully recovered. He said other cities should not be dissuaded, calling the collapse of the Midway plan ''a little speed bump.''
 But some analysts said the deal's failure was a huge blow to privatization advocates.
 ''Midway appeared to be almost ideal for Wall Street,'' said Joseph Schwieterman, a transportation and economics professor at DePaul University.
 Mr. Schwieterman noted that Mayor Richard M. Daley had staunchly supported the deal and that Midway had tended to weather economic downturns better than most other airports.

HEADLINE: China's Influence Grows Along With Its Car Sales

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
After a century in which American tastes largely set the course of the global automotive market, China is poised to increasingly take on the role of global trendsetter. 
 Automakers say just as car buyers around the world saw more sport utility vehicles and cup holders because that was what Americans wanted, they will probably see more features that the Chinese favor, from greater fuel efficiency to more comfortable back seats.
 Vehicle sales in China passed those in the United States in the first quarter, as China has weathered the global downturn much better than other major economies. And there are growing signs that China will become the leading automotive market in the long term. 
 ''The center of gravity is moving eastward,'' Dieter Zetsche, the chairman of Daimler, said at the opening day of the Shanghai auto show Monday. ''This has, if anything, only accelerated through the crisis.''
 China's emphasis on fuel efficiency is partly a reflection of frugality: income per person in China is still one-sixteenth of American levels. But it is mainly a result of the Chinese government's strong determination to reduce dependence on imported oil.
 Late last year, the government cut to 1 percent its tax on ''family vehicles'' with fuel-sipping engines no larger than 1.6 liters, while raising the tax to as much as 40 percent on cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles with larger engines.
 Sales of cars with smaller engines have surged in response, while sales of beefier models have grown more slowly and in some cases actually fallen. Multinational automakers are responding by transferring their latest fuel-efficiency technology to China, so as to shrink their engines to 1.6 liters or less while providing the best possible performance.
 John Parker, executive vice president for Asia, the Pacific and Africa at Ford Motor, said that the carmaker would transfer its ''Eco-boost'' engine efficiency technology, including turbocharging and very precise fuel injection, to its Chinese joint venture. Ford is also reconsidering its future vehicle development plans after having concluded that the Chinese government would keep insisting on greater fuel efficiency. 
 ''My overall belief is the trend is for keeps,'' he said.
 General Motors is also trying to expand sales of fuel-efficient models worldwide with a special emphasis on China. It has a 34 percent stake in a Chinese joint venture, Wuling, that already produces small, lightweight minivans that get 43 miles a gallon in city driving, although they do not meet American safety and environmental standards.
 G.M. wants to increase its stake in the company by buying at least part of the nearly 16 percent held by the municipal government of Liuzhou, the city in southernmost China where Wuling is based, Nick Reilly, the president of G.M.'s Asian and Pacific operations, said in an interview on Monday afternoon.
 Mr. Reilly said he wanted the Wuling venture to start exporting, although probably not to the United States. 
 Mr. Reilly's remarks represent the first time a G.M. executive has publicly voiced an interest in an overseas acquisition since the company ran into severe financial difficulties last year and had to seek billions of dollars in help from the United States government. While an automaker is being kept in business by federal loans, any of its acquisitions in China could prove controversial in Washington. 
 Beyond stressing fuel efficiency, the Chinese government is emphasizing alternative-fuel vehicles, particularly electric cars with rechargeable batteries. Senior Beijing officials want the country to become a leader in such technology, and Western auto executives give China a strong chance of success.
 ''There's no question that the government and the companies here are spending huge amounts in this area, so there's no doubt they are going to be important players,'' Mr. Reilly said. ''If you look at where batteries are making the fastest progress, it's China, it's Korea, it's where the government is heavily behind it.''
 Andy Palmer, Nissan's senior vice president for vehicle planning, said that Nissan started an electric car experiment this month in Wuhan, China, mainly because China wanted it. ''We didn't approach them, they approached us,'' Mr. Palmer said.
 Automakers have long built vehicles to suit American preferences and then marketed the same models around the world after recouping the development costs in the United States market. Manufacturers sharply increased their development and production of sport utility vehicles and minivans in the 1980s, for example, in large part because those vehicles were subject to less stringent fuel economy regulations in the United States; the automakers then marketed the same models around the globe.
 In addition to better fuel economy, the rapidly rising importance of the Chinese market will probably result in much more comfortable rear seats in cars around the world. That is because even the owners of compact cars in China frequently hire full-time chauffeurs, who cost as little as $440 a month and allow the owner to read or make phone calls in the back seat while in traffic jams.

HEADLINE: Obama Tells His Cabinet To Look for Efficiency

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When is $100 million small change? 
 When you are President Obama and you propose trimming that amount from your $3.6 trillion federal budget. 
 On the theory that every little bit helps, Mr. Obama convened the first cabinet meeting of his presidency on Monday and said that in an effort to make the government ''as efficient as possible'' and to ensure that ''every taxpayer dollar is being spent wisely,'' he was challenging department heads and agency chiefs to come up with ways to save $100 million over the next 90 days. 
 Budget analysts promptly burst out laughing. A reporter declared at the White House briefing that the initiative would become fodder for late-night talk show hosts. The Republican Study Committee, a group of fiscal conservatives, put out a news release with the headline ''Obama's 0.0025% spending cut.'' 
 The White House was quickly thrust into explaining mode. ''This is a symbol of a new attitude and a new perspective,'' Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, said in an interview, insisting that Americans would appreciate the effort. 
 Mr. Emanuel pointed out that the president's budget proposes to cut $2 trillion over 10 years, and that Mr. Obama was proposing to save as much as $50 billion through more efficient military procurement. 
 Of the $100 million, he said, ''If that's all I did -- legitimate criticism. But it's part of an entire process of going through the budget line by line.''
 Yet in the city where former Senator Everett M. Dirksen is supposed to have said, ''A billion here, a billion there, pretty soon you're talking real money,'' $100 million does not seem like very much these days. After all, Mr. Obama has just signed a $787 billion economic stimulus bill into law. The federal deficit is projected to hit $1.8 trillion this year. 
 ''He enacts a $1 trillion stimulus and then calls for $100 million in cuts?'' said Brian Riedl, a budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy organization. Mr. Obama's proposal, Mr. Riedl said, was tantamount to asking a family that spends $40,000 a year to cut $1 out of its budget.
 The White House put out a list of money-saving areas it has already identified. The Agriculture Department is proposing to save $16 million a year by working with the Treasury Department to root out fraud in the farm subsidy program. The Education Department is increasing the ratio of employees to computer printers and plans to save $2 million by eliminating desktop computers for employees who have laptops.
 The Department of Homeland Security estimates that it can save up to $52 million over five years by buying office supplies in bulk. The Justice Department believes it can save $6.7 million by publishing judicial forfeiture notices on the Internet, as opposed to in newspapers. 
 Mr. Obama said he recognized that ''none of these things alone are going to make a difference.'' But, he insisted, they would add up.
 ''$100 million there, $100 million here,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Pretty soon, even in Washington, it adds up to real money.''

HEADLINE: E.U. Threat to Banks Lacks Teeth

BYLINE: By PAUL TAYLOR. 
Paul Taylor is a Reuters columnist.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
The European Union's antitrust czar, Neelie Kroes, is struggling to stop governments from bending E.U. rules on state aid to business when they rescue banks with taxpayers' money.
 But Ms. Kroes's threat to force some banks to the wall unless they offer viable restructuring plans within six months of receiving state cash may have been both economically unwise and politically inept.
 It could fuel political pressure to suspend the rules and weaken the European Commission's crucial watchdog powers. 
 E.U. regulators in charge of policing state aid have given fast-track approval to more than 50 rescue plans since last October, when the full force of the financial crisis hit Europe after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the United States.
 Ms. Kroes told Reuters in an interview April 7 that time was running out for some banks to propose restructuring plans, which in most cases would mean slimming down and selling off assets to avoid distortions in competition.
 ''Brussels will not rubber-stamp such schemes and may even let banks go bankrupt if those plans do not satisfy the commission,'' Ms. Kroes said.
 She is very unlikely to make good on her threat because of the depth of the crisis and because of fierce political pressure from big member states to go easy on the banks.
 The commission might do better to give banks and governments more time to get over the worst of the crisis before restructuring or repaying aid, rather than making banks sell assets now at fire sale prices that would cause bigger losses for taxpayers.
 Ms. Kroes implicitly acknowledged as much Wednesday, when she approved a request from Britain to extend recapitalization and credit guarantees for its banking sector that were approved last October.
 A statement from the commission said ''the circumstances on the financial markets justify the extension, which aims at underpinning lending to the U.K. real economy.''
 The E.U. watchdog has bared its teeth at some other state rescues resulting from the crisis. Ms. Kroes has had a tug of war with Berlin over the conditions for a bailout of Commerzbank, one of the largest banks in Germany, and two regional lenders, WestLB and BayernLB.
 The commission is demanding that Commerzbank spin off mortgage lending in return for a government bailout of 18 billion euros, or $24.4 billion. It is also insisting on deadlines for the sale of all or parts of WestLB in return for the rescue last year, and pressing BayernLB to sell foreign units.
 Peer Steinbruck, the German finance minister, has charged that E.U. foot-dragging is undermining confidence in a systemically critical part of the financial sector.
 Ms. Kroes may have issued her warning to resist such pressure and concentrate minds in E.U. member states on the need for an exit strategy from bankrolling banks. Commission figures show that E.U. governments have provided 3 trillion euros in guarantees, risk shields and recapitalization since the crisis began.
 But it makes no sense for the E.U. executive to force the break up of banks in the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression. It would force banks to take further losses by disposing of assets at a time when there was no market for them.
 The commission's authority over state aid is not comparable with its direct power to veto mergers. It can order governments to recover aid deemed illegal and haul them before the European Court of Justice if they fail to comply, but that process often takes years.
 If pressed by Ms. Kroes, governments would probably tough it out and hope that by the time the commission acted, the market would have recovered sufficiently for the banks to repay them -- or for the state to sell on shares it has purchased.
 Politically, it would be dangerous for the commission to start down that road against any of the big E.U. states, especially at a time when the commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, is seeking reappointment this year. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France may be the most outspoken in his criticism of E.U. competition ''dogma,'' but many other governments have been irritated by the commission's forcing them to change national rescue measures.
 Many of the bank rescues were approved under an E.U. treaty article that allowed state aid ''to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State.''
 That emergency situation is unlikely to end in the near future.
 If Ms. Kroes did decide to make an example of a bank, the risk would be that member states could reach for the nuclear option and seek to suspend the state aid regulations in the financial sector or use their power to override a commission decision unanimously.
 So if the commission overplays its hand, it risks seeing its key economic powers emasculated.

HEADLINE: Iranian Calls Israel Racist At Meeting In Geneva

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Nick Cumming-Bruce contributed reporting from Geneva, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem.

 BODY:
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran on Monday used the platform of a United Nations conference in Geneva on combating racism to disparage Israel as a ''cruel and repressive racist regime,'' prompting delegates from European nations to desert the hall and earning a rare harsh rebuke from Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.
 As Mr. Ahmadinejad began to speak, two protesters wearing rainbow-hued clown wigs -- their statement on the tenor of the proceedings -- pelted him with red foam noses. Hustled out the door by security agents, they were soon followed by lines of stony-faced diplomats from the 23 European nations attending the conference. They walked out to the sound of some other delegates applauding Mr. Ahmadinejad. 
 The United States and more than a half-dozen other nations had already boycotted the gathering out of concern that it would focus on maligning Israel rather than on the global problems of discrimination, replaying the disputes that marked the first United Nations conference on combating racism in Durban, South Africa, in 2001. 
 Years of negotiations intended to avoid just such a scenario failed, underscoring the uneasy gap that exists between the rest of the world and the West when it comes to certain issues, like whether Israel's treatment of the Palestinians under occupation belongs at a forum on discrimination and xenophobia. 
 The speech and the reaction are also likely to complicate but not necessarily derail recent attempts between the West and Iran to forge new negotiations over the Islamic Republic's nuclear development program. 
 Member states, who wrangled for months over the draft document for the Geneva conference, had ultimately removed controversial statements about Israel; about what constitutes defamation of religion, a position pushed by Muslim states; and about compensation for slavery.
 But a reference in the draft document that endorsed the communique that emerged from the contentious Durban meeting -- where the United States and Israel walked out -- set off the boycott. Besides the United States, the countries staying away included Germany, Italy, Poland, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Australia. Canada and Israel announced months ago that they would not attend. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad, who seems to take visible delight in his diatribes against Israel and denying events like the Holocaust because it so irks Iran's opponents, brought the contention roaring back to the fore. He was the only head of state to attend. 
 ''Following World War II they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of Jewish suffering,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said, grinning as he spoke, his remarks coincidentally falling on the day that Jewish communities mark the Holocaust. ''And they sent migrants from Europe, the United States and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in occupied Palestine.''
 Portraying Israel as a regional boogeyman has been a cornerstone of Iran's 1979 revolution, although Mr. Ahmadinejad, facing a presidential election in June, is often criticized at home for spending too much time on Palestinian issues and not enough fixing the economic woes of Iranians.
 The speech prompted the normally mild-mannered Mr. Ban and other top United Nations officials to voice uncommon criticism of the leader of a member state. ''I have not experienced this kind of destructive proceedings in an assembly, in a conference, by any one member state,'' Mr. Ban said.
 ''I deplore the use of this platform by the Iranian president to accuse, divide and even incite,'' he said, urging members to ''turn away from such a message in both form and substance.''
 Mr. Ban also criticized members of nongovernmental organizations for heckling Mr. Ahmadinejad. 
 Navi Pillay, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, criticized Mr. Ahmadinejad for ''grandstanding'' from a United Nations dais and said his performance should not be an excuse to derail the important topic of the conference. 
 She also made a not-so-subtle dig at Iran's treatment of its own minorities, after noting that the president's remarks were outside the scope of the conference. ''This is what I would have expected the president of Iran to come and tell us: how he is addressing racial discrimination and intolerance in his country,'' Ms. Pillay said.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's speech prompted a chorus of condemnation. Israel recalled its ambassador to Switzerland to protest both the conference and meeting Sunday between the Swiss president, Hans-Rudolf Merz, and Mr. Ahmadinejad. 
 At the United Nations, Ambassador Alejandro D. Wolff, the deputy permanent representative for the United States, said the Iranians deserved better. 
 ''It shows disregard for the organization to which he is speaking -- the United Nations -- and does a grave injustice to the Iranian nation and the Iranian people,'' he said, suggesting that Iranian leaders show ''much more measured, moderate, honest and constructive rhetoric when dealing with issues in the region.'' 
 Not everyone at the conference was critical of the speech, which also wandered through topics like the economic collapse and Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 ''If we actually believe in freedom of expression, then he has the right to say what he wants to say,'' the Pakistani ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Zamir Akram, told The Associated Press. ''There were things in there that a lot of people in the Muslim world would be in agreement with, for example the situation in Palestine, in Iraq and in Afghanistan, even if they don't agree with the way he said it.''
 Those who supported the Obama administration's attending the conference said their attitude was not altered by Mr. Ahmadinejad's remarks. ''It is unfortunate that the inappropriate and out-of-line remarks of Ahmadinejad would obscure the only international forum to address racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia,'' Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, said in a statement by the Congressional Black Caucus. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 22, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about a speech that disparaged Israel, made by the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, at a United Nations conference on racism in Geneva, quoted incorrectly in some editions from his comment about the creation of Israel. He said, ''Following World War II they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of Jewish suffering.'' He did not say ''under the pretext of Nazi suffering.''

HEADLINE: When Builders Build Bad Loans

 BODY:
Even as the Obama administration struggles to find ways to help homeowners who are drowning in bad debt, more needs to be done to keep them out of the water in the first place. 
 A promising bill in the California Legislature would try to do that by going after a particularly troublesome practice of corporate home builders. It would prohibit them from doubling as lenders, issuing mortgages on the homes they build. 
 The bill's sponsor, Assemblyman V. Manuel Perez, says the problem is that many consumers who bought homes from corporate builders ended up caught in a closed loop: forced by hard-sell tactics and deception to use the builders' in-house mortgage and title companies. 
 The industry promotes the practice as a one-stop-shopping convenience that saves time and money. Too many homeowners found it did neither. They were pressured into buying overpriced homes with interest-only loans that they didn't understand and couldn't handle. When the bubble burst in Southern California, that was it for their dreams and homes.
 Homeowner advocates say that the system is rigged against the consumer, riddled with inherent conflicts of interest. What in-house appraiser is going to scrupulously and honestly assess a home's value, especially if the market begins to tank? If a lender is connected to a home builder, it is going to try to find any way possible to make that loan, since making that loan means selling that house. 
 That sign-'em-up-at-all-costs impulse, advocates say, is how patently unqualified buyers in the sprawled-out Inland Empire and Coachella Valley were pushed into exotic and risky forms of lending. Those included interest-only loans that were affordable for a few years, but then exploded with single balloon payments of tens of thousands of dollars. By then, the house and loan had been sold, and the builders had moved on to other suckers.

HEADLINE: In MTV Style, Mayor Urges New Yorkers to Get Out There and Volunteer

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
Heeding President Obama's call for boosting Americans' engagement in civic service, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced on Monday a sweeping plan to encourage volunteerism among city residents.
 The announcement came on the eve of Mr. Obama's signing of the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act,which over five years will more than triple the size of AmeriCorps, the nation's civilian service force. The legislation would mobilize volunteers to undertake some of the country's most urgent social challenges, like shoring up communities hard-hit by the recession.
 Mr. Bloomberg's announcement had all the elements of a well-rehearsed pep rally: boisterous cheers, colorful signs and an animated crowd of volunteers young and old. When the mayor asked how they felt, they answered, ''Fired up!'' 
 He had an unlikely sidekick in Sway Calloway, a reporter for MTV News, which broadcast the event live on the Web.
 ''I want this to be a rally, a celebration of how special we are and how exceptional we can become,'' the mayor said from a stage set up at the Armory Track and Field Foundation's arena in Washington Heights.
 The event was broadcast on four big screens above the stage. At one point, they showed a photo montage of Mr. Bloomberg dressed as Uncle Sam over the words, ''I want you for NYC Service,'' the name of the plan 
 The idea, Mr. Bloomberg said, is to capitalize on a local history of activism and volunteerism and channel New Yorkers' goodwill into worthy causes that could have a palpable effect. One element of the mayor's plan is to create an NYC Civic Corps to shepherd volunteers into public agencies and nonprofit groups. Other elements will seek to provide free legal services and financial counseling to families who are facing foreclosure or otherwise need help managing debts.
 There are smaller, yet significant, programs, like enlisting landlords and tenants to paint the roofs of their buildings white to reduce energy consumption.
 Some in the audience issued their own pledges. Rupa Mehta, a fitness instructor, pledged to help revive a recreational center in Harlem so that residents could have another place to exercise. Amreen Vora, a student at Barnard College, committed herself to continue tutoring high school juniors in East Harlem. Ana Maria Gonzalez, a fourth grader at Public School 132 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, vowed to plant trees to help reduce the effects of global warming.
 The plan will require every school to incorporate the notions of service and volunteerism into its curriculum this fall. 
 ''I believe strongly that one person can make a difference,'' Representative Carolyn McCarthy, the main sponsor of the House version of the service bill, which Mr. Obama is scheduled to sign on Tuesday, told the crowd. ''And when you take everybody here, what a difference we can make in the country.''
 In the months since Mr. Obama's inauguration, Bloomberg administration officials have met with hundreds of organizations; held focus groups with volunteers in schools and for environmental and public health causes; and consulted corporations that have large volunteerism programs. The goal was to understand the challenges they faced and identify how the city could make it easier for them to serve.
 One of the conclusions, drawn from a survey, was that 17 percent of New Yorkers who do not volunteer said they did not do so because they did not know where to go. For that reason, the city will make volunteering opportunities available through 311. 
 ''Creative, resilient, opinionated'' are adjectives commonly used to describe New Yorkers, he added. ''We want civic-minded to be at the top of that list.''
