HEADLINE: Albany Cancellation Hits Quebec Power Project

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, March 28

 BODY:
New York State's cancellation of a $12 billion, 20-year contract to buy power from Quebec has struck perhaps a fatal blow to one of the biggest and most controversial efforts to exploit the Canadian province's vast water resources for energy.
The provincially owned Hydro-Quebec utility insisted today that its northern expansion project in the Cree Indian country to the east of Hudson Bay will still go forward. But the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars anticipated from Albany annually will almost certainly strain the giant utility's finances as well as bring a damaging reduction in its credit rating. 
 In turn, this could raise the cost of borrowing money to such an extent that the project, which has been under fire from the Cree and environmentalists, would no longer be feasible, or profitable, several analysts said.
"I believe this will make it extremely difficult for them to borrow any additional amounts of capital beyond what they have outstanding," said Robert Blohm, a Montreal investment banker.
The utility, moreover, has counted on export revenue to keep domestic prices for energy low. New York's decision on Friday may thus mean higher electricity charges within Quebec, which could create a political storm.
Hydro-Quebec still needs to market some $9.5 billion of bonds to finance the massive Great Whale project. The cancellation, in effect, has made such bonds far more difficult to sell. The utility's long-term debt stands at $25.6 billion, of which nearly $9 billion is payable in United States dollars. The magnitude of its debt was described recently by William Streeter, vice president of Moody's Investors Service, an agency that evaluates bonds for investors, as "unprecedented."
On the drawing boards for at least 10 years, the Great Whale development -- in the area of the Grande Baleine or Great Whale River, which empties into Hudson Bay 750 miles north of Montreal -- entails building dikes and dams, roads and airports, diverting four rivers and flooding an area a little larger than Rhode Island, where up to 10,000 Cree Indians and 5,000 Eskimos live.
The utility's lobbyists had said that it could carry out the construction work while both preserving the environment and raising living standards of the native peoples.
But lobbysts for the Cree and the environmentalists contended that the project would take a devastating toll on an area that is the ecological heart of northern Quebec and have unfortunate consequences on the native people, for example, by raising mercury levels in the fish they catch.
In taking their action on Friday, New York officials cited only economic factors, the utility's refusal to cut prices another 30 percent on the future hydropower it would be selling the state.
The New York Power Authority and Hydro-Quebec, whose generally cheap electricity in earlier years powered Quebec's postwar industrial expansion, had been discussing the contract for the past three years.
The utility put a brave face on what most outside observers called a major setback. Pierre Bolduc, Hydro-Quebec's executive vice president for external trade, told a news conference in Montreal Friday night that the cancellation would not affect project, except possibly to delay it by a year.
"Great Whale will be producing energy by the year 2000," he predicted.

HEADLINE: ETHNIC VIOLENCE IS SHAKING KENYA

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, March 25

 BODY:
In the last few days, many Kenyans -- as well as the foreign donors who have sunk billions of dollars of aid into Kenya -- have expressed concern that one of the few African countries with a relatively strong economy and capitalist economic practices may be in danger of unraveling.
Over the last year or so, a series of events have contributed to a feeling of uncertainty in Kenya, which Washington until recently considered one of its strongest allies in Africa. These events have included widespread charges of Government corruption that have brought halts or cuts in the flow of foreign aid upon which Kenya's economy depends, and protests against the Government of President Daniel arap Moi that resulted in police attacks on demonstrators early this month. 
 The latest events to shake the nation, an outburst of ethnic violence that claimed 60 lives over three weeks this month, have brought Kenya's problems into sharp relief, with opposition charges that the President or his aides were instrumental in fomenting the fighting.
In an editorial denouncing the Government for the latest violence, which has left thousands homeless and houses and granaries burned, The Nation, Kenya's largest-circulation newspaper, said this week that the clashes were "creating political acrimony and tension that is threatening national unity."
 
Pervasive Unease Prevails
 Tension remains high in the western part of the country, where the tribal violence occurred, and in Nairobi, the capital, a pervasive unease prevails as concern mounts that Mr. Moi will be either unwilling or unable to calm ethnic distrust now rife in a country generally known for its tribal harmony.
In the last several days, religious leaders, opposition forces and members of Mr. Moi's governing party have charged the Government with fomenting the clashes as a way of proving that multi-party politics would not work here.
How the 67-year-old Mr. Moi, a member of the minority Kalenjin tribe, could expect to come out ahead by alienating the larger tribes, the Kikuyu, Luo and Luhya, was not clear. Some politicians suggested that Mr. Moi, faced with two opposition parties drawn from the larger tribes, was determined after 14 years in power not to go down without a fight.
Many Kenyans, from business leaders to clergy, say the unease in the country far deeper than the uncertainties surrounding a short-lived coup attempt in 1982. "You can't plan for the future," a young professional woman said. "You don't know what's going to happen."
Accentuating the political and tribal troubles is the economic deterioration.
In November last year the foreign donors suspended new infusions of aid for six months, calling for improvement in the political and economic management of the country. An American diplomat said this week that a World Bank meeting scheduled for May with Kenyan treasury officials to discuss the resumption of aid would not be held. There was nothing to discuss, he said.
A marked increase in violent crime in Nairobi seems to underscore the growing nervousness. Armed hold-ups, once a rarity, have become almost commonplace, according to shopkeepers.
At the same time, impoverished urban dwellers are faced with serious food shortages, caused in part by a severe drought but also, economists say, by the Government's pricing policies. There has been virtually no milk or butter in Nairobi for the last month, and people are walking miles to buy containers of water.
Last week, during some of the worst violence, Mr. Moi was out of the country on an official visit to Austria, where he was often photographed with President Kurt Waldheim, and on a private trip to Britain.
On his return, while attempting a conciliatory tone during visits in the areas where the violence occurred, Mr. Moi accused the main opposition party, the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy, of provoking the violence.
In December, Mr. Moi agreed to the introduction of multi-party politics in Kenya. Two main opposition parties quickly formed: the Forum, headed by Kenya's first Vice President, a Luo, Oginga Odinga, and the Democratic Party, headed by another former Vice President, a Kikuyu, Mwai Kibaki.
At first, both opposition parties held large, peaceful rallies. But violence started early this month when armed policemen in Nairobi disbanded a group of elderly women hunger strikers protesting the Government's holding of political prisoners. This was quickly followed by the ethnic clashes.
According to accounts in the Kenyan newspapers and descriptions from witnesses, the violence involved nighttime arson and attacks by heavily armed groups from members of sub-tribes of the Kalenjin, Mr. Moi's ethnic group.
At first the attacks were on villages and market places of Luo people, the second largest tribe in Kenya. Villages of Luhya were also hit, witnesses said. Last week, the violence spread to the rich farming belt of the Rift Valley where many Kikuyu people, the largest tribe in Kenya, have settled on traditional Kalenjin land.
Kikuyu workers on the tea estates in the area around a town called Molo described how bands of Kalenjins burned houses, spiked people with spears and terrorized others.
The violence around Molo so angered the local member of Parliament, a Kikuyu, Njenja Mungai, that The Nation quoted him as telling the Kalenjins: "You have taken on the wrong tribe since the Kikuyus will never sit down and watch their children and wives being massacred for no apparent reason."
A member of Mr. Moi's party, the Kenya National African Union, Mr. Mungai was arrested on Monday by the security forces in connection with his anti-Kalenjin statements.
As well as seeing tribal ruptures in his own political party, Mr. Moi appears to have lost the confidence of church leaders, who had said they were heartened by the introduction of multi-party politics.
In their harshest criticism yet, the 18 Roman Catholic bishops attributed the tribal violence to a "wider political strategy" of a Government wanting to show that multi-party politics would result in bloodshed.
"It is difficult for the Government to exonerate itself from the responsiblity of these violent clashes," the bishops said in a pastoral letter read in the pulpits last Sunday and published in the newspapers.

HEADLINE: Since Beating, Little Change for Los Angeles Police

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 28

 BODY:
Sgt. Andrew Simon found himself excited, even a little frightened, as he pulled to a sudden stop last week behind an armed man in a small white pickup truck. The police officers who halted Rodney King, he said, must have felt much the same.
"You got a gun, man, you're dead," Sergeant Simon shouted, leaping from his car and aiming his revolver with both hands at the muscular man in a Raiders hat who slipped quickly from the cab of the truck. 
 "Freeze! Freeze!" came the shouts of other officers running in a loping sideways gait, their own guns raised, to block his escape amid a cluster of small bungalows in the heart of the city's South Central ghetto.
"I ain't done nothing," said the man, tossing his gun, barely concealed in a brown paper bag, into the cab of the truck. And then, despite the fast arrival of more police officers who blocked the alleys with their black-and-white cruisers, he ducked between the bungalows, leaped a wire fence and disappeared.
 
Excitement of the Chase
 The suddenness and the touch of danger, the running and the shouting, the barking of dogs and the rapid thump of a police helicopter overhead produced a rush of excitement for Sergeant Simon that overflowed in a torrent of words about police work and the painful questions that still surround the beating of Mr. King.
"In my mind it was a similar situation," he said, still breathing hard. "Here's a 14-year veteran that tells you, 'Yeah, I got excited. I got a little scared.' I was scared because I kept thinking, I'm going to have to shoot this guy, because I knew what he had in the bag."
A sergeant and three officers are on trial now, charged with assault in the videotaped clubbing and kicking of Mr. King, whom they stopped for speeding on March 3, 1991, after a long and unnerving chase.
In the minds of a shocked public, the widely televised 81-second beating has come to symbolize police brutality, a vivid portrait, as one lawyer at the trial put it, of peace officers "out of control."
 
Not Much Has Changed
 It inspired a review of the Los Angeles Police Department by an independent commission that made scores of recommendations for an overhaul designed to produce a more humane, community-oriented force.
But police officers, who for the most part defend their practices, and the monitoring groups that criticized them, say the last year has not brought significant changes.
Complaints to Police Watch, a private nonprofit lawyer referral service, are running at about the same rate as ever, said its director, Karol Heppe. Last month, it received 226 complaints of misconduct by the Los Angeles police, including 146 that involved an accusation of assault.
A theme in the independent commission's findings, and among critics of the police force, is that the city's violent streets have hardened its peacekeepers and that officers here are too ready to perceive its inhabitants as enemies and to react to them with violence.
On the witness stand last week in the King case, the accused sergeant, Stacey C. Koon, made the argument that on those violent streets police work must sometimes be ugly.
"It's violent and it's brutal," Sergeant Koon said, describing the videotaped beating. "Sometimes police work is brutal. That's just a fact of life."
 
Reserving Judgment
 Sergeant Simon, an officer selected by the Los Angeles Police Department to offer a reporter a glimpse of police work, seemed to agree. "Any time you hit somebody with a stick it looks shocking," he said.
And although the prosecutor in the King trial, echoing a common public sentiment, told the jury that no extenuating circumstances could possibly justify the beating, Sergeant Simon said he could not, as a policeman, condemn what he had seen on the videotape without knowing the full picture that surrounded it.
"If I was standing in Stacey Koon's shoes I don't know what I would have done differently," he said. "I wasn't there and I don't know the totality of the situation."
In defense testimony at the trial this week, experts in the use of force described the narrow line the police must walk between a dangerous restraint and criminal overreaction. To stay in control in a threatening encounter, they said, police officers must be the first to apply force.
 
Seeing Banality in Violence
 Analyzing the videotape at one-sixth speed, the defense witnesses testified that every one of the 56 blows was justified by what seemed to them to be threatening movements of the mostly prone Mr. King.
Amid the blurry rise and fall of the batons they found the banality of routine police procedure.
In last week's encounter, Sergeant Simon had responded to a report of a man brandishing a gun. Unlike the circumstances of Mr. King's arrest, there was no car chase and no violence.
But the sergeant said the brief incident reminded him of the harsh and difficult situations that police officers must deal with every day and that Sergeant Koon faced a year ago.
"Can you put yourself in the Rodney King incident, with some guy running from you that 'didn't do anything?' " he said. "You see how things happen? That's how things happen. That's how it really happens.
"It raises the tension level -- the adrenaline level -- on anyone," he said. "You have to play everything that way. You have to anticipate the worst."
Like Sergeant Koon, he said, he had had to size up the situation in an instant, and like him, he determined that the man he was facing was dangerous.
"He was very buffed out, very muscular," said Sergeant Koon of Mr. King, using police slang for a man who is well-built. "My initial response was that he was probably an ex-con."
And Sergeant Simon said: "My guess was that this guy was on parole. He was built like a parolee." He said that prisoners often spend their time lifting weights and that their upper bodies are disproportionately developed.
"I said, 'Hey, man, put your hands up,' and he said, 'I ain't done nothing,' " Sergeant Simon said. "That's another thing with a con. They'll always answer you. It's from their time in prison.
"I don't know anything about that guy we chased, and yet our contact -- there was something there, there was something happening there. We close on this guy and he is running like a bat out of hell and he resists. What do you do? I've got a 6-year-old and a 3-year-old to come home to every night."
All around the tiny courtyard where the armed man had disappeared, faces of adults and children peered at the police from behind half-opened barred doors. Some turned quickly away when a reporter approached, but others said they welcomed the police in their neighborhood.
"Ever since the Rodney King beating, you've got to have that on your mind," said Michael Miller, a mechanic who described himself as "unemployed, like about 50 percent of the people around here."
But he added: "The streets are wild, so if you're the police you've got to be rough. You've got to show them that you're the ones in control."
As the helicopter hovered and police radios squawked, Sergeant Simon and his men went from house to house, looking under cars and flinging open the doors of wooden sheds.
They stopped at the house of Gladys Hildreth, where a dog was barking excitedly at the entrance to a ground-level crawl space. They peered warily through the opening with their flashlights.
 
Prudence First
 With an evident act of will, Sergeant Simon placed prudence ahead of the excitement of the chase.
"The risk-benefit ratio is not worth it to go in there," the sergeant told his men. "This is just a C.C.W. caper," carrying a concealed weapon. "It's just a misdemeanor. My philosophy is, we'll catch that guy another day."
Mrs. Hildreth looked on in some bewilderment from behind her own barred door as the policemen climbed back into their black-and-whites and drove away to answer another call.
"I hope I don't wake up in the middle of the night with someone under my house," she said.

HEADLINE: DUMP BID ASSAILED ALONG RIO GRANDE

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 28

 BODY:
After months of United States criticism of Mexico's environmental practices and policies, proposals to build three hazardous waste dumps along the Texas border have caused an uproar on both sides of the Rio Grande.
Mexican state and city governments, environmental groups and political parties have all clamored against the proposal, arguing that the dumps could threaten the groundwater that communities in both countries share. Last week hundreds of Mexicans joined Texans in protests at different border-crossing points. 
 Increasingly, the Mexican Government has added its voice to the complaints, warning that it will use "all of the diplomatic means available" to block any radioactive or toxic waste sites that it considers dangerous. But a commission of the Mexican Congress voted unanimously to ask the Administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to increase its efforts to stop the dumps from being built.
For the time being, the Foreign Ministry has only made a formal request to the United States for more information about the proposals. But Mexican diplomats say that unless geologists convince them that leaks from the dumps could not reach the aquifers that run beneath the border area, they will insist that the projects violate a 1983 border environmental treaty.
 
'Case That Can Be Stopped'
 "There are lots of environmental incidents along the border, but here we are dealing with something different," said Alberto Szekely, an environmental law specialist who is advising the Foreign Ministry in its negotiations with the United States. "This is a case that can be stopped before something happens."
The growing controversy reflects how, even as the momentum has slowed in negotiations over a North American Free Trade Agreement, concerns about economic integration have continued to reshape environmental politics along the border.
According to officials in both countries, Mexican and United States border communities that once kept their distance have begun to find themselves frequently allied, or at least in consultation, over their mutual environmental problems. Environmental groups in Mexico and the United States say they now often coordinate their lobbying efforts, and many have found that problems they might once have considered local can be handled more effectively on a broader front. "We had to make this an international issue," Alfredo Gutierrez Jr., the Mayor of Del Rio, Tex., said in a telephone interview explaining his town's strategy to block the large hazardous waste dump that Chemical Waste Management Inc. wants to build near Dryden, Tex., a town about 15 miles north of the Rio Grande and 35 miles west of the Pecos River in southwest Texas. "In terms of defeating the dump site, Mexico's involvement has a tremendous impact."
 
Not Close to Final Approval
 United States and Texas officials have emphasized that none of the three dumps was close to receiving final approval. "And there are mechanisms," the United States Ambassador, John D. Negroponte, assured Mexican reporters last week, "to take into account any concerns, any point of view not only of the Mexican Government but of any community that feels that it might be affected."
The two countries agreed this week to discuss the issue at a high-level meeting next month in Washington. But like their counterparts in Texas, border communities and environmentalists in Mexico have grown more worried since a Texas agency voted last month to buy a 16,000-acre ranch near Sierra Blanca, a small town about 75 miles southeast of El Paso, and spend $415,000 more to apply for a license to store the state's low-level radioactive waste there.
Texas officials say that unlike the other two proposed dumps -- a private low-level radioactive waste depository near the town of Spofford, about 15 miles from the Mexican border and 30 miles southeast of Del Rio, and the Chemical Waste Management one near Dryden -- the state radioactive storage site will have to be built somewhere by 1996 to comply with Federal requirements.
Texas tried for five years to get approval to build the dump near Fort Hancock, a town along the Rio Grande 26 miles west of Sierra Blanca. But last year the city of El Paso, concerned about radioactive leaks into its water supply, won a lawsuit to block the project.

HEADLINE: Collapse of Inner-City Families Creates America's New Orphans

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., March 28

 BODY:
Marianne Nolte avoids saying "mom" or "dad" in her ninth-grade math class, referring instead to "family" in deference to the many shamefaced children who have been abandoned to other relatives, foster homes or institutions.
Sylvia Parker knows she will dial multiple wrong numbers when she tries to call a student's home, spending hours if not days retracing the zigzag path these children travel from parent to grandparent to foster home and sometimes back again. 
 And Carolyn Ayana has written a song called "Gimme Back My Mama" for her seventh-grade music class, hoping it will open discussion among students who avert their eyes and whisper that everything is fine at home long after their parents are lost to crack or locked in jail, and they are living with grandma, auntie or a stranger.
These teachers and their students are struggling with a profound social problem, the disintegration of the inner city family, which has taken a terrible toll at Frick Junior High School here. The principal and a school social worker estimate that more than half the 750 youngsters at Frick live with neither a mother nor a father.
Frick is rare among schools in trying to count how many of its children are without either parent. But experts say high concentrations of these children, America's new orphans, are common in schools in the inner city, where fathers have long been absent and mothers have more recently disappeared into the nether world of crack.
 
In Every City
 "You could use expressions like, 'It's mushrooming' or 'growing exponentially,' but these words aren't strong enough," said Lois G. Forer, a retired judge in Philadelphia and the author of a provocative 1988 article in The Washington Monthly calling for the return of orphanages to help with the problem. "It's everywhere -- New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, you name it."
The phenomenon of children with no parents is prompting educators to rethink how to run schools that were meant to serve nuclear families. Even more tellingly, it is creating growing support for the idea of bringing back the orphanages of the 19th and early 20th centuries.
"This is still a high voltage subject," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, who in 1989 wrote a paper forecasting the explosion of zero-parent families. "You get an awful shock if you go near it, so people avoid it. But custodial institutions are clearly on their way."
Senator Moynihan added that crack is creating not only orphans but a need for orphanages, in the same way that epidemics of diphtheria, influenza and tuberculosis once did.
There is some dispute about how best to count these children, who overwhelmingly live in neighborhoods where drugs, AIDS and guns are rampantand the zero-parent family is replacing the single-parent family as the emblem of social distress. Their situations vary, but in all categories the numbers of these new orphans are increasing.
Some are true zero-parent children, living permanently with relatives, in foster homes or in institutions because their parents are dead, incarcerated or have disappeared. Many more are youngsters who are shuttled from pillar to post, farmed out to a shifting cast of relatives while a drug-abusing or vagabond parent is unable or unwilling to care for them.
According to the Federal Bureau of the Census, 2.8 million children, or 4.5 percent, of America's 63.8 million children were true zero-parent children in 1980, up from 3.5 percent 10 years before. And the numbers are far worse among black children: In 1980, 10.6 percent of them lived in parentless households, up from 9.4 percent in 1970. The 1990 census data on these children is not yet available.
 
Measuring the Problem
 But some demographers are looking for a more inclusive description for the messy way that families fall apart, a better statistical measure for this new social problem.
According to the Kids Count Data Book, an annual profile of American children by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the Center for the Study of Social Policy, nearly 1 of every 10 American children lived in a household headed by someone other than a parent in 1990, up from 6.7 percent in 1970.
A mother is sometimes present in these homes, but she is often a drug addict or a teen-ager who comes and goes while someone else cares for her children. At a recent conference at the American Enterprise Institute these households were described as "family radicals," using the scientific jargon for unbalanced atoms.
At Frick Junior High and similar schools in inner-city neighborhoods, the statistics are even more extreme. At least two-thirds of the school's 750 pupils are new orphans.
Forty percent live in county foster homes. At least half that many are living with grandmothers or aunts. Many more live with a drug-abusing mother one week and a weary relative the next. The principal, Murphy Taylor, said virtually all these children are black. The Hispanic families, he said, almost always remain intact.
Mr. Taylor, a first-year principal who is black and a longtime foster parent, decided to learn where his students were living after he found that many of them were routinely out of control: fighting with classmates and shoving or cursing teachers. This behavior, he knew, matched what child development experts see in abandoned youngsters.
Scarred by years of abuse and neglect, many of these children are angry and disruptive, even after they settle in loving foster homes or with doting grandmothers. They are distrustful of adults, greedy for attention and convinced that they must be worthless or their parents would not have left them. They are unresponsive to threats that their misbehavior will land them in trouble, because things already seem as bad as they can get.
"People look at these kids and think they're crazy," said Nanette Sanders, the mother of a ninth grader and president of the Parent Teachers Association at Frick, where an average meeting draws a half-dozen parents. "Well, society hasn't dealt them a fair hand. The person who's supposed to have taken care of them didn't. So they develop an attitude. They get hard."
The teachers at Frick are scornful of foster homes and say that most of them are economic arrangements that do not nurture children. The children with relatives are loved, the teachers say, but often poorly supervised because the grandmothers and aunts are exhausted, afraid to come out at night to attend school events and unwilling to hear bad news about the youngsters. The children who move from house to house have no stability and bear the wounds of repeated rejection.
The new orphans, particulary those in foster homes, are ashamed and secretive, never volunteering information about who they live with, refusing rides home and not inviting friends to visit.
"They have a keen awareness of what a family should be like," said Cheryl Vawter, a history teacher. "And they desperately want that."
Teachers usually have no idea who students live with because the children do not tell, different last names are the norm, and such information is not routinely available or changes so often that school records cannot be kept up to date.
Ms. Ayana, the music teacher, said she learned that one of her favorite students was living in a foster home only after the girl arrived at school with black-and-blue marks suffered from a beating. The police were then summoned. Mrs. Vawter said she had a similar surprise after a student disappeared from the school. The girl, despite frequent references to her mother and father, had been living in a group foster home and had run away.
Disciplining these children is tricky. Miss Ayana showed why by citing a typical exchange.
TEACHER: "All right, Charles, I'm going to call your mother."
STUDENT: "Go on ahead. I don't have no mother no way."
When the children are moving from relative to relative, or their telephone has been disconnected, they act up with impunity. "They know you can't get in touch," said Bob Kenney, a social studies teacher.
 
The 'Concentration Effect'
 Schools like Frick have disproportionate numbers of orphans, just as certain neighborhoods wind up overwhelmed by the most disadvantaged people after the others flee. And the results are much the same, said William Julius Wilson, a professor of sociology at the University of Chicago, who coined the phrase "concentration effect" to describe the corrosion of a community when only the most impoverished people remain.
At Frick, many of the more organized families have fled the chaos by enrolling their children in magnet or parochial schools. "This futher isolates and stigmatizes these youngsters," said Toni Cook, a member of the Oakland Board of Education. "They don't get to mix and mingle with other youngsters for whom the ball has bounced right. They don't get to see how the grass can be greener."
Mr. Taylor, the principal at Frick, is trying to lure the stable families back. He took the 20 most disruptive children from all three grades and moved them to a satellite classroom in a nearby church. The children seem to be doing better with one teacher responsible for them all day. And the main school building is a less threatening place with these disruptive students gone.
Mr. Taylor has also encouraged more appealing activities for families, including weeky math nights in the computer laboratory so that the adults can learn along with the children. He also hopes to open the gymnasium on nights and weekends so that children from other schools will play alongside Frick's youngsters.
Across the country, inner city schools are tentatively making changes because of the proliferation of new orphans.
In some districts health services have relocated to school buildings so that needy children will not have to depend on absent or inattentive parents to take them to a clinic. In many junior high schools, including Frick, students are moving from subject to subject in intact classes to create a sense of family.
In New York City, the Parents Association handbook is being revised to explain that the term "parent" includes "guardians and persons in parental relationships to children." And in the District of Columbia, the school board is considering residential schools.
"These kids can't fit into the boxes we've created," Mr. Taylor said. "And it's not their fault. Very dysfunctional children need something significantly different, and it's up to us to figure out what that is."

It's Final: Bridgeport Loses Last Game

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Mass., March 28

 BODY:
The University of Bridgeport had the right scene but the wrong ending for the final chapter of its basketball program.
Playing what was in all likelihood the final game in Bridgeport's 45-year history in the sport, the Knights lost to Virginia Union, 100-75, this afternoon in the championship game of the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division II tournament at the Springfield Civic Center. 
 A storybook finish for Bridgeport was edited out at the start of the second half when Virginia Union went on a 15-4 run to grab a 17-point lead, and then cruised home for the title.
Bridgeport, in a financial crisis brought on by declining enrollment and an unforgiving recession, will cease all intercollegiate athletics at the end of the school year. The university needed a $2.2 million loan from a consortium of banks merely to open for the spring semester, and 31 degree programs will be dropped after this academic year if the school remains in operation.
When the final buzzer sounded today, as the Virginia Union players piled together at center court in jubilation, the Bridgeport players sat motionless on the bench with their arms around each other, clearly aware that there will be no more basketball at Bridgeport for the foreseeable future.
Bruce Webster, the Knights' coach, tried to keep a lid on emotions at the post-game news conference, but he ended up choking back tears.
"I don't want to get deep into this," said Webster, who is ending a 27-year career as the Bridgeport coach. "I don't want to think about the last game and all that stuff. This is the greatest group of kids I've ever been associated with. I think they displayed their heart the entire season. I'm going to miss them. I just wish it would never end."
Faced with the gloomy prospect of every game being their last, the Knights made an inspired run through the Division II tournament. In the quarterfinals, they went into overtime to defeat Central Oklahoma, 127-124. In the semifinals, they scored 8 points in the final 55 seconds to defeat California (Pa.), 76-75, snapping California's 29-game winning streak.
Virginia Union was just too big and strong inside for Bridgeport. Center Derrick Johnson had 17 points and 6 blocked shots for the Panthers, while forward Reggie Jones scored a team-high 19 points and grabbed 11 rebounds. Bridgeport was led by Winston Jones, who had 23 points.
The championship game was a disheartening culmination for the 54-year-old Webster, who compiled a 478-285 record, making him the winningest coach in New England Division I and II history. Webster guided nine Bridgeport teams to 20-victory seasons, and this season's 28-7 squad set the school record for victories.
Like the nonsenior Bridgeport players, who will be allowed to transfer without having to sit out a year, Webster must now find a new school.
Bridgeport had to finish its tournament run with its leading scorer, Lambert Shell, hurting. The 6-foot-4-inch senior forward, who averaged 23 points a game this season, badly sprained his left foot against Central Oklahoma in the quarterfinals. After sitting out the semifinal game, Shell started against Virginia Union but was hindered by the injury. He scored 11 points, 2 in the second half.
Afterward, the loss hurt more than his foot.
"We've been playing through so many things happening at the school and so many things happening with the team, like coach said, it's the greatest group of guys I've ever been associated with," Shell said.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE BASKETBALL: MIDWEST REGIONAL;
For Memphis State, Use of Local Talent Elevates City's Game

BYLINE: By THOMAS GEORGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., March 28

 BODY:
You can take Memphis State out of Memphis, but do not try taking the Memphis out of Memphis State.
When the Tigers (23-10) battle Cincinnati (28-4) in the Midwest Regional final here at Kemper Arena on Sunday to decide which team advances to the Final Four, Memphis State will feature four starters who are from Memphis. Nine of the 14 players on its roster are from that city, and three others are from cities within 100 miles. 
 In an era in college basketball where most successful schools scour the country and pluck their talent from a nationwide pool, the Memphis State basketball program is like none other in the National Collegiate Athletic Association.
The strong link with Memphis State basketball starts early for Memphis youth at places like the Lester Community Center and at nearby Y.M.C.A.'s and Boys' Clubs.
 
A Big, Little Town
 Bob Winn, the school's sports information director, who has watched the phenomenon unfold during his 14 years at the school, said it began in the late 70's and has never wavered.
"We like to think of Memphis as a big city and it is, with more than a million people," Winn said. "But when we went to Chicago for the Great Midwest tournament, our fans were looking around at the buildings and the sights and saying, 'Wow!' We're just a little town.
"Our players feel the same way. They grow up like most kids in Memphis do. You can drive through Memphis at almost any time of the day or night and find kids out on the concrete dribbling basketballs and dreaming they'll get the chance to play at Memphis State.
"It's a Southern city with Southern traditions. Many of the kids come from tough economic backgrounds and haven't traveled all over the U.S. They don't want to leave and play far away in places where they know their families and friends can't come. And a lot of the credit for the fond feelings in the city toward its basketball has to go to Coach Larry Finch."
Finch is from Memphis, too. He was an all-America guard at Memphis State from 1970-1973 and led the Tigers to the N.C.A.A. championship game in '73, when they lost to to U.C.L.A. Concluding his sixth season at the Memphis State helm, Finch was credited during his playing career with helping bring the city together after racial strife followed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination there in 1968.
 
'He's Still a Hero'
 "Every year there are 32 or so players in the Memphis area that want to play at Memphis State," said Anfernee Hardaway, a Memphis native and sophomore guard who is the only player in Division I basketball this season who ranked in the top five in his conference in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocked shots. "Coach has some tough decisions, but he's still a hero in our city every year, no matter who he chooses."
Guard Billy Smith, also from Memphis, explained Memphis youths' love affair with Memphis State basketball this way:
"You grow up playing at places like Lester against guys who are 27 and 30 years old, tough players who could have been in the N.B.A. but chose the wrong routes with drugs and other things but still play outstanding basketball. You can break a nose and you're knocked down, but you get up and you keep playing.
"You realize how good the basketball is there when you look around the country and see how many other players from Memphis are doing great at other schools, like Todd Day at Arkansas.
"Most kids in Memphis grow up very close to their families, with single-parent families, and they want to keep giving something back. You need to stay home to do that. And most of us think, 'Why go and build up somewhere else when you should take care of home first?' We all want to take care of home, of Memphis State, before anyplace else."
 
'You Belong to the Public'
 Finch enjoys the luxury of his rock-solid recruiting base but said it has drawbacks.
"Everybody knows everybody, and the least thing your kid does can be exploited," Finch said. "You have to live a model life as a Memphis State player. It's almost like you belong to us, and you belong to the public. We have created a monster."
What Memphis State wants to create against Cincinnati on Sunday is a more physical presence and a strong rebounding performance. Guard Herb Jones is Cincinnati's most steady player, and guard Anthony Buford adds dazzle and deadly long-range shots.
Cincinnati and Memphis State both hail from the new Great Midwest Conference, and the Bearcats have beaten Memphis State three straight times this season -- by scores of 75-66, 69-59 and 75-63 -- while outrebounding the Tigers each time.

HEADLINE: Mexico Trade Treaty Threatens U.S. Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Trading Trade for Votes" (editorial, March 16) lauds the Mexican free trade agreement the Bush Administration is negotiating, for its so-called benefits to both sides of the Rio Grande River. You state that "100,000 U.S. workers, mainly in auto and apparel, are expected to lose their jobs," and callously write them off. The loss of jobs will be much greater than your estimate. 
 For those victims of the Mexican agreement you recommend that "the compassionate remedy would be generous dislocation assistance," as if such remedies had not already failed to train or equip laid-off workers for jobs, especially in our depressed labor market, a time when people with the highest skills -- including executives, engineers, computer specialists and technicians -- cannot find employment.
In the last dozen years, 500,000 manufacturing jobs have been shipped to Mexico by United States corporations that have chosen 75 cent-an-hour wages and minuscule tariff levies that were designed to let these companies bring their products back to this country for sale at maximum profits.
A short while ago, General Motors shocked the country by announcing it would close 21 auto plants in the next four years, with a loss of 74,000 jobs.
The Mexican trade agreement will add to and exacerbate these losses, affecting not only auto workers, but also the vast number of companies and employees in this country whose existence depends on a thriving United States automobile industry.
No Government handout or "dislocation assistance" is a substitute for a regular job in an industry that has always provided a decent livelihood for its workers and their families.
This treaty will be a blow to our economy, and Congress should repudiate it.

HEADLINE: Cleaner Streets at Lower Cost

 BODY:
Reduced sanitation budgets leave New York City dirtier than ever and undermine the recycling that once promised relief for landfills. But a radical proposal to change commercial trash collection could ease those problems and save businesses tens of millions -- all at no cost to taxpayers.
In 1957, the city turned over to private carters the task of hauling trash from commercial establishments. The firms that carry on the business today are relatively small -- some 475 companies haul trash from more than 250,000 businesses that produce 40 percent of the city's commercial waste. 
 City officials charge that they operate as a "cartel," deciding among themselves which company will service which route rather than compete for customers. No invisible hand keeps costs down, and the reliance on hundreds of small operators bars economies of scale. Mark Green, the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs, therefore proposes that the city be carved into large districts and that contractors bid for the right to collect trash from each one.
The prospect of access to large amounts of trash could interest big national waste disposal companies; it might also persuade smaller contractors to band together in more efficient units.
The plan would give the city more power to insist on weekend pickups and collection schedules that don't block rush-hour traffic. And large contractors serving large districts could recycle valuable waste paper, metal and glass.
The current carters claim the right to compensation should the new plan void their contracts. But that's no reason not to proceed. Legislation authorizing an experiment could permit a return to the status quo should the carters prevail in court. The idea's promise -- cleaner streets at lower cost -- remains far too alluring to ignore.

HEADLINE: 'No Place Seems Safe'

 BODY:
Fear: It's the urban concern most conspicuously missing from the Presidential campaign. Yet even now, as the primary contest heats up in this most urban of all settings, the candidates shrink from talking about it.
Senator Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat, is not a candidate, but last week he raised the issue with a bravery and candor that Bill Clinton, Jerry Brown -- and President Bush -- would do well to emulate. 
 Republican exploitation of race, crime and fear has deeply divided the public. The Democrats have failed to face up to these issues. But Senator Bradley began to confront them last week in a Senate speech. "If you were to select the one thing that has changed in cities since the 1960's," he said, "it would be fear. No place in the city seems safe." And to do something effective and humane about that, he went on, requires frank discussion of black criminality in America's inner cities.
Willie Horton -- black man, escaped murderer and rapist -- has been the principal metaphor of racial discourse since the Bush campaign used him in a TV ad to inflame voters against Michael Dukakis in 1988. Powerfully, it aroused white fear of black crime.
Democrats have seemed perpetually helpless in trying to combat this fear; they have failed to acknowledge the link between race and crime. In his speech, Senator Bradley confronted that fear head on:
"Many whites responding to a more violent reality, heightened by sensational news stories, see young black men traveling in groups, cruising the city, looking for trouble, and they are frightened. Many white Americans, whether fairly or unfairly, seem to be saying of some young black males, 'You litter the street and deface the subway, and no one, white or black, says stop . . . You rob a store, rape a jogger, shoot a tourist, and when they catch you, if they catch you . . . you cry racism.' "
Mr. Bradley is no alarmist. He suggests ways to turn more resources toward the problem. And he offers a blunt reminder that "the future of American cities is inextricably bound to the issue of race and ethnicity . . . That means the economic future of the children of white Americans will increasingly depend on the talents of nonwhite Americans. If we allow them to fail because of our penny-pinching or timidity about straight talk, America will become a second-rate power."
Mr. Bradley's speech has its flaws. He warns that middle-class whites will become alienated from the cities, but he pays no notice to a black middle class that now encompasses more than a third of black Americans. Their presence, too, is critical to the future of the cities. And he puts too much stock in the revival power of enterprise zones.
But the Senator could well have been addressing the Presidential candidates with these words: "When politicians don't talk about the reality that everyone knows exists, they cannot lead us out of our current crisis."
Are the candidates listening?

A Close-Run Thing

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
It is a Hobbesian election campaign here: nasty, brutish and short. It has produced acres of invective and little by way of affirmative reason to vote for anyone. But at least it will be over a week from Thursday, when Britain votes.
Or will it? The polls are so close that the election could produce a hung Parliament, one in which neither Labor nor the Conservatives have a majority. If neither can then form a stable government with the help of minor parties, the British might have to vote again. 
 Such predictions are usually fanciful. The British election system tends to give one party a decisive majority in Parliament even when the popular vote is close. But this time there is a real possibility of an indecisive result.
By the ordinary swings of politics here it should be Labor's election to win. The Conservatives have been in power for 13 years, 11 under Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister and now 2 under John Major.
The gains made by Mrs. Thatcher in ending trade union excesses and making business more competitive have been overtaken lately by a recession even more savage than America's. Unemployment figures have risen 23 months in a row. It is the longest recession since the 1930's.
Yet Labor has not been able to turn economic distress into a clear lead in public opinion. One reason -- the dominant one, I believe -- is the historical baggage the party carries.
Neil Kinnock, the Labor leader, has done a remarkable job in removing the extreme left from any significant role in the party. Labor's principal economic spokesmen, John Smith and Gordon Brown, are models of responsibility.
But there is no doubt a lingering public memory of the time when important figures in the party spouted Marxist slogans and big unions pushed Labor Governments into inflationary policies. And the Conservatives are doing their best to remind voters of that past.
Mr. Major has run a negative campaign, attacking Labor in general and Mr. Kinnock in particular as not to be trusted. He even brought Mrs. Thatcher in one day to join the attack -- a rather odd tactic, considering that the Tories dumped her as party leader because they thought the voters had tired of her hectoring.
In fact the attack mode has not seemed to suit Mr. Major. For a successful politician he is a colorless figure, stiff in expression and movement. His winning quality is an essential decency, and that is lost in the negative campaign. Perhaps sensing so, the Tories have lately seemed to turn toward accentuating the positive.
The low level of the campaign is indicated by the big issue of the last few days. Labor put on a television broadcast about a little girl who had to wait nearly a year for an ear operation because, it said, the Tory Government had starved the National Health Service. The girl's name, Jennifer Bennett, was not used in the broadcast but somehow got to the press.
The Conservatives denounced the broadcast. Mr. Major called it "shroud-waving" and charged Labor with leaking Jennifer's name. Labor said the Conservatives leaked it to a pro-Conservative paper, The Daily Express. For days the party press conferences resounded with this stuff. Could the public really care?
The larger themes of the campaign are economic: Labor calling for higher spending on National Health and other public services, the Conservatives for tax cuts. But in the end, my guess is that the decisive question will not be details of economic policy. The issue will be whether voters just think it is time for a change.
If the voters are so uncertain that they elect a hung Parliament, many things could happen. Labor could be close enough to a majority to govern in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, who might have 20 seats in the House of Commons. Their price would probably be Labor's agreement to conduct future elections by proportional representation.
The Conservatives could be so near a majority that they could govern with the help of the Ulster Unionists, the Northern Ireland Protestants who are expected to hold 13 seats. Or that alliance could seem so treacherous that Mr. Major would ask the Queen to dissolve Parliament and have another election.

HEADLINE: Where the Money Washes Up

BYLINE: By Steve Lohr; Steve Lohr is a financial reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
IN ANY FLIGHT FROM MIAMI TO the Cayman Islands, passengers can usually be divided into two groups. There are the vacationers, in their T-shirts and sneakers, on their way to a Caribbean holiday of sun and scuba diving. Then there are the suits. With Rolex watches on their wrists and leather attache cases by their feet, they barely glance up from their papers to take in the palm-fringed isles below as the plane nears its destination.
The button-down crowd has been commuting regularly to do business in a tax-and-regulatory haven that, by some measures, now rivals Switzerland. Three slivers of sand tucked south of Cuba and northwest of Jamaica, the Cayman Islands are an unlikely location for a world-class financial center. Mere flyspecks on most maps, they are so out of the way that Christopher Columbus discovered them by accident when his flotilla was blown off course on his final voyage to the New World in 1503. For centuries afterward, the Caymans were a hideaway for adventurers like Edward Teach, also known as Blackbeard the Pirate, who hid ill-gotten loot on the remote isles. 
 There are still stretches on the islands -- Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman -- that are postcard-perfect vistas come to life, pristine coral sands overlooking turquoise waters, disturbed only by the occasional fisherman or diver. But this British crown colony's real claim to prosperity and distinction -- as the Geneva of the Caribbean -- lies in what its champions call regulatory flexibility: scant regulation, strict confidentiality laws and the absence of taxes.
The financial district in Georgetown, the capital, boasts the highest density of banks and fax machines in the world. The 548 banking outposts here -- a who's who of global banking -- hold assets of some $400 billion, a fivefold jump in the past decade, placing it just behind Switzerland as an international banking center. There are, however, no skyscrapers or concrete canyons in Georgetown, for most of the banks are so-called plaque banks, or booking centers -- that is, loans or deposits are recorded on the books in the Caymans. Booking centers require no vaults, no tellers, no security guards, not even a bank building. They traffic in electronic debits and credits in a computer, which is where most money is in modern finance. The banking operation in the Caymans can be little more than a brass plate, with the paper work handled by a sponsor bank with offices in Georgetown and most of the transactions done by fax and phone from elsewhere.
American banks have booking centers in the Caymans mainly to sidestep the requirement by the Federal Reserve that a small portion of deposits held in the United States be placed with the Fed each night in a so-called reserve account that does not bear interest. This regulation helps the Fed manage the nation's monetary policy, by giving it some control over the total amount of funds in the American banking system each day. But banks make money by putting their money to use, earning interest, constantly. To avoid the reserve requirement, a bank can ask its corporate customers to place deposits in an offshore office of the bank. Thus, placing deposits on the books in the Caymans reduces a bank's costs. Because a major bank does billions of dollars' worth of international transactions each year, the savings, though small in percentage terms, can run to many millions. It is entirely legal, and one of the fine points of modern global finance.
Of the Caymans' registered banks, only 68 have offices and staff in Georgetown. In fact, the financial district's office buildings are five stories or less, owing to an old statute declaring that "no building should be higher than the tallest tree." The building edict is one of the few regulatory curbs on business.
Over the past decade, offshore financial centers like the Caymans have benefited enormously from an explosion in the size and complexity of international finance, as country after country has eased curbs on money flows and technology has enabled a banker to send funds around the world with a few taps on a computer keyboard. Offshore centers are now an integral part of the global economy, with as much as half of the world's money residing in or passing through them, according to Anthony S. Ginsberg, a Los Angeles-based financial consultant and expert on tax havens.
There are roughly four dozen of these financial entrepots, ranging from venerable European centers like Switzerland and Liechtenstein to newcomers like the South Pacific islands of Nauru and Vanuatu. The Cayman Islands are a particularly appealing way station partly because the colony is politically stable, efficient and close to the United States.
For individuals, virtually anyone can still establish his or her own shell company for a few thousand dollars in legal fees, open a local bank account and, because the required disclosure is minimal and business operates behind a legal wall of strict secrecy, no one need know about the company or what funds are stashed there. The few slips of paper that constitute the company records may be held in the office of a Cayman lawyer.
According to these lawyers, a hefty portion of the 23,500 companies and trusts registered in the Cayman Islands have been established by Americans who, for whatever reason, want to place funds outside the reach of American law. Americans, of course, are supposed to report overseas accounts to the Internal Revenue Service.
Like blue-chip corporations and highly reputable banks that use the Caymans legitimately to reduce taxes and expenses on their international business, shady operators of all kinds -- Americans included -- have grown increasingly adept at exploiting these offshore havens. Brian M. Bruh, director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a 200-person unit in the United States Treasury Department, recalls that not long ago a fraud investigation was a local affair. "Now a typical fraud case is not only nationwide but worldwide. And the offshore centers are frequently used by the crooks."
When Federal agents arrested the investment banker Dennis B. Levine in 1986, no one was surprised that days before he had visited the Caymans to set up a dummy corporation and open a bank account, where he hoped to deposit $10 million in insider stock-trading profits. When Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North needed a money-collecting front company in the arms-for-hostages caper known as the Iran-contra affair, it was set up in the Cayman Islands.
These islands also played a key role in what has been called the biggest scam in financial history. Agha Hasan Abedi, the founder of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (B.C.C.I.), channeled many of the bank's illegal transactions through its Cayman subsidiaries, including bogus loans and payoffs to the bank's front men, who secretly bought First American Bankshares Inc., the largest bank holding company in Washington. Although it had offices in 70 countries, B.C.C.I. had key operations in the money havens of the Caymans and Luxembourg, beyond the reach of any central bank.
B.C.C.I.'s collapse last year has brought financial havens like the Cayman Islands under fresh scrutiny. In testimony before the House Banking Committee last fall, E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and head of the Bank of International Settlement's committee on global banking supervision in Basel, Switzerland, said the B.C.C.I. scandal highlighted, and left unresolved, the "least common denominator aspect" of international finance -- that is, money flows to the places that regulate least.
WILLIAM S. WALKER, A trim, silver-haired 65-year-old, is the elder statesman of the Cayman Islands' banking and legal fraternity. Raised in Barbados and British Guiana and educated at Cambridge, he arrived in the Caymans in 1963 to seek his fortune.
"In the first few years, there was absolutely nothing going on here," recalls Walker, seated in his spacious Georgetown law office. "It was a fishing village."
Communications and travel were difficult, he says, but the mosquitoes were the real headache. Early visitors often fled the islands on the first boat or plane out, driven away by the insects. Caymanians used smoke pots to repel the bugs and branches to swat them. It was all a losing battle until an entomologist, Marco Giglioli, arrived from British Guiana to eradicate the mosquitoes by the diking of swamps, aerial spraying and fogging. (When Giglioli died in 1984, he was honored with a state funeral.)
For the Cayman Islands, there are two crucial dates in the post-colonial history of the Caribbean.
In 1962, the Caymans, a dependency of Jamaica since 1863, chose crown colony status after Jamaica declared its independence from Britain. British crown colonies -- like Hong Kong and Bermuda -- make their own laws and regulations. Although London appoints the governors and the Foreign Office handles the colonies' foreign policy, Britain's central bank, the Bank of England, has no direct control over financial regulation in the crown colonies.
In 1973, the Bahamas, then the main financial center in the Caribbean, was granted independence. To tighten regulations, the Prime Minister, Lynden Pindling, revoked some bank licenses and expatriate work permits. This, plus talk of nationalizing banks, scared off many financial institutions, which were welcomed in the Cayman Islands. By the 1970's, the Caymans -- already a popular tourist destination and, patterning themselves after the Bahamas and their laissez-faire capitalism, a popular tax haven -- had a new jet runway and improved communications. The territory was on its way to becoming a big-league money haven, which, by itself, is "a shortcut to prosperity," notes Walter H. Diamond, an economist and adviser to the United Nations on tax treaties and free-trade zones.
In about two decades, the islands have been transformed from a fishing-and-seafaring society to a modern service economy based on finance and tourism. (About 600,000 visitors arrive each year by cruise ships and jets.) And capitalism's spoils have trickled down.
The poverty that afflicts other parts of the Caribbean isn't much in evidence in the Caymans, which has a population of nearly 26,000, including Caymanians of mixed African and European descent, and expatriate workers from Jamaica, Britain, the United States, Central America and elsewhere. The islands boast a per-capita income of roughly $20,000, higher than that of Britain, yet the cost of living is high as well. The locals -- who take for granted such amenities as cars, air-conditioning, fine restaurants, education, international travel and satellite television -- often shuttle up to Miami for shopping trips.
William Arley Chisholm, a Caymanian banker, has experienced the economic miracle firsthand. Born in 1960, he grew up with his seven brothers and sisters in a small house with no electricity, no plumbing and no telephone. Water was drawn from a well. He walked eight miles to and from school. At night, he studied by the light of a kerosene lamp or went to bed right after sunset.
Today, Chisholm lives with his wife and two children in a condominium on Grand Cayman that is equipped with the full complement of modern conveniences: television, videocassette recorder, stereo, dishwasher and so on. He is an executive at the Bank of Nova Scotia Trust Company's operations in the Caymans. The Bank of Nova Scotia has a local consumer bank in Georgetown, as well as a sizable international operation offering a full range of financial services, including foreign-currency trades and securities transactions, to wealthy individuals who prefer a regulatory haven.
As manager of the data processing for both aspects of the bank's business, Chisholm supervises the work of 15 people. He drives a Japanese sedan and has traveled the world. His one concern at work these days seems to be where the fast track leads next. "I've kind of broken the rules at the bank in terms of the speed with which I've moved up," he says.
In the Caymans, Chisholm's story is not a one-in-a-million Horatio Alger tale, but a representative example of how the lives of many bright, young Caymanians -- who represent nearly two-thirds of the population -- have improved since the Caymans became a financial center. "By the late 1980's we created a boom the likes of which few small territories -- or large countries, for that matter -- have experienced," says Vassel Johnson, the former financial secretary and one of the principal architects of the Cayman Islands' development program.
The islands' rapid development has not, however, erased colonial class structures. Although many of the senior civil servants are Caymanian, the top bankers and lawyers tend to be white expatriates mainly from Britain or its territories but also from the United States, Canada and elsewhere. They are the ones who can afford to live in the upmarket elegance of West Bay or the northern section of Seven Mile Beach, along the west coast of Grand Cayman. This is an enclave of luxury homes, condominiums and tennis-and-yacht clubs with names like the Victoria House, the Heritage Club and the Commonwealth, which sports a sign declaring that its condominiums start "from $1.225 million" each.
The explanation for the social divisions is partly generational. The islands' upwardly mobile are young Caymanians like Chisholm who have been given a level of education and opportunity that their parents didn't have. But they have yet to break into the upper ranks of the banking and legal fraternity. They tend to live in more modest homes, some in enclaves like Bodden Town on Grand Cayman; others live closer to the stretch of Seven Mile Beach near Georgetown that resembles a Florida resort strip with gas stations, fast-food outlets, supermarkets and bars surrounding the cluster of hotels like Ramada Inn, Holiday Inn and Days Inn.
THE OFFICES OF bankers, lawyers and Government officials in the Cayman Islands all seem to have been decorated by the same person, who ordered the same pictures of Queen Elizabeth II and the same 19th-century English prints of Westminster Abbey and Big Ben. If the offices are similar, so is the message from their occupants: the unsavory reputation of the Caymans is an outdated stereotype.
"An offshore center is suspect from the word go," says Thomas Jefferson, the colony's financial secretary, "and there could have been a lot of drug money lodged in the Cayman Islands in the early 1980's. But those days are gone. Yes, we're offshore, but we're not here to collect dirty money."
In the old days, when business was scarce, banking practices were more relaxed, admits Peter A. Tomkins, chairman of the Cayman National Bank. "But there's so much legitimate business out there now," says Tomkins, a graying, craggy-featured 61-year-old who has been a banker on the islands since 1969. "To get involved in the shady stuff, running that risk, just doesn't make sense anymore."
A new customer's references, for example, are checked more closely than in the past. Tomkins says he turns away customers who don't pass muster, like people with sketchy credentials who want to open an account and quickly make multimillion-dollar deposits in the Caymans. Sometimes, he has specific information from banking colleagues that prompts misgivings about the source of a prospective client's wealth, but sometimes more subjective standards are applied. "If a guy walks in here with one, two or three gold neck chains, forget it."
For American law-enforcement officials, the Caymans began to be a problem in 1966. That year the colony, to enhance its status as a money haven, withdrew from tax treaties agreed to between Jamaica and Western industrialized countries, which required the islands to supply information on demand to other treaty nations. Soon the Caymans began to blossom as a tax haven and was a favorite of American tax dodgers. The Internal Revenue Service wasn't happy about it, and countered by serving subpoenas on Cayman-based bankers whenever they entered the United States.
The Caymans responded in 1976 by enacting the Confidential Relationships Preservation Law, which made it a crime for banks or local officials to disclose information to nosy foreign governments or investigators. The advisers to drug barons viewed the 1976 secrecy law as a money launderer's charter, and many of them hid their profits in the Caymans.
The United States stepped up pressure on the islands in the early 1980's, insisting that the Cayman Government address the issue of money laundering in drug cases. In 1984, the Caymans caved in, deciding that maintaining friendly relations with Washington and cleaning up its image outweighed the risk of losing some business because it was opening a tiny crack in its secrecy rules. The colony signed a narcotics agreement with the United States, allowing cooperation on drug cases. Two years later, the two Governments signed a broader Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, which was ratified in 1988. The assistance treaty allows the United States Government to request information from Cayman banks on specific drug cases and white-collar crimes like bank fraud.
"But it can't just be a fishing expedition," says Alan B. Ratcliffe, the commissioner of the Royal Cayman Islands Police, a big, deep-voiced man who was formerly the deputy chief constable of the English county of Cambridgeshire. "The American investigation has to be at an advanced stage before they can make proper request for information from the Caymans. And it doesn't include tax offenses because there are no tax offenses here."
By the end of last year, there were 30 United States requests for information under the legal-assistance treaty, says Ratcliffe. Of the total, 14 were drug cases and 16 fraud cases, including the one involving B.C.C.I.
In 1990, Cayman bankers agreed to a code of conduct that calls for banks to refuse any suspicious cash deposits of more than $10,000, the amount that the United States sets as a threshold to prevent money laundering. Local businesses like supermarkets, for example, might regularly make deposits of more than $10,000, but "suitcase merchants" -- those arriving at banks with attache cases full of cash -- are another matter.
The banking code, however, does not have the force of law. A bank willing to accept large cash deposits is the white-collar criminal's best friend, because once funds are in the banking system they can be sent electronically to anywhere in the world in seconds, making it extremely difficult to trace the source or the recipient of dirty money.
Other banking standards have been tightened as well. Since 1989, individuals could no longer be granted banking licenses. The personal bank is a staple of some offshore centers and the perfect refuge for crooks seeking to hide their financial manipulations. "The person who wants a private little bank for his own purposes does not fit into what the Cayman Islands is about these days," says John Atkinson, who recently finished a two-year stint as bank inspector for the Caymans.
In fact, the Cayman Government has become much tougher in granting bank licenses. The power to issue or deny a license is the Government's main means of quality control because, although it monitors financial reports, it has no corps of inspectors to go into banks and pore over records. In 1988, for example, when American troops invaded Panama, several Panamanian banks tried to relocate in the Caymans to escape the turmoil. Their requests were rebuffed. And B.C.C.I., which set up its Georgetown operations in the mid-1970's, would not be allowed in today, says Atkinson, because it was a new bank set up to avoid comprehensive supervision by a central bank. "Today, the Caymans want to be a home only to established banks that have cut their teeth in other countries."
CITIBANK, BANK OF America, Deutsche Bank, Barclays and most every other well-known international bank are represented in the Cayman Islands for two key reasons. First, many institutions use the Caymans as a booking center. The second main attraction is the colony's private banking. Private banking is the most attentive service the banking profession can offer the world's wealthy -- individuals who typically have at least $5 million for banks to protect and nurture. The service is one-to-one, and often more than money is involved. A private banker may be hedging currencies in the morning for a Latin American industrialist, and in the afternoon arranging for the client's daughter to attend a private school in Switzerland.
Most major banks have private banking divisions, staffed by small teams of cosmopolitan specialists, whose notion of banking is a world away from tellers' windows and cash machines. Confidentiality is assured and discretion guaranteed. The rich, understandably, want to keep their funds in a tax-free jurisdiction like the Cayman Islands.
"But the main reason people put their money here is that it provides a safe haven for their nest eggs, beyond the reach of governments that may be politically unstable," explains an American private banker in Georgetown who spoke only on condition of anonymity. Many of his clients are from South America, Asia, the Far East and the Middle East. The accounts are in dollars, so if developing-country clients violated currency laws to get their money out they did it before they showed up on his doorstep. In the Caymans, his bank does not handle accounts for Americans. "It's not illegal, but there is no valid business reason for a U.S. citizen to be here."
Thousands of Americans think otherwise. Many of the companies registered in the Caymans are personal trusts set up by Americans. These trusts are another form of safe haven, insuring that creditors, spouses, business partners and other potential litigants can't get at your money.
Denis A. Kleinfeld, a Miami lawyer, has set up more than 200 offshore trusts, in the Cayman Islands and elsewhere, for doctors, dentists, lawyers, small-business owners and others in the past three years. Offshore trusts, in Kleinfeld's view, are merely a prudent hedge against the vagaries of the American legal system. "The hallmark of the American courts is chaos, havoc and distress," Kleinfeld contends. "You go in a pig and you come out a sausage. People are moving their assets offshore to protect themselves."
Lawyers in the business say the practice of setting up offshore trusts is aboveboard, as long as the offshore accounts are filed with the Internal Revenue Service. But for certain Americans, the temptation to keep their Cayman accounts from the I.R.S. is irresistible.
Ed Pankau, a Houston private investigator and a former I.R.S. special agent, has tracked down several tax-evasion cases through Georgetown, including a non-swimming accountant who smuggled cash into the Caymans in scuba tanks and a pornographer who deposited funds in a Cayman bank in the name of his 86-year-old mother-in-law.
"The Cayman Islands are the location of choice for the wise-guy businessman who wants to hide a few hundred thousand dollars," says Pankau, who is currently chasing a former Texas savings-and-loan executive who spirited funds away into Cayman bank accounts. "A lot of the S.&L. bad guys used the Caymans. It was close, and they could party while they hid their money there."
IN THEIR EFFORTS to monitor the global movement of funds through money havens, the United States has signed tax-information exchange agreements with several offshore countries and territories in the Caribbean, including Barbados, Jamaica, Bermuda and Grenada. In exchange for their cooperation, Washington has said it will encourage American investment in those places.
Under these agreements, the signatories would share information and assistance on matters like tax fraud. However, says Bruce Zagaris, a Washington lawyer who is an expert on international criminal law, "the key secrecy jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas refused to lift the veil."
Potentially the most significant piece of legislation to combat money laundering through offshore havens is the so-called Kerry amendment, a provision of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. It instructs the Federal Government to reach enforcement agreements with offshore havens, requiring them to record any United States dollar transactions exceeding $10,000. Such records would be made available to American law-enforcement officials.
Under the Kerry amendment, harsh penalties may be imposed against jurisdictions that do not comply, like cutting off their banks from the United States dollar-clearing and electronic-transfer system. For a dollar-based center like the Cayman Islands, that could amount to a financial death threat. But Washington has been slow to negotiate enforcement arrangements that might upset foreign governments and drive business away from American banks at a time when there are worries about the financial strength of the banking industry.
John Kerry, the Democratic Senator from Massachusetts who wrote the amendment, contends that the United States has the right to track the funds from the Caymans, a dollar haven, because that money eventually flows through the American payments system.
"Our Government has to decide whether it is serious about protecting the integrity of the American financial system," says Kerry, "and there should be penalties for these unregulated offshore centers that won't play by the rules." His approach is the most draconian, but in the wake of the B.C.C.I. scandal, the central banks of the major industrialized countries could well see it as their duty to prohibit their commercial banks from having branches in places that do not meet certain international regulatory standards.
In Georgetown, however, there seems to be little concern about such moves. Thomas Jefferson, the financial secretary, for one, doesn't believe that either the United States or Britain would ever take the kind of steps that would endanger the livelihood of the Cayman Islands. "I doubt you could impose any regulation that would really hurt us, short of a worldwide and permanent tax repeal."

HEADLINE: HOBOKEN JOURNAL;
How a 'Bunch of Amateurs' Learned to Fight City Hall

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

DATELINE: HOBOKEN

 BODY:
IN a church basement here on Washington Street is a scale model of the City of Hoboken -- its churches, stores, streets and houses reproduced in painstaking detail. Depicted along the eastern boundary, where the city meets the Hudson River, is a tree-lined waterfront park that stretches from one end of town to the other.
The model represents the collective vision of an eclectic mix of Hoboken residents -- artists, writers, homemakers, truck drivers, lawyers, business people -- that calls itself the Coalition for a Better Waterfront. It also represents the group's alternative to an official city plan to develop 32 acres of the city's most precious real estate. 
 For more than two years, the group has been a thorn in the side of city officials who favor the plan. With little more than spunk, dedication and seemingly boundless love for this mile-square city, the 150-member group has managed to thwart the officials' efforts at nearly every turn.
On Tuesday, voters will make their third trip to the polls to decide their waterfront's fate. This time, they will be asked to accept or reject the city's scaled-down version of an earlier plan. The revised plan, officials say, represents the last chance to recapture the economic potential of the waterfront.
 
'I Got Tired of Hearing That'
 "When I first moved here, people would say that you can't fight City Hall, and I just got tired of hearing that," said Augusta Przygoda, a Hoboken resident since 1976 and a founding member of the coalition.
The grass-roots movement began in 1989 when Patrick Pasculli ran for Mayor on a platform that included a plan to lease city-owned waterfront land to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for development. The plan called for construction of two public parks and 3.2 million square feet of commercial and residential space -- including a 33-story office tower and hotel -- on two 5.5-acre piers and four city blocks at the southern tip of Hoboken.
In that election, the citizens' group sponsored a referendum that would designate nearly all the area a parkland that could never be developed. Mr. Pasculli won the election, and the referendum was defeated. After that election, the newly formed coalition, which favored some development, started collecting signatures to block the Mayor from signing the agreement with the Port Authority. In the meantime, the authority made a $7 million payment to the city in anticipation of proceeding with the plan. The city quickly spent the $7 million.
"That money was used to bridge a severe budget deficit that had been created by a previous administration," Mayor Pasculli said. "We also used it to lower taxes and to improve municipal services."
Meanwhile, the coalition had managed to gather enough signatures to place the issue on the ballot. The city fought the effort, citing its belief that state law reserved for municipal officials the power to make land-use decisions.
The coalition filed a lawsuit to force the city to put the issue before the voters. The suit made it to the State Supreme Court, and the group won.
"We were fighting them in the Supreme Court and at the same time preparing for the election," Ms. Przygoda said. "We were all a bunch of amateurs. I still don't know how we pulled it off."
The court ordered that the referendum take place, and in July 1990, the coalition defeated the city plan by a scant 12 votes out of about 9,000 cast.
Officials were in a quandary. With the plan dead, the city would have to pay back the Port Authority the $7 million, which had been spent. So the officials tried again. They scaled back the original plan, retained the two parks and proposed development for just one of the two piers and two of the four blocks. The revised plan was placed on Tuesday's ballot.
The strategy angered the coalition.
Cassandra Wilday, a landscape architect who moved to Hoboken three years ago, said the city's revised plan appeared to be different from the original plan because it cut out half of the development area. "But it's really the same plan because we expect them to just paste the other half back on," she said.
In fact, the revised plan gives the Port Authority an option to develop the property that was taken out of the original plan. Mayor Pasculli said, however, that any construction on that portion must be in keeping with a plan to be developed by the Hoboken Waterfront Corporation, a community planning agency composed of city officials, planners and residents.
Ron Hine, the coalition's spokesman, said that rather than just oppose the city's revised plan, which addresses only a small portion of the waterfront, the coalition had decided to develop a citywide plan of its own.
"We wanted to put forth a positive vision for what could happen on the waterfront," said Mr. Hine, a potter who has lived in Hoboken since 1969.
The result of that vision now sits in the basement of the First Presbyterian Church on Washington Street and is etched in the minds of the 150 volunteers who stand on street corners passing out leaflets and registering voters for Tuesday's election.
"This represents 2,000 hours of volunteer time," Mr. Hine said, referring to the 12-foot-long scale model of the group's plan, designed by Craig Whitaker, an architect. The model depicts a tree-lined waterfront esplanade that runs the length of the city. Inland of the esplanade, the coalition plan calls for four million square feet of residential and commercial development and 24 acres of parks. The two 5.5-acre piers remain vacant.
Ms. Wilday, the landscape architect, said that Frank Sinatra Drive, the road along the waterfront, provided a clear delineation between the public area and private development in the coalition's plan.
The city plan, she said, which calls for high-rise buildings on the southernmost pier with a public park at the very tip, will send mixed signals to the public. "The buildings will take possession of the pier, and it won't be inviting to the public," Ms. Wilday said. "It will, in essence, privatize that piece of waterfront."
City officials, however, say the plan has one major shortcoming: the recession has made private-development money increasingly scarce. On the other hand, officials say, the Port Authority is prepared to commit $100 million to the city's plan if it is approved.
Peggy E. Thomas, director of the city's Department of Planning and Community Development, said the Port Authority would spend up to $25 million for building a park, rehabilitating a baseball field, demolishing vacant buildings on the waterfront and making other infrastructure improvements.
 
Jobs Expected for Residents
 The remaining $75 million, she said, will be invested in the development itself, which will help stabilize the tax rates. She also estimated that 10 to 15 percent of the permanent jobs generated at the office tower and hotel would go to Hoboken residents.
"People have to make hard economic choices in this day and age," she said. "You can't make those choices just based upon somebody's view out their window."
In an effort to avoid repeating the mistake made in the 1990 referendum, officials have mounted an aggressive campaign to bring the issue before the public. The coalition has countered by stepping up its campaign.
But all the political hoopla has apparently left many residents confused and anxious for something other than plans and models to take shape on the waterfront.
"I don't like a 'yes' or a 'no' plan," said Ian Gilmore, a resident for 10 years, referring to the choice voters will have to make on Tuesday. "This is the best piece of commercial property that New Jersey has to offer. I think there should be some compromise."

HEADLINE: All About/Sewing;
In the Gray 90's, Women Are Heading Back to the Bobbin

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
IN the early 1970's, the $4 billion home sewing industry unraveled. As women left home for offices and careers, sales of patterns, fabrics, sewing machines and notions plunged, and many pundits of popular behavior began predicting the demise of a longstanding American tradition.
But while more women than ever work, home sewing is enjoying something of a renaissance. The Simplicity Pattern Company, one of the three American pattern makers that control 95 percent of the $50 million or so market, sold 15 percent more patterns last year than in 1990, and the Singer Sewing Company, the world's largest seller of sewing machines, estimates that its sales in the United States grew 30 percent last year. 
 "As the employment numbers go, so goes home sewing," said Alan G. Millstein, publisher of the Fashion Network Report, which tracks the garment industry. "There are probably a lot of women pulling their sewing machines out of the closet where they've been for the last 20 years."
Most people in the industry credit the recession with the resurgence in home sewing. But many are hopeful that a more fundamental change in the American psyche will keep the industry buoyant long after the economy recovers.
"While the uptick is certainly reflective of the economy, I really feel this is part of the whole reaction to the self-indulgent 80's," said J. Nicholas Hahn, president and chief executive of Cotton Inc., the umbrella organization representing American cotton growers whose goods account for 59 percent of the fabric sold to home sewers. "People aren't throwing money around like they did five or six years ago. They've re-embraced basic values and aren't likely to give them up for awhile."
The biggest growth categories for pattern makers has been home decorating and children's clothing, testament to the aging baby boomer's new interest in home and family.
And styles of accepted office attire have relaxed. Women are no longer expected to wear a severely tailored suit adorned only with a demure strand of pearls or a scarf.Uniforms are out, individuality is in -- and a dress is far easier to sew than a jacket.
"Everybody has the same Liz Claiborne stuff, and who wants to go to the office and see everyone wearing the same thing?" said Pamela Hastings, director of consumer education for Singer.

 
 
Smarter Machines
They Can Memorize A Buttonhole
 Innovations in sewing machines have given the home sewing market a boost. What was once manual -- threading the needle, snipping thread -- is now electronic. "Machines are getting smarter so that the people operating them don't have to be," said Linda Griepentrog, editor of Sew News, a sewing magazine with about 230,000 subscribers. "If you tell them what kind of fabric you're using and what you're sewing, they make all the decisions about stitching for you."
The Quantum CXL -- at about $2,500, the Cadillac of Singer's line -- has a 300-stitch-plus built-in memory, allowing it to spew out anything from a bit of programmed embroidery to a buttonhole. Not enough? It will also, on command, recreate a pattern in mirror image.
Think the Izod signature embroidery has pizazz? New Home, a highly regarded Japanese-owned sewing machine manufacturer based in Teterboro, N.J., is about to introduce a device that will allow the sewer to scan a design in, say, a newspaper, magazine or family photo; commit it to the sewing-machine's memory; accept orders on within-the-design color changes and produce it on a garment. The device, named Memory Craft 8000, is so smart it knows when to stop and wait for you to change colors of thread.
"People are interested in embellishing garments to give them a unique, one-of-a-kind sort of look," said JoAnn Pugh, marketing manager of software at Bernina of America, a sewing machine maker.
The new technology also gives home sewers the ability to put a professional finish on garments. Electronic sewing machines can memorize a buttonhole, then produce identical copies, and can make various types of stitches without mechanical attachments.
Innovations in today's sewing machines have enticed new entrants into the market. Singer reports that five years ago, 30 percent of its North American customers were first-time purchasers, compared with 50 percent today. "It's not chic to spend $5,000 on your wardrobe any more," Ms. Hastings of Singer said. "It's almost like it's cool to say you made your own clothing."
 
Pattern Makers
Stressing How Little Time Is Needed
 The pattern industry is emerging from a decade of upheaval, when takeover artists like Carl Icahn, who made a bid for Simplicity, and Reginald Lewis, who bought McCall's for $1 million in cash and $19 million in high-yield debt, were attracted to the high pre-tax profits pattern companies generated.
All three of the major pattern companies -- Simplicity, McCall's and Butterick -- were acquired in leveraged buyouts. The ownership of Simplicity and McCall's changed hands multiple times, loading them with debt. McCall's is just emerging from bankruptcy, and Simplicity, which started the 80's with $100 million in spare cash, entered the 90's with $100 million in debt.
Butterick, once the nation's smallest major pattern manufacturer, was bought by its management in 1983, and now controls 32 percent of the domestic pattern market, according to the National Purchase Diary, a market research firm.
Butterick was the first to attempt to decrease its dependence on apparel patterns. Capitalizing on its sophistication as a printer, the company acquired small greeting card companies and has increased its presence on newsstands with seven magazines that generate income as well as pattern sales. Simplicity and McCall's each publish a similar magazine.
"Five years ago, we started programming ourselves to go down in pattern sales and planned a strategy to offset that with new businesses," said John E. Lehmann, chairman, president and chief executive of Butterick. "But we got luck and pattern sales climbed slightly, and we still have the other businesses as insurance."
The pattern companies have simplified and streamlined their patterns to save their customers time. McCall's sells a pattern for a blazer that can be constructed in four hours, and Simplicity has what it calls a 2 Hour Express Collection.
"The perception of sewing is that it's time-consuming, but that isn't always the case," said Judy Raymond, senior vice president of marketing and new business at Simplicity. "So in many cases, the only difference in patterns today is that we're telling the consumer precisely what kind of time investment it's going to be."

 
 
More Than Clothes
Capturing the Home Spruce-It-Up Craze
 Home decorating is hot. For example, Butterick's best-selling pattern in January was for a baseball cap ('tis the season), but second, third and fourth places were taken up by curtains.
People in the industry note that the straight-line sewing of curtains and pillows is far easier and faster than, for example, a dress's curves, tucks -- and complicated fittings. "Windows don't gain weight," explained Simplicity's Ms. Raymond.
Moreover, people have been moving far less in the last five or six years than in the past, and new curtains, slipcovers and other decorative touches spruce up an old house.
Pattern makers are also dipping into the crafts business with patterns and plans that don't require sewing. Simplicity offers a Halloween costume, for example, that can be assembled with fusable tape and an iron in less than two hours.
McCall's Creates, a new series of $4 leaflets, shows how to make, among other things, woven placemats and dolls from handkerchiefs. Simplicity even offers instructions on how to build a birdhouse.
 
 
 
EVERYONE LOVES A SERGER
 While manufacturers have wrought a revolution in sewing machines, it is the serger, or overlock, machine that has truly revolutionized home sewing. Called the microwave of the business, a serger is used to give seams and other parts of a garment the same neat finish as commercially produced clothes.
The sewing machine makers introduced sergers at retail -- with price tags of $400 to $1,000 -- about seven years ago. Complements to the basic machines, sergers weave stitches around an edge of fabric that might otherwise ravel. As they go along, they also trim away excess material. In addition to giving homemade clothing a more finished look, overlock machines hit speeds of 1,500 stitches a minute, compared to between 800 and 1,000 stitches regular sewing machines are capable of. A pair of leggings can be completed in less than an hour.
Almost half of Sew News's 230,000 subscribers own a serger, according to Linda Turner Griepentrog, the magazine's editor. In fact, PJS Publications Inc., which publishes her magazine, decided to launch Serger Update, a newsletter about the machine and its capabilities.

 CORRECTION:
The "All About" column last Sunday, about home sewing products, misstated the American market share in patterns, as reported by the National Purchase Diary, a market research group. The group said that in 1991, McCall's held 32.4 percent of the market, Simplicity had 32 percent and Butterick's share was 27.7 percent.

HEADLINE: ALBANY'S LEADERS ANNOUNCE ACCORD ON STATE'S BUDGET

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 28

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the leaders of the New York State Legislature announced tonight that they had reached an accord on a roughly $31 billion spending plan for the fiscal year that begins on Wednesday.
The agreement appeared to end the colossal five-month fight over the budget, which Governor Cuomo said was the obstacle that kept him from running for President. 
 At a joint news conference in the Governor's office, Mr. Cuomo and the leaders, Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin and Senate Majority Leader Ralph J. Marino, said the agreement meant they were "virtually assured" of having all budget bills passed by Wednesday, April 1, the start of the 1992-93 fiscal year.
 
No New Aid to New York City
 It would mark the first time in eight years that the Legislature managed to produce a budget before the legal deadline. For the last seven years, the budget was passed days and sometimes weeks after April 1. Last year it was a record nine weeks late.
Aides to Mr. Cuomo and the leaders said that much like the budget plans proposed by the Governor in November and January, the agreement reached tonight includes virtually no increases for most local-aid programs, including aid to New York City. It also puts new limits on some services in the Medicaid program and imposes hundreds of millions of dollars in new fees on hospitals and other health-care providers to keep the budget in balance.
Unlike last year, when Mr. Cuomo and the leaders made a last-minute deal to raise the state income tax to produce the revenue they needed to close the budget, this time, aides said, there were no major surprises in this plan.
 
What About Candidate Cuomo?
 But the Governor and the leaders repeatedly refused to provide any details of the plan in their joint appearance, about 9:30 P.M. And Mr. Cuomo cut short the news conference, joking that he and the leaders had to watch the overtime period of the N.C.A.A. East Regional final between Duke and Kentucky. Duke won, 104-103.
Asked later in a telephone interview whether, with the budget settled, he might now consider joining Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California in the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination, Mr. Cuomo said he would be "thinking exclusively" about the budget until the Senate and Assembly passed it.
Asked if he would think about running for President after the Legislature passed a budget, the Governor said he could not answer. "It's like saying, 'If I had a little bread and I had a little cheese, then I'd have some bread and cheese.' "
Although the plan includes no increases in any of the state's broad-based taxes -- the sales tax and personal and corporate incomes taxes -- it does include increases of hundreds of millions of dollars in fees that hospitals, nursing homes and insurers would be obligated to pay to the state.
Lobbyists for those groups are likely to wage a ferocious last-minute attempt to defeat those fees, and if unsuccessful, are likely to pass them on to consumers.
Similarly, while most of the other new revenue sources agreed to will be felt indirectly, some, like an accelerated collection schedule for sales taxes on petroleum products, will be more apparent. Business groups estimated the new schedule would force them to add a penny or more to the retail price of a gallon of gasoline.
 
How Talks Began
 The legislative leaders dropped plans to allow video lottery games in bars and clubs.
Mayor David N. Dinkins may campaign strongly against passage of the budget plan agreed to tonight. He has urged lawmakers to "just vote no" on any budget that did not restore many of what he said totaled $100 million in aid cuts.
Mr. Cuomo said that Mr. Dinkins was unlikely to be satisfied by the agreement, but that its timely passage was critical. And the Governor suggested that part of the Mayor's unhappiness was politically expendient.
"No mayor who wants to please his or her constituency will admit to any satisfaction with this budget," Mr. Cuomo said.
Mr. Dinkins's press secretary, Leland T. Jones, said that the city had not received full details of the budget agreement, but that he was skeptical about what it might contain.
"What we've heard is that the agreement in Albany is tentative, tenuous and somewhat troublesome," he said. "As the saying goes in football, you don't get credit for the touchdown if you have the ball at the 20-yard line with third and goal to go."
Mr. Jones also said that having taken $300 million in cuts in state aid, New York City could not bear any more. "We're not sure if this agreement holds us harmless for any more cuts," he said. "If we have to face additional cuts, we're obviously going to have to look at some reductions in services and increased costs to our residents."
The struggle to reach this particular budget accord dates back to early November, when Mr. Cuomo's budget director, Patrick J. Bulgaro, revealed that the state was facing a deficit of at least $500 million in the existing $30 billion budget, a shortfall that eventually grew to $875 million.
At the same time, the Cuomo administration announced that even more severe problems were looming for the 1992-93 fiscal year, which begins on Wednesday, because of declines in projected tax revenues and growing demands on the budgets for Medicaid and welfare in the face of the recession.
That led Mr. Cuomo to propose that he and the legislative leaders undertake a singular approach to solving the budget woes, essentially tackling both years' budget problems at once. His plan involved drafting a 17-month budget that would carry the state through April 1993.
 
Political Baggage
 But whatever the fiscal merits, the plan became weighed down with heavy political baggage: Had it worked, it would have given Mr. Cuomo the clear advantage of freeing him to hit the Presidential campaign trail. Republicans initially said they were skeptical of the proposal, even though later -- after Mr. Cuomo had pulled out of the Presidential race -- they became its chief proponents.
In any event, negotiations ultimately collapsed. And even more modest attempts to solve the smaller $875 million deficit failed, which forced the state to borrow more than $500 million to tide it through the year and which caused two major Wall Street bond-rating agencies to lower the state's credit rating to the second-lowest of any state in the nation.
Mr. Cuomo, meanwhile, grew increasingly agitated with what he depicted as the Legislature's inertia, and he frequently lashed out at both parties, saying they would pay the price if they failed to come together to produce a budget.
"If they don't do it, they're dead politically," he told reporters a few days after announcing on Dec. 20 that he would not run for President. "They're going down. Why? Because they're going to have such trouble doing the budget in daylight, in April, May, June, July, they're going to get killed when they are revealed to the world."
Still, once he reverted to a traditional 12-month budget proposal, Mr. Cuomo said it was imperative that the budget be completed by the legal deadline, as opposed to last year, when he and the Legislature were nine weeks late. Delay, the Governor said, would run the risk of a further decline in the state's credit rating. A late budget would be "disastrous" for New Yorkers, he said, because it could demote some state borrowing to "junk bond status."

HEADLINE: Employers Winning Wide Leeway to Cut Medical Insurance Benefits

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
A rapidly growing number of victims of cancer, AIDS and other serious illnesses are discovering that under recent court interpretations of a law that was originally intended to protect employees' benefits, their insurance coverage can evaporate when they need it most.
The recent Federal court rulings have given employers that now act as their own insurers wide leeway to cut back on existing coverage -- or to skimp on coverage in the first place. These "self-insured" employers, a large majority of companies from giant corporations to an increasing number of smaller businesses, have been exempted from state insurance laws governing what ailments insurance companies must cover. For example, many states require coverage for alcoholism, mental health problems and intensive care for infants with birth defects. 
 At the same time, a Supreme Court decision has made it much harder for patients under all kinds of health insurance plans to sue to get benefits they say have been unfairly denied.
 
AIDS Coverage Slashed
 Among the most striking cases in which employees found they had insurance in name only were those of Richard Owens in Atlanta and John McGann in Houston. After Mr. Owens began filing thousands of dollars in AIDS claims with his employer, a furniture chain called Storehouse, the company cut its maximum lifetime benefit for AIDS to $25,000 from $1 million. Similarly, Mr. McGann's employer, H & H Music, a Texas retail group, reduced its $1 million maximum to $5,000 for AIDS cases.
A Federal district court in Atlanta and an appeals court in New Orleans ruled last year that the companies had every right to do so. If they had bought their coverage from an insurance company, state laws in both Georgia and Texas would have required that the original AIDS coverage be continued.
Under a string of earlier court rulings, self-insured employers have been exempted from hundreds of state health-care laws. Massachusetts, for example, requires insurers to provide up to 30 days of hospitalization a year for alcoholism treatment. But A.T.& T. employees are eligible for only five to seven days of detoxification in a hospital and a lifetime limit of two 30-day hospital stays, when approved by company medical experts. A.T.& T. also pays for outpatient alcoholism treatment.
 
Separation of Sick From Well
 Although six states now require coverage of in-vitro fertilization to help women become pregnant, General Electric, like many self-insured employers, does not pay for that treatment.
In effect, the court rulings and the health plans that take advantage of them are another manifestation of a system of private health insurance in which the sick are increasingly separated from the well. That lowers the insurance costs of the healthy but leaves more of the sick with little or no protection.
"We're very concerned," said John Rother, public policy director for the American Association of Retired Persons, which had supported Mr. McGann. "It's not just AIDS. This kind of ruling could be applied to any chronic disease, like Alzheimer's, which strikes some people in their 50's. We seem to just have insurance for those people who don't need it."
 
Avoiding State Rules
 The number of Americans affected by the rulings is rising as more employers, concerned about upwardly spiraling medical costs, choose to act as their own insurer.
To be sure, many of these employers continue to offer a comprehensive benefits package that often exceeds what most states require. They say they act as their own insurer not to cut back on coverage but to economize by paying less to insurance companies and averting the costs of complying with varying state laws. They are also exempted from state insurance taxes and assessments, and they say they can slow the rise in costs by supervising the quality and duration of care.
But others, desperate to lower medical-cost increases, have cut back. Many self-insured employers are eliminating or reducing coverage for expensive treatments like care for infertility and alcoholism, which insurance companies are required to offer in many states, said Judith Mazo, research director with the Segal Company, a benefits consulting firm.
Nearly two-thirds of the nation's employers are now providing their own coverage, up from fewer than half only four years ago, according to a survey of 2,000 employers last year by the A. Foster Higgins consulting firm. The proportion of self-insured smaller employers, with 100 or fewer workers, grew even faster, more than doubling to 23 percent last year from only 9 percent in 1988.
Many self-insured employers have been able to reduce their coverage under the courts' interpretations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as Erisa. Enacted in 1974, the law was intended to guarantee employee pension rights by establishing Federal control over benefits.
But the courts have interpreted a broad but little-noticed provision of the law to limit state authority over health benefits as well.
Former Government officials who helped draft the law said health plans were not even discussed when a sweeping Federal pre-emption of state benefit laws was added. Erisa did not spell out Federal rules to replace the state laws.
The American Medical Association, the American Association of Retired Persons, the state attorneys general, and several state insurance commissioners support proposals in Congress to plug the exemptions from state laws. As James S. Todd, executive vice president of the American Medical Association, put it, "The sad part is that somebody who thinks they are covered by their employer suddenly discovers that they are not."
But the Bush Administration and many employers strongly oppose changing Erisa, and the insurance industry even supports extending the Federal exemption to all employers. Without Erisa, they say, insurance costs would rise even faster as insurers would be forced to comply with varying state requirements, and even more employers would give up health coverage.
Even more small businesses would be exempted from state insurance laws under an Administration proposal last month, which would reward companies that join new purchasing groups to buy coverage.
Worries about the dependability of health insurance, which Mr. Bush cited in his State of the Union speech, were hardly assuaged by the McGann and Owens rulings. Citing a 1985 appeals court ruling that employer decisions on what benefits to offer should be determined by "forces in the marketplace" unless contradicted by a Federal law, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said in November that under the Erisa law a self-insured employer has "an absolute right to alter the terms of medical coverage available to plan beneficiaries."
Mark A. Huvard, a lawyer for H & H, Mr. McGann's employer, said the company had to "limit its exposure on things that are exotic" or else drop basic health coverage for several hundred other employees. Lawyers for the estate of Mr. McGann, who died last June, recently petitioned for a Supreme Court review.
Judith O'Brien, a lawyer for Mr. Owens's employer, said Storehouse could not find an insurance company willing to provide reinsurance for costs above $25,000 for AIDS cases. Self-insured employers often hedge their risks by buying reinsurance, which covers costs above an agreed level. A Federal appeals court in Atlanta heard arguments in the case last month.
Bob Griss, a United Cerebral Palsy Associations researcher, cited Government surveys indicating that 81 million Americans under age 65 have the kinds of chronic ailments, including cancer, multiple sclerosis and diabetes, that he said could put them at risk of losing coverage.
 
Loses Case Against Dow
 James C. Cathey Jr. was a purchasing agent in Houston with the Dow Chemical Company when his wife, Bette Lou, contracted muscular sclerosis and had to use a wheelchair. He said that Dow, which was self-insured, forced him into early retirement in 1983 and two years later stopped paying for nursing care ordered by Mrs. Cathey's doctor. He sued Dow unsuccessfully in Federal and state courts, which decided that Erisa protects the company's plan from such challenges.
Janet Van Alsten, Dow's benefits planning manager, said that Mrs. Cathey was eligible only for skilled nursing that would monitor her disease and give medication, but not for such daily nursing needs as helping her bathe and eat. "Even if Erisa didn't apply, we wouldn't have to pay a dime," she said.
But Mark Kincaid, Mrs. Cathey's lawyer, said that her health plan specifically covered nursing prescribed by a physician. "If the Erisa exemption had not existed," he said, "we would have won in state court, where insurance policy language that is unclear is construed in favor of the patient."
State officials want to remove the regulatory exemptions. "Erisa has become a tool for employers who wish to avoid their obligations under state law," the National Association of Attorneys General said last year.
Complicating the problems of people complaining that coverage has been unfairly curtailed, the Supreme Court has discouraged lawsuits against insurers by deciding that patients cannot collect punitive damages allowed under state laws. They may collect only the price of the treatments found to have been unfairly denied.
That decision came in a precedent-setting Erisa case involving the Pilot Life Insurance Company of Greensboro, N.C. The Supreme Court held in 1987 that health insurers are exempt from the state laws that permit juries to assess punitive damages for improperly denied medical claims.
 
'Take a Hike'
 Because of the Pilot ruling, John Garamendi, the California insurance commissioner, said his department could do little about the 30,000 health insurance complaints it receives each year.
"The insurance companies tell us to take a hike," he said. "The self-insured employers don't even bother to answer our phone calls."
Critics of the Erisa law say the Pilot Life ruling makes it very difficult for a family that had spent its savings on medical bills to sue an insurer. Without the possibility of punitive damages, they said, most lawyers will not take these cases.
Nick J. Canata's 12-year-old daughter, Corinne, is blind and has to take growth hormones and other expensive drugs for medical problems she has had since birth. Mr. Canata, a farmer in Earlimart, Calif., near Fresno, said an insurance broker persuaded him to buy coverage from a farmer insurance trust without telling him that the trust was self-insured. When Corinne's expenses snowballed, Mr. Canata said, the trust canceled his coverage and would not provide a conversion policy to continue her benefits.
William M. Shernoff, a Claremont lawyer who took Corinne's case despite the limitations on his potential compensation, said the trust was able to claim exemption, under Erisa, from state laws that would require an insurer to offer her an individual policy. He took the case to a Federal court, where the potential recovery was limited, and the family would be left without insurance for her heavy continuing needs.
Representative Howard L. Berman, a California Democrat, and Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, are sponsoring bills to overturn the Pilot Life ruling. Business groups say the bills would primarily benefit plaintiffs' lawyers, and the Bush Administration has threatened to veto them.

James C. Cathey Jr. sued the Dow Chemical Company unsuccessfully after he was forced into early retirement from his job as a purchasing agent in 1983 when his wife, Bette Lou, contracted multiple sclerosis. Two years later, Dow stopped paying for the nursing care Mrs. Cathey's doctor ordered (F. Carter Smith for The New York Times); John McGann, who died last June, sued when he learned that his employer, H & H Music in Texas, reduced its $1 million maximum in payments to $5,000 for AIDS cases. Lawyers for Mr. McGann's estate have recently petitioned for a Supreme Court review. (Pam Francis for The New York Times) (pg. 24)

HEADLINE: Networking;
Keeping the Costs Down When Office Hopping

BYLINE: By STEPHEN C. MILLER

 BODY:
Connecting a local area network in small branch office to the home office or another branch office can be expensive if it isn't planned carefully. A major problem with this process, called internetworking, is controlling the volume -- and cost -- of traffic over expensive long distance phone lines.
In most LAN operating systems, packets of data are sent along the network until they reach their intended destinations. Much of that data involves requests for access to expensive shared resources, such tasks as producing something on a color laser printer. 
 In some cases, the data might travel quite a distance before getting to the right place. A print request might originate with a user in Chicago, but the only color printer is in New York. If there are three other offices on the network between Chicago and New York, each would get the print request, reject it and send it on. A solution is a device called a router attached to the network. It acts as a traffic cop and sends data to the proper destination via the most efficient route.
Even with a traditional router, the amount of network traffic can still swamp a remote LAN connected via a regular phone line, since the phone line can handle only a small amount of data at any one moment. A T1 line, a dedicated high-speed phone service, eases the problem, but it can add significantly to the cost of servicing the remote LAN. One solution is to put additional routing power within the LAN itself by installing a router circuit board and software on the network's server computer. The local router decides what to do with outward bound data before it leaves the local network.
"For those companies committed to internetworking and running a single network operating system, like Novell's Netware, router cards are the way to go," said Paul Callahan of Forrester Research Inc., a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass.
Eicon Technology of Montreal goes beyond the traditional with Router for Netware and its accompanying software and circuit board, known as the Eiconcard, to speed data to and from the remote LAN. The system acts as a mini-router by figuring out which router on the network would handle a particular user request. It then passes the request to the appropriate router, using the most efficient, or cheapest, connection on the network.
Router for Netware comes in two versions. One is for packet switched commercial data networks that use a communications protocol known as X.25. (Packet switched networks are akin to long distance lines for computer data.) The other version is for point-to-point connections using private phone lines. Both models retail for $995. The Eiconcard for each PC retails for $1,095.

HEADLINE: Lighting Russia's Entrepreneurial Spirit

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
ARE the citizens of Moscow and St. Petersburg ready to be transformed into entrepreneurs? The wives of two Russian diplomats say the answer is yes and are helping lay the groundwork for entrepreneurial centers across Russia that would be patterned on one in Purchase.
The wives, Natalia B. Lozinsky and Elena V. Ilitchev, know something about what it takes to be an entrepreneur because they studied how to start a business in a 10-week course at the Entrepreneurial Center at Manhattanville College in Purchase. 
 One recipient of their help now is the director of the Entrepreneurial Center, Marge Lovero, who is leaving Friday on a two-week fact-finding trip to Russia. She will be accompanied by Clifford Schorer, the volunteer president of the Entrepreneurial Council, a nonprofit group affiliated with the United Nations that was begun in 1990 to foster development.
Mrs. Lozinsky's husband, Valentin, is Russia's First Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations. Mrs. Ilitchev's husband, Alexander, is the political counselor at the Russian Federation Mission in Manhattan.
"What is happening is very exciting," Mrs. Lozinsky said in a meeting earlier this month at the Russian Mission in Manhattan. "It started simply, with a few women."
This week's trip is under the auspices of the Volunteer Development Council for United Nations Delegations, a group whose goal is fostering volunteerism to stimulate business worldwide.
Mrs. Lovero and Mr. Schorer will be accompanied by Russian volunteers selected by Mrs. Lozinsky and Mrs. Ilitchev, who will assist in setting up meetings with people in business and government.
In addition to Moscow and St. Petersburg, the group will visit Kaluga, an hour and a half by car from Moscow; Barnaul in Siberia, and Ulyanovsk, 1,000 east of Moscow. In each city, they will explore the possibilities of setting up centers for entrepreneurs similar to the one in Purchase.
"Elena and I met Marge Lovero through Toby Anthony, who is the acting president of the Volunteer Development Council," Mrs. Lozinsky said. "We started talking about the problems that ordinary citizens have; not those higher-ups running steel plants, but average people who are finally making the adjustment from working in a centrally planned economy to a free economy. We had no guidelines."
Mrs. Lozinsky, a political analyst who has observed capitalism in America for 15 years, said she was especially intrigued with the entrepreneurial businesses she has seen here.
"We are on our fourth assignment to the United States," she said, speaking of herself and her husband. "We lived in Rye for several years and liked it very much; our son was born there." The couple now live in Manhattan.
"Now, when Russian society is being reshaped," she said, "I thought it was time for people like myself to make a grass-roots effort, to help able, mainstream Russian people to get into what is, for us, a new economic world."
It was to better understand the skills needed to become a successful entrepreneur that Mrs. Lozinsky and Mrs. Ilitchev, who is a medical doctor, decided to enroll in the course at Manhattanville.
 
'You Call It Hands-On'
 "It is not like any course I have taken," Mrs. Ilitchev said. "We got so much practical information -- here you call it hands-on experience -- from the lecturers, who were all entrepreneurs themselves."
Mrs. Ilitchev lives in the Russian compound in Riverdale and sends her two sons to P.S. 81 in the Bronx. "We also got to know the other students in the course well," she said. "At the end of each session, we would stay and talk and learn from each other."
What was especially interesting, Mrs. Lozinsky said, was the spark of creativity she observed in everyone in the program. "It convinced me of something I already knew: that universal human qualities are all the same," she said.
"A creative spark is what makes people come alive. As a people, Russians are very creative. And understanding that a business is also a creation is a concept that is very much attuned to the Russian soul."
 
'The Time Is Right'
 The idea of opening entrepreneurial centers across Russia is very pragmatic, Mr. Schorer said. "The time is right simply because the Russian Government is aware that the institutions they now have in place are not adequate for the future as a platform of business. I believe they are going to nurture entrepreneurs in every possible way."
Mrs. Lovero described this week's trip as an initial effort.
"Cliff and I are making this first exploratory trip in order to find out how we can best help small business people in Russia," she said. "The plan is for us to go back to Russia in September with Mrs. Lozinsky and some of the instructors at the center, plus a volunteer group of entrepreneurs."
The plan at that time, she added, is to hold a two-day conference in each of the five cities, "with the hope of starting Russian-staffed entrepreneurial centers in all of them."
The project is receiving only private financing, not government funds. "We hope our efforts will be like the pebbles thrown in the water, expanding in ever-widening circles," Mrs. Lozinsky said.
"We know there is a lot of desire to learn how to be your own boss in Russia," she added. "Skilled people there, including professionals, know that they have an opportunity now to implement their skills. But they want to know the right and the best way to operate in a market-driven economy, which is new to us."
The conferences in September, Mrs. Lozinsky said, are expected to attract "an audience made up of 'brokers,' who might be manufacturers, professionals such as accountants or dentists, and people interested in starting service businesses."
Even former black marketeers would be welcome, she said. "They are the one group that already knows the basics of entrepreneurship."
She sees the conferences attracting "an eclectic group -- what people have in common is that they are eager to adapt to new ideas."
This interest has already been recognized by the new Russian Government, Mrs. Lozinsky said. "There has been an Association of Entrepreneurs formed recently in Moscow. It is headed by Arkadiy Volsky, who is a high Government official and a former representative of Parliament.
"But our Entrepreneurial Centers are designed for the people who are, so far, left out. We will deal with them on a one-to-one basis and they will learn such practical things as I did, such as how to get financing, promote sales, price products and services."
Mr. Schorer, who heads his own company, Express Office Products in Atlanta, said he wants to attract American corporations to participate in the entrepreneurial project.
"What better time for American corporations with vision to establish an identity for themselves for future business dealings in Russia?" he asked. "Russia has 260 million educated consumers, and that's a very big potential market for American goods and services."
Mrs. Lozinsky's enthusiasm for the entrepreneurial program has been contagious, Mrs. Lovero said.
"So much so," she said, that the wife of the Danish Under Secretary of the United Nations, Barbara Hansen, "who is Polish by birth, has now begun to take our course on Wednesday evenings."
"Mrs. Hansen will be going back to Europe in late June," Mrs. Lovero added, "and says she intends to go to Poland and discuss what she has learned about entrepreneurship."

WAKE UP LITTLE SUSIE
Single Pregnancy and Race Before Roe v. Wade.
By Rickie Solinger.
324 pp. New York: Routledge. $25. 
 WE have come a long way, we like to think, since Hester Prynne had to wear a scarlet A. Yet much closer to our time, children born outside marriage were openly called "bastards," with "ILLEGITIMATE" stamped on their birth certificates.
But how far have we progressed? Even in our more enlightened era, most Americans feel that procreation should be confined to married couples. Single motherhood is still a flashpoint for social and sexual morality, as well as a means of exacerbating tensions of race and class and gender. Extramarital pregnancies and births raise an array of vexing issues. Whether abortion should remain an option often leads the list. But there are also worrisome aspects to adoption, and passions rise over having to pay taxes for public assistance.
With the dismantling of Roe v. Wade certain to continue, and reversal a possibility, states will be free to rescind the abortion alternative. What will be the consequence? During the 1980's, an average of 1.57 million pregnancies were terminated each year, or some 424 abortions for every 1,000 live births. Approximately 1.3 million abortions, about 82 percent, were performed on single women. These figures seem fated to change as access to abortion gets restricted. Yet quite apart from policies on abortion, out-of-wedlock births have risen without remission for the past 40 years.
"Wake Up Little Susie: Single Pregnancy and Race Before Roe v. Wade" details the treatment accorded unmarried girls and women who became pregnant from approximately 1945 to the middle 1960's, which brought both the Great Society and the sexual revolution. Rickie Solinger, now a visiting scholar at the University of Colorado, Boulder, tells a grim and compelling story. It is an avowedly feminist analysis, showing how their possession of "the reproductive capacity has contributed to the oppression of women in the United States in variable ways." The major variable Ms. Solinger has chosen to stress is race. She deals only briefly with contrasting class reactions to premarital pregnancies and births, and the book does not distinguish the experiences of teen-agers from those of more mature women. Still, she has a persuasive case for making race her key division. The result is a stimulating study that should have a wide audience.
Whether or not beliefs about race have really changed, people spoke more candidly in those postwar years. Most members of the white race saw themselves as a superior strain, which meant more was expected of them, particularly if they were single women. Those who became pregnant were held morally culpable for having got themselves into "trouble," as if their seducers or traducers were in no way responsible. They were deemed a disgrace to their race, with redemption only possible by displaying remorse. The expected penance was to give the baby up for adoption, since sex prior to marriage was sufficient evidence of unfitness for motherhood. These strictures were especially stern in maternity homes for white girls, to which Ms. Solinger devotes several doleful chapters. Some were plainly places of incarceration, with high fences and locked gates. As many as 20 girls could be crowded into dormitory rooms, with a single drawer for personal possessions. Mail was routinely opened and read; and at most homes, only two afternoons were allocated for trips into town, always "under supervision."
Ms. Solinger also shows how experts in the 1950's and 60's held the view that "every unmarried mother is to some degree a psychiatric problem." A New York University study found such women to be "overtly dominant, aggressive, narcissistic and bitterly hostile." To want to raise children on their own showed they were "conflicted about their masculine and feminine drives" or were acting out a "parthenogenic, puberal fantasy." Unwed mothers should also be monitored for neglecting their babies, it was believed, with authorities empowered to take the children away and arrange for their adoption.
Attitudes toward black women were more ambiguous. To start, Ms. Solinger tells us, black unwed pregnancies and births were seen as "the product of uncontrolled sexual indulgence." Some Southern legislators called for compulsory sterilization after a specified number of children, although no state actually passed such a law. Yet even as late as 1964, Theodore H. White could allude to the "pattern of mating and breeding" in "zoological tenements." But despite condescension and worse, black women were seen as naturally suited for motherhood, so no efforts were made to remove their children. On the contrary, in one graphic case cited by Ms. Solinger, when a black woman in Chicago sought to give her baby up for adoption she was charged with desertion. On the whole, though, the social costs were low, since most black out-of-wedlock children were absorbed by extended families, and their mothers were expected to take jobs as chambermaids or domestic servants.
These attitudes began to change with the expansion of the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program. In the Great Society ideology, single women were as entitled as married women to remain at home with their children, even if at public expense. But that outlook did not last. The "welfare mother" soon became a target, even though stipends were -- and are -- below the poverty line. One criticism was that in the past, women usually applied for public assistance because of desertion or divorce; however, in recent years most of those joining the aid program have been women who embarked upon motherhood without benefit of marriage. The Family Security Act of 1987, a pet project of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, aims at forcing women on welfare to find work. Little is heard any longer about how preschoolers might benefit from having a mother at home, and states like New Jersey are considering banning welfare payments for subsequent children.
AT what may be the end of the Roe era, is Ms. Solinger's racial emphasis still valid? Where abortion is concerned, black women have used that option as much as their white peers. According to the most recent Public Health Service figures, of unmarried white women who become pregnant, 1,130 choose abortion for every 1,000 who give birth; among their black counterparts, the ratio is 777 abortions for each 1,000 births. However, when economic levels are factored in, black women actually use abortion at a greater rate. With births there is also an increasing convergence. When unwed mothers of both races have babies, it is usually a conscious choice. Few have been forced to do so by lack of money or clinics in their areas. Moreover, almost all now opt to keep their children. The latest study by Planned Parenthood shows that only 3.2 percent of white women and 1.1 percent of black women give up their out-of-wedlock infants. Indeed, even as early as the 1960's, Ms. Solinger found, "white girls were keeping their babies as part of a rational life plan."
In 1950, only 1.7 percent of white babies were born to unmarried women, compared with 16.8 percent of black babies, or 10 times the figure. But by 1989, the most recent reporting year, the respective rates for the races had risen to 16.1 percent and 66 percent. While two-thirds of black births now occur outside of wedlock, the accompanying fact is that the proportion of black births has declined from 10 to 4 times that for whites. Indeed, the white rate is now where the black figure was 40 years ago. So even in an age of racial division, we may be coming closer to a consensus where sexual behavior is concerned.
And what about the book's title? At no place in the text does Ms. Solinger allude to this Everly Brothers song, let alone explain why she took it for her title. True, it was released in 1957, about midway through the period she is covering. The song, which I have played several dozen times, seems simply to be about two teen-agers who are getting home very late from a movie date. Sex is hardly hinted at; pregnancy certainly isn't. But perhaps I have not deconstructed it properly. Readers who want to try their hand can find the record in the "oldies" section.
 
 
 
THE POWER OF GUILT
 "Wake Up Little Susie" takes its title from a song by the Everly Brothers about a young couple in a quandary about how to explain Susie's tardy return home to her parents after a date.
"The words of that song are about the imputation of guilt, which was a key component in unwed pregnancy at the time," Rickie Solinger, the book's author, said in a telephone interview from her home in Boulder, Colo.
"This young girl thinks her association with imagined sexuality will doom her, and this book is really about the ways society and culture stigmatize girls in very damaging ways."
Although women's reproductive rights today seem more imperiled than ever, with the Supreme Court poised to review Roe v. Wade and a growing number of states taking steps to impede access to abortion, Ms. Solinger does not believe society will ever again treat unwed mothers as it once did.
"You can't reconfigure the social structure of a culture simply by changing laws," she said, "and unwed pregnancy today is regarded much differently than it was before 1965."
Instead, she said, she hopes her book demonstrates the ways in which society uses women's bodies to satisfy political ends.
Ms. Solinger says she is "on a mission to reveal the history of women in the pre-Roe-v.-Wade era, because I think it's very important to understand the horrors unwed, fertile women faced when their lives and their children's were used to fulfill society's agenda." -- STEPHANIE STROM

HEADLINE: As Money Gets Tighter, Tax Collectors Get Tougher

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
IN the first two weeks of March, Bridgeport issued almost 60 tax warrants, which allow it to attach the salaries and bank accounts of people who owe municipal taxes. By contrast, the city issued only about 15 such warrants in the previous five years. The city's finance director, Richard V. Robinson, said the accelerated collection efforts would continue, and the number of warrants "could be in the thousands by the time we're done."
As the recession continues to squeeze their finances, municipalities throughout the state are getting tough with taxpayers. In addition to issuing warrants, towns and cities are expediting foreclosures and sales of tax liens, even turning delinquent accounts over to private collection agencies. 
 "When you're desperate, you look for new ways to do things," Mr. Robinson said.
Every town has had problems with collections this year, said the executive director of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, Joel Cogen. Towns that historically had a 99 percent collection rate have seen it drop to 97 percent, he said, while those that have collected 95 percent in a good year might be down to 92 percent today. The tax collector in Brookfield, Theresa A. York, said she had moved up by seven months the schedule for foreclosures. "This is what we need to do, because the town needs the money," she said. "Cash flow is becoming a serious problem." Hamden's tax collector, Barbara J. Tito, said, "What we're seeing is people who for 10 or 20 years have never paid their taxes late, they can't afford them this year, and they're embarrassed."
Local tax collection is based on the calendar year, but city budgets correspond to a fiscal year that runs from July 1 to June 30. The scramble is now on to collect as much as possible of the money that was due on Jan. 1 before the current fiscal year ends, so the towns can wind up in the black.
Municipal officials say they are sympathetic to people who have lost their jobs or faced other economic hardships that have forced them to fall behind on their bills. But the officials add that it would be unfair to let taxes go unpaid.
"It's a lot better to collect all the taxes owed from the people who are supposed to pay than to raise the tax rate on the people who do pay," Mr. Cogen said.
 
'There's No Money Left'
 The Conference of Municipalities has just started a new program that uses two private collection agencies to track down recalcitrant taxpayers. Fees range from 20 to 40 percent of collections, depending on the type, balance and age of the account. There is no fee if there is no collection. More than a dozen towns have expressed interest in the program, Mr. Cogen said.
"People are financially strained these days," he said. "And when you're in that situation, you pay those bills you can't get away without paying. You pay the telephone company, because they threaten to cut off your service. Or you pay the electric company, because they threaten your lights. And by the time the tax collector comes around, there's no money left."
Many people have found it profitable to delay tax payments, Mr. Cogen said. "There's an 18 percent annual fee for overdue tax bills," he noted. "But if you're paying 21 percent on your Mastercard, 18 percent sounds pretty good, and it's zero percent until you actually pay it."
Mr. Cogen said the conference has been advised by its lawyers and by the State Office of Policy and Management that the new program is legal. But some tax collectors said they had their doubts. Mrs. York in Brookfield said her town's counsel warned her that the authority to turn delinquent accounts over to collection agencies was not specifically spelled out in state statutes.
"I think they could do a great job," Mrs. York said. "But I'm not about to make myself, or the town, liable."
She said the local newspaper agreed to publish the names of tax delinquents. "I told them I hope they had enough newsprint and typists," Mrs. York said with a laugh. "I expected that would get a lot of action. But it didn't. It must mean people don't have the money."
 
Selling Tax Liens
 In Bridgeport Mr. Robinson is using audits to aid in tax collection, something he had not done in several years, he said. In an audit the tax collector reviews the personal property statements a company files with state and Federal agencies to find out if there are any discrepancies.
Another tactic proposed by Bridgeport this year is the sale of tax liens. Rather than foreclose on a property, the city would sell the tax bill to a company or individual. The new owner can foreclose on the property and get it at a fraction of its value. The owner of the property can, at any time in the first 12 months, pay the tax bill and regain title, Mr. Robinson said.
"But in the meantime you're being paid 18 percent interest, under the statute," Mr. Robinson said. "It's a lot better than the five and a half percent interest you're going to get on a certificate of deposit. A lot of investors are very interested in the concept."
Mr. Robinson said that while he had not heard of another Connecticut town selling tax liens, the practice was used in Florida.
"We're trying to catch up on the ground we've lost over the last few years," Mr. Robinson said. Bridgeport's tax collections have consistently been among the lowest in the state, he said, just over 92 percent in recent years.
Some towns are finding the mere threat of enforcement is enough to get the job done. The tax collector in Guilford, Barbara A. Kohls, prepared a list of 34 properties proposed for a tax auction this month. The bills were paid on all but six by the day of the auction, she said.
 
Missed Mortgage Payments
 Mrs. Kohls already has nine other properties that have fallen behind, she said, and she will recommend another tax auction before June 30.
"This is the first time I've ever had two in a year," she said. "And the way things are going, I could have one again before the end of the calendar year."
In Hamden, where collections are about $1.1 million behind officials' expectations, Mrs. Tito said that many people were not making their mortgage payments, so banks were not paying the taxes on those properties.
"Once the banks foreclose on the properties, they'll pay the back taxes," she said. "But not in this fiscal year, which is creating the problem."
Mrs. Tito said most of her efforts involved trying to contact delinquent taxpayers earlier. Letters that normally would have gone out in January, warning people that their taxes were overdue, went out in October.
"People are picking and choosing what they're going to pay," Mrs. Tito said. "If I get them before another bill collector and tell them their tax is overdue, I may get the payment that week instead of someone else."
But she is also working with other town agencies to strengthen collection efforts, she said. For instance, she makes sure the Health Department does not issue a new license to a restaurant that is in arrears.
 
'The Worst Year'
 Middletown has established a task force that sends out collection letters to delinquent accounts, said the tax collector, Joseph S. Colonghi. A year ago it was sending out 60 letters at a time, he said. The most recent round of letters, in February, totaled 200.
"This has definitely been the worst year in my tenure, and I've been here 22 years," Mr. Colonghi said. He estimated more than 250 people are on payment schedules to catch up on overdue taxes.
"We've got about 50 properties in foreclosure proceedings," he said. "Two years ago maybe we had five or six."
Not everyone is enthusiastic about the results of more aggressive collection efforts in a recession, though. In New Britain the tax collector, Fred J. Menditto, said the city had collected just over $65 million, leaving about $3 million to be collected before June 30.
"We've gotten a little more forceful about foreclosures," Mr. Menditto said. But he added that taking errant taxpayers to court had its drawbacks.
"The city doesn't want to be the property owner," he said, because we don't want to have to sell it, or insure it. And the courts don't want to hear foreclosure cases. They've got a lot more important business."

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
A Logo of the Past On the Screen Of the Present

BYLINE: By Robert Campbell; Robert Campbell is the architecture critic for The Boston Globe.

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Everyone says Robert A. M. Stern's new office tower here "looks like Boston." The phrase is subtler than it sounds. It defines a paradoxical, very contemporary kind of architectural success.
The tower, 222 Berkeley Street, is the first tall building ever designed by this New York architect, long known for lavish houses. Twenty floors of office space ascend above two floors of shops and lobbies on a prominent site in the Back Bay neighborhood. An instant landmark is a 10-foot-tall bronze teddy bear -- not Stern's -- that sits on the sidewalk like a huge embalmed panhandler, signaling the presence of a toy store inside. 
 Out-of-town designers who build in Boston often surpass the locals in architectural chauvinism, and 222 practically pops its studs with traditional Boston motifs -- red brick walls, limestone trim, bay windows, stuff like that. It all feels spookily hollow -- partly because, in a recession, there are hardly any tenants, but also because the building is, in every way, a simulation.
This is a papier-mache mask of architecture. Except at the lowest floors, the limestone isn't God's own limestone but precast concrete, just pretending. The red brick doesn't feel like thick clay that has been dug and shaped and cooked and piled up by calloused hands. Instead, it arrived in flat manufactured panels that were slipped into place like giant jokers in a house of cards. Palm fronds rustle in a breeze not of nature but of the air-handling system. Porticoes look like tiny Renaissance temples but lack the detail of the real, seeming to have been miniaturized in porcelain.
The building can best be thought of as a light sketch of the solid architecture of the past, a mirage of the iconic red-brick Boston. There's a kind of authenticity in its very inauthenticity. Today, when we build, we build tents. We erect a frame of steel and stretch a skin over it. The skin may be glass or stone or brick or metal, but it's still only a skin. Willy-nilly, a building becomes a wrapped package. By looking like what it really is -- a paper-thin fake -- 222 negotiates the trickiest shoal in architecture today. It "looks like Boston," but renders the resemblance as an unmistakable simulation and, therefore, as a work of our own time. In an era dominated by media imagery, 222 is a logo of the past projected on the screen of the present, taking care at every turn to remind us that it is a fiction. It could hardly be more contemporary.
Mr. Stern was out to please -- not an unreasonable goal for so public an art as architecture. In this case, it was a necessary goal. Mr. Stern got the job only when another firm was fired under pressure from community activists who hadn't liked his last building. A partner in that firm was the famous Philip Johnson, Mr. Stern's nearly lifelong mentor.
So Mr. Stern moved with caution, but also with considerable skill. Besides adopting a watercolor-of-old-Boston esthetic, he displayed a commendable sense of urbanism. He found ways to unpack his building, so it would look more like a pile of architectural blocks and less like the box they came in. He turned it sideways, reducing its bulk further. He avoided useless plazas, those patches of urban mange so common in new developments, by pulling his building's shopfronts to the edge of the sidewalk, where they would engage the pedestrian. He succeeded in creating something far more palatable than Philip Johnson's proposed building. Nobody took Stern to court, a circumstance that for an architect in Boston is tantamount to a standing ovation.
Robert Stern is a scholar as well as a designer, and his scholarship shows at 222 in the motifs drawn from architectural history. A skylit atrium recalls those of the turn-of-the-century Chicago architect Daniel Burnham. Lobby details learn from the "stripped classicism" of public buildings of the 1930's -- the last era in which Americans achieved an appropriate civic style.
But the dominant source for 222 remains the neo-Georgian (often called neo-Colonial) architecture of the early 20th century. As Mr. Stern himself has argued, those were decades in which a WASP establishment, feeling itself to be drowning in a tide of immigrant groups, struck back by reviving the architecture of the 18th century, the golden age of WASP hegemony. The Rockefellers restored Williamsburg in Virginia, and Harvard erected a virtual theme park of pseudo-Colonial red brick, buff limestone, green doors and white cupolas. As has often happened, good architecture was created in a hopeless attempt to stabilize a culture in decline.
There's a big difference, though, between Harvard's fake-Colonial and Robert Stern's. Harvard's buildings embodied a political message, if a bigoted one. And they were inhabited by a society that believed the message and dressed the part. That has changed. At 222, the population fails to cooperate in the architect's ambitions.
A long-haired messenger in bicycle tights, for instance, loping across the marble floor of Mr. Stern's grandiose lobby, transforms the building at once, by his mere presence, into a stage set in which his own role is that of grip. An attorney in running shoes and earmuffs simply by being here alchemizes 222 into a museum representation of a dead culture, becoming, herself, a tourist in that museum. A disquieting background babble from the walkie-talkies of the security guards is another clue that we must be in a museum.
Such bizarre disruptions of time and place pull the plug on what seems to be the intended political and social message of the WASP-revival architecture. At 222, we don't really experience nostalgia for a WASP past. What is unintentionally dramatized is its very opposite: the diverse, plural, conflicted, imagistic and mosaic city of today.
The architecture of 222 recalls a great sentence from Milan Kundera's novel "The Unbearable Lightness of Being": "Kitsch is taking pleasure in being moved by a mask of beauty."
The truth is that, kitsch or no, most of us probably do take pleasure in 222 as a mask of beauty. What we seem most to love, at the end of the century of modernism, is the simulation that isn't too perfect, that remains obviously a simulation. So we flock by the millions to, say, the MGM theme park at Walt Disney World, where we can move from front stage to backstage among the Hollywood sets, and thus experience them as simulations. We gravitate to the slice of space that lies between reality and its representation.
 At 222 Berkeley, we're offered that guilty delight. No doubt it's a shallow pleasure. Mr. Stern's architecture could be a lot riskier, grittier and fresher (as it is, for example, in his recent library at St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H.). But if it were, it would be that much less interesting an expression of its own moment in cultural history. Mr. Stern is now a member of the board of the Walt Disney Company. The fact arrives with the satisfying click of a shutting box. This is architecture for an age of simulation.

HEADLINE: Really Cool Cars

 BODY:
IT LOOKS LIKE A FUTURISTIC SHOW CAR: SILVER, with swooping aerodynamic lines. Just another sporty "concept" car, you think, until you get behind the wheel.
Then comes a moment of disorientation. There's no gearshift, you learn, because there's no clutch and no transmission. Just two small electric motors, one for each of the front wheels. A long hump down the center floor of the car looks rather like the one in old sports cars; but instead of a driveshaft there's a line of 32 lead-acid batteries under it. 
 Now you see the dials, which are centered just below the steeply raked windshield. Motor temperature, check. Miles per hour, fine. But then there's a dial for battery charge, marked in percentages. And another -- the ammeter -- marked in amps. Driving this car, you realize, requires a different frame of mind.
Turn the key, and nothing seems to happen. No sound, no vibration. But press the button marked F for forward and step on what you can't help thinking of as the gas pedal, and the force of acceleration suddenly has you pushed back against the seat.
You didn't expect this. You realize you're smiling. Surely a sexy electric car is an oxymoron.
Until this car's debut in 1990, it was. The car is the Impact, a General Motors prototype designed to break the conceptual mold of electric cars as glorified golf carts. Though there's some way to go before it will be fit for the market -- the suspension is rock hard and the motors whine like an animal in pain -- G.M. has scheduled it for production in the mid-1990's, at a price reportedly about $25,000.
The Impact is a major precursor of what appears to be an impending new era in cars: a radical change from gasoline to electricity. Even as auto makers struggle through the recession, they have been forced into an expensive, high-stakes race to determine the future.
Fueling the race, as it were, are new environmental regulations introduced by California and now under consideration in 10 Northeastern states, including New York -- potentially, a total of just over a third of the United States new-car market.
The aim of the regulations is to clean up cars, which by most accounts produce up to two-thirds of all urban smog and a quarter of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. The California program mandates progressively lower emissions standards, starting two years from now. At first, these can be met with alternative fuels -- reformulated gasoline, compressed natural gas, alcohols like ethanol and methanol -- and with improved combustion technologies.
But these measures will probably only produce a holding pattern on smog and greenhouse gases. As James J. MacKenzie of the World Resources Institute notes, "with auto ownership worldwide forecast to rise by up to 50 percent in the next 20 years, we simply cannot conserve our way out of the problem." Thus, the ultimate requirement of the new regulations: By 1998, 2 percent of all new cars sold by auto makers with California sales exceeding 3,000 a year will have to be Z.E.V.'s, or zero-emission vehicles; by 2001, 5 percent; and by 2003, 10 percent will have to be Z.E.V.'s.
"The die has been cast," MacKenzie says. "The only way to do this is an absolutely fundamental change in the character of the auto: its propulsion system." The hot technology of the internal-combustion engine -- known in electro-speak without any apparent irony as ICE -- will have to give way to the cool one of electricity, the mechanical engine to the electrochemical one.
As developments in major industrial markets go, all this has happened very fast, and most auto makers are now scrambling to catch up, investing heavily in R.&D. for what they still consider an uncertain market. Much of the research is directed at batteries, because at this stage no purely electric car can go more than about 100 miles before stopping for several hours to recharge. As a result, it looks as though many of the first electrics will be "hybrids" -- electric-drive cars using batteries together with small gasoline engines to recharge the batteries and extend the car's range. Some researchers say that a battery powerful enough to drive a pure electric as fast and as far as a gasoline car may well be on the market by 1998. And in the longer run, researchers are looking to hydrogen-powered fuel cells to replace batteries.
"THIS DECADE IS GOING TO BE BY FAR the most exciting ever in cars," says Paul MacCready, head of Aerovironment, the company that led the Impact development team. "It's going to be somewhat like the 30's in aviation, when you went from canvas and sticks to airliners and fighters in just a few years."
MacCready is not the kind of man you would expect G.M. to trust farther than it can see: too iconoclastic, you would think, for a major American corporation. A three-time United States national soaring champion, he designed a series of solar-powered planes in the late 70's. Then, in what seemed the height of eccentricity, he led a team that built a huge radio-controlled, wing-flapping, flying replica of the largest animal ever to have flown -- the dinosaur-age Quetzal coatlus northropi, or pterodactyl, with a 36-foot wingspan. That, he said, was to show the connection between the evolution of natural flight and technological flight.
Far from a mad scientist, though, MacCready is a restrained, cerebral, intensely practical engineer with a Ph.D. in aeronautics from Caltech and a long string of awards and honors. No fewer than five Aerovironment inventions have been acquired by the Smithsonian, including the Gossamer Condor plane -- the first plane powered solely by a human to achieve sustained, controlled flight -- and the Sunraycer car, G.M.'s record-breaking entry to the first World Solar Challenge Race in Australia in 1987.
After the Sunraycer's success, G.M. bought 15 percent of MacCready's company and gave him and his team the go-ahead to develop an electric car. They were apparently thinking of it primarily as a show car, but MacCready had other ideas. In just under a year, his team developed the Impact, with its top speed of more than 100 m.p.h. and acceleration from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in eight seconds.
Most electric cars developed in the previous 20 years had been conversions of gasoline cars. They worked, but not very well. By redesigning the car from the ground up, MacCready's team transformed the electric car from a technological oddity into a stylish practicality.
They literally reinvented the wheels: made out of aluminum, with tires specially designed to reduce drag, they help make the Impact so energy-efficient that if it were to run on gasoline, it would use only one-third the amount required by a typical internal-combustion car. And in a process known as regenerative braking, the brakes themselves act as small generators, feeding energy back into the batteries and recharging them.
"We had to rethink the whole question of automotive design from the point of view of efficiency the way it's pursued in the aerospace industry," MacCready says, sitting in his sparse office in Monrovia, Calif. "And the odd thing is that nobody had ever looked at a car from that point of view before. There'd never been any need to."
MacCready is no car enthusiast. He puts down the American obsession with high-powered, energy-intensive cars in his low-key, slightly sardonic manner: "If you look at birds like the albatross, you'll see they can spend days soaring over the ocean, with magnificent maneuverability. Then at the other end of the spectrum, there's the peacock, stuck on the ground, flying at most up to a low branch. The mechanical part of a peacock's flying function is minimal, so much effort goes into other things like the large tail, which hampers flying but boy, does it make the females quiver."
The Impact promptly made a lot of auto journalists quiver, a thing they normally do only for peacock cars. The Impact's team had created the automotive equivalent of a peacock that could fly like an albatross, proving, as MacCready says, that "styling and efficiency don't have to be incompatible." And the very fact of its existence undoubtedly influenced California's decision to go ahead with electric-vehicle regulations. MacCready had demonstrated that the technology already existed.
WITH SEVERAL MORE STATES looking closely at the California program, support for electric car production seems to have already "passed critical mass," as one advocate puts it. The European Community will probably adopt a similar measure in the next few years, as will Japan, which already aims to have 200,000 electric cars on the road by the year 2000. Meanwhile, in February the Senate overwhelming passed a bipartisan energy bill mandating the use of alternative fuels or electricity for all government fleets and most commercial ones by 2000. A similar if somewhat weaker House bill is expected before the Easter recess.
But some critics call this unseemly haste. Rushing a new technology onto the market may be counterproductive, they say. David E. Cole, director of the University of Michigan Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation, argues that scientific research on pollution and the greenhouse effect is still contradictory. He warns that demanding that Detroit right now invest in a whole new technology could further jeopardize the position of the American auto industry.
James P. Womack, a principal research scientist in technological policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, cautions that Detroit's problems could yet undermine the new regulations. "There's always the possibility that laws can get changed," he says. "It's true there hasn't been much inclination to believe Detroit when they've said they couldn't do something, and then done it under the regulatory gun, as with catalytic converters. But if you get to the late 90's and Detroit says they can't make the deadlines for financial reasons, it's quite possible there'll be delays in the mandates. So I don't know how much voltage there is, so to speak, behind the regulatory drive for electronics. There's a lot of room for poker-playing here."
Now that the Japanese have entered the poker game, however, nobody can afford to drop out. "A whole electric-vehicle industry has suddenly come into being," one auto executive says. "Our Rolodexes have been transformed in the past year." And even though the regulations call only for a gradual conversion to Z.E.V.'s, the major producers know they will have to be there when the laws kick in.
Some companies, including Ford and Chrysler, are working on electric vans rather than cars. Their assumption is that Federal legislation and market signals virtually guarantee that the initial demand for electrics is more likely to be for service and delivery vehicles than for private cars. But many others are going straight for the far larger private market, and their cars are attracting a lot of attention, both from potential buyers and from other companies.
The first modern electric car to come onto the American market is scheduled to start production a year from now. Code-named the LA301, it was commissioned by the city of Los Angeles and will be built by a small British-Swedish consortium called Clean Air Transport. A four-passenger hybrid commuter car, it runs on lead-acid batteries plus a small gasoline engine that cuts in above 30 m.p.h. or when peak power is needed, extending the car's 60-mile electric range to over 150 miles. It doesn't have the flair or technical sophistication of the Impact. And because of its small production run -- 1,000 in 1993 and 5,000 in each of the two succeeding years -- its projected cost is $25,000.
A prime contender for the mid-90's is the Volkswagen Chico, a small city runabout. Another hybrid, it uses a two-cylinder gasoline engine to recharge nickel-hydride batteries. The batteries alone give it a range of 12 to 13 miles for nonpolluting city driving, while the gasoline range is about 300 miles, with a top speed of 81 m.p.h. Some early reports price it at a very attractive $7,000, but initially it is likely to cost far more.
Volkswagen is also working on a joint venture with Swatch to produce electric cars, capitalizing on the Swiss watchmaker's reputation for inexpensive quality.
In Japan, radical prototypes have pointed the way to a more powerful electric future. Nissan introduced its F.E.V. (future electric vehicle) last year, with nickel-cadmium batteries fully rechargeable in just 15 minutes, compared with a minimum of three hours for most other batteries. That, however, is at 440 volts, which is far beyond home capacity and therefore impractical right now.
Another Japanese prototype is setting an interesting precedent: it was developed not by an auto maker but by Tokyo Power and Electric, the largest privately owned utility in the world. Its Iza is a sleek four-seater with nickel-cadmium batteries, a top speed of 109 m.p.h. and a record-breaking range of 340 miles. The Iza is an expensive proposition, however, and is not scheduled for production.
BMW intends to produce two sophisticated electrics -- the E1, promptly dubbed "the electric egg" by the automotive press because of its shape, and the larger E2 sedan unveiled in January at the Los Angeles Auto Show, with sodium-sulfur batteries, rear-wheel drive, a top speed of 75 m.p.h. and a maximum range of 267 miles. To Americans, one of the most striking features of the E1 and E2 is that they are the first BMW's to be powered by American-made motors. And these come not from a major supplier, but from a small company called Unique Mobility.
AT FIRST BLUSH, RAY A. GEDDES, THE mustachioed chairman of Unique Mobility, is an unlikely proponent of electric technology. A lawyer with an M.B.A. from the University of Michigan, he spent 12 years as Ford's GT and sports-car manager, supervising Shelby Cobras, high-performance Mustangs and the like. In 1981, he got a call from his cousin, a radiologist who had invested in Unique Mobility. "He was worried about the way the company was going," Geddes says. "He wanted me to come help protect his investment." Like all good Detroit people at the time, Geddes scorned the very idea of electric cars. "I had to be dragged in," he says, grinning. "Definitely under duress." Yet what he saw was so interesting that by 1983 he was working full time at the firm's headquarters in Englewood, Colo.
Unique had built a novel direct-current motor that looked so promising that Geddes decided to sell off the company's real estate -- including a race track -- to concentrate on its development.
Standard electric motors pose a difficult trade-off for engineers. They can be designed for torque, which provides acceleration, or for power, which allows steady operation at high speed. But getting both characteristics -- which is what most American drivers expect in a car -- in a motor that is sufficiently small, light and inexpensive for a mass-marketed automobile is a vexing problem.
The patented Unique motor uses less iron and copper than regular electric motors, making it lighter. More important, the motor's copper wire is wrapped in a special configuration and the current is controlled electronically to provide acceleration or high-speed cruising power as needed, and without a transmission. It is thus extraordinarily efficient, producing up to two horsepower per pound of motor weight -- almost twice as much as the Impact's variable-speed AC motors and more than five times that of conventional DC motors.
Though Geddes may have gotten out of racing, the racing hasn't gotten out of him. Pinned to his office wall are engineering drawings for an electric Grand Prix race car. "Racing can accelerate this technology," he says, "just as it did for gasoline technology. Eventually, electric-drive race cars with a motor in each wheel will run circles around other kinds."
With the legendary racing figure Carroll Shelby a former board member of Unique Mobility and still a shareholder, it may not be that long until the drawings move from Geddes's wall to the production studio. And another future indicator is the fact that the company's largest shareholder, Alcan, is working on an aluminum-air battery with 10 times the energy density of lead-acid, and far longer life due to an exchangeable aluminum cassette that can simply be inserted into the battery casing.
The battery connection is important. Electric motors are well advanced, but batteries have a long way to go. In fact the phrase most used about batteries is "the Achilles' heel of the electric car." Right now, they provide too limited a range, take too long to recharge and have too short a life to make electrics fully competitive in cost and performance with gasoline cars.
The range problem is more psychological than practical, but none the less real for that. The average daily trip of an American car is 22 miles, well within the range of even the most modest electrics. But drivers don't like to think of themselves as average. And the limitations challenge a basic piece of American mythology: the freedom to range.
The energy and durability of batteries present more serious problems. Right now, new batteries mean an expenditure of some $1,500 every two years or so. And no single kind of battery seems to do everything that's needed. Sodium sulfur, for instance, holds about three times the energy per pound weight as lead acid but typically delivers that energy to the motors less than half as fast.
The lead-acid batteries in the Impact produce nearly twice the energy per pound weight of current car batteries -- "we think our battery people sneaked some kryptonite in there," jokes one of the engineers working on the production model -- and take only three hours to recharge. But three hours is about 2 hours and 57 minutes too long when compared with the "recharge" time for gasoline motors.
Detroit's Big Three have joined with major utilities and the Department of Energy to form the Advanced Battery Consortium, a billion-dollar effort to develop the ideal battery. The group's goal is to extend battery life to 5 years by 1994 and to 10 years by the end of the decade, while simultaneously bringing down costs and extending range.
Meanwhile, auto makers and utilities are on the verge of agreement on a standard charging system, while the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has begun setting safety standards for electric cars. For a change, auto makers are hoping the agency acts swiftly; nobody wants to put a car on the market that suddenly has to meet new safety standards.
The standards are likely to include disabling mechanisms to disconnect the batteries from the rest of the car automatically during servicing and in crashes, thus preventing electric shock. They may also require that batteries be sealed and packed behind flame barriers to prevent explosions and keep toxic and often highly corrosive acids from spraying the cars' inhabitants in an accident.
Despite the intensive investment of time and money, batteries may be only an interim means of powering the electric car. The ultimate problem is that the electricity to charge them still has to be produced somewhere. In the first few years, as electric cars are phased onto the market, the present power capacity will suffice. But eventually, more will be required, and that means either more nuclear plants, which seem highly unlikely in the United States, more coal and gas-fired plants, or solar generation.
In the long run, though, most experts predict that this whole issue will be resolved by the use of a far more promising energy source: hydrogen. In fact, it could be the ultimate clean fuel.
HYDROGEN IS THE space-age fuel par excellence. The space shuttle uses hydrogen fuel cells to provide on-board electricity and drinking water. Yet one of the leading firms working on hydrogen-powered cars developed its technology not hundreds of miles above the earth, but below it: specifically, underwater.
Energy Partners, based in West Palm Beach, Fla., was founded by John H. Perry Jr., a former newspaper and cable television owner who introduced computerized typesetting into the newsroom. In the 60's, Perry began producing small manned submarines for the offshore oil industry, eventually cornering 90 percent of the market. He also built the hydrogen fuel-cell-powered Hydrolab, in which astronauts trained underwater for the weightlessness of space, and began to experiment with fuel cells in submarines.
Now 74 years old and looking more like a retired naval captain than a captain of industry, Perry is high on hydrogen, and curiously, considering that the source of a considerable part of his fortune is in the oil-drilling business, on the idea of clean energy. "The fuel cell," he says, "is the silicon chip of the hydrogen age."
Fuel cells were bulky and very expensive until the development some years ago of proton exchange membranes, or P.E.M.'s for short. A P.E.M. is a variety of Teflon that looks like a regular sheet of transparent plastic. When treated with platinum as a catalyst, it splits hydrogen and separates out its electrons to form electricity. A series of P.E.M.'s stacked one on top of another like layers of meat in a sandwich produces a fuel cell that is light, small and potentially cheap enough to use in a car.
Hydrogen can be burned in an internal-combustion engine -- BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Mazda all have prototype internal-combustion cars working on hydrogen fuel -- but when used instead to produce electricity in a fuel cell, it will take that same car twice as far. A fuel cell in an electric car as aerodynamic as the Impact could increase its range to about 400 miles, and reduce its recharge time to two or three minutes.
Energy Partners plans to build a "proof of concept" car, rather than a production prototype, running on two hydrogen fuel cells.With it, Perry hopes to demonstrate that such cars can be ready for the mass market by the end of the decade, rather than 20 years from now, as most experts predict.
Though the car will use gaseous hydrogen as its fuel for now, a better and safer option for the future would be to store the hydrogen in an on-board tank containing a granular metal alloy that holds hydrogen gas in nonvolatile form, releasing it to the fuel cell as required.
One of the many advantages of hydrogen as an energy carrier is fuel flexibility: hydrogen can be made from just about anything. It could be reformed either aboard the car or at the service station from methanol, ethanol or natural gas. It could even be produced by using solar power to electrolyze water.
It seems the perfect fantasy: a car running, basically, on sun and water. But outside Munich, Germany, an experimental power plant is already producing hydrogen from solar power and water. Solar technology may be nowhere near the stage where it could power a family car directly, but its potential to power the car indirectly, by producing hydrogen, has now been established.
THE TECHNOLOGY for a new era in cars already exists. The problem now is building a market large enough to justify the large production runs that will make electric cars more economical. Some of the options include regulation, as is being done right now, and incentives, like higher gas taxes or tax breaks for buyers of electric cars.
"Economics underlies this whole issue," MacCready says. "Cars are not airplanes. You have to make them affordable. The challenge is how to get some of the efficiency of the culture of aviation into the mass-market car culture, which is all the trickier when gasoline is cheaper than bottled water.
"If some fearless politician with enough charisma to carry it off could introduce a slowly rising tax on gasoline to, say, $4 a gallon by the end of the decade, the national debt would be pretty much taken care of, the economy would be revitalized, everyone's health would be better, and we'd be free of independence on foreign oil," he says. "But it's not going to happen."
With a clear Federal policy still missing, the coming decade will be one of rapid development and high risk for auto makers. State regulations have set the pace. Now the question is whether consumers are ready to make the leap. If they are, it seems certain that within the next 10 years, cars will finally emerge from the century-old technology of gasoline and begin to catch up with the level of technology we use in the rest of our lives. Within 20 years, they may even catch up with the space age.

HEADLINE: FORUM;
Dick Darman's Spending Ways

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. MITCHELL; Daniel J. Mitchell is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a public policy research group in Washington.

 BODY:
According to Washington budget lore, Richard Darman's extraordinary talents and pragmatic approach have restored the Office of Management and Budget's credibility, which was allegedly bruised under the ideological tenure of Jim Miller, its director during President Reagan's second term. But if the numbers in O.M.B.'s recently released historical tables are accurate, Mr. Darman's reign has been an unmitigated disaster. By every conceivable measure -- Federal spending, budget deficits, economic assumptions -- he has presided over fiscal calamity. It appears that his energies have instead gone toward preserving his inflated reputation.
Self-proclaimed Washington budget experts still dismiss Mr. Miller as a lightweight, yet he accomplished what he set out to do: control the growth of domestic spending and reduce the deficit. The budget deficit declined by $59 billion between 1985 and 1989 under Mr. Miller (years are fiscal years, starting Oct. 1 of the previous calendar year). That compares with an jump of $246.2 billion in just three years under Mr. Darman. And the deposit insurance bailout cannot be blamed for the discrepancy. Excluding deposit insurance spending, the deficit fell by $83 billion under Mr. Miller, but climbed $188.1 billion under Mr. Darman. 
 Perhaps more importantly, the deficit as a share of the nation's output declined every year under Mr. Miller, falling from 5.3 percent of gross domestic product in 1985 to 3.0 percent in 1989. By comparison, the deficit has climbed every year under Mr. Darman and is expected to consume 6.8 percent of G.D.P. this year. Once again, the exclusion of deposit insurance has no effect.
The reason for the climb under Mr. Darman is the explosion of Federal domestic spending. While Jim Miller held spending growth to an average of $1.08 billion annually (in constant 1987 dollars), spending has jumped an astounding $43.5 billion annually under Mr. Darman. The figures, moreover, exclude not only deposit insurance, but also interest on the national debt.
No matter how it is measured, domestic spending is expanding at a phenomenal clip. After adjusting for inflation, domestic spending climbed by an average of only two-tenths of 1 percent under Mr. Miller, compared with an average of 7.0 percent annually under Mr. Darman.
Mr. Darman's supporters correctly argue that much of the higher spending is due to entitlements like Social Security and Medicare that are mandated by existing law. But the same entitlement programs existed when Mr. Miller was O.M.B. director. The difference? While Mr. Miller sought to reform entitlement programs to restrict the growth of spending, Mr. Darman has watched Congress expand the programs and increase taxpayer liability. As a result, inflation-adjusted entitlement spending under Mr. Darman is increasing by an average of 7.8 percent annually, compared with only 0.1 percent in the Miller years.
Knowledgeable budget observers may point out that such comparisons are skewed since Mr. Miller's tenure coincided with the enactment of the Gramm-Rudman Deficit Reduction Act. Jim Miller's fine record is indeed due in part to Gramm-Rudman, but Gramm-Rudman is also due in part to Jim Miller, whose early project as budget director in 1985 was to work with his friend Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, to push through Gramm-Rudman.
Mr. Darman, in contrast, agreed as part of the catastrophic budget agreement of 1990 to eviscerate Gramm-Rudman, eliminating the fixed annual deficit targets that were the heart and soul of the law. In its place he created the Budget Enforcement Act, which is supposed to cap domestic discretionary spending but has actually allowed it to grow nearly five times faster than it did under Gramm-Rudman.
Finally, while Jim Miller was a staunch opponent of tax increases, Dick Darman is perhaps most infamous for engineering the President's reversal on his no-new-taxes pledge, which has slowed economic growth, thereby reducing tax revenues. Revenues for the 1991-1995 time period are now projected to be $497 billion lower than estimated back in the summer of 1990 -- before the tax increase was enacted.
Dick Darman may be adept at generating good press, but his talents do not include managing the budget of the United States Government. If the President wishes to extract himself from the fiscal mess Mr. Darman created, he should fire Mr. Darman and ask someone with a proven record to take the job.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT;
DINKINS DENOUNCES DETAILS OF ACCORD ON ALBANY BUDGET

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 29

 BODY:
As details emerged today about local-aid cuts and new fees in the budget agreement reached by state leaders late Saturday, Mayor David N. Dinkins denounced the plan as too harmful to New York City and urged lawmakers to revise it.
The Mayor's protests came as Senate and Assembly leaders of both major parties began drafting the bill intended to be New York State's first on-time budget in eight years. The 1992-93 fiscal year starts on Wednesday, with April 1 the legal -- if seldom observed -- deadline for the budget. 
 Dinkins administration officials said today that the agreement would cost the city as much as $375 million -- $100 million more than the Mayor had anticipated when he drafted his own budget proposal in January. [Page B7.]
The Mayor, through a spokesman, described the $30.8 billion spending plan as "a hurtful" budget. "At the current moment we are asking lawmakers to vote no," Mr. Dinkins said.
 
'Going to Be on Time'
 But Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the legislative leaders predicted that the budget from the agreement, which they reached after five months of negotiations, would be quickly ratified by both houses. "We're going to have a budget," Mr. Cuomo told reporters today. "It's going to be on time."
Rank-and-file lawmakers returned to Albany this evening and were briefed on details of the agreement during party conferences in each house. While many legislators voiced displeasure over spending cuts, there was a general consensus that the pact would survive essentially intact.
Mr. Cuomo, who cited the state's fiscal morass as his only obstacle when he announced last Dec. 20 that he would not run for President, flatly ruled out the possibility that he would enter the race now. He repeated his view that Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkanasas would "probably" be his party's nominee.
The budget pact seems to have been reached now in large measure because lawmakers feared that another late budget would only deepen the election-year wrath of voters who say they are fed up with politicians to begin with. It would cut many local-aid programs and freeze others, including school aid, at the present year's levels.
It would also impose hundreds of millions of dollars in new state fees on insurers, hospitals and nursing homes, all of which assert that they will have to pass these costs on to the consumers. [Page B7.]
And, as expected, it would defer about $1 billion in scheduled income tax cuts for New Yorkers. The Legislature passed the cuts several years ago during much rosier fiscal times.
Cuomo administration officials said privately this weekend that the Governor was furious with Mayor Dinkins's last-minute objections, arguing that they could make the budget late and risk another painful lowering of the state's already abysmal credit rating.
Publicly, the Governor chalked up much of the Mayor's dissatisfaction to political expediency. "If I were Mayor, I think I'd be doing about what he's doing," Mr. Cuomo said. "I might be wrong, but it's what I'd be doing."
When asked about a possible Cuomo draft at the Democratic National Convention, the Governor replied, "To answer that question is to encourage its consideration, which I do not wish to do."
City officials, meanwhile, said they would target their lobbying efforts at the Democratic-led Assembly and its new Speaker, Saul Weprin. While Mr. Weprin seems to have had a major influence on crafting an on-time budget, city officials depicted him as having caved in on several issues vital to the city in his haste to realize what would be, by Albany standards, a stunning achievement.
But Mr. Weprin angrily rejected that notion today, saying his chamber had done as well as it possibly could for the city. "I had to make a determination -- if the budget were late, the city would be hurt worse," he said in an interview.
 
Shift in Program Cost
 But Dinkins administration officials expressed anger because the agreement would shift the burden of paying for tens of millions of dollars in mandated programs from the state to the city. These included a program intended to help poor people with their heating bills, which was expected to cost $47 million. A new cap on state payments for foster care and day care would cost another $40 million.
The budget deal will apparently spare bus and subway riders in New York City from any further fare increase this year -- the fare already rose from $1.15 to $1.25 on Jan. 1 -- but makes no guarantees for 1993. And after a successful squawk by suburban Republicans, it insures that city officials will be prevented from using any of a $90 million surplus in the commuter railroads' budget that they had aggressively sought.
To no one's surprise, the budget accord quickly generated condemnation from many quarters, including the insurance companies, health-care providers and petroleum dealers who would bear the brunt of the new fees. The dealers said a new plan to accelerate their sales-tax payments would force them to add a penny or more to the retail price of a gallon of gasoline.
 
'Callous and Insensitive'
 Dennis Rivera, the head of Local 1199 of the health-care workers' union, said all three of the state's top leaders -- Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Weprin and Ralph J. Marino, the leader of the Republican-controlled State Senate -- had been "callous and insensitive" in putting together the new budget.
But Mr. Cuomo sought to co-opt much of the disgruntlement, arguing that the recession and his desire to avoid any major tax increases had left the state little choice but to adopt a painful budget. "There's a great deal here that I'm not happy about," he said.
One thing Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders said they were happy about was what they described as the unusually small amount of "one shots," or one-time revenues in the budget. In past years, credit raters have expressed alarm about the use of one-shots as a budget-balancing tool since they represent revenue that the state cannot be assured of replacing in subsequent years.
 
Significant Decline
 Although the relative secrecy of the budget deal prevented reporters from verifying the claim today, Cuomo administration officials said there would be less than $500 million of one-shots in the 1992-93 plan, down significantly from $1.3 billion in this year's budget and $2.7 billion the year before.
The credit rating agencies were not officially apprised of the plan, so they were unable to pronounce any opinions on it. But the state leaders said they were confident it would head off any possibility of a further decline in the state's credit rating, which was reduced earlier this year to the second-lowest of any state in the nation, behind Massachusetts.

HEADLINE: BANKS FEAR LOSSES AS BUILDER REELS

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Many of the largest banks in North America, Europe and Asia lent billions of dollars to Olympia & York Developments Ltd., the world's largest private real estate company, even though it refused to disclose all its financial obligations and would not let the banks review its books.
Now the company, owned by the Reichmann family of Toronto, is being pummeled by $18.5 billion in debt, depressed property markets and a series of disastrous investments, and the banks are nervously lining up to see what their losses are likely to be. 
 And after decades of closely guarding its finances, Olympia & York has been forced to agree to open its books next Monday and show its creditor banks who is owed what, and on what terms.
 
A 3-Legged Colossus
 Olympia & York is the largest owner of office space in New York City, where its properties include the World Financial Center in Manhattan and more than a dozen other office towers. It is also building the immense and troubled Canary Wharf office complex in London.
With the veil now slowly being lifted from Olympia & York, a picture is emerging of a three-legged colossus with debts of Byzantine complexity.
The two most troubled legs of the company are its New York and London real estate holdings; the Canadian assets are believed to have the most value. No one but the Reichmanns and their lawyers are sure of the value of the empire after the billions of dollars of debt are subtracted. Very possibly, it is a negative number.
Some loans secured by the first mortgage on valuable assets, like Scotia Plaza in Toronto, are likely to be secure, but some banks may wind up writing off as losses a portion of the billions lent against the company's general credit.
"Unsecured lending without knowing the full financial picture is very dangerous," said H. Rodgin Cohen, a partner with the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell in New York and a specialist on banking law. "But secured lending based on the value of specific projects is perfectly reasonable without knowing the full financial picture."
On Friday, about 20 of the largest bank lenders were introduced to the new management and advisers at Olympia & York, in particular Thomas S. Johnson, the former president of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, and Robert S. Miller, former vice chairman of the Chrysler Corporation and now a partner of James D. Wolfensohn Inc., an advisory firm.
The banks were told that the advisers were still combing through the company's books, trying to determine what the company's short-term cash needs would be.
Olympia & York is carrying about $15 billion in real estate debt and more than $3 billion more on its oil and gas subsidiaries. With the company facing a string of large debt payments that it cannot meet, it will be pressing its banks for even more money in short-term loans and for more lenient terms on its existing debt.
Some of the world's major banks, including Citibank and the Chemical Banking Corporation, lent the company at least $10 billion for real estate, and Olympia & York borrowed billions more by selling bonds.
 
Hard-to-Measure Signs of Trouble
 The signs of trouble at Olympia & York have been emerging for at least two years but could not be measured because the company's finances were so closely guarded. And the company always vehemently denied it was having difficulty, even when in 1990 it sought to raise cash by trying to sell 20 percent of its United States property portfolio and then trying to sell its oil and forestry businesses. Both sale attempts were unsuccessful.
Last June, it borrowed $160 million from a group of banks, sold property in Florida, sold assets of its pipeline business and got a Hong Kong billionaire, Li Kai-Shing, to buy a stake in one of its troubled buildings.
"To the extent that borrowers approached the banks and the banks did not complete due diligence, it is partly the banks' fault," said Thomas Hanley, a managing director and bank analyst at the First Boston Corporation. "If you combine the lax underwriting standards with some of the most radical changes in the external environment during the past 50 years, then financial shocks should be expected."
 
The Leading Lenders
 Citibank is believed to have lent roughly half a billion dollars to Olympia & York, but it may have sold pieces of those loans to other banks. Chemical Bank, which recently merged with Manufacturers Hanover, is believed to hold about $250 million of loans to the company, one banker said.
Five large Canadian banks are believed to have the largest loans to the company, but European banks are also owed billions, as are a host of Japanese lenders.
Some of Olympia & York's creditors are the same banks that lent Donald J. Trump nearly $2 billion in the 1980's without fully reviewing his financial records or his property appraisals. Those banks were stunned in 1990 to find that Mr. Trump had overborrowed, was short of cash, and that property values had fallen so drastically.
And last year, many of those same banks again expressed horror when Peter S. Kalikow, one of New York's largest developers -- now under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection -- produced financial records that their accountants called Dickensian. Loans totaling hundreds of millions had been commingled in a single account with little regard for which projects the monies were used for.
Several bankers have said they did not fully understand how volatile real estate values could be and often loosened underwriting standards because real estate loans were highly profitable before the market collapsed.
 
Many New York Buildings
 In New York City, Olympia & York owns about 22 million square feet of space. In addition to the World Financial Center at Battery Park City in lower Manhattan, it owns many low-profile but first-rate buildings.
But the problem Olympia & York faces in New York is that it borrowed heavily against its properties at the height of the real estate market. Now that values are down sharply, the properties are worth much less than the more than $5.5 billion of debt against them.
Many of New York's top real estate analysts and executives say privately that there is little or no remaining equity value in the company's New York portfolio. Although some properties provide more than enough cash to service the debt on them, vacancies are growing as leases mature and rents in New York -- especially in lower Manhattan, where most of the buildings are situated -- are also down drastically.
The company's North American property portfolio consists of almost 40 million square feet of mainly office space: 54 percent in New York City, 17 percent in Toronto, 10 percent in Calgary, 5 percent in Ottawa and the balance scattered among smaller American cities, according to Dominion Bond Rating Service Ltd. Olympia & York has an overall vacancy rate of 10 percent in its North American portfolio; but that rate is rising.
Figures supplied by Olympia & York indicate that leases representing 5 percent of the space will end this year and about 7 percent next year.
Olympia & York financed its $3 billion equity contribution to Canary Wharf largely by remortgaging some older New York buildings. As the debt on some of those mortgages mature, the company must find a way of refinancing hundreds of millions of dollars in mortgages.
 
A Close Call
 It had a close call last year when the $450 million mortgage on One Liberty Plaza that was financed by Japan's Sanwa Bank came due. Olympia & York could not get refinancing and it could not pay off the debt. It avoided a crisis only by persuading Sanwa to reduce the mortgage by about $100 million and to grant a one-year extension for repayment.
The core of the New York portfolio consists of several towers acquired from the Uris division of the National Kinney Corporation in 1977, during a severe property recession. Olympia & York held onto these 20- to 30-year-old buildings and saw their market value rise with the upturn in the mid-1980's, then mortgaged the buildings for billions and continued its expansion.
Among the more troubled of those properties are 60 Broad Street, which is almost 70 percent empty; 2 Broadway, a behemoth that is 40 percent vacant, and 320 Park Avenue, from which the ITT Corporation moved its headquarters.
Another headache is 55 Water Street, on which Olympia & York put a $548 million Eurobond mortgage in 1986. This large office center is no longer worth the roughly $150 a square foot value that the mortgage put on it, judging by the decline in New York office properties.
Other buildings now generating enough cash to cover debt costs will see their cash flow shrink as leases mature and tenants demand rent cuts or move out. In addition, Olympia & York is short on the cash it needs to renovate some of its older properties and make improvements necessary to lure potential renters.
 
A Risky Wager On London's Docks
 The London picture is as gloomy. The Reichmanns' 71-acre Canary Wharf project was from the start regarded as an immense bet on the market for modern office space in London. A $7 billion project that is Europe's biggest office development, Canary Wharf is scheduled to have 10 million square feet of offices, 500,000 square feet of stores, a 400-room hotel, restaurants and other amenities.
According to Dominion Bond Rating Service, the company needs about $720 million more in financing to complete the first phase of the project and the first two buildings of the second phase.
Strongly supported by the Conservative Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher because it promised to revive London's derelict Docklands area and insure that city's future as Europe's international business center, Canary Wharf now seems to many a symbol of the Tories' coziness with wealthy developers. And with British elections scheduled for April 9 and Labor leading in the polls, there is no expectation that the Government will spring forward to help the Reichmanns.
 
Enormous Cash Drain
 So far, Canary Wharf has proved little more than an enormous cash drain. The cash being generated by the first phase of the project, which is largely complete, is far from enough to cover its expenses, partly because tenants were lured with incentives like several years of free rent.
With London property in a severe slump caused by overbuilding, rents are depressed and falling still, and British and European banks are reluctant to extend new real estate loans. That is making it difficult for Olympia & York to lease the 40 percent of the completed space still vacant at Canary Wharf. And with the company acknowledging that it is unable to meet its near-term obligations, it is likely to be more difficult to attract first-class corporate tenants.
The greatest threat to Canary Wharf is the strong possibility that Olympia & York will not be able to provide the 400 million ($697.3 million) it promised the British Government to help pay for the completion of the Jubilee subway line.
The line, scheduled to be completed in 1996 at a cost of $2.27 billion, would connect Canary Wharf, which is in an out-of-the-way site, to the rest of London. A contract that was scheduled to be signed between the Government and Olympia & York at the end of the month has been delayed, in part because the company would be hard pressed to come up with the first 40 million payment it agreed to provide.
Without the completion of the line on schedule, Canary Wharf's value will be further damaged. Indeed, its value as collateral is already questionable because the banks are unlikely to be able to find a buyer should they ever foreclose.
 
Valuable Canadian Assets
 Banks have lent Olympia & York about 700 million ($1.22 billion) on Canary Wharf, and the company to reduce its $3 billion in the project. Olympia & York now has about $2 billion of its own money in Canary Wharf. . A meeting had been scheduled in London today between the company and and some British and European banks that helped finance Canary Wharf. It was put off to await the results of the April 6 meeting at which Olympia & York will open its books.
On Saturday, Michael Dennis, chief executive of Olympia & York/Canary Wharf Ltd., said that Canary Wharf's lenders had agreed on March 20 to provide an emergency loan of 52 million ($90.6 million) that would keep work on the project going "through the next month."
It is in Olympia & York's Canadian assets that the banks are likely to find additional collateral worth holding. The portfolio of oil, gas, forestry, real estate and financial company stocks is worth more than $3 billion.
The holdings include a 75 percent controlling interest in Gulf Canada Resources Ltd., a major oil company; an 82 percent interest in Abitibi-Price Inc., a pulp and paper company, and a 89.3 percent GW Utilities Ltd., an oil and gas concern. Olympia & York also has smaller takes in some of Canada's largest property and financial companies.
The company's stock portfolio has dropped 44 percent in value in the last two years and 26 percent last year alone.
 
Squeezing Out Cash In Stock Dividends
 To some extent, the Reichmanns have been able to squeeze cash from the companies they control by paying out large dividends and liquidating assets, but efforts to sell Gulf Canada and Abitibi-Price, the two most valuable holdings, have been unsuccessful.
The company's Toronto real estate holdings have fallen in value over the past two years, but not as dramatically as the office space in New York. The company has 5.4 million square feet of prime Toronto office space and the value of some of those buildings is widely believed to be in excess of the debt several Canadian banks have against them. Partly because of this, the Canadian banks control of some of Olympia & York's most valuable assets.
 
Leaders Among the Lenders
 Already emerging as leaders among the banks are the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Citibank and the Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corporation. The three banks will direct the creditors' committee.
In all, Olympia & York currently has about 15 outstanding bond issues and most are backed by mortgages on specific buildings, although some are also backed by Olympia and York's shares in its energy and forestry companies.
Several rating agencies have downgraded some of Olympia & York's bonds because of the deterioration of the company's credit position and the individual buildings backing the bonds.
Most of the bonds trade in London on the Euro market, and Europeans hold large chunks of these securities. Since news of Olympia & York's problems, the prices of many of these bonds have fallen, but there has been little trading.
Some bonds, however, have maintained their high quality ratings and are expected to trade near face value because the properties on which they have a first-mortgage benefit from long-term leases with solid tenants and generate a lot of cash.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Olympia & York's Manhattan Real Estate Portfolio" -- The troubled Canadian real estate company Olympia & York made its debut in New York 15 years ago. Today it owns an array of buildings in Manhattan, from the well-regarded World Financial Center to the increasingly obsolete skyscrapers built by the Uris brothers 20 to 30 years ago. The company has disclosed little about the value of its portfolio, but a sense of its magnitude can be gained by the city's most recent assessments. The assessed values are typically 45 percent of market value and cover both land and buildings. The buildings are listed in a rough South to North orientation.

HEADLINE: '88 Welfare Act Is Falling Short, Researchers Say

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
When Congress passed a much-celebrated welfare law in 1988, its supporters, including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, said it would bring revolutionary changes to the system.
But the first major study of its implementation says the program's accomplishments fall far short of radical change. While the law has succeeded in expanding services, the report found, it is failing to convert welfare from a system that permits long-term dependency to one that stresses skills, jobs and financial independence. 
 The report, to be released Monday at a Senate hearing, attributes the problems to a lack of political commitment and a recession-driven shortage of money.
 
Caseloads at Record High
 "The potential of the program hasn't been fully realized," said Irene Lurie, a professor of public affairs at the State University of New York in Albany, who co-wrote the report. "There have been significant changes, but there hasn't been what was advertised in Washington: the most sweeping reform in 50 years."
The findings come as welfare caseloads have reached record highs and elected officials from President Bush on down are making sharp attacks on the system and the 13 million people who rely on it.
In a telephone interview Friday, Senator Moynihan said that the problems were predictable and that he remained "very encouraged" about the program's prospects. "We always said when we put the statute in place that we wouldn't really know if it would work until the year 2000," he said.
The newly antagonistic political climate has arrived only several years after Mr. Moynihan and others were celebrating what they called an era of new political consensus on welfare. Mr. Moynihan, the New York Democrat who will preside over Monday's hearing, has expressed the fear that the current attacks may undermine the program.
The program is called JOBS -- for Job Opportunities and Basic Skills -- and it was created as part of the 1988 Family Support Act. It requires every state to run an education, training or work program for parents on welfare, and provides up to $1 billion a year in Federal matching money to help pay for it.
When it passed, Senator Moynihan and others said the law amounted to a new social contract, one that emphasized the mutual obligations of Government and poor people. The law expands training opportunities for those on welfare but also imposes new obligations on them to participate. States are supposed to meet enrollment quotas and reduce the grants of those who refuse to join.
 
Some Successes
 The report, which examined 10 states including New York, was not entirely negative. It found that states were meeting their enrollment goals and that Government agencies that provided related services were learning to work together, a social policy goal often pursued but difficult to achieve.
As a result, it said, the program was offering "enhanced educational and training opportunities to welfare recipients."
The report looked only at the states' experiences in setting up the program and said it was too early to tell whether the programs were actually getting people off welfare.
Its biggest criticisms centered not on the letter of the law but on the states' approach toward its spirit. The program's architects hoped it "would signal a change in the mission of welfare systems or redefine the social contract," the report said, but that "has not been realized."
In none of the states studied, it found, had the program spurred leaders to "make a strong personal commitment to reform their welfare programs."
 
Implications for Public
 Richard Nathan, director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government at SUNY, which conducted the study, said the lack of fanfare had implications for the public: amid all the current talk about changing welfare, he said, many are unaware that large-scale changes are already supposed to be under way.
Mr. Nathan had hoped the program would serve to spur social workers to think more creatively about the range of a family's needs, and design services for children as well as their mothers.
But the report found that states had not used the new money "in any significant manner to provide new or expanded services to the children."
The report found that states, unable to come up with their portion of the matching funds, were only spending about 48 percent of the $1 billion in available Federal money. Figures from the Department of Health and Human Services, which is among the groups paying for the study, have since updated that number to about 60 percent.
 
Priority on Volunteers
 Mr. Moynihan said he was most disturbed by the finding that states, in meeting their enrollment goals, were giving priorities to mothers who volunteer. He said this practice could undermine the notion that the reluctant had an obligation to participate and raised the concern that those who most need the training may not get it.
"Most welfare administrators don't believe in telling people they have to do something or else," he said.
By 1995, every state will be required to enroll 20 percent of their welfare recipients in a work or training program, but about half the mothers are exempt because their children are too young.
Representative Thomas J. Downey, the Long Island Democrat who sponsored the law in the House of Representatives, blamed the Bush Administration for part of the program's problems.
Among the targets of his criticism is the so-called "20-hour rule," which requires states to design programs that involve at least 20 hours of activity each week. Many state officials have complained that this makes it hard to put welfare mothers in college classes, since they usually meet for just 10 or 12 hours.
Administration officials have said the 20-hour rule is necessary to insure that programs are long enough to be meaningful. Jo Anne B. Barnhart, the assistant secretary for health and human services who oversees welfare, could not be reached for comment on the report.
In addition to New York, the report examined Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas. It was co-written by Jan L. Hagen, also a professor at SUNY.
The fragility of the so-called welfare consensus can be seen in the experience of New York. Although the law was shaped in Washington by two New Yorkers -- Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Downey -- the State Legislature took two years to get its program up and running, as it bogged down in a contentious debate about the kind of training to offer and other issues.
Ms. Lurie said that while the program is now in operation, it "has not been sold to the public at all." She said New York put up enough matching funds to spend 47 percent of $87 million available in Federal money.
 
Link to Recession
 After showing little growth for almost two decades, the number of people receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the official name for the welfare program for households with children, has skyrocketed. There are currently about 4.6 million families on welfare, or about 13.2 million people, an increase of 21 percent in little more than two years.
Experts have said the rise is being driven by the recession but also reflects a long-term increase in the percentage of families that are headed by single mothers. Many states have responded by cutting grants or tightening eligibility standards.
Nationwide, a mother with two children and no outside income received an average of $623 a month in A.F.D.C. and food stamps last year, according to the House Ways and Means Committee. That represents a two-decade decline of 27 percent in inflation-adjusted terms.
 
Attacks on the System
 In December, Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican, gained national notice with a proposed ballot initiative that would cut grants by up to 25 percent. Vice President Dan Quayle traveled to New York City last month and said it showed the failure of a "liberal vision of a happy, productive and content welfare state."
President Bush -- previously silent on welfare issues -- used his State of the Union Message in January to attack the system and then began promising in televised campaign commercials to "make the able-bodied work." But he has offered no concrete proposals.
The actions by the White House drew an unusually sharp response from Mr. Moynihan, who said the President was playing "the race card." Mr. Moynihan has introduced a bill that would add $4.5 billion a year to the JOBS program, and enroll every eligible mother.
In a political attack of his own, he has called on President Bush to support the proposal, asking him to "put up or please to shut up."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Candidate's Record;
Brown Firm on What He Believes, But What He Believes Often Shifts

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ

 BODY:
Listen to the voices of Edmund G. Brown Jr. over the years: Limits on campaign contributions are "a violation of free speech." National health insurance is out of the question, an invitation to "runaway inflation." Economic growth cannot be maintained forever; Americans must accept "an era of limits."
If those positions sound the opposite of what the former California Governor is pitching on the campaign trail these days, it is because they are. The Jerry Brown running for President in 1992 is at odds on crucial issues and campaign themes with the Jerry Brown who ran for President in 1976, the Jerry Brown who tried again in 1980 and even the Jerry Brown of just a year ago. 
 "You grow. You learn from mistakes. Positions evolve," the candidate said yesterday in an interview, pointing out that the country had changed greatly since he first ran for President at the age of 37.
Many political figures shift their stands over the years, of course, sometimes out of expediency, sometimes out of a genuine change in circumstances and convictions, sometimes because the responsibilities of governing overtake the promises of campaigning. But even Mr. Brown's supporters acknowledge that his shifts have come more often and been more fundamental than those of most other politicians.
Mr. Brown has become a champion of limiting campaign contributions to $100; it has been a hallmark of his campaign, as he says that to take more money is to be corrupted. But in years before, he sought much larger contributions, both for the Democratic Party in California, of which he was chairman, and for his own political action committee. A leading contributor to his PAC was Milan Panic, who ran a drug company of which Mr. Brown was a director; that relationship created a new controversy for the Brown campaign yesterday. [Page A14.]
In Michigan this month, Mr. Brown achieved second place in the Democratic primary largely because of his opposition to free trade with Mexico, which automobile workers say will cost them jobs. But as a Senate candidate in California in 1982, with the state's economy tight and Mexican immigrants pouring in, he called for close economic ties with Mexico and forming "a North American Common Market."
Mr. Brown now favors limits on the length of terms of elected officials, but in 1990 he opposed them. This year he supports gun controls, as he did in the 1976 Presidential campaign, but in the 1980 campaign, at a meeting of gun owners, he dismissed controls as the beginning of government restrictions on private lives. In 1979, Mr. Brown rejected national health care as too expensive, but this month, with health care one of the big issues in the campaign, he embraced the idea.
"You have to remember that Jerry Brown is a work in progress," said Bill Carrick, a Democratic poll taker in California. "He's a very shrewd politician, very shrewd. I wouldn't dismiss political motives for his changes in position. On the other hand, don't forget he started very young. He's constantly re-evaluating who he is, what he thinks about the issues. To some that's positive; to some it's negative."
In addition to the shifts on individual issues has come a shift in the main themes of Mr. Brown's campaigns. In 1976, he was in some ways playing the Paul Tsongas role, bearing a message of austerity. "We are entering an era of limits," he said. "And we all need to get used to it."
By 1980, having lost with that message, Mr. Brown's somber campaign theme had changed to "protect the earth, serve the people and explore the universe." After he wound up without any primary victories that year, he announced he was going to rethink his message and bring it closer to earth.
What emerged is this year's campaign: an appeal to the public anger at government and an attack on "a ruling elite of insiders who serve only themselves." The balanced-budget amendment that he advocated in 1980 has been replaced as the campaign's main economic theme by the flat-rate income tax. Exploration of the universe has turned into proposals to build high-speed trains.
"Jerry has no political or ideological anchor," said Mickey Kantor, who is running the Clinton campaign this year and had run Mr. Brown's 1976 campaign for President and 1982 race for Senator. "I'm saddened, frankly, by his kind of politics. I think he once had something to offer. Now he's a groping politician looking for the next thing he can exploit."
Mr. Brown sees it differently. "You experiment," he said in the interview. "You have to learn. You can't keep repeating."
 
Consistancy Cited
 Throughout it all, he argued, are underlying threads to which he has been consistent. "My writing and my speeches have had a real consistency. I've always been for trade unions; I've always been strong on the environment; I've always been strong on minorities."
But what happened, just to cite one example, to his fixation on space exploration? "You guys beat my brains out," he said, meaning that newspaper articles had ridiculed him for it. "But I still think it's important."
To be sure, Mr. Brown has been consistent on some of the same issues, like concern for the environment, opposition to nuclear power and cuts in military spending. And he has always run as the outsider, "David versus Goliath" he said just the other day, exactly what he said in 1980. The only difference is that for this performance Gov. Bill Clinton is substituting in the role of Goliath, played previously by Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
Still, the shifts in Mr. Brown's stands are there, and they come both fast and deep. It is sometimes possible to watch things shift -- or at least blur -- before one's very eyes.
Here is Mr. Brown early this month, saying America needs to help Americans: "I wouldn't give a penny in foreign aid until every small farmer, businessman and family are taken care of."
Does that mean he would withhold aid to Israel, he was asked a few days later, on March 8, on the NBC News program "Meet the Press."
"You know, that Israel thing is a hot-button issue," he replied.
Asked if he did not take accountability for what he originally said, Mr. Brown said: "I take accountability, precisely. Precisely. I wouldn't give one penny as long as the injustice is going on in this country. But I've also said that I believe this country is rich enough to be a leader in the world, that we can afford foreign aid."
Mr. Brown's shift on issues is most apparent on campaign contributions. Here he is on March 21: "I challenge Bill Clinton to limit his contributions to $100, as I have done. I challenge him to do away with the big money that is corrupting our Government, eating away at it. Government is being run for the big contributors, not for the people."
But in November 1989, Mr. Brown, then chairman of the Democratic Party in California, fought in Federal court against a state law that would have limited individual contributions to $1,000. Asked in court if the state should place any limits at all on campaign contributions, he responded: "When I had the chance to impose that, I decided that it would not be neither effective or good policy."
At another point Mr. Brown said, "I don't think large contributions per se have any different impact than contributions raised under these limits."
Question: "In the course of the days and weeks preceding the special election that occurred Tuesday, did you telephone and solicit any registered lobbyist in the State of California for contributions?"
Answer: Yes.
Q. How many?
A. As many as I could.
Mr. Brown's former law firm, which took on the case pro bono, has since applied for Federal money for its handling of the suit, which was brought as a civil-rights freedom-of-speech case. It was awarded $170,000 but no money has been paid, pending an appeal of the whole case. The lower court ruled in favor of Mr. Brown's opposition to the contribution limits.
Mr. Brown says that as party chairman he was obliged to fight the campaign limits, which would have treated the party as a political PAC and limited its donations to candidates to $2,500. In any case, he says, he has now seen the light because of his experience soliciting big contributions. "I have had my nose rubbed in the stench," he said. "I know about it first hand."
 
Stand on Proposition 13
 Another area where Mr. Brown seemed to shift was on Proposition 13, a voter-initiated measure that cut property taxes by 60 percent. As Governor, he strongly opposed it as "a consumer fraud, expensive, unworkable and crazy."
But once it passed overwhelmingly, he jumped on the bandwagon, cutting spending and talking about "a tax revolt that is being heard and has inspired the hopes of many."
Asked about that, Mr. Brown said yesterday that he had no choice as Governor but to enforce the new law. As for the enthusiasm of his enforcement, he indicated that perhaps he should have curbed it a bit. "But we had to make a move," he said.
One of the keys to Mr. Brown's doing well in Michigan and winning second place was his opposition to free trade with Mexico. "I opposed the fast track to free trade," he said to the delight of Detroit auto workers, to whom he portrayed Mexico as the enemy. "That means jobs that should be yours will end up in Mexico."
But in 1982, running for the United States Senate in a race he eventually lost, Mr. Brown said: "I would work in Washington to achieve closer economic cooperation with Mexico and Canada, whose economic destiny is linked with our own. I'd work for a unified economic policy for the Western Hemisphere to create the richest and most powerful trading region in the world."
Mr. Brown said yesterday that the statements were not inconsistent, that he simply opposed giving President Bush "a blank check" to open trade with Mexico.
On the issue of national health insurance, Mr. Brown changed stands recently. In 1979, at a Harvard meeting of doctors, he opposed it, saying: "If you have one individual who is dedicated to curing disease at all costs and another person understandably interested in alleviating his own suffering, and if you have a third party called Government that is willing to pay the cost, you have brought runaway inflation."
But this month, in Miami, he backed national health insurance, saying, "We can pay for it."
Even Mr. Brown's beloved flat tax is a reversal of an earlier stand. In an Op-Ed piece in The Los Angeles Times on Nov. 18, 1990, he spoke in favor of the progressive income tax. Asked about that yesterday, he said his flat tax was progressive, but admitted that was not what he was talking about in 1990. "If you are asking did I understand the implications of the flat tax then," he said, "the answer is no."

HEADLINE: A Final Clear-Cut, and Goodbye to Logging

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: QUILCENE, Wash., March 23

 BODY:
Loggers don't say "timmmmmmber," when a 200-foot Douglas fir comes crashing down, severed by chain saw from its centuries-old anchor to the ground. They never did, as far as anyone on the Olympic Peninsula can remember.
Instead, after the pop and snap of wood fiber crumbling into the arms of gravity, Gary Phillips takes a deep breath. "Smell that?" says Mr. Phillips, a third-generation logger who is cutting his last stand of timber. "That's the smell of dying trees." 
 It wasn't so long ago that the Olympic Peninsula, home of the only temperate rain forest in the contiguous United States, called itself the logging capital of the world.
A big man and a chain saw could cut enough trees in a day to build two average-sized houses. Of course, those trees may have lived five centuries and harbored untold biological secrets, and therein lies the conflict. The public owns most of the big trees left in the country. More and more, they are valued for something other than building materials.
Because of environmental restrictions, concern about the shrinking habitat of endangered wildlife like the northern spotted owl, automation and over-cutting on some lands, the timber industry here is but a ghost of what it once was.
This spring, Mr. Phillips, who owns one of the last of the small timber operations on the peninsula, is closing his business. For him and his crew, this is the final clear-cut.
Increasingly, wood for new American homes comes from Canada, the South or the big Northwest tree farms owned by companies like Weyerhauser. Less than 15 percent of the nation's wood comes from the national forests, and some critics would like to see all logging halted on Federal lands.
 
Farmers, Not Villains
 These men do not see themselves as land rapists or villains. They say they are more like farmers, harvesting a crop. Nature, Mr. Phillips said, has downed more trees through fire and wind than any logger.
"A salmon fisherman once asked me if I felt bad, cutting down all these big trees," Mr. Phillips said. "I said: 'No, sir. Have you ever felt bad taking in a big salmon?' "
But these men concede that most of the really big trees are gone, and in many ways, the loggers still working in the last years of the 20th century are paying for the sins of others.
"I cut a tree once, 18 feet in diameter, but have not seen anything like that for many years," said Bob French, who has spent most of his 57 years in the woods.
They gather on this day in darkness, an hour before dawn, at a restaurant along Highway 101 called The Logger's Landing. Everyone wears spiked boots, and suspenders because belts don't hold the pants up just right. They consume enough eggs and bacon to shock a heart surgeon into palpitations. On the walls are pictures of the glory years, a dozen or more loggers standing proudly atop a single tree stump.
 
70 Acres of Timber
 Mr. Phillips, who has a bearskin rug over the couch at home, elk trophies on his walls and antique rifles displayed in a glass-topped coffee table, started H & P Logging with his partner, Pat Handly. They are contract loggers -- meaning they cut trees on contract for the purchaser of the timber. Their final timber harvest is a 70-acre piece of land owned by the state. Logging on Federal land on the peninsula has come to a virtual standstill because of restrictions to protect the northern spotted owl.
In all the years that Mr. Phillips's crew has been logging, not a man can remember seeing a spotted owl. Although a few dead owls have been found nailed to posts here in the Olympics -- a sign of the intense bitterness some men feel -- the loggers on Mr. Phillips's crew say they respect wildlife more than the average city dweller.
The Olympic Peninsula, a Massachusetts-sized shank of land in the far northwest corner of Washington State, can get heavy rains -- up to 180 inches a year -- on its western side, while the eastern side basks in sun. The interior of the peninsula is the Olympic National Park; it is bordered by the Olympic National Forest, two-thirds of which has been logged. The remaining land is private or owned by the state of Washington. Much of the private land has been severely cut, leaving vast stretches of stumps and brown earth.
Clear-cutting, considered the most economical way to cut trees in the thick forests of the Pacific Northwest, is the only way most of the men on the H & P crew have ever logged. In a typical clear-cut, the land is cleared of every tree, the logs gathered into neat piles, the brush burned and the ground replanted.
On this cut, the loggers start at the bottom of the slope and work their way up.
Deer, black bears, mice, coyotes, and numerous birds may live in this particular 70 acres, just above a saltwater inlet of Puget Sound. After the chain saws start up, the prime concern is wood. A single large tree can yield lumber worth as much as $30,000. When all the trees are felled from this section, they will provide enough wood to build about 230 houses. Much of this wood, after being cut into framing timber, will go to Japan.
Lee Olson uses a chain saw with a 36-inch blade to bring down the trees. He is massively built, with thick upper arms and bulging chest inside a Mickey Mouse T-shirt. It takes all of about five minutes to cut a century-old Douglas fir. The hardest part, he said, is keeping his footing while holding the saw steady.
Mr. Olson has scars all over his legs and arms from where the saw has bitten into his skin. Three of his uncles have been killed on logging jobs, and he has lost several good friends as well. On average, one of every three loggers is killed or seriously injured on the job during the length of a career. But even with the danger, Mr. Olson, who is 33 years old, said there was no job he would rather have than being a lumberjack.
 
Vanishing Vocation
 "I like the satisfaction of looking back at the end of the day and seeing what you've accomplished," Mr. Olson said. "Every tree is a different challenge; no two trees are the same." He can determine the way a tree is going to fall by cutting at an angle on the opposite side of the downslope. When he is done, he steps back and watches the crash.
Mr. Olson is something of an anachronism. The big companies that provide most of the nation's wood from their tree farms cut timber with a $300,000 machine that can pinch off a tree trunk like pruning shears on a plant. In the last 15 years, even before a single acre was set aside for the spotted owl, the Northwest lost 30,000 timber jobs, while gaining more than 800,000 jobs in other fields. Wood products, which once drove the economy, now accounts for only 2 percent of all jobs in western Washington.
And in the next 25 years, an additional 30,000 jobs are expected to be lost throughout the Northwest if proposals to set aside six million acres for the spotted owl are approved. Some economists have said that tourism will replace logging as the economic mainstay of timber communities. But many loggers say they will never become waiters or tour guides. Mr. Olson said he wanted to build houses. Mr. Phillips may work with plants. Mr. Handly is not sure what he will do. None of them seemed particularly bitter.
"The environmentalists have done their homework," Mr. Phillips said in a sort of back-handed compliment. "They got out ahead of us, and then before we knew it, it was basically over. We never knew what hit us."
As the jobs and towns built around logging have disappeared, some people have romanticized it, talking about a logger's culture of pickup trucks and brawny work. But the men on this final clear-cut scoff at such notions.
"What we do is all about one thing and one thing only -- money!" Mr. French said. Timber workers here make about $14 an hour.
When Mr. Olson has felled enough trees, he cuts them into sections, about 40-feet each, sized for fitting on a truck. Then a yarding crew comes along, hooking up the logs to massive steel cables connected to a hydraulic pulley. From there, they are loaded on trucks and sent to a mill in Tacoma.
 
'Just Plain Ugly'
 The forest floor, stripped to the bare earth in parts, covered with limbs and brush in others after the loggers have finished, looks like it has been hit by a hurricane.
"There's no way around it, a clear-cut is just plain ugly," Mr. Phillips said. But he sees life where others see death. "We've had lots of clear-cuts where I thought we did a great job," he said. "But then your average person comes along and says it's a catastrophe. People just don't understand what it is we do."
As part of what is known as the new forestry, not all the trees is this clear-cut were cut. A small section bordering a stream was left standing, as were several old trees used by birds. But the loggers complained that it caused more environmental damage to leave some standing trees, because the crew had to build twice as much road to get around the trees left near the stream. The road, gouged into the side of the hill, is already causing erosion and runoff of sediment.
"We're supposed to make a clear-cut that's not really a clear-cut," said Mr. Handly. "It's ridiculous."
Mr. Phillips's grandfather was a logger who came to the Northwest from Maine, via Wisconsin -- a fairly typical path for workers who followed the declining timber harvests from one coast to the other. Mr. Phillips's father was a logger as well, and he advised Gary not to get into it.
Although Mr. Phillips is not sure what he'll do when he hangs up his saw this spring, he is thinking about starting a nursery.
He does have another project in mind, a museum depicting the history of logging on the Olympic Peninsula. For artifacts, he said, he need go no farther than his own front yard, where he keeps the big tools of the tree-cutting trade.

HEADLINE: Budget Plan Will Raise Costs for Health Coverage, Private Insurers Say

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
Health insurance executives said yesterday that millions of New Yorkers would ultimately have to pay more for coverage from commercial carriers if the Legislature approved its leaders' budget pact.
At the same time, state officials said the budget agreement alone would not be enough to prevent a rate increase for 1.5 million customers of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the nonprofit insurer of last resort around New York City, Albany and the mid-Hudson Valley. 
 The tentative agreement would force the commercial insurance companies to pay hospitals more for customers' care, an increase the companies said they would have to pass along to their customers.
"This will cause premiums to increase signficantly," Philip J. Harrington Jr., vice president of government relations for the Prudential Health Insurance Company of America, said yesterday. "This is a tax that we would have to pass on to our policy holders."
But state officials dispute that assessment, saying that the commercial insurers are profitable enough to absorb the increase. They say the change will help make the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans -- which would not be subject to the higher rates -- more competitive.
The state is considering a request by the ailing Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield to raise rates by as much as 42 percent for individual subscribers and those who work in companies with fewer than 50 people.
The State Insurance Superintendent, Salvatore R. Curiale, has warned that unless the Legislature comes up with a comprehensive package of reforms for the industry, in addition to the hospital-fee increase, he will be forced to grant Empire's rate request. He has set April 1 as the deadline for his ruling.
While the increase in premiums under the higher rates would vary considerably depending on a subscriber's individual circumstances, some people could find themselves priced out of the market.
Daniel Margulis, who is 62 years old and lives in Whitestone, Queens, now pays $1,872 quarterly for an individual Empire policy for himself and his wife. If the rate increase is approved, his premium would rise to $2,470 quarterly, which Mr. Margulis said he simply could not afford.
Mr. Curiale has proposed a list of changes that would help bolster Empire and the other Blue Cross plans, which provide insurance for some 12 million New Yorkers but which are hemorrhaging money and subscribers. In the last few years, Empire -- which takes on everyone, no matter how old or sick -- has been increasingly challenged by commercial competitors.
This has meant disaster for Empire, which has raised rates four times in as many years, even as it lost some 400,000 customers. Its chairman, Albert A. Cardone, has said that without an increase, Empire will lose $372 million this year, making it insolvent by summer.
Mr. Curiale's proposals would force the commercial companies to accept any applicant who could afford to pay, as Empire does. And they would also change the way the commercial insurers set their rates for small groups and individuals.
Currently, the commercial insurers set rates depending on a subscriber's risk of illness, considering factors like age and whether or not the subscriber smokes. If the subscriber works for a small company, the other workers' risks are also considered in setting rates for the company. This keeps the rates down for healthy customers, while raising them for sicker customers, who are often forced into the Blue Cross plans.
Mr. Curiale, and the Assembly Democrats, want to force the commercial companies to spread the risk by considering all small-group subscribers as part of one pool, as the Blue Cross plans do.
But Senate Republicans have balked at those proposals, saying they would put an unfair burden on the commercial insurers. And now Mr. Curiale is saying that if his plan is not passed, not only will Empire's rates go up, but the whole system will begin to unravel.
It is unclear what will happen with the rest of the revisions Mr. Curiale is proposing. After yielding on the hospital-fee issue, the Senate Republican leadership may be in no mood to compromise on the other proposals.
 
Managing Competition
 Currently, all hospitals charge insurance companies the same base fee for the same procedure. The Blue Cross plans reimburse the hospitals at cost, and the commercial insurers pay an extra 13 percent. Under the agreement, the hospital fees for the commercial companies would increase to 24 percent.
The Blue Cross plans maintain, and the state agrees, that the different fees are necessary if Blue Cross is to compete with commercial carriers.
"This is an economic device that the state uses to help manage the competition between nonprofit carriers and commercial carriers," said Geoffrey Taylor, a spokesman for the New York State Conference of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans, which takes in Empire.
But the commercial insurers say the increased fees will just raise rates for their customers, without addressing the underlying problems.
"We feel sorry for anyone who feels that a tax on commercial insurance policy holders will save Blue Cross and solve the monumental problems facing health care in New York State," Mr. Harrington said. "This is like putting a Band-Aid on a cancer."
An odd twist in the agreement is that the extra money that would be raised by the fee increase -- about $130 million -- would go to the state's general fund to help offset $1 billion or so in cuts from the Medicaid program. This means that hospitals would pass the money from the increase along to the state.
"We haven't begun to estimate how much it will cost," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, which represents 131 hospitals and nursing homes in New York City and nearby. "We'll be used to channel funds to the state, which is an activity we're not particularly familiar with."

HEADLINE: Levy Says He Is Resigning As Israel's Foreign Minister

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 29

 BODY:
Foreign Minister David Levy, brooding for weeks about his faction's decline within the governing Likud Party and under pressure from angry supporters to do something about it, announced tonight that he was resigning.
Mr. Levy, the most openly enthusiastic supporter of the Arab-Israeli peace process in the hard-line Israeli Government, did not say he would also leave Likud, which he said he still loved and considered his home. 
 But even if he stays with the party, a decision that some political commentators said was far from assured, he has left it divided and perhaps seriously hobbled at the threshold of a campaign for national elections in June.
"I think the most satisfied person today is Yitzhak Rabin," a senior Government official said tonight. He was referring to the new leader of the opposition Labor Party, which recent opinion polls have given the edge against a Likud stumbling over an economic slowdown, difficulty in absorbing a tide of new immigrants and stagnation in the peace process.
It was not clear if Mr. Levy meant business about resigning as Foreign Minister, an announcement that came as a surprise in that his followers had been urging him to quit Likud, not necessarily the Government, and form his own party.
His resignation does not take effect until two days after he submits it to the Cabinet, and that is not scheduled to take place until it meets next Sunday. So there is a probable nine-day waiting period, and some Government officials and neutral commentators predicted that Mr. Levy would use it to wring concessions from his main enemy of the moment, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
But Aliza Goren, a Levy spokesman and longtime aide, said she thought the decision to quit was irreversible. Still, she said, "he keeps his cards very close to his chin, and he's the only one who knows what he'll do."
Mr. Levy, who also has the largely titular position of Deputy Prime Minister, has staked out a centrist position in the Shamir Cabinet, the most right-wing Government in Israeli history. Among ranking ministers, he has been not only the one most favorably disposed toward the peace process but also the most consistent exponent of restraint in the present tensions between Israel and the United States.
Before announcing his resignation at the end of a long speech to cheering followers gathered in Herzliya, near Tel Aviv, he rebuked Mr. Shamir and other Cabinet ministers for severely attacking Washington after the collapse of Israel's request for United States loan guarantees.
"Sometimes everyone is Foreign Minister," he said. "They are all experts. Everyone is declaring war on America. This certainly was a fundamental mistake."
It seemed unlikely, however, that Mr. Levy's departure would have a material effect on either the peace process or relations with the Bush Administration. Peace negotiations are expected to resume in late April after a hiatus of nearly two months. But many participants assume that nothing will happen and that the talks will be suspended until well after the Israel elections on June 23.
 
Rebuffed by Party
 In any event, the announcement tonight had less to do with public policy than with the moodiness that enveloped Mr. Levy and his Likud supporters after internal elections several weeks ago that shut them out of prominent spots in the party's lineup of parliamentary candidates.
Mr. Levy, who is 54 years old and was born in Morocco, is a proud man, the most successful Israeli politician among Sephardic Jews, who immigrated here in the 1950's from North Africa and elsewhere in the Middle East. But many feel that he is also sensitive to the point of touchy, especially about his origins, his meager formal education and the endless jokes told about him.
After his candidates fared poorly, the Foreign Minister accused Mr. Shamir of conspiring against him. Many of his followers saw an anti-Sephardic conspiracy by Ashkenzim -- those who, like Mr. Shamir, came here from Europe.
The dispute, some commentators caution, threatens to rekindle old rivalries between Ashkenazim and Sephardim that many Israelis thought they had put behind them long ago, especially in the Likud.
 
'Genie Out of the Bottle'
 "The genie is out of the bottle, and it's going to be a big one," said Akiva Eldar, a senior political writer for the newspaper Haaretz.
In Herzliya tonight, Mr. Levy invoked some of the Sephardic resentments in charging that he was the victim of discrimination.
"In the mouths of some I was a monkey that just came down from the trees," he said, blaming "the weak minds of little people" for his situation.
Nonetheless, he insisted that he still loved Likud, saying, "The party is my home, and a man cannot leave his home." But Ms. Goren, among others, said it was still possible that he would walk away and form his own party.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Vermont;
'Uncommitted' in Unpredictable State

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Vt., March 29

 BODY:
This was once the nation's staid state taciturn, thrifty, rural, Yankee, Republican, a place where cows and sugar maples far outnumbered people and life was, above all else, predictable.
That was before the hordes of refugees from the sprawling, mauling urban combat zones of New York, Boston and Philadelphia discovered Vermont, bringing with them liberal, progressive ideas that have muddled much of what used to be a sure thing in the Green Mountain State. 
 Now hardly anything here is predictable. Especially politics.
So when Vermont Democrats caucus on Tuesday night to choose 14 delegates to the Presidential nominating convention in July, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas may find themselves in a surprising three-way contest instead of the simple one-on-one contest they had anticipated.
 
'Uncommitted' Running Strong
 In this, the year of the angry voter, "uncommitted" appears to be running strong in Vermont, at least in the final hours before the caucuses.
Mr. Brown and Mr. Clinton both hunger to go into next week's New York primary with a fresh victory, even one from a tiny state that seldom has played much of a role in Presidential nominations. What they may get, instead, is political muddle.
"The 'uncommitteds' are a big factor out there," said Jennifer Wallace-Brodeur, the executive director of the Vermont Democratic Party. "Neither Clinton nor Brown seems to be stirring much enthusiasm. This should be Brown's state, given he's so strong on the environment and women's issues and the like, but it's not inconceivable that Vermont could really confuse things and give 'uncommitted' its first 1992 win. I wouldn't bet on a thing."
Republicans will caucus, too, on Tuesday, and there a bet on President Bush is as safe as anything in politics. His conservative rival, Patrick J. Buchanan, has made no significant effort here, where 19 delegates are at stake.
There are no public opinion polls indicating who is out front here in the Democratic contest. But Clinton and Brown campaign workers have begun to warn the party faithful not to vote for "uncommitted."
Both campaign camps are driven, in part, by the results of a Democratic Party straw vote a few days ago in Norwich. "Uncommitted" captured 40 percent, with Mr. Brown getting slightly more than 30 percent and Mr. Clinton just more than 20 percent.
The nature of caucuses adds another element of unpredictability to Tuesday's results.
Caucuses are typically small neighborhood gatherings in which only a small, strongly committed percentage of voters turn out. A well-organized campaign can often pack caucuses with a candidate's supporters, thereby creating a voting result that does not actually mirror the preference of the electorate at large.
Mr. Brown appears to be better organized in Vermont than Mr. Clinton. But neither candidate has poured in major resources and both campaigns are relying mainly on the help of volunteers, who are working the phones and handing out pamphlets.
Mr. Clinton has not visited the state, though a solid finish here would help wipe away some of the tarnish his campaign picked up when he lost to Mr. Brown last week in the Connecticut primary.
Mr. Brown made his first appearance in the state this afternoon, appearing at a rally here and later at a rally at Montpelier, the capital.
"They can say all they want about me and my record," he told a gathering of about 2,000 people here. "But they can't stop the moral force of you, the people. We have to wake them up. Take our country back."
Mr. Brown called the rally "the biggest of my campaign" and questioned whether Mr. Clinton, troubled by questions about his personal and public behavior, could be elected should he win the nomination.
Before Mr. Brown's arrival here, campaign workers distributed leaflets that defended his proposal to set a flat tax of 13 percent on all earnings, a proposal that Mr. Clinton is criticizing at every opportunity.
Ken Dean, the director of Mr. Brown's Vermont campaign, said Mr. Brown hoped to win Tuesday's caucuses by picking up the support of voters who helped the Rev. Jesse Jackson win here in 1988.
Craig Fuller, a former Clinton aide in Arkansas who now lives in Vermont and heads the Governor's campaign effort here, is playing down expectations of success, perhaps as much out of frankness as political expediency.
"This is a tough state for Bill Clinton and, for that matter, for Jerry Brown and any other candidate," he said. "I confess, I don't detect much enthusiasm for anybody."

Clinton Wins One Delegate
 CHRISTIANSTED, St. Croix, March 29 (AP) -- Mr. Clinton won one delegate Saturday and two went to "uncommitted" at the Virgin Islands' caucus.
The caucus coordinator, St. Claire Williams, said Mr. Clinton won 42 percent of the vote, earning him one of the three Virgin Islands delegates at stake. He said "uncommitted" got 58 percent and Mr. Brown got no votes.

HEADLINE: Bush Inches Toward Announcing How Much Help to Give to Russia

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
President Bush is expected to announce his much-debated program of aid for the former Soviet republics this week, perhaps as early as Tuesday, Administration officials said today.
The officials said that the program, which has become embroiled in the 1992 election campaign, was virtually finished but that White House advisers were debating the political merits of presenting it at a news conference or in a televised address. 
 Mr. Bush, who has come under bipartisan criticism from members of Congress and others, including former President Richard M. Nixon, for the delay in announcing the program, told reporters after attending church today that the package "will be good."
But he declined to discuss specifics. "I will have something to say on that this week," Mr. Bush said as he walked across Lafayette Park.
Mr. Bush's proposal has already been widely reported. It is expected to include an American contribution of about $1 billion to a fund to stabilize the ruble as it becomes a convertible currency, officials said. That fund is expected to total $5 billion or $6 billion from several countries.
Mr. Bush is also expected to propose about $1 billion in loan credits for Russia and about $200 million for Ukraine, with the money to be used to purchase farm goods from the United States.
The package is said to include an end to restrictions on lending that were imposed on Moscow during the cold war, and an increase of $12 billion in United States loan guarantees through the International Monetary Fund so the fund can make loans to the former Soviet republics.
Among details still being worked out this weekend was how to trim the Federal budget to come up with the $645 million in direct assistance to the republics that was pledged by Washington last month.
Some lawmakers have suggested taking the money from the Pentagon budget, which is being cut sharply. But Mr. Bush has refused to do that, saying he did not want to violate the 1990 budget agreement, which set limits on spending in individual areas and stipulated that any money cut from the military budget must be used to reduce the size of the deficit.
Administration officials were also debating how to present the package.
As Mr. Bush tries to bring the power of his incumbency to bear on his bid for re-election, some officials have argued that the President should make the announcement as "Presidential" as possible by doing it in a prime-time address from the Oval Office.
Once the the program is announced, a senior official said, Mr. Bush is likely to start an intensive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill, both because of the need to show that he is seizing control of the issue for political reasons, and because of the complicated politics of finding the money.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
The Hurdles That Remain
MOSCOW, March 29 (Special to The New York Times) -- While economic reform in Russia is showing "some good results," a great deal remains to be done, a senior American official said here today.
The official, David C. Mulford, Undersecretary of the Treasury, said that while he expected Russia to be able to join the International Monetary Fund by early May, the current reforms were not as comprehensive as the fund would require before agreeing to help.
"On the budget deficit, they have a lot more to do, and they know it," Mr. Mulford said to reporters after meeting the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of the reform, Yegor T. Gaidar. "They have not necessarily reached the goals they originally set. I think the whole process has gone a bit slower and has been more difficult than they first imagined, but that is not unusual."
Mr. Gaidar has already relaxed monetary and fiscal policy to try to keep inefficient industry going during this difficult transition, when more than 40 percent of the country's industrial capacity is idle and output is continuing to decline by about 10 percent a month. Tax revenues are consequently below expectations, and tax collection is still haphazard.
The Russian Government is expected to face considerable criticism over its economic policies, which have raised prices for most commodities, when the Congress of People's Deputies convenes on April 6. Apparently concerned about the political reaction, President Boris N. Yeltsin said last week that he had decided to postpone freeing oil and gasoline prices from April until May or June.

HEADLINE: U.S. Reaping Zairians' Anger Toward Mobutu

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire

 BODY:
Ever since Mobutu Sese Seko came to power nearly 30 years ago, Zaire has been regarded as one of Washington's best friends in Africa. But now, with the country facing economic ruin and increasing violence, there has been a marked surge in hostility toward Washington for its longtime support of President Mobutu's autocratic rule.
Students and intellectuals have long denounced the United States as a repressive force in Zairian politics, accusing Washington of pressing a cold-war ideology that has helped prop up the Mobutu dictatorship. But amid the growing political turmoil, even Zairians who reject such views are taking a more critical view of the United States. 
 "There's no doubt that many people here blame the United States for keeping Mobutu in power for so long," said Etienne Tshisekedi, leader of Zaire's biggest opposition party, who served briefly as Prime Minister in October. "The anti-American sentiment has recently become a lot worse because many people can't understand why the U.S. is still supporting his regime."
Zairians say they believe that the United States has the power to remove the President, but is unwilling to.
President Mobutu has received hundreds of millions of dollars from the United States since he came to power in 1965. Over time, public and private American voices were raised against that aid.
Last November, allegations of a massacre of university students in a major southern city, Lubumbashi, and persistent reports that he amassed a fortune prompted Congress to end all military and economic help.
Nonetheless, the United States is perceived as President Mobutu's Western backer, which has made life uncomfortable for Americans living in this Central African country. This hostility is directed not just at Americans but at Zairians who are friendly with Americans.
A Zairian who studied at Stanford University said, "Even people who have been educated in the U.S. like me have been told things like we're brainwashed, or probably C.I.A. agents, or on the C.I.A.'s payroll."
A poll taken by the Zaire Institute of Public Opinion in February found that 73.3 percent of those asked had a poor opinion of American policy toward this country. In contrast, 78.9 percent said they had a good opinion of Belgium, the former colonial ruler.
American officials said they were hard pressed to explain this, since in recent months, at least publicly, the United States and Belgium have taken virtually the same positions toward the Zairian leader, criticizing him for being unwilling to grant political pluralism he promised in 1990.
"The difference," said a European diplomat, "is that Belgians have been wrestling with Mobutu for a much longer time, and most people here believe that they truly want to get rid of him. The Americans, on other hand, aren't seen as credible; they're afraid to say publicly what they privately believe, that Mobutu must go."
This view has come at a time when the American presence has nearly vanished. Since the State Department warned of danger in Zaire in September, thousands of Americans have left. The few who remain -- fewer than 100 by some estimates -- say they are targets of strident criticism. Many fear that the tension could easily turn violent.
"It is not the virulence of the stories appearing in the local press that concern me," said Melissa Wells, the United States Ambassador, "but it is the comments of longtime American residents, including many missionaries, who say they have never known this extent of anti-American sentiment. And I hear such comments day after day after day."
The anger increased a few weeks ago when Herman J. Cohen, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, met briefly with President Mobutu. Mr. Cohen declined to discuss the meeting, and his silence seems to have released a torrent of pent-up anger and fed conspiracy theories involving the United States.
Mr. Cohen, though critical of President Mobutu, has said he should stay in office during a transitional period leading to multi-party elections.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Cloak and Dagger Retired, Ex-Chief Of C.I.A. Remains Hard to Predict

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
Which is the real William Egan Colby, "the traditional grey man, so inconspicuous that he can never catch the waiter's eye in a restaurant," as the former spymaster described himself in his 1978 memoir, "Honorable Men: My Life in the C.I.A.", or the romantic who drives a red Fiat Pininfarina around Washington as if he were in vehicular combat in Rome?
Is he the onetime secret agent who for years assiduously cultivated a manner as colorless as his translucent eyeglasses, or the free spirit who tangoes with his wife in the living room of their Georgetown town house? 
 Mr. Colby, once an unrepentant cold warrior branded a war criminal on antiwar posters in the Vietnam era, is now promoting a 50 percent cut in the military budget. Once the mastermind of the Central Intelligence Agency's clandestine operations in Indochina in the 1960's, he is now advising the heads of Eastern European intelligence services how to make their agencies compatible with democracy.
Is the 72-year-old former Director of Central Intelligence a born-again liberal atoning for past misdeeds? Is he, as his wife, Sally Shelton, insists, misunderstood -- a lifelong populist who is driven to tears by the plight of the world when he watches the nightly news, so "low key," she says, "that he sometimes lets people walk all over him?"
 
A Covert Career
 Mr. Colby himself, now a practicing lawyer and a consultant to a handful of multinational corporations who is earning considerably more than he did at the C.I.A., dismisses any seeming contradictions in his history. "The career explains the whole thing," he said in a recent interview. "For years I was a covert operator, and in the intelligence business you're not supposed to be terribly open."
Though Mr. Colby had been speaking out on disarmament for years, it was the overlit, 30-second television commercial that began in Washington in January that portrayed the image of a man whose world has turned upside down.
"I'm William Colby, and I was head of the C.I.A.," he says in the commercial. "The job of intelligence is to warn us of dangers to our national security. During the cold war, those dangers were military. The cold war is over, and the military threat is now far less. It's time to cut our military budget by 50 percent and to invest that money in our schools, our health care and our economy."
Since then, Mr. Colby has expanded on his proposal before Congress, traveled around the country giving speeches and drafted a long paper with Paul C. Warnke, the former director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency for the Coalition for Democratic Values, the organization that sponsored the ads.
Their plan would halve the military budget in five years, freeing $345 billion to help the country's sagging economy. This is considerably more than President Bush's plan to pare $50 billion from the military budget, a plan that Mr. Colby says "reflects a desire to continue business as usual."
Mr. Colby's is not, of course, a universe of one. Ray S. Cline, for example, who as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence first informed the Kennedy White House of the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, stood beard-to-beard with Fidel Castro at a conference in Havana last January, joking about the C.I.A.'s unsuccessful efforts to assassinate him.
But Mr. Colby said he has been waiting in the wings for the new world for more than a decade. Indeed, as long ago as 1975, his friends say, he was made an outcast by the Old Guard in the intelligence agencies for violating the unspoken rule of C.I.A. secrecy, telling Congress about "the family jewels" -- the nickname for the agency's illegal activities and dark secrets, from spying on American citizens in the United States to operating a project to develop supersecret weapons like poisons, biological weapons and dart guns.
Mr. Colby said his candor to journalists, and in interminable Senate hearings on the excesses of C.I.A. covert operations, cost him his job but gained him the respect of Congress and helped establish the process of Congressional supervision over intelligence.
Shortly after he left the agency Mr. Colby began to speak out on military affairs, quickly becoming the darling of the disarmament set.
 
Panel Discussion Recalled
 "It was amazing," recalls Jeremy Stone, the president of the American Federation of Scientists, who says he discovered the soft side of Mr. Colby at a panel discussion on disarmament 15 years ago. "I thought I'd be the only dove among the hawks, but I found myself saying that Colby had said everything I believed in on disarmament and more eloquently than I did. Then, to my surprise, I started finding Colby on panels everywhere -- traveling at his own expense."
In 1983 the man who had years before acknowledged to Congress that the C.I.A. had regularly used overseas missionaries to gather intelligence, endeared himself to the Roman Catholic bishops when he joined their cause, calling himself an "unabashed supporter of the nuclear freeze."
Mr. Colby's critics say that he was always a bit of a misfit as a C.I.A. bureaucrat, that his cooperation with the press and the Congress made "the process of demolition" of the C.I.A. "irreversible," as Archie Roosevelt, the veteran C.I.A. official, said in his memoirs.
Those close to him say he is nothing if not a pragmatist.
In an essay written in 1986, for example, Mr. Colby in effect called for a military coup in Iran, arguing that the United States should "actively encourage the appearance" of a new Shah, "preferably out of the army rather than the clergy."
 
A Sense of What's Practical
 "I don't think he has an ideological bone in his body," says his wife, Ms. Shelton, a former ambassador in the Carter Administration who runs an independent consulting firm for multinational corporations. "He just wants to know what's practical, what's fair and what makes sense."
Mr. Colby says that he still believes in old-fashioned covert action, but only when it works. "If you can stir up a little antagonism between rival drug lords, if you can support covertly some more responsible people than some wild anti-American groups, if you could give some assurances privately to a few people in Cuba, North Korea, Burma that if they change their government and orientation, yes, the United States would be responsive, then why not?" he asks.
When asked why he does not favor assassination plots, he does not plunge into Jesuitical arguments about morality, but says simply, "If they're exposed, it's usually counterproductive."
In the case of Panama, he said, an invasion that "killed several hundred Panamanians and in which we lost 40 of our own" was better than a covert plot to eliminate Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
"If he had been assassinated you'd still be hearing about it," Mr. Colby said. "But military action fit so naturally into America's longtime relationship with Panama, it causes no great stir."
 
Praise and Criticism
 As for his current stand on military spending, some independent experts praise the effort but criticize its lack of specificity. "What's missing on paper is a sense of roles and missions," says Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, a nonpartisan research group that works on military-spending issues. "If I were a college professor I'd give him a C-plus, or better, maybe an incomplete. But it's not off the wall. No way."
Mr. Colby says he does not understand all the fuss about his position on defense. A member of the American Civil Liberties Union before he joined the C.I.A., he spent a summer organizing service-station operators when he was an undergraduate at Princeton, parachuted behind enemy lines into France and Norway in World War II, campaigned door-to-door for President Harry S. Truman in 1948 and joined the C.I.A. because, he wrote in his memoir "Honorable Men" (Simon & Schuster) , it was "the most effective place for a non-Communist liberal to do battle against the Communist menace."
In "Lost Victory," his book on Vietnam (Contemporary Books, 1989), he argues that one of the main reasons the war was lost is that the C.I.A. had to turn it over to the American military.
He also refuses to distance himself from the C.I.A.'s Phoenix program, a secret operation that he supervised and that was designed to "neutralize" the Vietcong in South Vietnam. More than 20,000 "suspects" were killed, and although he vehemently denies charges that it was a program of systematic assassination and torture, he acknowledged to a House committee that there had been some "excesses."
But Vietnam was "a liberal action," Mr. Colby says, adding, "I think we had the war won in 1972."
Daniel Ellsberg, the Defense Department analyst in the 1960's who became a prominent opponent of the war, still insists that the Phoenix program was wrong. But he adds, "I admire Colby for being so open, and I wish there were more like him."

HEADLINE: An On-Time Budget;
An Early Start and Angry Voters Help Cure Albany's Tardy Ways

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 29

 BODY:
In trying to find a silver lining in the cumulus of New York's budget crisis, state leaders consoled themselves with the notion that hard times would allow them to change government in fundamental ways that were politically unfeasible in brighter days.
The tentative budget deal reached on Saturday night by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the state's legislative leaders showed the premise to be true on one important count but false on others. 
 It was the hard political times -- marked by a deep sentiment against incumbents at all levels of government -- that provided the imperative to produce an on-time budget for the first year since 1984. If the agreement reached by Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders wins approval in tonight's party caucuses in both the Senate and Assembly, it is expected that budget bills can be passed by Wednesday, the start of the fiscal year.
 
Hard Economic Times
 But the hard economic times, which forced the state to close a significant budget gap for the third consecutive year, did not provide the imperative to revise government in the way that Mr. Cuomo and some lawmakers had envisioned.
With the exception of the major savings squeezed from the Medicaid program, much of which came from increased taxes on hospitals, nursing homes and private insurance companies, there is apparently little in the budget that qualifies as fundamental reform.
As in past years, the Legislature did not agree to create more prison space by loosening sentencing laws, to eliminate inequities in the formula that determines state aid to schools or to relieve local governments of hundreds of costly state regulations.
"The biggest disappointment is that the Legislature will not restructure across the board as I asked them to," Mr. Cuomo said last week, as budget negotiations were entering their final phase. "They will do only one thing -- poor people -- and call it restructuring."
In the context of state politics, passing a budget by April 1 is no small achievement. For the last seven years, the budget deadline has been imaginary, often treated with little respect even at the beginning of each year's budget talks.
State officials did not even heed the warning from Wall Street in 1990, when the state's credit rating was lowered at least partly because that year's deadline was missed.
Although voters expressed exasperation about the succession of late budgets, the majorities in both houses -- the Democrats in the Assembly and the Republicans in the Senate -- expanded in that November's election.
The next year, the state shattered its previous record for tardiness by approving a budget that was nine weeks late.
But this year, the politicians in Albany could sense that the relentless recession in the Northeast had given rise to a growing anger.
In that environment, legislators saw no reason to once again hand voters a tangible symbol of their impotence, particularly in a reapportionment year when they would be introducing themselves to strangers in newly drawn districts.
"This is really a first step back to re-establishing our credibility, both with the voters and the raters," said Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat.
 
Negotiations Began Early
 There were other factors that prodded the process as well. Above all, budget negotiations got started early. After discovering in November that New York had a gap of nearly $900 million in this year's budget, state leaders spent two months of trying to produce an agreement on how to close that gap or on the possibility of forging a 15-month budget that would close the combined $4.8 billion gap for this year and next year.
While those talks failed, they produced a great deal of progress toward this year's deal. Essentially, the leaders spent the same amount of time negotiating the 1992-93 budget as they did in the last two years. But this year, they started earlier, and they had the unpleasant memory of last spring to guide them.
"One of the things that was different about this year was last year," Mr. Cuomo said today.
In addition, the Assembly had a new leader, Mr. Weprin, who joined Mr. Cuomo in placing a high premium on timeliness. Some Assembly members have said they believed this was how Mr. Weprin hoped to make his mark.
Privately, some New York City officials have faulted Mr. Weprin for being so eager to be on time that he did not mount a strong defense of the city's interests. But Mr. Weprin said today that the city would have been worse off if the budget was late because he would have lost negotiating leverage with the Senate, particularly on Medicaid and welfare.
Ralph J. Marino, the leader of the Republican-controlled State Senate, said he agreed to several last-minute compromises, including a measure that would increase the rates paid by insurance companies to hospitals, because he had won deep cuts in Medicaid and had staved off cuts in school aid.
"I think basically we got what we strove for," he said. "This is why we could agree on a timely budget."

CRASH MAY FORCE NEW ICE RULES
If the National Transportation Safety Board determines that ice on the wing caused the crash of USAir Flight 405 last week, it could prompt fundamental changes in how aircraft are inspected before takeoff, how they are de-iced and even how they are dispatched to the runway. Despite the potential danger of even thin sheets of ice, there is no universal rule on how it should be detected and removed. B3.
 
FLIGHTS TO LOCAL AIRPORTS IN DECLINE
The total number of travelers who passed through the region's three main airports declined sharply last year, a decrease caused by the recession and the economic effects of the Persian Gulf war, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The overall number of passengers who used the three airports -- Kennedy International, La Guardia and Newark International -- fell 8.7 percent, from 74.8 million in 1990 to 68.3 million last year.

FIRE RIPS THROUGH TRANSIENT HOTEL 
 Nineteen people were injured, 13 of them firefighters, and more than 150 people left homeless in a five-alarm fire at a transient hotel in midtown Manhattan, fire officials said. The firefighters sustained burns and smoke inhalation while fighting the two-hour fire at the Hotel Mansfield Hall, near the theater district. B3

DINKINS ASSAILS NEW BUDGET PACT
As details of the local-aid cuts and new fees in the budget accord crafted by the state's leaders emerged, Mayor David N. Dinkins denounced parts of the plan as overly harmful to New York City and urged state lawmakers to revise it. Mr. Dinkins's assault came as officials in the Capitol, on the heels of the fiscal agreement that had eluded them for almost five months, began drafting the bill that would insure New York State's first on-time budget in eight years.

A SMALL SORT OF SILVER LINING
In trying to find a silver lining in the cumulus of New York's budget crisis, state leaders consoled themselves that hard times would allow them to change government in fundamental ways that were politically unfeasible in brighter days. The tentative budget deal reached Saturday night showed that premise to be true on one important count but false on others. News analysis. B7.

HEADLINE: From Trenton to Montauk, Local Officials Are Buying Local

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., March 27

 BODY:
In a mini-trade war, New York City, New Jersey and Long Island are engaged in a bitter exchange of purchasing policies that favor local suppliers for government contracts.
The policies are intended to protect jobs and buttress local economies, all mired in recession. They give preference to resident businesses, even if their bids are as much as 10 percent higher than competing proposals from other, nonresident companies. 
 But as they spread from Trenton to Montauk, the incentives, known as "local preferences," are encountering a groundswell of skepticism. The critics say they waste tax money and squash competition, and are fraught with many of the same conflicts that make trade protectionism a recurrent theme of global debate.
"Any advantage to a specific group of contractors, even if it sounds good politically, leads to higher prices," said Carla S. Lallatin, a financial consultant in Brooklyn and a member of New York City's Procurement Policy Board, created under the 1988 revision of the City Charter to oversee its purchasing procedures. The board wants all local preferences eliminated.
 
'Not a Foreign Power'
 So do many business people.
"It is amazing to me that with all the financial problems around us, they would not go with the low bidder," said Conrad Noble, president of the White Plains Electrical Supply Company, whose $173,200 bid to supply light bulbs to New York City was rejected last year. The contract went to a supplier in the city that bid $5,700 more.
"It's not as though I don't spend my own money in New York City," Mr. Noble said. "I am not a foreign power."
New York City started the battle in 1984 when it began favoring local companies in contracts for products ranging from police cars to software. City companies can win city business as long as their bids are no more than 5 percent higher than competing bids from outsiders.
The favoritism has always rankled business executives outside the city, but the first counterattack did not come until October, when New Jersey's Division of Purchase and Property adopted what it called a "Golden Rule."
The New Jersey policy retaliates against 18 states and 7 cities across the nation that impose various forms of local preference, but is aimed most squarely at New York City. Under the rule, all out-of-state bidders for New Jersey business must contend with the same penalties faced by New Jersey companies that compete for contracts in their states or cities.
Now, in what it calls a plan to create jobs, Nassau County is proposing a preferential policy of its own, which would allow local bidders to charge up to 10 percent more than companies from outside the area. The preference would be extended to companies in New York City and Suffolk County, as well as in Nassau.
Unlike New York City's law, the Nassau law would cover those providing services as well as products.
"Local tax dollars should be spent locally," said Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau County Executive and author of the proposal, which is scheduled for a hearing by the county's Board of Supervisors on April 6.
Over the last three years, officials here said, $109 million in county construction contracts and 25 percent of the purchase orders for Nassau have been awarded to companies outside Long Island and New York City.
 
'Time to Protect Our Own'
 "It has always galled our members when local funds are spent on businesses based outside the region," said Anthony Russo, business manager for Local 138 of the Engineers Union in Nassau County, which supports Mr. Gulotta's plan. "It's time to protect out own."
But while support for such policies appears to be growing, some business people say the preferences undermine competition and waste taxes.
And the laws have not escaped the notice of officials in Washington, and even abroad. American negotiators, at work in Uruguay on revisions of the international treaty governing trade among more than 100 nations, have asked all states to forgo preferential policies that would handicap foreign bidders.
"The Europeans in particular are aware of, and are very much opposed to, the so-called 'buy local' initiatives," said Beverly Fuortes, an adviser to Carla Hill, the United States Trade Representative.
And while the movement for local preferences seems particularly strong in the New York metropolitan region, other cities and states have also been enacting or considering such rules.
"There has been a frenzy since November," said Les Jackson, director of research of the National Institute of Governmental Purchasing, a nonprofit group in Falls Church, Va. He said a dozen cities and states are now considering policies either to initiate local preferences or to retaliate against other areas.
The new interest in local preferences comes as cities and states have adopted a host of other business incentives, many of them for minority-owned companies. A more recent surge involves "Buy American" programs in which goods made anywhere in this country are favored over those produced abroad.
But Mr. Jackson's group, whose members include government procurement officials from across the United States and Canada, said the recent flurry of interest in local initiatives may be more deeply rooted in the recession than the other programs, as cities and states respond to calls for help from their financially troubled business constituents.
 
How Much Competition
 The group opposes the local preferences, saying the officials who advocate them often overlook the precision with which suppliers can estimate how much others will bid for contracts. In many cases, it contends, a local company that is given a 5 percent or 10 percent price advantage in bidding will automotically increase its bid by just enough to be assured of winning the work.
Still, some proponents of local preferences say they leave ample room for competition. In Nassau, Mr. Gulotta and other officials said they wanted to offer their incentives to New York City and Suffolk County because many residents here work outside the county, and because a bigger pot of potential bidders will keep costs low.
The impact of New York City's seven-year experience with local initiatives is being studied by the Procurement Policy Review Board. Although the board has repeatedly criticized the incentives, it does not have the authority to eliminate them.
In its most recent report, covering city purchases for 12 months ending in September 1991, the board found that city procurement officials had rejected nonresident suppliers in 93 contracts, in each case awarding the work to city businesses that submitted higher bids.
 
Costing the City More
 It said the city spent $199,400 more for the contracts from its hometown businesses than if it had accepted the competing out-of-town bids. More than half of the rejected low bids came from elsewhere in New York State, and 20 percent came from companies in New Jersey, it said.
In previous years the preference policies cost the city even more, according to the board's records. But because the city's policy is discretionary, it said, the Dinkins administration has more frequently chosen to use out-of-town bidders to cut costs in the face of the city's budget crunch.
Amid the broadening array of local preferences, some business people say their cities and states have no choice but economic retaliation.
"What is good for the goose is good for the gander," said Donald Warnock, owner of Warnock Chrysler Dodge in Hanover, N.J., who in 1989 was rejected on a $21.8 million bid to supply police cars to New York City. The contract was awarded to a dealer in the city that bid $1 million more.
Mr. Warnock was a leader in the lobbying effort for New Jersey's new preference rule. But he said he would prefer that none of the local preferences existed anywhere. "The people that pay in the end are the taxpayers," he said. "What we'd prefer is a level playing field."

HEADLINE: Opposition Develops to Proposal For Building-Permit Extensions

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 29

 BODY:
A move by New Jersey developers to gain blanket extensions of building permits for projects that were delayed by the recession has run into opposition from environmentalists and municipalities in the state.
At hearings of the Assembly Community Affairs committee on Monday, representatives of the New Jersey League of Municipalities are planning to argue that the automatic extensions being sought by the builders usurp local powers and reward only a small group. 
 Environmentalists also oppose the proposed legislation, which would extend any construction or development permit that expired after Jan. 1, 1989, through 1994. Many developers had stopped or slowed down the construction of projects for which they had obtained the required dozen or more state and municipal permits. Many of those permits, which are typically good for three years, are expiring.
Granting automatic extensions for projects that have already passed municipal and environmental muster would put thousands of unemployed construction workers back to work, said Patrick O'Keefe, director of the New Jersey Builders Association. Requiring developers to go back to the authorities for extensions or renewals, he said, would add to delays and costs that could kill the projects.
 
'Dead in the Water'
 "We're talking about projects that have already demonstrated to the satisfaction of everyone that they are appropriate," Mr. O'Keefe said in an interview last week. "But because of the economic slowdown, they have been built out at a pace slower than originally anticipated. Because of the credit crunch and the expenses involved in reapplying for the necessary permits, there is little likelihood that they will ever be resurrected, and they will be dead in the water."
That would only delay a revival of the state's stagnant construction industry, he said. The industry has lost approximately 50,000 jobs in the state. "We're better off just extending these permits and get the projects moving, put people back to work and get on with the business of the day," Mr. O'Keefe said.
Mr. O'Keefe said he did not know how many such permits have expired or are about to do so. The measure has been heard in the Senate Community Affairs committee and may be voted on in that chamber in mid-April, he said.
But while the builders say the extensions would promote jobs and economic development, the municipalities are gathering forces to head off what they see as an attempt to circumvent local land-use prerogatives.
William G. Dressel Jr., Assistant Executive Director of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, called the proposal "misdirected" in a letter to legislators and league members. "It is intended to benefit a small segment of the state, namely, land developers, at the expense of prohibiting governmental officials from protecting the citizens."
 
State Land-Use Plan Coming
 Many of New Jersey's counties, townships and boroughs are reviewing their land-use plans in anticipation of a state land-use plan that is scheduled to be published this summer by the State Planning Commission. Local officials, as well as some environmentalists, maintain that the builders are trying to preserve the viability of their plans within a fluid planning environment.
"Local plans are not standing still," said Steve Howard, a lobbyist with the New Jersey Conservation Fund. The municipalities, he said, "can be revising their master plans or changing their zoning, and all of a sudden they are overridden by the Legislature? That would be irksome in the extreme to the people in a municipality."

HEADLINE: Big Gains for European Stocks, but Not in Dollars

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON Jr.

 BODY:
Hefty gains in European stock markets in the first quarter were virtually wiped out, for American investors, by a corresponding rally in the dollar.
Since Jan. 1, several markets in Europe have outpaced the United States market and appeared to offer global investors an attractive alternative to domestic stocks. But an investor happily calculating impressive earnings in a foreign denomination saw them evaporate when converted back into dollars. 
 German and French markets advanced 8.82 and 9.35 percent, for example, while American markets dropped 2.95 percent, according to the Financial Times index of world markets. But in dollar amounts, those gains were watered down to only 0.42 percent for Germany and 1.61 percent for France.
Markets in Sweden and Austria saw nice advances of 12.52 percent and 13.45 percent, but currency differentials reduced the gains to 4.42 percent for Sweden and 3.86 percent for Austria.
Analysts expected the dollar to rise slightly this year, but anticipation of a recovery in the American economy has pushed it higher than many predicted. The dollar closed at 1.64 German marks on Friday, up from 1.52 on Jan. 1.
An essentially flat market in Britain, down 1.22 percent, became an 8.22 percent loss once the dollar differential was factored in. Britain's market reached an all-time high in the fall but has since been listless.
Over all, Mexico's bourse again led the world's markets in the quarter, with now-predictable gains. Capping an advance inspired by an economic policy that has lasted four years, it rose 28.42 percent in the local currency, and 26.42 percent in dollars.
In Asia, Hong Kong's stocks surged nearly as sharply as Japan's fell. The Hong Kong market advanced 17.58 percent, and with Hong Kong dollars closely pegged to the American currency, stock gains are protected from currency fluctuations.
The benchmark Hang Seng index closed Friday at 5,007.58, and analysts predict another spurt of growth in the coming months. Known for its sensitivity to political events in Beijing, Hong Kong's market has surged in recent weeks after a wave of political clues indicating that the economic reformers affiliated with Deng Xiaoping, the senior Chinese leader, had gained the upper hand in a power struggle with conservatives.
 
Hong Kong Hopeful About China
 Mr. Deng has supported nascent securities markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen, although it will probably be at least a few years before foreigners can own more than a nominal amount of stock. But progress in China is opportunity in Hong Kong, and the market reflects fresh confidence.
"We're partly playing catchup," Howard Gorges, managing director of South China Brokerage Ltd., said from Hong Kong. "The market here was suppressed in 1989 because of the Tiananmen crackdown, and last year because of the delay in getting approval for the airport project. Now it's very strong, and there are some real opportunities."
Mr. Gorges said good fundamentals and better-than-expected 1991 earnings had also fueled the boom, which he expects to continue for the rest of the year.
Elsewhere in Asia, the Malaysian market grew 6.97 percent in local currency. But in a rare instance in which the local currency rose more than the dollar, the growth in stocks was worth 12.47 percent in dollars.
Singapore's market, on the other hand, fell by 4.67 percent in the local currency, and by 7.25 percent when translated into dollars.
At the very bottom of the Financial Times listing of 24 markets was Japan, with a decline of 17.07 percent, measured in yen, and a 22.17 percent drop in dollars.

HEADLINE: Budget Office Retreats on Work Health

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
Under pressure from Congress, the Administration's budget office retreated last week from its demand that new occupational-health regulations be delayed to see if their cost would impoverish workers, thereby making them sicker rather than healthier.
Instead of sending the regulations back to the Labor Department for an analysis of that issue, the Office of Management and Budget said it would be satisfied if the department asked for public comment on the question. 
That step would allow the draft regulation to be published, an essential step before it can be put into effect. But even so, several senators of both parties said they were suspicious that the new issue would serve to delay implementation of the proposed regulations, which set limits on exposure to lead and a wide range of toxic chemicals.
The issue arose on March 10, when James B. MacRae Jr., acting administrator of O.M.B.'s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, announced that he was suspending review of regulations affecting the construction, agriculture and maritime industries, a move that would have left the regulations in limbo. He said he was doing so because the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's review of the regulations failed to examine the effect on workers of the costs of compliance.
 
Trying to See a Link
 When regulations impose higher costs on employers, he said, employers sometimes cut wages or reduce employment. That makes workers poorer, he said, and consequently less healthy, because "richer workers on average buy more leisure time, more nutritious food, more preventive health care and smoke and drink less than poorer workers."
In the hearing, Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, said he feared that even inviting public comment would "greatly extend" the time it takes ultimately to get the regulations issued.
At a hearing of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on Wednesday, Mr. Jeffords said the budget office approach had little support among Republicans. He said he could not repeat the expletives used when the issue was discussed in the Republican caucus the previous week.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, chairman of the committee, charged that the entire effort was part of the Bush Administration's "blatant election-year move to cater to business."
 
'A Bit Off the Wall'
 "While this unnecessary controversy goes on, more workers will get sick, and some will die," the Massachusetts Democrat said. "With this Administration's encouragement, businesses will continue to pocket the funds they should be spending to eliminate dangerous conditions in the workplace."
Senator David Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota, said during the hearing of the Labor and Human Resources Committee that the whole idea was "a bit off the wall."
A Labor Department official told the committee that she expected to reach agreement with O.M.B. by the end of last week on how to frame the question for public comment. By the weekend, however, the question had not been settled.
Witnesses at Mr. Kennedy's hearing had argued that the analysis could take years to complete.
 
No Defenders Found
 Mr. MacRae said there were studies suggesting that "each $7.5 million in additional regulatory expenditures may result in one additional death from lowered incomes." Since the costs to employers would come to $163 million annually, he said, that could cause 22 additional deaths -- or more than the 8 to 13 deaths a year OSHA believed the new rules would prevent.
The complaints about the budget office approach, which had no defenders at the hearing, fell into three categories. Mr. Kennedy called it an attempt to revive a weighing of costs and benefits that the Supreme Court had outlawed in 1980 on the grounds that the Occupational Safety and Health Act allowed only consideration of impacts on health.
That argument, in muffled terms, was offered by Nancy Risque Rohrbach, Assistant Secretary of Labor for policy, in her reply to Mr. MacRae on Monday. Mr. Kennedy also put into the record an earlier draft of her letter in which she said Mr. MacRae's approach contradicted the Court decision and Congressional intent.
A second argument was that the approach was based on "speculative hypotheses set forth in a small number of obscure academic publications," as Margaret Seminario, director of occupational safety and health for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., put it.
 
'Cold and Uncaring'?
 She said the O.M.B. reasoning about cause and effect was so badly flawed that it could not form a basis for serious policy making. While some individuals facing a loss of income might smoke less, others might eat less meat, and still others would cancel a vacation. "Neither O.M.B. nor anyone else knows the effect of income reductions on individuals or what the public health consequences will be," she said.
Dr. Anthony Robbins of Boston University, a past president of the American Public Health Association, called the proposals "cold and uncaring."
"I would like to close down O.M.B. for six months so that the economists who daily manipulate data and revel in mischievous speculation could be sent to work on ships, constructing buildings and harvesting crops," he said.
Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, assailed the budget office as too powerful and out of touch with the people. He complained about the "absurd and twisted thinking that less protection saves lives."
A clear purpose of the Congressional effort was to encourage the Labor Department to stand firm against Mr. MacRae and O.M.B. Mr. Jeffords offered the department his "condolences." Mr. Kennedy said, "We want to give the Labor Department all the support it really deserves."

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Up 6.4% in February

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON Jr.

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools rose 6.4 percent last month from January's level, in another sign of renewed economic growth, according to a report to be released today by an industry trade group.
The trade group, the Association for Manufacturing Technology, calculated February's orders at $231.4 million, up from $217.4 million in January. The amount of February orders was down 5.6 percent, however, from the $245.2 million of February 1991. 
 Together with January's figures, year-to-date orders for machine tools totaled $448.8 million, up nine-tenths of a percent from $445.0 million in the first two months of last year.
Of the $231.4 million in total orders, $200.6 million were placed by American companies and $30.8 million were sold for export.
"Domestic orders are off to a good start," Albert W. Moore, president of the association, said in a statement. He noted that domestic machine tool sales had topped $200 million for two consecutive months, while in 1991 domestic sales topped $200 million only three times all year.
The association's statistics combine figures for two kinds of machinery: metal-cutting and metal-forming machines. Each are used to produce a significant number of manufactured goods, from refrigerators and cookware to automobiles and aircraft, and are regarded by economists as one of many indicators of the nation's economic condition.
With exports depressed in recent months, Mr. Moore expressed determination to press ahead with efforts to gain foreign market share, despite concerns that foreign markets may recover more slowly than domestic industries.
"The slow- or no-growth condition in much of Asia and Europe does not mean we should pull back," Mr. Moore said. "Instead, it is precisely the time to invest more in export promotion."
At $30.8 million, export orders of machine tools were more than double the $13.2 million of January, but down sharply from the $80.1 million of February 1991.
"Japan and Germany have always found economic downturns in foreign markets a good time to intensify their efforts and gain foreign market share," Mr. Moore said. "The machine tool industry is now global, and the U.S. industry must continue the successful strategy of diversifying our markets."
Actual shipments of machine tools in February grew faster than orders, soaring 27.2 percent, to $203.2 million, from $159.8 million in January.
The individual statistic that changed most sharply in February from the previous month was export orders for metal-cutting machinery, rising to $19.6 million, from $5.2 million in January. The February total was small, however, compared with the $72.5 million posted in the same category a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Peter Sammartino, 87, Is Dead; Was Fairleigh Dickinson Founder

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Peter Sammartino, the founder of Fairleigh Dickinson University and an early leader in the restoration of Ellis Island, was found shot to death yesterday with his wife, Sylvia, at their home in Rutherford, N.J., in what the police said was a murder-suicide. He was 87 years old and his wife was 88.
The couple had been in failing health. The Bergen County Prosecutor, John J. Fahy, said Mrs. Sammartino had Alzheimer's disease and Dr. Sammartino had undergone surgery to remove a kidney. 
 No note was found. But Mr. Fahy said that Dr. Sammartino had been recently getting his affairs in order and had hinted to friends that he might die soon.
The university Dr. Sammartino founded in the old Ivison Castle in Rutherford is to celebrate its 50th anniversary later this year. He began with 60 students. The initial decision to start a two-year junior college was made four days before the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The next morning Dr. Sammartino and a handful of colleagues reconsidered and, by one vote, decided to proceed.
 
Enrollment of 12,000
 Today Fairleigh Dickinson is the largest private university in New Jersey. It has an enrollment of 12,000 and campuses in Teaneck-Hackensack, Rutherford and Florham Park-Madison, plus a branch in Wroxton, England. Its programs include liberal arts, business administration, dentistry, engineering and education.
Mrs. Sammartino, the former Sylvia (Sally) Scaramelli, served without pay for 14 years as its first director of admissions and retired as dean of admissions. The university's initial financing was $15,000 from Dr. Sammartino, $15,000 from his father-in-law and $30,000 from Col. Fairleigh S. Dickinson, the head of the Becton, Dickinson surgical appliance company, for whom the school was named. The original building cost $21,600. Years later, individual contributions rose into the millions of dollars.
An innovative educator, Dr. Sammartino insisted that teachers visit students in their homes, sent the social sciences department to visit Asia and Africa, dispatched students to the Bowery, coal mines and migrant camps, and required some students to buy a share of stock in any company to study its reports.
When new buildings were planned, the contractors' bids were opened by students at assemblies, and architects were on stage to answer questions. The students voted their recommendations to the trustees. When money ran out on one project, the students decided to complete the work themselves. Dr. Sammartino and the faculty donned overalls to join them.
To impress local business with the college's economic importance, he once paid the staff and faculty in silver dollars, and the merchants quickly took notice. He also a promoted health food, buying chemical-free beef and providing free brewer's yeast and cheap vitamins for students. He was an outspoken critic of water fluoridation.
Dr. Sammartino served as president until he retired in 1967, but remained active at the university and in other causes.
 
Active in Civic Affairs
 He was the president of the New York Cultural Center, in the former Gallery of Modern Art building at Columbus Circle, for five years. The gallery was donated to the university by Huntington Hartford, heir to the A& P fortune. Mr. Sammartino was also on the board of the State Opera Society. He was the founder and chairman of the Restore Ellis Island Committee, but he retired from the effort in 1978. He also founded the International Association of University Professors and served as its president.
He was chairman of an eight-town economic development commission and vice president of the New Jersey Constitutional Convention and the National Italian-Americans Foundation. He also participated in the President's Commission on Higher Education, the White House Conference on Education, the Peace Corps advisory board and the National Board of Foreign Scholarships. He worked to improve services for the hearing-impaired, of which he was one.
Dr. Sammartino was born in New York City. He graduated from City College in 1924 at New York University earned a master's degree in education in 1928 and a doctorate in 1931. The idea for Fairleigh Dickinson grew out of his work for 10 years at the New College, an experimental school at Columbia University's Teachers College. He wrote more than a dozen books on education.
Mrs. Sammartino was born in Boston. She graduated from Smith College and earned a master's degree in history from Columbia. She was chairwoman of the State Commission on Women and president of the Garden State Ballet Foundation.
A university spokeswoman said she did not know of any immediate survivors.
A maid found the Sammartinos bodies in the bedroom of their home in Rutherford early yesterday afternoon, after she suspected something was amiss and forced open the locked door.
The police recovered a .38-caliber revolver. Mrs. Sammartino was shot in the temple and Dr. Sammartino was shot in the mouth, Mr. Fahy said. The last time the couple were seen alive was 4:30 P.M. Saturday, when the maid left the house for the day.

HEADLINE: In Hoboken, Debate Over Waterfront Plan Heats Up as Vote Looms

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOBOKEN, N.J., March 29

 BODY:
This city is in the throes of a pre-election blitz. Campaigners are meeting commuters at the bus, train and ferry depots. Pamphleteers are canvassing the rows of tightly packed houses. There are posters and buttons, fund-raisers and rallies, and plenty of debates.
At issue here for the second time in less than two years is the future of Hoboken's historic waterfront. On Tuesday, voters in the mile-square city of 33,400 will decide whether to enter a waterfront redevelopment agreement with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The previous referendum on the question was narrowly defeated in July 1990. This time, those on both sides say the contest is a dead heat. 
 The debate is not whether the moldering Hudson River port should be developed. Most here believe it should. Voters are grappling with whether the development proposed is the right kind, for the right reasons and with the right partnership.
 
Looking for Jobs
 To proponents, led by a recently formed City Hall contingent called the People for Hoboken's Future, the agreement with the authority means 4,500 new jobs, new recreation areas for the city's children and new revenues to stabilize the city's property tax rate, one of the highest in the state.
Opponents, led by a citizens' group called the Coalition for a Better Waterfront, say that while there is no guarantee the plan will bring benefits, it is certain to give too much away to the Port Authority, wreak havoc on the environment and ruin Hoboken's small scale and charm.
And to some other residents, the plan and the issues swirling around it have been too complex and confusing to follow.
"I don't understand what any of them are talking about," said Luis Rivera, 21, who moved to the northwest end of Hoboken two years ago.
The city's plan is a scaled-back version of the one defeated in 1990. It proposes a 20-story office tower and nine-story hotel on a 5.5-acre pier near the city's transportation terminal and two residential buildings, 21 and 17 stories, just west of the pier. The plan also calls for a new athletic field and for expanding the city's Little League baseball field. The rest of the milelong stretch of waterfront would be developed with the advice of a citizens advisory committee.
 
Accusations Fly
 Those favoring the plan have accused its opponents of being interested only in whether development blocks their view of the river. Those against it say the promise of jobs is a pipe dream -- that city officials are most interested in a political victory and short-term payments to fix a hole in Hoboken's budget.
The thorniest issue for the city is the lease agreement with the Port Authority. Under the agreement, the Port Authority would lease the pier and the parcels next to it for 55 years. In exchange, the agency would pay the city $3.25 million as soon as the referendum is passed, part of $20 million in fixed lease payments.
The Port Authority would also prepare the site for development, build the waterfront park and expand the Little League field. It would sublease the property to developers, giving the city 20 percent of the gross revenues for the first 35 years and 60 percent for the remaining 20 years.
Opponents say the plan cedes controls of the city's most valuable asset for peanuts. The Port Authority would have a $10.25 lien on the property -- the $3.25 million it would hand out once the referendum passes, plus $7 million it handed the city in 1989, before the first plan was defeated.
But proponents say the lien means only that the Port Authority would get its money back if Hoboken entered into an agreement with a developer and without the Port Authority. And they say the waterfront, which lost its last link to the busy heyday immortalized in Elia Kazan's "On the Waterfront" when the Maxwell House plant closed less than two weeks ago, could lie dormant for years if the plan is not approved.
Tom Newman, a City Councilman who is the leading spokesman for the plan, said: "Three years ago, when the private developers of the world were beating down the doors to get a shot at the waterfront, I argued that we didn't need the Port Authority to prime the pump for us in order to attract investors. But now, we're in a recession. There's nobody out there with $100 million ready to invest in Hoboken."
But Ron Hine, a leading member of the Coalition for a Better Waterfront, said he believes that just as the recession halted the legions of potential investors, the coming recovery would bring enough of them back to enable Hoboken to make choices.
"That's another of the city's big lies -- that the Port Authority is the only investor we could find," said Mr. Hine, whose group has proposed an alternative development plan for the entire length of the waterfront. The plan calls for a milelong esplanade, 19 blocks of mixed residential and commercial development and and more than 20 acres of new parks.
But Mr. Newman said the city needs a plan now. "We have to deal with dire realities," he said. "The plan we have before the voters may not be my ideal plan but it's one I can live with."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Phone Company Growing Rapidly

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
IN Monroe, La., is a little-known company worth more than $1 billion -- Century Telephone Enterprises Inc., a rarity in the telephone business. Last year, Century's profits rose 20 percent, in an industry where earnings gains in the single digits are considered a good performance. Some analysts expect the company's annual earnings growth to exceed 25 percent for the rest of the decade.
"This is a growth company disguised as a telephone company," said John P. Reddan, a media and communications analyst at Moran & Associates in Greenwich, Conn. Century has consistently performed better than analysts' estimates, Mr. Reddan noted. 
 Century Telephone has a large cellular telephone business that it has been investing in for several years. The operation is about to break even, analysts say, probably in the quarter ending this month or the quarter ending on June 30. Proponents of the stock say investors can essentially get its cellular properties for free.
Rather than buy expensive cellular telephone properties in big cities, Century Telephone has bought cheaper rural properties next door. It has reaped benefits when big-city subscribers paid "roamer fees" to use Century's network when they made calls during trips or commuting home. Century's mainstay conventional telephone network has grown largely through acquisition and internal growth, again away from the big cities.
While analysts think highly of the company, they are divided on whether to buy its stock. Some recommend purchase, but others say it is substantially overpriced at 29 times earnings.
Century Telephone closed Friday at $34.875 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, down 37.5 cents and close to its 52-week high of $37.25. With 31.3 million shares outstanding, Century Telephone's market capitalization is nearly $1.1 billion.
Analysts expect earnings to be in the range of $1.45 a share for 1992 and $2.10 for 1993. But part of the hesitancy among some analysts about the stock is its relatively rich price compared with annual cash flow, about $7 for every $1 of estimated 1992 cash flow, compared with $6 or less for other telephone companies.
Most huge telephone companies, like the GTE Corporation and the regional Bell operating companies, have been struggling in the last year or so. With nearly 80 percent of the market for local telephone service, they have steady revenue and guaranteed earnings as near-monopolies but often must confront openly hostile regulators who want to keep rates low for consumers. The recession has hurt the big companies' revenue at a time when labor costs, often the majority of their operating costs, remain high.
Like others among the nearly 1,300 telephone companies that make up the other 20 percent of the local phone market, Century Telephone has benefited from the lower operating and maintenance costs found in rural areas. And analysts laud it for being one of the best managed of the smaller phone companies, with an emphasis on holding down costs without sacrificing performance.
In the states where Century has most of its conventional telephone operations -- Louisiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Arkansas -- regulators have not been as hostile to it as other states' regulators have been to phone companies. In Texas, for example, carriers sometimes find it difficult to recover costs, analysts say.
What most excites analysts is Century's cellular properties. Mr. Reddan of Moran & Associates, values Century's conventional telephone service at $1.3 billion, or $42 a share. In valuing the cellular business, he says that Century has 3.7 million potential subscribers, or "pops," in urban areas, at $195 a pop, and another 1.9 million potential subscribers in rural areas, at about $100 a pop. That means, he concludes, Century's cellular properties are worth about $29 a share.
Alexander Alma, an analyst at Martin Simpson & Company, projects that by 1993 the cellular business will be at least 25 percent of Century's annual revenue, or more than double the proportion of 1991 and 1992. Earnings will be more than 25 percent cellular, Mr. Alma estimates, compared with today's earnings, which are all from conventional telephone service.
Analysts agree that the cellular properties will perform well, compared with the nearly $5 million loss in 1991, but are divided about how well. Joel D. Gross, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., for example, expects cellular and a small operation in electronic pagers to be profitable this quarter, with their combined operating income estimated at $4.4 million in 1992, and 1993 income estimated at $13.2 million.
Mr. Reddan of Moran & Associates, on the other hand, estimated that 1992 operating income would be 60 percent more, or $7 million, and about 5 percent more in 1993, or $13.8 million.
Mr. Gross of Donaldson, Lufkin gets queasy, however, when his computer says Century Telephone is fully priced at about $35 a share. He said that he was neutral on short-term purchase but that the stock was fine for long-term accumulation.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Some Predict Era of Low Inflation

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Although last week's report on gross domestic product showed that inflation has been extraordinarily low lately, most economists expect prices to revive along with the economy.
Earlier this month, for example, the Blue Chip consensus of 50 forecasters predicted that the nation's price level would rise about 4 percent a year -- twice the rate of the last nine months -- for the rest of the decade. 
 But some contrariant Federal Reserve officials and private economists think that inflation is likely to stay as low as it did during the 1960's, when it ran around 2 percent. They are trying to convert bond investors to this view.
"Largely due to actions which took place before I joined the Fed, we have a good chance to achieve effective price stability in America by mid-decade," Lawrence B. Lindsay, a newly appointed Fed governor, told members of the Government Bond Club of New England in a speech two weeks ago.
 
Unexpected Consequences
 If Mr. Lindsay is right, some of the consequences for individuals and the economy could be quite unexpected. Most startling, lower inflation would have the same impact on the economy as a supply-side tax cut aimed at raising savings and investment.
"There is a widespread consensus in the economics profession that higher rates of saving and capital accumulation would be beneficial to the U.S. economy," said Mr. Lindsay, once the most prominent supply-side economist in the Bush Administration and a former professor of public finance at Harvard University.
"Numerous schemes have been advanced to achieve this end through the tax system," he said. "The point is that disinflation would produce much the same result."
Few members of Mr. Lindsay's under-40 generation of public finance experts would disagree. "We have a tax system that is not indexed for inflation," said James Poterba at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Inflation raises the tax burden on capital."
Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company and a budget official in the Reagan Administration, agreed. "Very few people consider the tax implications of the inflation rate."
 
Raising After-Tax Returns
 A permanent drop in inflation raises the after-tax returns of savings and investment. The reason: When Congress revised the tax code in the mid-1980's to eliminate "bracket creep," which forced taxpayers to pay higher income taxes merely because inflation had swelled nominal incomes, the tax-writing body did not do the same for most kinds of investment income. Owners of bonds or real estate, for example, must pay taxes on nominal gains, which merely reflect inflation.
Consider how lower inflation would slash capital gains taxes. On the books, the capital gains tax rate is 28 percent. In real terms, however, with 4 percent inflation, the effective tax on the real gains from selling an asset held for three or four years is more than twice as high.
"The net effect of our tax system, coupled with current levels of inflation, is to make the effective tax rate on real capital gains well over 50 percent," Mr. Lindsay said.
Mr. Kudlow of Bear, Stearns estimated that a drop in inflation of two percentage points, from 4 percent to 2 percent, would slash the effective capital gains tax rate by about 20 percent.
 
Benefits for Business
 For businesses that buy new equipment, lower inflation amounts to an investment tax credit, Mr. Lindsay argued. A two-percentage-point decline in inflation is roughly equivalent to a 2 percent investment tax credit, he figured.
The reason is that businesses are allowed to deduct capital outlays from their incomes over a period of years. Income -- or in this case, a depreciation allowance -- a few years off is worth more or less depending on how much it must be discounted to account for the level of interest rates. Lower inflation makes depreciation more valuable because interest rates typically come down with inflation.
Lower inflation would also bolster the payoff to savers, just as a cut in the top income tax rate would.
It is just a matter of arithmetic. If bond yields are 8 percent and savers pay 30 percent of their interest income in Federal taxes, that means a bondholder's nominal after-tax return is 5.6 percent. With 4 percent inflation, their real return shrinks to 1.6 percent.
Now consider what happens when inflation remains at 2 percent. Interest rates may decline to 6 percent, but the after-tax return still manages to go up, to 4.2 percent. After taking inflation into account, the return is 2.2 percent, or nearly 40 percent higher than if inflation were 4 percent.
"Even though market rates are lower, the real rate of return is higher," Mr. Kudlow said. "The dollar buys more."
 
Other Factors Necessary
 To be sure, skeptics would say that higher returns alone would not necessarily produce more savings and investment. Real returns rose sharply when inflation fell from double digits to less than 5 percent in the early 1980's, but personal saving actually declined and business investment was about average. But most economists agree with Mr. Lindsay that higher real returns can only help.
As with any tax cut, there are winners and losers when inflation falls.
In the long run, Mr. Lindsay argues, lower inflation could make income distribution more equal.
For one thing, some of the measured gain in the incomes of the well-to-do has been caused by sharply higher interest income. But that income, Mr. Lindsay said, is partly compensation for the erosion of financial wealth from inflation and would decline with inflation. For another, the fact that housing would become more affordable should make the distribution of wealth more equal by spreading homeownership more widely.
What Mr. Lindsay does not say is that in the short run, lower-than-expected inflation would hurt borrowers and benefit lenders until interest rates adjusted downward, much as they did in similar episodes at the beginning of the 1980's. In the 1970's, of course, the tables were turned when inflation ended up much higher than expected.

HEADLINE: Travel Slows at Local Airports

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
Constrained by the recession and the economic effects of the Persian Gulf war, the total number of travelers who passed through the region's three main airports declined sharply last year, according to a report released yesterday by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The overall number of passengers who used the three airports -- Kennedy International, La Guardia and Newark International -- fell 8.7 percent, from 74.8 million in 1990 to 68.3 million last year, the Port Authority said. The decline erased the slight increase of 0.5 percent that the airports had posted in 1990, compared with 1989. 
 The total decline came despite slight gains at Newark International, where passenger traffic climbed from 22.25 million in 1990 to 22.28 million last year.
Prof. Mitchell L. Moss, director of the New York University Urban Research Center, said the passenger figures reflected the economic fragility of the region, which, he said, lost 400,000 jobs last year.
"We had fewer people employed here," Professor Moss said. "And the firms were not only laying off people but were cutting back on their travel budgets."
 
Gulf War Cuts Travel
 In addition to the recession, Richard C. Leone, chairman of the Port Authority, cited the Gulf war as a factor. He said travelers were deterred from flying in early 1991 by fears of terrorism and by higher ticket prices, which rose in response to increased jet fuel costs.
"The good news is that we saw what may be the beginning of an upturn late in the year," Mr. Leone said in a statement.
Of the three airports, La Guardia had the worst year, with passenger traffic falling 13.5 percent, from 22.8 million in 1990 to 19.7 million last year, the authority said. The number of passengers at Kennedy dropped 11.6 percent, from 29.8 million in 1990 to 26.3 million last year.
The narrow increase at Newark, Mr. Leone said, was fueled in part by an 8.6 percent rise in international traffic.

HEADLINE: Transit Vote Shows Split In Union

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Lou Corradi thinks of himself as a loyal union man, the son of a transit worker and a longtime supporter of Sonny Hall, the president of the transit workers' union. But Mr. Corradi could not even wait to bring his D train to a complete halt at the end of its run in Coney Island the other day before beginning a broad denunciation of his union and the tentative three-year contract that union leaders had negotiated with management.
"The workers are disgusted," Mr. Corradi said. "This really struck a chord." 
 Mr. Corradi was among thousands of New York City subway and bus workers who voted earlier this month, nearly 2 to 1, to reject the contract endorsed by the leaders of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union. The union has now asked the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to reopen negotiations. Because transit officials say they have no more money to offer, the renewed bargaining is not likely to last long, and the dispute appears bound for arbitration.
The rejection of the contract was the first time in memory that the union's members had turned down a pact supported by the leadership. And while the vote clearly hinged on basic bread-and-butter issues -- including concessions on salary and health care -- it also exposed publicly some internal tensions that have been dividing the once monolithic local.
 
An Unusual Rejection
 To New Yorkers familiar with the iron-fisted reigns of colorful transit union leaders like Michael J. Quill and John E. Lawe, the sight of their successor, Sonny Hall, being rebuffed by young union members concerned about participatory democracy and women's rights was disconcerting, if not revolutionary.
Among other things, the rejection of the contract, by a vote of 13,110 to 7,220, reflected the rise of New Directions, a faction within the union that began challenging Mr. Hall's leadership four years ago over dissatisfaction with two contracts negotiated in the 1980's.
New Directions organized much of the campaign against the contract, distributing literature, putting together demonstrations and generally making its critique of the proposal known throughout the city's vast mass-transit system.
"They showed more concern about the membership than the union leadership did," said Mr. Corradi, although he added that he was skeptical of the dissident faction and was uncertain whether he would vote for their slate in the next union election, in three years.
Michael Clark, another train operator who was taking a break between runs in Coney Island, said that New Directions had done a better job explaining its position. "They came out here and they talked with us," he said. "We only see the other guys when it's election time."
The vote also reflected generational conflicts and changes in the composition of the transit work force, which in recent years has come to include many more women and more black and Hispanic workers. And it underscored a longstanding split within divisions of the transit system.
 
Women's Issues Mattered
 Most of the support for the contract came from bus drivers and other employees of the bus division in Manhattan and the Bronx, the traditional stronghold of the union's leaders, including Mr. Hall. Much of the opposition came from subway workers. Train operators, for example, rejected the pact by a margin of nearly 20 to 1.
"It was not so much this particular contract that upset us," Mr. Clark said. "It's been building up, an accumulation of issues."
Many women who work on the subways as conductors, train operators and car cleaners said that they had been angered because the union's leaders did not press issues important to them, including guaranteeing light duties for pregnant workers and more generous leaves for mothers and fathers of newborns.
"That was very important to me," said Denise, a car cleaner in Coney Island who declined to give her last name. "If I have a baby, I have no benefits."
Corine Scott, a train operator who is a member of New Directions, said that many matters of concern to women were simply ignored by union leaders in their discussions with management. "Sonny never took these seriously," Ms. Scott said.
 
'Money Is the Issue'
 It is hard to measure whether race, too, has played a role in the dissension within the union, many black and Hispanic workers said.
The slates offered by New Directions in the last two union elections, in 1988 and again last year, contained many black and Hispanic candidates. But within Mr. Hall's circle, the union establishment, there are also a number of minority-group members, reflecting perhaps that the proportion of black and Hispanic workers within the transit system has grown enormously in recent decades. Mr. Hall is white.
Mr. Clark, who is black, said he thought there might be some racial aspects to the union insurgency, but he offered no specific examples. Another black transit worker, a car inspector who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he thought race played no part in the contract's defeat. "Money is the issue, not color," he said.
New Directions is an informal group, with no officers and a core of several hundred active members. The total union has about 32,000 members.
New Directions' candidate for local president, Tim Schermerhorn, won about one-quarter of the vote in the 1988 union election, said Steve Downs, a train operator who is a member.
Mr. Schermerhorn, who is also a train operator, won about a third of the vote last year and New Directions won nine seats on the union's 39-seat executive board, said Mr. Downs, who was one of the successful board candidates. The group wants the union to work more openly with its membership, consulting them more before they negotiate with management. It also wants more union jobs to be elective and not appointive, he said.
"In our view, there was a decided lack of democracy in the union," Mr. Downs said. "There was a feeling that the leadership was out of touch."
But Mr. Downs also said that the defeat of the contract reflected broad dissatisfaction with its provisions. It would be a mistake, he said, to view the rejection as simply the result of an internal power struggle.
"I think it is an important breakthrough, but it was not just New Direction's doing that the contract was voted down," Mr. Downs said. "There was widespread displeasure over the contract, and so we don't take credit for it."
Mr. Hall was equally candid in his own assessment of the vote, saying that he was surprised by the strength of the opposition and chastened by the outcome.
He had argued for the last two months that the tentative agreement with the M.T.A. was the best that could be obtained during the recession. It called for a 4.5 percent raise this year, a 2 percent raise next year and a $1,000 payment to cover inflation since last May, when the old contract expired.
Mr. Hall said he still believed that he had wrung from transit officials all that he could, but that he had clearly failed to convince his members of it. "I think there is a lot of merit to the fact that we have failed to spend the amount of time that we should out in the field," Mr. Hall said. "We've made a major mistake."
He said he believed the proposed contract was superior to any now being negotiated by unions representing other city or state workers, but that his members have made it clear that they want more. "I think the vast majority of the members were telling us, 'You've got to go back and get us more,' " Mr. Hall said.
"It's a tough one for me to handle," said Mr. Hall, who was re-elected president last November. "But I really believe that what's happened is that the internal factions, the people who want to be leaders of the union, were able to capture their minds."
The only way to wring additional money and concessions, he said, would be to convince the state to increase its operating subsidies to the transit agency, and that will be no easy undertaking, given the state's fiscal problems. "If we can't, then I don't know how we can resolve the contract in a peaceful way," Mr. Hall said.

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook;
Jerry Brown, Peronist

BYLINE: By DAVID C. UNGER

 BODY:
It's June 1973, the year before Jerry Brown was first elected Governor of California. Argentina's repackaged populist legend, Juan Peron, returns to Buenos Aires in triumph. As his plane approaches, more than a million impassioned supporters line the expressway. They constitute an impossibly broad coalition: countercultural revolutionaries, blue-collar workers, Catholic mystics, hard-core fascists.
Just how impossibly broad seemed clear minutes later when gunfire erupted and Peronists, united only by their hero's stirring oratory, started shooting Peronists. Even so, the coalition endured; a few months later, Peron was elected President. 
 America is not Argentina. And Jerry Brown remains a long shot for the Democratic nomination, let alone for President. Still, there is an instructive parallel. Playing fast and loose with powerful political emotions, he offers himself, like Peron, as the leader of an impossibly broad coalition. Recklessly, he courts different constituencies with different, even contradictory positions. Which would guide him as President? If his candidacy is for real, there has to come a moment of truth.
Mr. Brown has come this far largely on the strength of what urban teen-agers call attitude -- a stance that only angry outsiders can be trusted not to sell out. He reaches out like a snarling Oliver Stone hero or rap star to audiences turned off by conventional politics.
He does democracy a huge favor when he exhorts alienated voters to re-enter politics. But so far he has offered his followers only the rush of protest. He's quick with scattershot debating points. Translating them into policies could leave even his most enthusiastic supporters feeling betrayed. Having spent eight years as a competent governor of the largest state, he knows government inside out. He's too smart for his inconsistencies to arise from ignorance. They smack, rather, of a renegade's bid to tap the politics of anger.
Jerry Brown, of the pilgrimages to Calcutta, Africa and Japan, is a convinced internationalist. As a Californian, he well understands the growing integration of the U.S. and Mexican economies. As Governor, he outspokenly favored the trend. Just last month, he impatiently reminded a debate questioner that aiding Russia creates jobs and markets for Americans.
But this month in Michigan, he played to auto workers' fears, indicting free trade for letting good jobs slip south of the border. Now, back in trade-dependent New York, Mr. Brown does a double reverse, denying that he's a protectionist and recalling that his home state's economy also depends on trade.
Consider the issue of abortion. Jerry Brown, graying alumnus of the California 1960's, believes in full reproductive rights for women. But he also agrees with Mother Teresa that abortion is "the killing of the unborn."
Consider the Middle East. Last week he told Ted Koppel on ABC that as President, he would do all in his power to stop Israeli settlements in the West Bank. But, he added, he wouldn't withhold U.S. loan guarantees over the issue. All in his power?
Jerry Brown is fast on his feet. He argues that his diverse positions can be reconciled. Maybe so, metaphysically. Rather than programmatic consistency, he offers attitudinal consistency: a sharp-edged anger that resonates among a variety of Americans. If he wants the rest of America to pay attention, he'll need to start translating attitude into plausible proposals.

HEADLINE: Icy Words on Global Warming

 BODY:
Words matter, words wound. Asked last week whether he planned to attend the "Earth Summit" in Rio de Janeiro in June, Mr. Bush replied that "running for the Presidency" might keep him at home. Asked whether he would sign a treaty limiting the emission of gases that contribute to the threat of global warming, the President said not if it threatens American jobs.
It's true that stricter controls on fossil fuels could affect economic growth. But Mr. Bush's comments conveyed a parochial indifference and dismayed a universe of friends -- developing countries seeking Western assistance, European allies willing to take risks for a cleaner environment and the 105 heads of state who will attend the conference. 
 As the President surely knows, those leaders confront the same tough choices he does. The Rio meeting has one central theme: "sustainable development." That means finding ways to build the economies of rich and poor nations alike without wrecking the environment.
No easy task, especially for the poor. For example, the conference seeks to slow the wanton destruction of the world's rain forests. Poor countries, however, see the forests as sources of jobs and revenue. Thus the U.S. is not the only country which fears that environmental restrictions will limit growth. Yet the U.S. has been uniquely sluggish in the pre-Rio negotiations. Why? The main problem is a proposed binding treaty on global warming. Several European countries and Japan have urged that by the year 2000 all nations cap emissions of carbon dioxide -- the chief gas implicated in trapping heat in the atmosphere -- at 1990 levels. That scares White House officials, who fear that restricting fuels that produce carbon dioxide, like oil and coal, would be too costly.
Yet if the U.S., the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, doesn't move, what incentive is there for poor countries, whose development depends on fossil fuels, to make sacrifices?
It should not be impossible for the U.S. to sign the treaty. Data available to Mr. Bush suggest that even if the U.S. did nothing new, greenhouse gases would increase by only 5 percent by the year 2000. A few additional measures -- wider use of clean fuels like natural gas or further conservation incentives for utilities -- might do the trick with little pain.
If Mr. Bush still refuses to accept the cap, the language of diplomacy might help. The treaty could simply call for measures that aim at, but do not guarantee, carbon dioxide stabilization by the turn of the century.
In any case, there's no longer much doubt that global warming is a worrisome prospect. What is in doubt is America's resolve. Mr. Bush should go to the conference, carrying a commitment to the well-being of the earth.

China's Silent Upheaval

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"The word is racing gleefully through Beijing intellectual circles," reported The New York Times's Nicholas Kristof early this year, "that an impeccably reliable American political forecaster, renowned for his clairvoyance, has declared that there will be immense changes in China in 1992."
This mysterious Nostradamus (a prophet without honor in his own country) has already been proven partly right. 
 Chinese Communist hard-liners led by the ideologue Chen Yun, 86, saw the disintegration of the Soviet Union as proof that reform was heresy, and that decentralization was "economic warlordism." They viewed the Tiananmen crackdown as sensible precaution, and sneered at "peaceful evolution" as a sellout to capitalism.
That brought the old anti-Maoist economic reformer, Deng Xiaoping, 87, rolling out of bed for his last hurrah. "Some comrades inside the party remain muddleheaded," he charged. "Had it not been for our reform over the past 10 years, our situation could have been worse than the U.S.S.R.'s."
China-watchers tell of the cultural struggle between the rigid north and the freewheeling south; between the inward-looking Yellow-River mindset of the interior and the "blue-water" mindset of the ports of Shanghai and Guangzhou, formerly Canton. Mao and Chen Yun were Yellow-River; Zhou Enlai and Deng were blue-water.
Although Deng maintains "we cannot do without dictatorship," he sees the need for the sort of capitalism now burgeoning in the blue-water provinces. To dramatize his case, the old man went on a final campaign tour of China's southern models of free-ish enterprise.
With control of the party to be decided this fall at the 14th Congress, the battle was joined. "Whoever is opposed to reform," Deng told the Chen faction, "must leave office." That was a warning to Prime Minister Li Peng, disliked by reformers and hated by intellectuals, who tries to straddle the fence between hard-line leftists and capitalist-roaders.
Editors put in power by the crackdown crew after the Tiananmen massacre blacked out Deng's tour. We are only now getting accounts of Deng's divisive speeches (a good argument for starting Radio Free Asia). But his strange message is getting through: Communism can succeed only through an infusion of capitalism. "The main danger in thought inside the party comes from some people's refusal to admit that Marxism needs continuous development and revision."
For the paramount Communist leader to call for theoretical "revision" is a very big thing. Revisionism is counterrevolutionary, a sin ascribed by diehards to Gorbachev.
Deng is not talking about political freedom. He thinks the only way to hold together the 50 ethnic groups that make up China, not to mention Taiwan and Tibet, is to buy stability through prosperity. Deng talks of "emancipating the mind," but he means that China is more easily ruled if the people have full bellies rather than free minds.
I think he's wrong about that: political and economic freedom are ultimately one and inseparable. But friends of mine in China who were distressed by the 1989 crackdown are now encouraged by Deng's 1992 counterattack. They say that the Soviet mistake was in putting glasnost before perestroika. They prefer a more orderly upheaval, believing that if China first puts capitalism to work, political freedom will follow.
President Bush accepts Deng's half a loaf, and refuses to apply economic pressure to win human-rights gains. (Last week, he applied such pressure to get China's vote to isolate Libya, negating what little principle undergirded his policy of placating Beijing.)
We should be publicizing Deng's campaign, reaching out to his disciple, Zhu Rongji, while freezing out Chun's followers.
As we hail most of Deng's "four modernizations," the U.S. should remind Beijing of what the dissenter Wei Jingsheng, still in jail after 13 years, called the fifth modernization -- democracy. Hunger has different forms; freedom to think can be as nourishing as freedom to eat.
Will my off-the-wall soothsaying of "China convulses, goes democratic" come true? The timing may be optimistic, but rub the crystal ball: see how the suppressed story of Deng's tour has brought creative instability to this Year of the Monkey.

HEADLINE: How to Turn Our Guns Into Their Butter

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "How to Lose the Cold War" (Op-Ed, March 10), Daniel Schorr cites Richard M. Nixon's warning of a "new despotism" in the former Soviet Union that would spread rapidly. What better way to save the "cold war victory" than for President Bush and Congress to start a new Marshall Plan for the former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe and to meet United Nations peacekeeping costs.
To underwrite these bold initiatives for true national security, $10 billion can be transferred from the proposed House of Representatives defense budget of $287.2 billion for fiscal year 1993, to be combined with equal contributions by Japan and the European Community. Such a program would generate exports, lift the world economy out of recession and create lasting jobs for our defense workers and the troops who would come home. 
 Starting in 1947, the United States could afford $12 billion for the original Marshall Plan by cutting military spending 90 percent within three years after World War II. In contrast President Bush proposes a minuscule 6 percent cut by 1997.
The House provides that the cut of $9.2 billion to date is to be used for defense worker retraining, deficit reduction and public investment. The additional $10 billion can be taken from programs obviously not needed with the end of the cold war including all nuclear testing, production of B-2 bombers, antiballistic missiles, almost all "Star Wars" and a great many of the 395 United States military bases on foreign soil.
An even larger total cut of $25 billion has been urged by many members of Congress and more than 100 national organizations.
The President and Congress must be told to find in the defense budget the emergency funds that President Nixon calls for to insure the "victory of freedom."

To the Editor:
In "America Only" (editorial, March 10), you ask: "why on earth does the Administration allow the Defense Department alone to define the terms of the national debate on U.S. strategy after the cold war?" And, further, why don't the State Department and the National Security Council also weigh in?
A large part of the answer is that all three institutions operate as a well-oiled foreign policy machine that emphasizes military power over economic and cultural influence. As a career diplomat and economist member of the Secretary of State's policy planning and coordination staff during the false detente of the early 1970's, I raised that issue to fellow diplomats. Young diplomats sick of rationalizing Vietnam to disbelieving industrial democracies were then more worried about losing Europe than Indochina. 
 President Nixon and Henry Kissinger had come up with a plan to normalize economic and cultural relations with the Communist world. However, the State Department was staffed and organized to wage economic and ideological war to contain Communism. Its deeply imbedded world view was that of a policeman, rather than a merchant. A departmental purge would have been necessary to implement a new policy, followed by a reorganization along the lines of modern European foreign ministries that stress economics and culture over war.
The Department of State was not made over but further militarized during the stand-tall Reagan-Bush era. It is naive today to expect that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d or his senior Foreign Service deputies will change the institution that serves their careers so well. More likely would be their recommendation for a well-orchestrated attack on Libya or Iraq to contain terrorism, instead of Communism, and which could extend their collective reign for at least another four years.
Our deepening economic and cultural crisis will someday sweep in a President and Congress determined to fix our broken foreign policy apparatus.

To the Editor:
Re "U.S. Strategy Plan Calls for Insuring No Rivals Develop" (front page, March 8):
Dwight Eisenhower, a military man, left us a warning against the military-industrial complex, which exploits world tensions for its own ends. Now the demise of the Russian bear has diminished tensions, so scenarios are invented to sustain them. 
John Foster Dulles, Eisenhower's first Secretary of State, told how:
"In order to bring a nation to support the burdens of maintaining great military establishments, it is necessary to create an emotional state akin to war psychology. There must be a portrayal of external menace. This involves . . . arousing the population to a sense of sacrifice. Once these exist, we have gone a long way on the path of war."
Those who profit from turmoil, fearing for their power as peace breaks out, are trying to resurrect the open channel between the arms makers and the United States Treasury. This combination went on a spending spree under Ronald Reagan, leaving us with rusting weapons and a staggering deficit. Now they offer us the gallant image of America against the world when there has been a billionfold increase in the power and delivery of weapons.
The recession has made citizens skeptical of the cover stories that explain why the infrastructure deteriorated while the military-industrial complex became bloated. They are asking why the peace dividend is being appropriated to the same end.
It is not insignificant that the text of the Pentagon's bellicose plan was not sent to Congress, the representatives of the people.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The Russian Sinkhole

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
As the U.S. foreign policy establishment stampedes toward a megabillion-dollar comprehensive "aid" program for the ex-Soviet Union, consider the following facts:
* These states have 44 nuclear power plants, including 15 of the Chernobyl style, many of which are in terrible shape and could spring radioactive leaks. One near St. Petersburg leaked two weeks ago. 
 * Ukraine and Kazakhstan now threaten to take control of intercontinental-range missiles on their territory. If they do, they would instantly become the third- and fourth-largest nuclear powers after the U.S. and Russia.
* Russia's debt is running at 25 percent of total Government expenditures for the first quarter of this year. There is massive underpayment of taxes by business enterprises and local governments.
* Wages have dropped so low relative to freed prices that some 90 percent of Russians now live below subsistence levels. Subsistence is about 1,500 rubles monthly, while per capita income now totals about 900 rubles monthly or $8.25. Life will get much worse if, as expected, production in key sectors falls an additional 50 percent this year.
* The ex-Soviet states are now meeting only 30 percent of their interest payments (and almost no principal) on debts to the West of $70 billion. Most of this is owed to or guaranteed by Western governments.
* Various forms of Western aid to the ex-Soviet states totaled about $50 billion in the last 20 months, and the money has virtually disappeared without a trace or a dent on the economic picture. Tens of billions in hard currency controlled by Communist Party officials also vanished in the last two years.
These sad facts -- plus civil and ethnic wars and the lack of cooperation among the ex-Soviet republics -- suggest that the new states are nearing military, economic and political anarchy.
Such considerations should cause American political leaders to think again, and hard, about rescue plans. The danger is that we will waste billions and, even more tragically, fail to zero in on what can be realistically accomplished by outside aid.
My particular concern is Richard Nixon's recent proposal for a comprehensive aid plan. He argued that anything less would ignite a "Who lost Russia?" debate. He accused President Bush of playing "a penny-ante game" where the stakes were geopolitical survival. He called for tens of billions of dollars to stabilize the ruble and more tens of billions in other help. He made more modest and practical proposals as well. But the practical ideas have gotten lost in the political scramble he triggered.
Mr. Bush, stung by the Nixon charges, is now under the gun to present a bigger-bucks plan than he would otherwise have done. Governor Clinton, the leading Democratic Presidential contender, could try to outbid him in a major world affairs address Wednesday. Congressional leaders and foreign policy gurus are also jumping on the now fashionable big-bucks, big-plan bandwagon.
The West should be working on plans for big aid programs -- currency stabilization, import and export credits and the like. But these plans have to be for later, when and if the threat of anarchy subsides and some stability returns. Any cash given now would simply vanish down a vast sinkhole.
For now, Western governments should not throw away their aid on saving governments that can only save themselves. Instead, they should focus on specific, pressing and solvable problems and on seeding the future of democracy.
First priority must go to the nukes. This means immediate help to repair or shut down unsafe nuclear reactors. It means talking very tough with Ukraine and others about their nuclear weapons aspirations and putting experts on the ground now to help them dismantle weapons.
The second priority should be agriculture and food aid. Without bread, the return of dictatorships is inevitable.
The third priority has to be sending experts and technical aid directly to groups committed to running businesses and making democracy work.
The stakes could not be higher. All the more reason for substantial, practical and immediate aid -- not for grand illusions.

HEADLINE: Their Wages Low, Single Mothers Get Little Help

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
Milagros Reyes took her baby boy to the hospital for a hernia operation, but had to rush away a few hours after surgery to get back to work. Her 6-month-old son, bandaged and scared, was crying as she left, but she feared that a missed day might get her fired from her $7.79-an-hour factory job.
The same anxiety has also driven Ms. Reyes to ignore the advice of her baby's pediatrician who says she should quit her job. Her son, Juan Carlos, cared for by a series of poorly paid sitters, is severely underweight, the doctor told her. But Ms. Reyes feels she cannot afford to stop working. 
 "I have to pay the rent," she explained with a helpless shrug.
As do a growing number of single women raising children alone, Ms. Reyes faces an agonizing choice between the dead-end certainty of poverty on welfare and the grinding struggle to survive and get ahead in a low-paying job.
The number of single working mothers has soared from 2.1 million in 1971, to 4.4 million in 1981, to 5.8 million in 1991, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Two million had incomes of only $10,000 to $20,000 in 1990.
These women often cannot afford housing, health insurance or quality day care, and most of them get no child support from their children's fathers, say researchers.
"The system is totally stacked against single working moms," said David T. Ellwood, a professor of public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. "It's very difficult for them to survive, and the only alternative is welfare. The current welfare system only helps women when they've failed and reduces the support for them as they move forward in the workplace."
Ms. Reyes feels that, despite the difficulties she has had finding decent child care for her son, welfare would lead her nowhere. "People take the money and don't do anything," she said. She came to New York from the Dominican Republic when she was 14 and has worked full time in the same garment factory in the 19 years since.
This year, the Federal Government has modestly expanded a program to help low-income working families. Parents who make up to $21,000 will get as much as $2,020 back in an earned income tax credit. Some mothers interviewed recently said they were unaware that they were entitled to the credit. Others said it had slightly eased their pinched circumstances.
Working mothers living in New York City on the cusp of poverty -- just above a sharp line drawn by the Government that starts at $9,388 for a woman and one child -- say their path is especially treacherous because the high cost of housing often forces them to live in poor neighborhoods where predatory drug dealers and violent crime endanger their children.
And they resent their status as invisible women, going unnoticed in neighborhoods most often portrayed as havens for crime, drugs and welfare dependency, rarely for workaday striving.
"They can tell you about the black man who raped and killed someone," said Deborah Barton, a teacher's assistant who supports her two daughters on $12,000 a year, "but you don't hear about the single black mothers doing positive things to survive."
Ms. Barton's 10-year-old daughter, Serina, influenced by a barrage of negative images of blacks, at one point wished she was white. Her mother was appalled. "That day, I almost lost my mind." Serina recalled, "I wanted long hair and money and a Ford Taurus."
 
A Bitter Arithmetic
 For many of these women, working does not pay great dividends, at least in the short run. Ms. Barton has have about the same amount of money to spend as she would have if she were on welfare -- and even less when her expenses for transportation, clothing and child care are deducted. After taxes, she takes home about $10,000 a year. A family of three on welfare would get about about $9,300 in grants and food stamps, as well as free medical care through Medicaid.
Ms. Barton says working is worth it anyway. She loves her job. And she knows she must work and go to school on weekends to achieve her goal of becoming a full-fledged teacher.
Often, single mothers have had spells on welfare when their children were young. There is a pattern in their ability to resist the undertow of welfare dependency. They rely on their own determination, as well as supportive extended families, and often government housing programs. Usually, those who make it without welfare find ways to avoid some of the costs of housing or day care.
To save on rent, Wanda Boyd, a secretary who earns $19,499 a year, lives with her mother in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and shares a bedroom with her two daughters. She works for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, but she makes too much money to qualify for apartments it renovates for the very poor.
"I'm 32 years old with two children," she said. "I'd like to be on my own. But every apartment I look at, I can't afford."
Belkis Jimenez is able to support her two children on a bank clerk's $14,500-a-year salary, because she lives in a public housing project in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and pays only $250 a month for rent and utilities. Often the elevator is broken and Ms. Jimenez, who has asthma, must climb 18 flights of stairs with her baby in her arms. Even so, she counts herself lucky. About 200,000 families are waiting for a spot in the projects.
Maria Guadalupe, a $12,000-a-year secretary, can only afford to work because her mother lives two blocks away from her in the South Bronx and looks after her son Christopher, 4 years old. A friend she calls "Mama," who lives in her apartment building, keeps an eye on her two older sons, Carlos, 9, and Jorge, 7, and does not charge her anything. Ms. Guadalupe forbids the boys to play outside without supervision, because drug dealers work the sidewalk across the street.
"The big one complains a lot. He wants to go outside," she said. "I tell him, 'One day I'll hit the Lotto and buy a nice house.' "
Many working women attend school at night or on weekends. Education, they say, is the only path to a bigger income.. The price they pay is even less time for their children. Zianna Bennett leaves for work as a home health-care worker at about 7 A.M. and gets home from night school at 10 P.M. She's earning a college degree in social work.
After school, her sons, 7-year-old Neville and 4-year-old Michael, go to their grandmother's house. Each afternoon, Neville plugs in a tape his mother recorded the night before and hears her voice telling him to read a this book or do his homework.
For now, Ms. Bennett, who earns $14,000 a year, can only afford to live in a run-down, drug-infested apartment building in the South Bronx. The rent is $500 a month. She said she is the only woman in the apartment house with a job.
"I live there, but I'm not part of that culture," she said. "I am there as a necessity. The only way out is through education. There is no other legal way."
 
No Faith in Public Schools
 Deborah Barton also dreams of a better life for her daughters. She spends $3,000 of her $12,000 income as a teacher's assistant on tuition so Serina and her younger sister, Stephanie, 7, can attend the private school where she works, St. Paul Community Christian School, in Brooklyn.
The school's fence is topped by concertina wire in an effort to keep the violence of East New York at bay, but inside its classrooms her daughters are learning and thriving. Serina wants to go to Spelman College, in Atlanta.
The family lives in a public housing project in Brownsville, Brooklyn, where the rent is only $285 a month. The elevator reeks of urine, and gunfire erupts most nights. Ms. Barton has pulled the couch away from the windows so the girls will not get shot in the back of the head while they study or watch television. "Bullets don't have eyes," she said.
To survive on her pay, Ms. Barton accepts hand-me-downs with grace. And she has become a canny bargain-hunter who punctuates every household item she mentions with a price tag. She buys economy packs of chicken legs, $5.99. She worries when the girls get runs in their tights, $1.99. Ms. Barton has no winter coat, just a raincoat she bought three years ago at Strawberry, $79.
They live so close to the edge that Ms. Barton cannot afford to go to the doctor, even though she has health insurance. Under the rules of her policy, she must have at least $100 in charges to file a claim, but she cannot afford to pay the money out of pocket and wait to be reimbursed.
"When I'm sick, I doctor myself," she said.
While Ms. Barton has found a way to keep her children near her at all times, the challenge is more difficult for women with very young children. Good day care that is affordable to poorly paid working mothers is hard to come by, say researchers and city officials.
 
Employer's Cold Shoulder
 Milagros Reyes, who earns about $12,000 a year as a clerical worker in a garment factory, says she has had bad luck finding reliable sitters for Juan Carlos, now 19 months old. She has hired about half a dozen women, paying each just $40 a week. Some have quit for better jobs. Others have gone back to the Dominican Republic. She fired one woman after learning Carlito had been left with a stranger.
The two times she missed work to care for her son when he was sick, she received harsh warnings from her employer.
"You were absent 17.50 hours, or 12.50 percent of your maximum regular time," one warning said. The company "finds your absenteeism unacceptable. The company expects you to immediately correct this problem."
So Ms. Reyes goes to work even when Carlito is sick. Recently, she hired yet another sitter and raised the amount she pays to $50 a week. She hopes the new woman will do better. And, always, she watches nervously for signs that her spry, affectionate toddler -- smaller than 95 percent of children his age -- is filling out, growing taller, catching up with the other boys and girls.

HEADLINE: Bush Is Pressed on Vietnam Embargo

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is under growing pressure from American business leaders and foreign allies to modify its embargo against Vietnam.
In response, officials say, the Government may be preparing to move to a new phase of relations with Hanoi, which recently pledged to remove some major obstacles to the resolution of the issue of Americans still missing from the Vietnam War. 
 The sense that an American policy move is imminent is provoking protest from some veterans organizations and groups lobbying for families of the missing. In a letter to President Bush on March 27, the national commander of the American Legion, Dominic D. DiFrancesco, voiced "extreme concern" that the embargo might be lifted.
 
Pressure for Change
 Among the organizations calling for a policy change is the President's Export Council, a group from private business, Congress and several government departments, which advises the White House on international trade. In a letter to President Bush on March 4, the chairman of the council, Heinz C. Prechter, wrote: "It is the Council's belief that the United States will lose substantial competitive ground in Southeast Asia in the immediate future if we do not begin some relaxation of the embargo on Vietnam."
Mr. Prechter, chairman and chief executive officer of ASC Inc., a supplier of auto accessories who accompanied President Bush to Asia, was among about 250 people to give $100,000 or more to the Republican Party in 1988, according to the party.
His appearance among those arguing for relaxation of the embargo indicates that the topic is not strictly political, with Democrats urging improved relations and Republicans using the issue of the missing to continue isolating Hanoi.
"'We cannot watch from the tailgate as other nations get their fair share of trade in Vietnam, a big nation of 66 million people that needs to buy many things," Mr. Prechter said. "I think this is very important to America, just as the whole Pacific-Asia arena is."
Richard Solomon, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific, who returned recently from Indochina, was apparently promised a higher level of cooperation from Hanoi on the issue of the missing. The French have told the President they will not hold off indefinitely in pressing for reintegration of Vietnam into the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
Virginia Foote, director of the United States-Vietnam Trade Council, a private organization based here, said Hanoi had agreed to take five new steps.
The decision came after what some Vietnamese officials described as a "brawl" in Hanoi between Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry officials, with the latter holding out against concessions to the United States, Ms. Foote said.
The steps are: allowing immediate access to the Vietnamese countryside for checking reports of sightings of live prisoners; providing increased access to military archives; agreeing to a 24-month schedule of excavations by American-Vietnamese teams; accepting the need for meetings with Laos and Cambodia to coordinate searches for Americans; and promising to turn over any remains found whenever they are produced.
Vietnam also said that remaining political prisoners from the war years would be freed.
 
Election-Year Skepticism
 According to a "road map" charting milestones that must be passed before the embargo can be lifted and diplomatic recognition extended to Hanoi, the two sides could now be entering the second phase of a four-phase process. In this phase, the United States would allow American companies to bid on and negotiate, but not sign, contracts.
The Export Council letter also urges that the Administration eliminate currency restrictions and lift the ban on the use of credit cards for American business travel in Vietnam.
Some people who follow American policy toward the region are skeptical of reports that the Administration or Congress can be pushed by business pressure alone into a significant move on Vietnam in an election year.
Evelyn Colbert, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific from 1978 to 1980, said today that before Vietnam invaded Cambodia and set back its chances of American recognition, there was no great urgency in Indochina policy.
"When it came to final choice, better relations with China and the completion of the Panama Canal treaty took precedence," she said. "This is an issue on which it is very easy to arouse emotions. Many politicians will ask, 'Why open myself to added criticism?' "

HEADLINE: Officials Facing Loss of Privilege In Washington

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
The wave of public indignation that has led Capitol Hill to abolish some perquisites enjoyed by members of Congress now threatens the life style of Federal bureaucrats everywhere.
Upset by President Bush's attacks on lawmakers' privileges, Democratic Congressional leaders have begun reviewing those enjoyed by Federal officials. Last week Paul W. Bateman, the White House Director of Administration, appeared before the House and Senate appropriations committees to defend White House perquisites, including gymnasiums and chauffeur-driven limousines. 
 Like members of Congress, Federal employees have long enjoyed gymnasiums and fitness centers that were either free or at a minimal cost, like $180 a year for the Pentagon gym and swimming pool. Other privileges include free parking and subsidized meals sometimes prepared by personal chefs and served in private dining rooms adorned with freshly cut flowers.
For the upper echelons there are chauffeured limousines, military aircraft and a fleet of 1,200 nonmilitary planes, mostly maintained by the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Agriculture and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Officials maintain that most of the aircraft are needed to enable the agencies to fulfill their functions.

 Even low-level Federal employees receive valuable benefits including unusually generous health insurance benefits along with low-cost life insurance and generous pension plans, a spokesman for the American Council of Life Insurance said.
The Office of Personnel Management, the independent agency that administers the merit system of Federal employment, encourages the use of fitness centers by Federal employees. Last year, for instance, the Internal Revenue Service bought memberships in a health club for 125 employees who worked at a building six blocks from its headquarters, which has its own gym. The agency abandoned the plan after it was disclosed last year by The Washington Times.
The Central Intelligence Agency provides free medical, financial and alcohol and drug abuse counseling, free parking and a free fitness center. The agency also operates a singles network, obtains reduced tickets to shows and sporting events and has a day-care center that costs $95 to $130 a week.
Such perquisites have fueled the perception that Federal bureaucrats, like members of Congress, are a privileged class not subject to the same travails as normal citizens. Indeed, some critics say these privileges have blinded bureaucrats and members of Congress to the critical need for affordable health care and dependable air transportation.
 
Gripes From Perot
 H. Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who is considering a campaign for President as an independent, told a National Press Club audience recently that the President should be the only official entitled to use a Government aircraft. He said airline service would drastically improve if officials had to wait in lines, suffer delays and cancellations and endure rushing to meet connecting flights.
Congress has jurisdiction over the power of the purse, which it is considering using to limit benefits for the executive branch.
Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington said on Sunday that Congress, having abolished the House bank and quadrupling to $400 the dues for the House gymnasium, would now examine the perquisites of the Federal bureaucracy. He noted that chauffeur-driven limousines were used not only by Cabinet secretaries and their deputies, but by those as far down the ladder as deputy assistants.
Today, Judy Smith, a Presidential spokeswoman, was asked by a reporter why Clayton K. Yeutter, the White House deputy chief of staff, and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, needed to be chauffeured to and from work.
"This portal to portal service has been established in the White House for many years," she replied. "It's important for them to keep in touch with the President. They are key players."
She added that the aides paid taxes on their use of Government cars.
 
Voters Have Short Fuse
 Such privileges have upset an electorate that is suffering acute economic distress, in the opinion of some scholars. "The people in Government are not a privileged class, and once they begin acting like one, we get mad as hell," said Stephen J. Wayne, professor of government at Georgetown University. "The reaction is: 'Who the hell do you think you are? You work for us.' "
Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, said: "This is a political firestorm rushing through Washington, and it's going to leave some victims. Before the storm settles you'll see many less people having access to limousines, and a cutback of perks in the executive agencies."
But some scholars say the criticism is unwarranted. "I think it's mostly cheap shots and an unfortunate focus on the wrong things," said James P. Pfiffner, professor of government and politics at George Mason University. "People at the top level in private industry have similar resources to make sure that their time is used wisely."
Some Administration privileges have already been eliminated, including the use of Federal cabins in places like Jackson Hole, Wyo., which were also used by members of Congress. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., who abolished that privilege last year, also quit using a plane used by his predecessors and now flies on commercial flights, in coach class unless given a complimentary upgrade, which frequently happens, said Steven Goldstein, his spokesman.
Congressional scrutiny of Federal perquisites has been fueled both by the discomfort of Congress at current scandals involving the House bank and post office and by President Bush's attack on Congress in a speech last week. Mr. Bush decried "the hopelessly tangled Congressional web of PAC's, perks, privileges, partnership and paralysis."

USAir Orders Boeing 757's

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 30

 BODY:
The Boeing Company said today that USAir had ordered 15 of its 757 twinjets and secured options for an additional 15 of the mid-sized airliners. The firm orders are worth about $900 million, including spare parts.
Boeing also said that CSA, the flag carrier of Czechoslovakia, had signed its first deal for Boeing aircraft, with an order for five 737-500's valued at about $160 million including spares and training. 
 USAir, which is based in Arlington, Va., was a launch customer for the 737-300 in 1981, and has remained a loyal Boeing customer, the company said. As configured for USAir, the 757 will seat 16 passengers in the first-class section and 173 in economy. The aircraft will be powered by Rolls-Royce engines.
"We plan to use our new 757's to serve high-volume markets in the USAir system," Seth E. Schofield, the airline's president and chief executive, said in a released statement. "These aircraft will augment the 757's already in our fleet and provide additional flexibility to meet market needs."
The Czechoslovak airline said it planned to use the Boeing 737's it had ordered to replace its existing fleet of Russian-built TU-134's. The carrier has also taken options on four additional 737's, with specific models to be determined at a later date. The 737-500 as configured for CSA will provide mixed-class seating for 111 passengers.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Urban Problems;
Democrats Give Cities Their Day

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB

 BODY:
After months of campaigning through snowy New England towns, Midwestern farms, Sun Belt suburbs and other locations where the problems of big cities were at a far remove, the Democratic candidates for President will be forced to confront the problems of urban America intensively today for the first time in this long Presidential campaign season.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California are to answer questions from more than a dozen mayors at Mayor David N. Dinkins's residence, Gracie Mansion, and will later debate for an hour on urban issues in the New York City borough that is a metaphor for urban decay, the Bronx. 
 Though the candidates have addressed at least to a point a number of urban issues during the campaign, the plight of large cities, which used to be a centerpiece in Democratic primaries, has been overshadowed this year by general economic issues and a spate of personal controversies that have particularly bedeviled Mr. Clinton.
 
City Issues on the Table
 "It's our first and maybe our only opportunity to get the issues of urban America put on the table," Mayor Ray Flynn of Boston said yesterday of the Gracie Mansion event. Mr. Flynn, who is president of the United States Conference of Mayors, will join Mayor Dinkins along with the mayors of Cincinnati, Newark, Hartford and other cities.
Because the four earliest primaries are scheduled in rural states like New Hampshire and South Dakota, Mr. Flynn said, "the candidates really haven't been pressured to respond specifically to the key issues affecting the cities."
"The campaigns are well on their way before they get to one of the top 50 cities," he continued. "The issues of homelessness, drugs, violence -- those issues are ignored. Those are the life-and-death, bread-and-butter issues of American cities."
Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch of New York City said that the mayoral forum was suggested to Mr. Dinkins several weeks ago by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. But the Mayor's office began to organize the effort last week, said some City Hall sources, after queries from reporters.
Mr. Jackson is scheduled to be at Gracie Mansion and to present the mayors with his own proposals for increasing voter registration and reducing crime and illiteracy in cities.
The event will probably be broadcast later over C-Span, mayoral aides said.
The Bronx event, sponsored by the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, is scheduled to begin at 7 P.M. at Lehman College and be broadcast live over WABC-TV.
 
Aid for Local Governments
 Mr. Lynch said Mr. Dinkins planned to press the candidates to support aid to local governments during recessions. Under one plan in Congress, sponsored by Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, the Federal Government would provide municipalities with $15 billion. Because of its high rate of unemployment and high tax rate, New York City would receive $800 million under the proposal, mayoral aides said.
Mr. Lynch said the Mayor would undoubtedly press the candidates to support national gun control, money to rebuild infrastructure, and a range of proposals endorsed by 35 mayors at an urban summit that Mr. Dinkins sponsored in November 1990.
But the list of issues that have come to be considered "urban" sprawls in many directions, including AIDS, which disproportionately affects urban dwellers; job training; anti-crime legislation, and tax policy.
 
The Cities' Turn
 Although the candidates have already swung through Chicago, Detroit, and Atlanta in the course of the primaries, urban issues have yet to become a focus for a variety of reasons, political observers said yesterday.
The Georgia primary took place as part of the hectic Super Tuesday process in which candidates barely had time to touch down in a city for more than a couple of hours at a time. The Michigan and Illinois primaries were part of a truncated one-week campaign where issues of plant closings and economic growth held center stage.
But attention to urban issues has begun to grow on the streets of New York. As he addressed black newspaper publishers at a midtown restaurant yesterday, Mr. Brown said, "Our crisis is not the dead Soviet empire." Rather, he said, it is "the turbulence, bitterness, despair and alienation in every city in America."
Joe Costello, Mr. Brown's communications director, said that he had endorsed a seven-point plan for rebuilding cities that was supported by the Conference of Mayors.
Mr. Clinton has addressed the issues in more detail, offering elaborate positions on welfare and education reform and a more general 10-page proposal on cities, blaming urban problems on Republicans.
Rather than calling for massive aid programs akin to the New Deal or Great Society efforts, the Clinton proposals concentrate on setting aside smaller amounts of money for areas like housing and support of local community organizations.
Some urban experts say that the problems of the cities have begun to slip from the American consciousness as the electorate -- and the candidates -- become more suburban and as urban problems begin to seem intractable.
"If you will compare the 60's and 70's in Democratic primaries, the goal for candidates was to establish that they could handle urban problems better than anyone else," said Richard C. Wade, professor of urban history at the City University Graduate Center.
"But after 25 years, nothing positive has really happened. There's been a disillusionment over whether government can do anything," Professor Wade said.
Mr. Flynn has proposed an urban primary to take place in large developed states just after the New Hampshire primary. "If you had a national urban primary, you'd have an entirely different election," he said. "You'd probably have different candidates as well as different outcomes."

Chart/Graph: "New York City: Evaluating an Urban Environment"
When the candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination debate urban issues today, they will do so in a city that is confronting urban problems that have deepened over the last decade. After a period of boom in the mid-1980's, New York City's economy has gone flat and the gnawing social and health problems that were only beginning to confront it in the early '80's -- AIDS, crack, homelessness -- continue to affect it critically.
 
Unemployment
For a while in the mid-'80's, the city's unemployment rate was actually lower than that for the nation as a whole, a rare occurrance, but the recession has caused the rate to shoot up and flirt with double figures. A graph tracks the unemployment rate in New York City from 1981 through 1991.
 
New AIDS cases
The AIDS epidemic, which was only beginning to be recognized at the beginning of the '80's, continues to devastate the city. Last year's figures will grow as information about newly diagnosed cases is reported. A graph tracks new AIDS cases in New York City from 1981 through 1991.
 
Homeless in shelters
The number of homeless people living in city shelters has begun to rise again after tapering off for three years. The total is nearly three times greater than it was at the beginning of the '80's. A graph tracks homeless in New York City shelters from 1981 to 1992.
 
Homicides
Despite a slight decline the crime rate over the last two years, there have been significant increases since the mid '80's. A graph tracks New York City homicides from 1981 through 1991.

HEADLINE: Bid to Limit Gas Supply Makes Gains

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, March 30

 BODY:
Campaigns by hundreds of independent drillers to curb bulging supplies of natural gas in the Southwest scored one victory in Oklahoma last week and appear to be headed for others soon in Texas and Louisiana.
Oklahoma's Democratic Governor, David Walters, signed a bill last week that is expected to reduce annual gas output there by about 5 percent. The Texas Railroad Commission today scheduled a vote on April 27 on a narrower plan for production cutbacks, and Louisiana is considering a similar measure. 
 The three states produce nearly half of the nation's natural gas supply, but the production limits approved or under consideration in the three states are weaker than some drillers had sought and will probably have little impact on depressed gas prices.
 
Scrutiny by Federal Agencies
 The Federal Trade Commission has said that blanket restrictions on gas output to raise prices are illegal, but that states can impose some narrower limits. The Oklahoma measure attempts to comply with Federal law, but Federal agencies are examining it.
At the urging of powerful members of Congress from gas-consuming regions, primarily the Northeast, the Midwest and California, Federal regulators are monitoring the states' actions for signs of illegal attempts to rig the gas markets. But economists and other analysts say supplies are too abundant in areas outside the Southwest for producers here to have any lasting control over prices.
Battered by several years of gluts and depressed prices, the region's gas producers are in turmoil. Gas prices over the last few months have been the lowest of any winter since the 1970's. Thousands of smaller producers have been driven out of business, many large independent companies are losing money, layoffs have accelerated and drilling has plunged to its lowest level in 50 years.
Giant companies like Mobil, Amoco and ARCO, as well as large independents like Oryx Energy and Maxus Energy, have turned more to foreign drilling, where costs are lower and prospects more appealing. But many of the nation's independent companies, which produce about 60 percent of the domestic gas supply, are too weak financially to consider foreign operations.
Many of them have put pressure on state officials for help. Regulators in Texas are considering changes, based on historical trends and other factors, in how they calculate monthly production limits for each well.
Drillers in Texas, which produced 27 percent of the nation's gas in 1990, have complained for years that pipeline companies abuse the current system by overestimating how much gas they can sell each month. Production limits are based on the pipelines' monthly demand forecasts; when forecasts were too high, markets were glutted with gas.
"That process was difficult to follow and was not accurate," Lena Guerrero, chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission, said in an interview. Appointed last year by Gov. Ann Richards, a Democrat, to the three-member panel that regulates the state's oil and gas industry, Ms. Guerrero will be on the ballot for the first time in November. "You want to make sure the fuel is around for a very long time, so you want to conserve it when it is not being demanded," Ms. Guerrero said.
In Oklahoma, which produced 12 percent of the nation's gas in 1990, Governor Walters signed a bill last week that will modestly lower output limits on 1,100 high-volume gas wells, out of 24,000 producing wells in the state. The Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association estimates that annual production will fall by 5 percent.
 
Large Versus Small Producers
 In Texas and Oklahoma, most high-volume wells are owned by major companies. ARCO estimated that the new Oklahoma limits would pare $9 million from its yearly gas sales.
The debate over tighter controls on gas output in the Southwest has bitterly divided the industry. Many of the giants have produced gas at high volumes to generate cash needed for foreign exploration, even though the production has flooded gas markets and depressed prices.
Many independent producers without foreign operations are desperate for higher prices. Financially strong ones, like Anadarko Petroleum and the Apache Corporation, have shut many gas wells voluntarily. But they complain that other drillers with wells nearby are unlawfully drawing away their gas.
In testimony before the Texas Railroad Commission on March 18, Forrest E. Hoglund, chairman and chief executive of the Enron Oil and Gas Company, a large independent controlled by the Enron Corporation, said that major producers were ruining the business by overproducing.
"The macho producers have taken the gas back into their hands, and they are trying to sell it wherever and to whomever they can," he said. "They are trying to force gas into a market that won't hold it 9 months out of 12, with all of the destructive problems being the result."
 
Production Limits Could Backfire
 Kathleen E. Magruder, a government affairs manager at ARCO Oil and Gas, said the drillers who favored tighter production limits were actually scheming to put a floor under gas prices. She said the attempt would fail to bolster prices, and might backfire by raising fears among potential buyers of gas that supplies might become unreliable.
In letters last month to several Federal agencies, four members of Congress including John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, suggested a need to counter "the prospect of a domestic natural gas OPEC."
Officials of the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission replied earlier this month that states could restrict output to keep drillers from unlawfully drawing gas from each others' production areas and to prevent gas from being wasted. But blanket restrictions on gas output to bolster prices is illegal, they said.
Bob Krueger, a former Democratic Congressman who is one of the three Texas regulators, agreed. "We simply cannot constrict production in order to raise price," he said in an interview. "That would be illegal. It is also bad policy and the wrong message to send to potential purchasers."

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 30

 BODY:
The foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market grew only a tiny bit in the fourth quarter of 1991, prompting a warning to Japan by the United States trade representative and increasing the likelihood that the American industry will push for sanctions against Japanese companies.
United States and Japanese Government officials reported today that the share of Japan's semiconductor market held by American and other non-Japanese companies was 14.4 percent in the fourth quarter, up only slightly from 14.3 percent in the third quarter. That makes it exceedingly unlikely that a 20 percent share, the goal of a semiconductor trade agreement, will be reached by the end of this year. 
 "It is critical that the Japanese Government and industry intensify their efforts to improve access to their semiconductor market," Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said in a statement.
Japanese Government and industry officials have said that the slowdown in Japan's economy has made it harder for companies to take on new suppliers but that they are making their best efforts.

HEADLINE: Thatcher Adieu to Politicking, but Not Politics

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BASILDON, England, March 30

 BODY:
With her chosen successor as Prime Minister, John Major, battling for political survival, Margaret Thatcher bowed out of the British general election campaign today to keep speaking engagements in the United States.
"Political swan song?" she said. "Good heavens, no! I shall be active for a very, very long time." 
 Mrs. Thatcher is expected to accept a title and continue her political career in the House of Lords, but she will not be returning to the House of Commons after the April 9 election. And Mr. Major, whom she picked to succeed her after she resigned under pressure as Conservative Party leader in November 1990, did not ask her to break off her tour to campaign for him, according to her aides here.
Whether this election is won by Mr. Major or by the opposition Labor Party leader, Neil Kinnock, it will mark a generational turning point: not only Mrs. Thatcher, who is 67 years old, but many other Conservative politicians who served in her governments in the 1980's are leaving the stage to younger men and women.
 
No Pizazz From 'Iron Lady'
 Mr. Major is 49 and Mr. Kinnock is 50. But whoever wins, "Thatcherism," the uncompromising doctrine of self-reliance and unfettered free enterprise that dominated Britain for a decade, has already been replaced by more moderate stuff.
Some disciples of the "Iron Lady" think Mr. Major's campaign so far has lacked sizzle and could have gained some by asking Mrs. Thatcher to stick around.
Another party worker, Iris Bloomfield, came from Braintree to hear Mrs. Thatcher speak today, but she said she was not surprised that Mr. Major's campaign team had not asked her to stay on the campaign trail. "She might say something they don't like," Mrs. Bloomfield said.
 
The Thatcher We Know
 On her last day of campaigning, Mrs. Thatcher did her best to sound entirely loyal. "I will miss being on the campaign trail, but they can win without me," she told reporters in a cold rain in Maldon.
Asked what she thought of deficit spending, Mrs. Thatcher said, "You have to say, to coin a phrase, 'No, no, no.' " But she refrained from mentioning that Mr. Major's Government had projected a deficit of $48.4 billion for the coming fiscal year.
Later, she went to a renovated barn in a country club in Little Waltham, in prosperous Essex, east of London, to speak on behalf of a Conservative Member of Parliament, Simon Burns. Mr. Burns won in 1987 against a Liberal Party opponent, 35,231 votes to 27,470; Labor got only 4,642 votes.
After 33 years as a Member of Parliament and more than 10 as Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher seemed in fighting trim.
"When we took over in 1979," she said, "Britain was in decline as an economy. She was full of strikes. It was known that we were accepting decline. We have turned that country into one whose standards have been raised in the eyes of the world, which does not follow the world, but leads in many of its decisions."
She recited her triumphs, including the Falkland War, but not the Persian Gulf war, which Mr. Major led the country through after she resigned. Mrs. Thatcher also reminded her listeners that her governments had brought inflation under control in the early 1980's, without mentioning that control was lost again in 1989, leading to restrictive monetary policies that the Labor Party says brought on the current recession.
But the old belief was still there: "Competition is what keeps prices down, not governments," she said. British labor unions and European federalists had all been kept at bay, and what was needed now, she said, was the courage of Thatcherite convictions.
"It is socialism which is falling the world over," she said, "and it isn't coming back here.
"I'm sure Mr. Major would sweep the field," she concluded.
But one of her closest friends, Cecil Parkinson, who ran her campaign in the 1983 election after the Falkland War, said on Saturday that Mr. Major needed better advice on how to run a campaign.
 
Farewell to Familiars
 But Mr. Parkinson, who is 60, is not running this time, like 67 other well-known members of Parliament. They include Conservatives like Sir Geoffrey Howe, 65, former Foreign Secretary; Nigel Lawson, 60, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Norman Tebbit, 61, another former party leader. On the Labor side, Michael Foot, 78, whom Mr. Kinnock succeeded as party leader in 1983, and Denis Healey, 74, another ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer, are also bowing out.
Neither Mrs. Thatcher nor her aides gave a clue today of what cities were on her tour, which one report said would begin in Chicago on Wednesday. "It's a private trip," said one of her assistants, Elizabeth Buchanan, at Mrs. Thatcher's last hurrah today.

HEADLINE: An Industrial Comeback Story: U.S. Is Competing Again in Steel

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The American steel industry, long a symbol of decay in industrial America, has undergone a transformation in the last decade that has drastically sharpened the industry's competitive position.
Now, after the Government has provided a decade of protection from imported steel, the Bush Administration has decided not to extend quotas on imported steel that expire today. The move reflects the industry's improved condition and the Administration's preference for using existing laws to fight what it sees as unfair trade practices. 
 American steelmakers have so improved their productivity that the industry now often rivals -- and in ways outperforms -- its competitors in Germany and Japan. Japanese auto makers, like Toyota, Honda and Subaru, are using American steel in their plants in the United States.
Thanks partly to the lower value of the dollar, foreign steel shipments into the United States have fallen in recent years to the point that they are below the limit the Government had set. And the industry's bellwether efficiency measure -- the man-hours needed to produce a ton -- is at a record level.
Exports, which in the last 20 years have rarely accounted for more than 2 percent of all the steel shipped from American mills, soared last year to 6.3 million tons, or about 8 percent. And customers contend that the quality of American steel is better than ever, comparable with that from foreign steelmakers.
 
Quality and Efficiency
 "The steel made in the United States is equal in quality to steel made anywhere in the world now," said James M. Glazebrook, director of the General Electric Company's trading operation. "And the industry is now being recognized more and more throughout the world, not only for having top quality, but for being among the best in the world in efficiency. You could never have said that 15 years ago."
Trade protectionism gets some credit for the comeback of the big steelmakers, but so does domestic competition from low-cost nonunion mini-mills that pushed the big mills to change their ways. The value of the dollar played a big role, too. When the dollar was strong in the mid-80's, American producers recognized that they had to become more efficient to block inroads by imported steel. When the dollar later weakened, foreign steel prices rose and imports fell.
Over all, the effectiveness of protectionist measures is mixed. Protection has been a boon to some industries, like motorcycle makers, who have been rejuvenated after four years of tariffs on foreign makes, but it has backfired for the automobile industry, where Japanese manufacturers got around the import limits by building plants in the United States and capturing still more market share from Detroit.
The steel import quotas "have been an important help to the industry's recovery," said the Rev. William T. Hogan, a professor of economics at Fordham University and the author of a number of books on the steel industry. "The agreements have given them an opportunity to catch up." He added that the steel industry spent $23 billion in the 1980's to modernize plants and buy efficient equipment. Some of the money came in the form of joint ventures with Japanese and Korean steel companies. "Without the agreements," Father Hogan said, "we would have a high influx of imports, and I doubt they would have been able to invest as much."
The decision by the Administration, which was confirmed yesterday by Gary R. Edson, the general counsel for the Office of the United States Trade Representative, suggests that American trade negotiators and some steel industry executives would prefer to open the market to steel imports but would insist that foreign governments commmit themselves to wiping out subsidies for foreign steelmakers.
 
Trying to Curtail Reliance on Quotas
 The Administration is negotiating in Geneva for a multilateral agreement with steel-producing nations, hoping to determine levels of imports through a more flexible policy centered not on import quotas but on restricting government subsidies.
"The foreign producers are not using their quotas, and demand in the United States is down," said John I. Griffin, president of the Maurice Pincoffs Company, a Houston-based steel-trading company that buys both domestic and imported steel.
Mr. Griffin, who is also president of the American Association for International Steel, said the voluntary-restraint agreements that produced the steel quotas were "designed to give the American steel industry time to catch up with foreign steel." He added, "But the industry in the United States is certainly catching up, if it has not caught up already."
American steelmakers still have weapons for trade battles. They can file legal cases against foreign producers accusing them of selling steel below cost or of benefiting from government subsidies; several of these legal cases have already been prepared.
 
Exercising Their Options
 "We have to do whatever we have to do to protest unfair trade practices," said Frank W. Luerssen, chairman and chief executive of Inland Steel Industries, the nation's fourth-largest steel company. Under the terms of the steel import limits, American steel companies had given up some rights to battle the pricing practices of foreign steel manufacturers.
Despite the emergence of big steel companies as more efficient, trimmer operations, they are still plagued by the effects of continued overcapacity. There is more steel than demand, and that has caused prices -- and profits -- to remain in the doldrums. In fact, a ton of the sheet steel that goes into cars is priced at about $440 now, compared with $504 in 1980. And while the lower cost of producing steel has meant that steelmakers have profited in good times -- the six largest producers earned $1.2 billion in the robust economy of 1989 -- they have been ravaged by economic downturns and those same companies lost a combined $2.3 billion last year.
 
A Partial Comeback At a Classic Big Mill
 Nowhere have the industry's changes been more pronounced than in Gary, Ind., where the USX Corporation operates a sprawling plant along a five-mile strip on the shores of Lake Michigan. For decades, the mill operated by the company -- formerly known as United States Steel -- epitomized the vastness of big steel. Whatever steel product a customer desired could be manufactured here, from nails to railroad tracks to sheets for automobile hoods.
The Gary Works, or the Big Mill as it was known inside the company, is still the largest steel plant in North America, but it has shrunk considerably. At one time in the 1970's, more than 28,000 people worked here; today there are fewer than 8,000 employees. In earlier decades, the Gary plant housed everything from a hospital, a railroad and a cement plant to a factory that made bridge parts. But now, most of that has been closed or sold, scores of buildings are empty or were demolished and much of the site's 3,400 acres sit idle.
 
A Shrunken Product List
 The mill's production is now confined principally to two types of steel: flat-rolled steel used in automobiles and appliances, and plate steel used in construction and in heavy machinery.
What is made here, however, is produced more efficiently than ever. At the Gary Works, it takes 2.7 man-hours to produce a ton of steel, compared with a USX average of 3.6, and 7.1 man-hours 10 years ago. The national average for the steel industry is about five hours a ton. With the opening last fall of a new caster that converts molten steel into slabs, the Gary plant now produces all its steel by the more cost-efficient continuous casting method rather than the conventional method of producing steel from ingots.
The big plant is primarily a maker of sheet used for automobiles and appliances, tin for food and beverage cans and plates for construction and shipbuilding.
 
Labor and Managers Make Adjustments
 After a bruising labor dispute that shut the plant for six months in late 1986 and early 1987, relations between the union and management have become noticeably less hostile. A steelworker here is no longer confined to one specific duty, like pipefitting. Workers in the highly automated and computerized plant are likely to be assigned to teams to discuss their tasks and determine more efficient ways of working.
"I would say we've seen a complete turnaround from the way things used to be," said Cary B. Kranz, president of Local 1066 of the United Steelworkers union here. Mr. Kranz, whose father worked at United States Steel and was also president of the local, said that union members have a far greater role now in making decisions. "They now involve union people and make us feel that we are a part of something," Mr. Kranz said. "They meet with us and they recognize that we have all the knowledge in the world within these gates. It's not happening as fast as we would like, but it is happening."
Analysts and steel industry historians suggest that the changes in Gary mirror the changes in the industry as a whole. The 5.3 man-hours per ton for the steel industry in the United States compares with 5.4 in Japan, and 5.6 in both Germany and Britain, according to statistics by the WEFA Group, a consulting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. And the American figures look even better when compared with 6.4 man-hours a ton in South Korea, 7.2 in Taiwan and 8.9 in Brazil.
 
Global Factors Get More Emphasis
 In part, analysts attribute the changes in the mills to a new generation of steel managers whose views have been shaped by global competition in the steel business and a proliferation of joint ventures between American steel companies and partners from Japan and Korea. In fact, a total of $3 billion of foreign capital mostly from Japan and Korea has been invested in the American steel industry. Many American executives have been exposed to foreign steel companies' methods of operation and labor relations.
"Many American managers, particularly the younger ones, have started to criticize themselves now rather than blindly defend themselves," said Kiichi Mochizuki, president of the United States arm of the Nisshin Steel Company of Japan. "And that is healthy. It is the first step to improvement. They are developing the courage to say that they have problems and that they need to be attacked."
While the large steel companies have scaled down, their smaller competitors, the mini-mills, have become far more significant challengers, having systematically usurped markets once dominated by big steel. These mini-mills, with names like Nucor, Birmingham Steel and Oregon Steel, typically operate with far lower costs because they melt scrap to produce steel and have largely nonunion work forces with wages about a third lower than those of the unionized steelworkers at the big mills.
 
Big Players Learn Nothing Is Sacred
 Mini-mill companies, too, are gradually changing the competitive balance of the industry. Once these smaller companies were confined to producing such lower-quality items as reinforcement bars for concrete used in highways and bridges and material for fences, wires and nails. Today, they have a virtual lock on items like beams that support buildings. And some are moving toward the big companies' bread and butter: the flat-rolled steel used in automobiles and appliance parts. As a result, big steel companies consider the mini-mills to be as much a competitive threat as foreign steel is, perhaps even more so.
"Nothing is sacred any more as far as the big integrated steel companies' monopoly," said John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants in Philadelphia. "Mini-mills had to get into different pastures to continue their growth, and flat-rolled steel is the new area of opportunity."
The importance of steel produced by these smaller steel companies has grown sharply. In 1980, the five largest steel producers accounted for more than 60 percent of all of the domestic industry's shipments. By 1990, that figure had dropped to slightly more than 40 percent. And mini-mills now account for about 21 percent of domestic consumption, slightly more than the 18 percent accounted for by imported steel.
Unlike big steel, mini-mills have weathered the current economic recession robustly. Last year, the six largest steel producers posted operating losses of about $27 for every ton of steel they shipped, nearly $1 billion. But the 10 largest mini-mill companies earned, on average, $10 a ton, or about $100 million.
Some in the industry contend that the big American steel producers will bounce back with vigor once the economy rebounds, noting that despite the improvement in efficiency, steel remains a highly cyclical business. "They will always have ups and downs," Mr. Jacobson said. "But, because of the improvements among the big steel companies, their ups will be a little brighter, and they will be able to sustain themselves better during the down periods."

HEADLINE: Economists Shifting Priorities

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Prodded by three years of economic stagnation, a growing number of prominent economists are putting aside their criticism of the budget deficit as the worst of economic evils. Instead, they are advocating a temporary rise in the deficit to generate spending for public works that would put idle people and machinery back to work.
The latest evidence of the new priority appeared yesterday in an open letter made public in Washington and signed by more than 70 economists, some of whom said they would not have signed it even four months ago. Although a surge in retail sales has raised hopes that a recovery is finally under way, many economists say that without an injection of public spending, the recovery might not endure. 
 The letter, addressed to the Administration, Congress and the Federal Reserve, called for the quick outlay of $50 billion a year in Federal aid to state and local governments.
 
Effort Would Finance Projects
 The money would be borrowed by the Federal Government to expand education and to finance local public works projects that were halted or cut back for lack of local tax revenue. The right projects would pay for themselves, the letter said, "since the economy has idle resources of labor and capital available to meet additional spending with additional production."
"I signed that document because the infrastructure side of it, funneling money to education, highways and the like, is a key to generating solid economic growth," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company Economic Advisers. Until recently, Mr. Sinai had focused on the dangers of the budget deficit, which is expected to reach nearly $370 billion in the current fiscal year.
 
Temporary Shift in Priorities
 But the shift in priorities should be temporary, Mr. Sinai and other converts stress. Once the national economy is growing vigorously again, they will go back to criticizing the deficit as an intolerable burden for future generations -- a view still widely held.
Nevertheless, for a growing group of mainstream economists, the priority has become the use of deficit spending to make the economy rebound after 36 months of nearly zero economic growth or outright recession.
"The right question for economists to ask is how to use resources productively, particularly idle resources, and if that leads to an increase in the deficit, so be it," said Allen H. Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie Mellon Institute and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization. "I have said this before, but perhaps not as forcefully as I could have."
 
Spectrum of Viewpoints
 This new emphasis on public spending as an economic stimulant, although by no means unanimous, is nevertheless showing up across the spectrum of economic viewpoints. It was evident in interviews with a dozen prominent economists late last week. All acknowledged the trend, although some, like Henry Kaufman, an economic consultant and the former chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said they themselves had not converted from viewing the deficit as the No. 1 enemy.
Their view is that deficit spending, by putting more money into circulation, increases inflation. Higher inflation, in turn, or just the prospect of it, prompts holders of bonds and Treasury securities to demand higher interest rates. And as higher rates spread through the economy, companies and consumers are discouraged from buying homes, cars and machinery on credit.
"There is a tendency lately among economists to disregard the credit markets," Mr. Kaufman said. "They have an important veto in all this." Rather than higher deficits, even temporarily, Mr. Kaufman wants to put pressure on the Federal Reserve to reduce rates another notch.
 
Some Favor a Tax Cut
 So do officials in the Administration, which has also proposed tax cuts for the middle class. Similarly, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the leading candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination, favors middle-class tax cuts -- steering clear so far of the deficit-spending issue.
Another outspoken opponent of rising deficits, Charles L. Schultze, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Carter Administration, bases his opposition mostly on concern that a temporary rise in deficit spending would become permanent in the hands of the Federal bureaucracy. But Mr. Schultze is beginning to waiver.
"I would like to wait a little longer to see if easier money -- the recent decline in interest rates -- will turn the trick," he said. "If it does not produce a satisfactory recovery, then we might have to do something with deficit spending."
 
Survey of Forecasters
 Reflecting this concern, 50 economic forecasters surveyed by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators now rate the deficit as of less importance than in 1988, the last year in which the American economy grew at an annual rate of more than 2 percent -- the minimum considered necessary by economists to raise employment.
The chief sponsors of the letter made public yesterday in Washington were two Nobel laureates in economic science, Robert M. Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and James Tobin of Yale University, themselves converts last fall.
"Most of us think that for the long run, the huge budget deficit and the inability of the country to reduce it are a serious economic problem," Mr. Solow said. "What has changed is that the recession has lasted a long time and the prospect is for a very slow recovery. Economists are prepared to say that there is a chance we will do more long-range damage by letting people sit in the puddle of economic stagnation than we will do if we have higher deficits temporarily."
 
Changes of Views
 The letter encouraging this deficit spending was signed by at least half-a-dozen economists who would have declined to sign it three or four months ago, among them Mr. Sinai of the Boston Company; Jay Woodworth, chief economist at the Bankers Trust New York Corporation, and Roger E. Brinner, director of research at DRI/McGraw-Hill Inc., an economic consulting service.
Previously, they considered deficit spending for public works -- the view that constructing, say, seaport projects pays for itself by expanding the nation's export capacity -- too uncertain an economic stimulant to justify the risk of running up the national debt. And now they are giving ground.
"The deficit is still clearly a huge problem -- that has not changed in my mind -- but I am willing to let it slide up a few billion dollars in the short run, in order to make some progress in overall economic growth," Mr. Woodworth said.
 
'Sense of Urgency'
 And Mr. Brinner added: "I became very worried during the winter that people have lost faith in the economy, and that has increased my sense of urgency to do something. I would have preferred easier money -- lower interest rates -- rather than deficit spending to restore economic growth, but easier money is not forthcoming, so this is second best."
This new willingness to let the deficit grow is not shared by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who argues that a healthy recovery began to show itself last month in the sharp rise in retail sales and that deficit spending is therefore an unnecessary stimulant.
Indeed, the support for deficit spending would evaporate quickly if a full-blown recovery developed, said Paul Samuelson, another Nobel laureate, who until recently also opposed an increase in deficit spending. "No one wants to be caught favoring deficit spending when we are already in an expansion," he added.

 BODY:
The Dime Savings Bank of New York yesterday reported big losses for the fourth quarter and year, mainly because of a large increase in the amount it had to set aside to cover losses from an aggressive lending policy in the late 1980's.
As a result of the losses, the Manhattan-based bank said it did not meet regulatory capital standards in two of three financial categories and said it would file a plan in April detailing how it would meet the capital requirements by the end of 1994. 
 The bank said the fourth-quarter loss of $197.3 million came largely as a result of $203.7 million it set aside in the period to cover loan losses. In the fourth quarter of 1990, the company lost $12.6 million and set aside only $16 million for loan losses.
For the year, the Dime reported a record loss of $237.4 million, compared with a loss of $135.7 million for 1990. For the year, the bank set aside provisions for loan losses of $306.7 million, compared with $195.4 million in 1990.
Although the value of nonperforming assets dropped from the third to the fourth quarters in 1991, the percentage of total assets that were nonperforming rose from 10.8 percent in the third quarter to 11.1 percent, roughly three times the industry average.
The Dime's chairman, Richard D. Parsons, said yesterday that after taking the loan-loss provision for the fourth quarter, the bank's cost-cutting programs and healthy margins should return the bank to profitability this year.
"In making this large provision, we believe we have captured the full extent of potential losses in the bank's portfolio of nonperforming and performing loans," Mr. Parsons said.
Joseph A. Jolson, a banking analyst with Montgomery Securities, said the Dime could meet its goals, barring further significant loan losses or a rapid jump in interest rates that would decrease its margins.
The Dime's stock closed yesterday at $4.125, unchanged, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Dime has been trying for years to shed the cost of troubled loans written in the late 1980's, when it expanded by writing loans on residential properties that required sizable down payments but little documentation. Falling property values and rising unemployment caused scores of borrowers to default on their mortgages.
The Dime has also tried to reduce costs in recent years, including an announcement in February that it would save $11 million this year by cutting 400 jobs and hiring other companies for some back-office work.

HEADLINE: Business and Health;
States Press U.S. On Insurance Plan

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
DOZENS of states, tired of waiting for Washington to grapple with health-care problems, are working on innovative programs to extend coverage to at least some of the 37 million Americans without insurance. But the state programs will face delays and legal setbacks, insurance and health-care experts say, unless Congress agrees to open loopholes in a politically sacrosanct Federal law.
Although this particular Federal-state conflict over medical insurance has had little public attention, it is a hot issue for policy makers in California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington and other states. Gov. Lawton Chiles announced a Florida health plan last week and told Congressional leaders that it would require both money and waivers from Federal Medicaid and benefits laws. 
 Gail Wilensky, a senior White House aide, said the Bush Administration was encouraging the states to move ahead with their own health-care programs. "They obviously don't have to wait for us," she said.
But the Administration, as well as large employers and insurers, vigorously opposes changing the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, called Erisa. Under court interpretations, the vast majority of businesses, which insure their own people, have been exempted from hundreds of state health insurance laws. Erisa also set national standards for pensions.
These self-insured employers are also exempt from state taxes on insurance premiums and from contributing to pools to cover high-risk individuals. Citing Erisa, the insurance industry plans to challenge New York's legal right to set higher hospital rates for self-insured employers than for Blue Cross subscribers, said Alan Neiditch, a vice president of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.
With most large employers out of the game, the state risk-sharing pools rarely have enough participants to cover costs. Consequently, individuals and businesses that are too small to self-insure are hit with steep rate increases and often rejected entirely by insurers.
"Erisa is clearly a roadblock to attempts to spread the cost of health care," said Fred Nepple, general counsel for the Wisconsin Insurance Commissioner's office.
Some states hope to get around Erisa by using general taxing powers. "Both Massachusetts and Oregon passed laws believing they could make them apply to Erisa health plans," said Greg Scandlen, editor of the Health Benefits Letter, a newsletter in Alexandria, Va. "I'm skeptical. The states pass these things on a hope and a prayer. But the courts have, if anything, broadened the Erisa exemption rather than narrowing it."
Massachusetts planned to tax employers to finance insurance for all workers. The law was sidetracked by the recession. Gov. William Weld, a Republican, wants to repeal it. If it is put into effect, some employers will probably sue, insisting that the law "relates to employee benefits plans and that it conflicts with Congressional policy," said Mary Anne Bobinski, an assistant professor of law at the University of Houston, who has studied the issue.
A similar Oregon program is to take effect in 1995. Lynn Read, a state project director, said that to avert an Erisa challenge, the state assumed that self-insured employers would voluntarily comply. Minnesota may finance its program with new taxes on hospital bills and cigarettes.
In California, the Insurance Commissioner, John Garamendi, proposed a payroll tax that "gets around the entire Erisa issue," Walter Zelman, a special deputy insurance commissioner, said. "Employers pay into a single fund. The fund purchases insurance for everybody, including six million who are uninsured now." He added, "Erisa doesn't say a state can't set up a health care plan."
Mr. Zelman said employers would voluntarily switch to the state program because they would be taxed anyway to pay for it. But Joan Trauner, a principal in San Francisco with the Coopers & Lybrand benefits consulting firm, said she expected employers and insurance companies to sue, citing Erisa, if the plan was enacted.
"Erisa is essentially above the law right now," Ms. Trauner said. "There is no Federal definition of what employers should provide." She added, "We've got to have some definition at the Federal level of what the rules of the game are going to be."
Hawaii is the only state that Congress has allowed to go around Erisa and require every employer to contribute to subsidized health coverage for employees. Other states have requested Erisa waivers in vain.
Congressional aides say the Administration and members of Congress have little stomach for facing a small army of business and insurance lobbyists in a bruising fight to amend Erisa. But the states are losing patience.
Alice Pelrine, a human resources analyst with the National Governors Association, said the group wanted Congress to grant Erisa exemptions for state programs for the uninsured. She said the governors were unanimous in saying, "If you're not going to do something about health care, Federal Government, at least get out of our way."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Yen Gains Against Dollar; Gold Is Down in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against all major currencies yesterday except the Japanese yen, which was supported by the scheduled release of new Government spending plans.
Gold prices fell on the Commodity Exchange in New York, which quoted a price for current delivery at $341.90 an ounce, down 60 cents. The late bid at the Republic National Bank quoted gold at $341.60 an ounce, also down 60 cents. 
 A new report showing a 2.7 percent decline in American home sales in February "knocked the wind out of the dollar a bit," said John McCarthy, chief dealer for Algemene Bank Nederland in New York.
Mr. McCarthy and other traders said the dollar's decline was minimal. Many analysts took a cautious view of the dollar, awaiting more substantial reports this week on consumer confidence and employment.
Andrew Hodge, vice president at Bank Brussels Lambert, said many market participants had adopted "a kind of a show-me attitude" before taking strong buy or sell positions in the dollar.
Most of the day's action surrounded the yen, which rose on expectations that a new public works spending package would be released overnight, Mr. Hodge said.
Traders expected that the public spending plan would help support Japan's uncertain economy. There was active trading in yen, with dealers selling marks to buy yen, which tends to weaken the dollar.
Mr. McCarthy said the yen had also strengthened because some investors were adjusting their trading position before the Japanese fiscal year ends today.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.92 yen, to 132.93 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 133.45 yen. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 132.75 yen, down from 133.05 late on Friday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7320, from $1.7385 late on Friday. In New York, the pound was quoted at $1.7375, more expensive than Friday's close of $1.7430.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.6445 German marks, up from 1.6410; 1.5000 Swiss francs, up from 1.4940; 5.5775 French francs, up from 5.5670; 1,241.50 Italian lire, up from 1,238.00, and 1.19105 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18855.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $342.00 an ounce, from $341.75 late on Friday. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $341.85 an ounce, from $341.30 late on Friday. In Hong Kong, gold rose $2.17, to $343.47.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Fell In February

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
Sales of new homes fell 2.7 percent in February from January, according to Government figures released today.
Analysts attributed the drop to rising mortgage rates and uncertainty over a proposed tax credit for first-time purchases, but few felt that the housing recovery was in danger of faltering. 
 Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. in New York, said the report indicated that "the housing market is strong despite the decline in sales."
David F. Seiders, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders, agreed.
"I feel pretty good about the course of the recovery so far," he said. "It's been erratic, but it's trending up. I'm looking for the market to trend upward for the rest of the year."
 
Northeast Has a 14.1% Gain
 Sales last month, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, totaled 613,000 units, down from 630,000 a month earlier, according to the report from the Commerce Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The previously weak Northeast posted the only regional advance, a gain of 14.1 percent. Sales fell in both the Midwest and South and were flat in the West.
Sales of new homes in the first two months of 1992 were 38.6 percent higher than in the corresponding period of 1991. That rise left the seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of February at 269,000, down from 281,000 in January and the lowest since 265,000 in April 1983, shortly after the previous recession.
 
January Figure Revised
 The report also revised the January sales jump to 11.1 percent, from 12.9 percent in the initial estimate last month. Still, January's advance was the largest since sales rose 20.7 percent in February 1991.
Analysts had said the January pace could not be sustained, particularly the 50.5 percent jump in the Midwest. In addition, they said an increase in mortgage rates in February probably curbed some buyers' appetites, though it might have caused other buyers to jump into the market before rates rose further.
According to surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose from 8.67 percent to 8.83 percent in February. They reached 9.03 percent during the week ending March 20, but dropped to 8.98 percent last week.
Despite the advance, Samuel D. Kahan, an economist with Fuji Securities in Chicago, said pent-up demand should keep housing activity "fluctuating around a solid uptrend for several months to come."
"Any February decline should be interpreted therefore as a temporary wiggle, not as a death spasm for the rally in housing-sector activity," he wrote in the firm's weekly Perspectives.
Mr. Seiders, the economist with the home builders association, said the failure of Congress to enact the tax credit for first-time home buyers meant that the legislation was now"in limbo."
The February numbers also showed the supply of new homes at 5.2 months at the current sales rate, the lowest since a 4.7-month supply in April 1986. The small backlog could provide an incentive to increase new construction.

Job Seekers On the Move In Recession

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
THE effects of the recession in some of America's biggest states is prompting more workers to move in search of better job opportunities, according to a survey by one of the country's biggest moving companies.
The survey by Atlas Van Lines of 67,000 households that moved out of state in 1991 showed that coastal states like California and Massachusetts, where the recession has been particularly severe, had a net outflow of moves last year and that states in the Northwest, Midwest and the Sun Belt saw net inflows. 
 "About 80 percent of our moves are corporate moves," said J. Stephen Mumma, senior vice president of Allied, "so it is obvious companies are relocating some of their employees to where the economy is healthier."
The survey showed that Texas and Florida had the largest number of net incoming moves by vanloads. It also showed that the Midwest and states with lower costs of living like Oregon, Washington, Montana and Idaho, attracted substantial numbers of incoming households.
By contrast, more than twice as many households moved out of Massachusetts as moved in last year, and California showed a net outflow of households as well. Both states have been plagued by job losses during the recession.
James Challenger of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago job-placement firm with 16 regional offices, said managers willing to transfer could increase their current salaries by as much as 20 percent
"It generally is worth money to move," he said. "And most importantly from the individual's standpoint, he or she should be willing to move for the company now, even if the move is away from corporate headquarters where that person really should be. Moves are almost always linked with advancement."
Outplacement firms work for fees from companies that have dismissed managers and other employees. The firms provide some advice at the time of job loss, counseling about finding new jobs, resume service and office space, including telephone service.
Mr. Challenger often advises clients to take jobs that require moves. However, he warns that those who do make a move to another state away from the headquarters area should "create ways to report directly to headquarters."
Don't permit yourself to be forgotten, he advises, adding that anyone who spends more than two years away from headquarters can be overlooked when it comes time for promotions.
Michael D. Boxberger, managing director for North America of Korn Ferry International, the big management recruiting firm, points out that moving within the United States may not be enough to assure a person's promotability.
"International experience is now considered a prerequisite for leaders in the rest of the world," he said. "Nevertheless, many U.S. executives still view a foreign assignment as corporate banishment. That feeling may have been justified in the past, but today companies want their executives multicultural and multilingual."
But job security and advancement opportunities have been threatened by another demographic trend not related to moving, Mr. Boxberger said. The glut of baby boomers has begun to create much competition for higher-echelon jobs.
There is some room at the top, Mr. Boxberger conceded, but not so much in the middle.
"You are now competing not only with co-workers that you know but with your own counterparts at the competing companies," he recently told alumni of the Columbia University Graduate School of Business and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. "Whether you are aware of it or not, many of you are even competing with executives in other countries and industries."

Hartford Life In Bailout Deal

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: RICHMOND, March 30

 BODY:
The Hartford Life Insurance Company will assume the policies of the troubled Fidelity Bankers Life Insurance Company, Virginia's insurance commissioner said today.
Under the plan, Hartford will assume all of Fidelity's annuities and insurance policies, said Commissioner Steven T. Foster, the court-appointed receiver for Fidelity Bankers. He said policyholders would not lose any money. 
 Fidelity Bankers, which is licensed in 49 states, has about 184,000 policies, with a total value of about $4 billion. The insurer was seized by state regulators last May after suffering losses on its investments in high-risk junk bonds.
Details of the bailout plan are to be completed by May. Hartford's move is expected to allow the lifting of a moratorium that has prevented customers from cashing in their Fidelity Bankers' policies.
Policyholders who wish to terminate their coverage can pull out of the bailout plan, Mr. Foster said. They would then receive a cash payment estimated at 85 percent of the account value.
The plan, which requires regulatory approval, provides Fidelity Bankers' policyholders with security and competitive interest rates, said Lon A. Smith, president and chief operating officer of Hartford Life, a unit of the Connecticut-based Hartford Insurance Group.

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL: FINAL FOUR PREVIEW;
At Cincinnati, Happy Days Are Here Again

BYLINE: By THOMAS GEORGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CINCINNATI, March 30

 BODY:
Every way that Anthony Buford turned on the University of Cincinnati campus this afternoon, there was a handshake, a pat on the back, a good word. Buford, Cincinnati's versatile, play-making guard, was standing in the campus bookstore when another well-wisher offered his thoughts on what Cincinnati's inclusion among the Final Four meant to him and to others.
"I've got $500 seats, right on the floor," the fan and fellow student said. "I won't miss a minute of this. You guys have put Cincinnati basketball back on the map. This is going to be one big party in Minneapolis -- and here at home."
 
'Something Special' for Collection
 Buford smiled. 
 Later he explained: "No one can know just what this means to us. All of our lives, as kids playing basketball, you dream of playing in the Final Four. I've taped all of the recent ones. Now I'll have something special to add to the collection.
"All of my teammates and me know what it's like to have the eyes of the world fixed on you for all the wrong reasons. Just two years ago, I was transferring from Akron to here and I was getting hate mail from the Akron fans. I had to sit out all of last year yet keep my mind focused on basketball. I almost gave up. It seemed my chance would never come. And then to have all of this happen in my last year of college ball? We are living the dream."
Cincinnati's 29-4 season, which includes an 88-57 trouncing of Memphis State in the Midwest Regional Final on Sunday in Kansas City, Mo., earned the Bearcats their Final Four berth against Michigan this Saturday. It all serves as a throwback here to the glory years when players like Oscar Robertson helped Cincinnati almost 30 years ago make Final Four trips routine.
The long drought in between included a three-year probationary period from the N.C.A.A. and one-year elimination (in 1988) from post-season play for the school. Many of the Cincinnati players, however, have experienced their own sort of personal drought. Ten of the 11 players on the Bearcats' roster are transfer students, eight from junior colleges and two others from other Division I schools. There has long been an undefinable stigma placed on junior college players:
*Too dumb to make the big time.
*Not good enough to play with the big boys.
Cincinnati and its coach, Bob Huggins, may change much of that perception this week in Minneapolis.
"We recruit people, good people, whether they are junior college kids or not," Huggins said. "We get people who want to do the right things and want to go to class and make something of themselves. We fit their need and they fit ours. They know that we care about them first as people.
"Here, even in our own hometown, we're just beginning to educate people. We've got a guy who grew 6 inches while in junior college and worked hard to become the type of player he is today. We've got guys who transferred because of a change in coaches and in their old school's playing style. There are often myriad factors why a guy starts out in junior college, and they all don't have to be negative factors. What we're talking about here is opportunity."
The university thinks of itself in much the same manner. Its brouchures read: "A comprehensive university with a personal touch."
The university is situated three miles north of downtown Cincinnati and has an enrollment of about 36,000. The institution is noted for its engineering and music programs and for its distinction as the first in America (in 1906) to offer cooperative education for its students, the idea of classwork combined with practical on-the-job experience.
The players say that the university and the city are not too big or not too small but just right. The city's diverse economic base offers job opportunities after basketball, they said. And their coach, in his third season here, has offered the right touch. "He knew what it took," said Buford, "to get us where we are right now."
It took Huggins and the players fitting all the different pieces together to form a common bond. It took diving for loose balls -- "that's not optional," Huggins said -- and a relentless full-court pressure defense that kept producing turnovers. It took the humor of junior forward Terry Nelson, a standup comedian, to keep everyone loose and players like Nelson who do the dirty, inglorious work under the basket.
Huggins has worn the same, lucky brown suit for the last 10 games, all victories. He said he will later offer it for charity -- after the Final Four, of course.
Huggins arrived here in 1989 after five seasons as head coach at Akron and three more at Walsh College. In his 11 collegiate seasons as a head coach, his teams have won 20 or more games eight times. He said from the start that Cincinnati would eventually make the Final Four.
"I had 15 or so friends in the coaching business call me and tell me I was out of my mind, that I was putting too much pressure on myself," Huggins said. "What happens too often is that people are afraid to dream and are afraid of being disappointed.
"I'm honest and direct and sometimes I don't give the answers that people are looking for. I don't say to my players to do it because I said so. I say do it and here's why. They listen. I listen. My father was a coach and I grew up in a house always full of coaches. I learned there are so many different ways to skin a cat."
There are also many ways to make a "cat" lean and mean and full of desire and once again the apple of a city's eye. That is what Cincinnati's Bearcats are today.
"And no one can take that away from us," Buford said. "That is what our college experience has meant."

HEADLINE: A Day to Demonstrate Affection for the Stars And Some Dismay

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, March 30

 BODY:
By 10 P.M., the movie stars and moguls had left the Academy Award ceremonies outside the Los Angeles Music Center to noisy demonstrators protesting Hollywood's depiction of homosexuals in a number of films.
But the demonstrators, who had threatened to disrupt the Oscar ceremonies, failed to do so. And members of the glamorous audience expressed relief mingled with sympathy. 
 As Academy Award winners trooped backstage to chat with reporters, several said that although the protests fizzled, they would not criticize the demonstrators.
"I think protest is good," said Jodie Foster, who won the award for best actress for her performance in "The Silence of the Lambs." "Protest is American. It's not against the law. Criticism is also good. Anything other than that falls into the category of undignified. But criticism is very important."
Bill Lauch, a New York architect who accepted the late Howard Ashman's award for best song, "Beauty and the Beast," said: "Howard and I shared a home and a life together, but this is so bittersweet. It is the first Academy Award won by a person with AIDS." He also expressed sympathy towards the protesters.
 
A Secular Holiday
 The protests by organizations like Queer Nation were the only somber note in a giddy day in Hollywood. By 2 P.M. the movie studios were empty, the nominees were all dressed up and drinking champagne, and the streets around the Los Angeles Music Center resembled a barricaded war zone in which the police, the paparazzi and demonstrators engaged in running skirmishes. By late afternoon, the freeways were gridlocked in pre-holiday-style traffic as everyone rushed home to turn on the television set.
"For most of my life I saw the Oscars as an occasion to stay home, laugh at the outfits, boo and applaud the winners, and groan at everyone stumbling through their speeches," said Ted Tally, who won the Oscar for best adapted screenplay for "The Silence of the Lambs." "Now, I'm one of them."
Callie Khouri, who won for best original screenplay for "Thelma and Louise," began drinking champagne with her family and friends in her Santa Monica home before she climbed into a limousine paid for by MGM. "You spend your whole life getting to the point where you can express yourself as a writer and try to deal with some truths and thinking of yourself as a kind of serious person," she said. "But the one thing I kept worrying about, obsessing about, is what shoes I'll wear under my Oscar dress."
The movie industry was virtually shut down this afternoon in preparation for the 64th annual Academy Awards. "It's sort of a holiday, the only religious rite we have in Hollywood," one studio executive said. "You have to observe it. It's like getting dressed up for church or temple -- except this is strictly a secular experience and Oscar is our golden idol."
By early evening, after an opening monologue by the master of ceremonies, Billy Crystal, that kidded everyone from Vice President Dan Quayle to the director Oliver Stone, the winners, gripping their golden idols, began trooping backstage to talk to reporters.
Jack Palance, who was named best supporting actor for "City Slickers," plainly indicated that the 39-year interval between his last nomination for "Shane" and his current award had left him in a bleak mood. His Hollywood career, he implied, has been turbulent.
"My future plans -- I don't have any future plans," he said tartly. Had the 68-year-old actor won the Oscar earlier in his career, he said, the award would have had an impact. Now, Mr. Palance implied, the award's effect on his career would be marginal.
On the other hand, an exuberant Mercedes Ruehl, who was named best supporting actress for "The Fisher King," discussed "the pleasure and validation" of the Oscar. Ms. Ruehl said she was planning to start rehearsing "Anthony and Cleopatra" at the Actors Theater of Louisville, and then repeat her Tony Award-winning role in the film of Neil Simon's "Lost in Yonkers."
Anthony Hopkins, who won the award for best actor for his portrayal of the cannibalistic psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter in "The Silence of the Lambs," was asked what he would be having for dinner. He broke into a laugh. "I'm going to the Governor's Ball, and I'll eat everyone's dinner," he said.
Jonathan Demme, who received the Oscar for best director for the film, said: "This is all so unbelievable. It's very hard to digest. No pun intended."
 
'It's All So Bizarre'
 The gray, drizzly day followed a single pattern, Hollywood style. Nominees worked a bit in the morning, went to barbers and hairdressers in the early afternoon, put on their outfit of outfits, met friends at home for champagne, piled into limousines and went to the Academy Awards at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Later, many of them were to attend the academy's official party, the Governor's Ball, in a tent on the Music Center plaza, and then, with the night still young, make their way around town to numerous parties.
At midday the scene downtown at the Los Angeles Music Center was chaotic. Hundreds of police and security officers and firefighters surrounded the music center all day, partly because of demonstrations by gay protesters against what they termed Hollywood's unfair treatment of homosexuals. The demonstrators singled out films including "J. F. K." and "The Silence of the Lambs," two nominees for best picture, as well as "Basic Instinct," which opened this month, as films that dealt crudely and unfairly with gay characters.
About a dozen people, blowing whistles and carrying signs reading "Hollywood Stop Censoring Our True Queer Lives," demonstrated noisily outside the ceremonies. Several of them embraced and kissed, and others pasted small signs that said "Fag" on an enormous replica of the Oscar. Security officers quickly removed the tags as the crowd waiting for the movie stars to enter applauded and booed the demonstrators. Sizable numbers of Los Angeles police officers patrolled the area on horseback to drive back the demonstrators and arrested several of them.
The fans, many of whom arrived with sleeping bags on Sunday, surged forward, shrieking "Barbra!" "Kevin!" "Warren!" "Julia!" as the stars, some of whom wore red bows on their lapels symbolizing AIDS awareness, climbed out of limousines in mid-afternoon, waved like royalty and walked past the photographers and the screaming crowd into the marble-and-black-glass Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the hall where the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences often holds its annual awards ceremony.
 
Metaphors and Money
 Some of the participants looked beyond the ceremony to more bankable matters, pointing out that winning an Oscar -- or even a nomination -- represents a considerable financial gain to a film, especially in overseas markets, as well as to the performers or technicians who triumph.
"It increases the fortunes of everyone involved," said Lynda Obst, one of the producers of "The Fisher King," which was nominated for five Oscars. "You're able to somehow break through the wall." Beyond the money factor, she said, the Oscars serve as a metaphor for Hollywood.
"There's the nature of this place," she said. "Sociopathically competitive, status-conscious, hierarchal, flavor-of-the-month-oriented and glamour-struck. Somehow, this is the brass ring at the end of the rainbow. You become crazy."
Robert Bookman, an agent at the Creative Artists Agency, put it another way. "Unless you're a nominee, when it's the most important night of you life, Oscar is work; it's not fun," he said. "It's not even glamorous. It's business. It has an enormous effect on people's careers in terms of what they're offered, what their price will be and how they're perceived by their peers. It's really a bottom-line evening."
 
A Little Less Flamboyance
 The most famous party, and probably the hottest ticket, was the one given annually by the agent Irving (Swifty) Lazar, and his wife, Mary, at which some of the biggest movie stars in town would be crammed, like rush-hour subway riders, into Spago, a restaurant above Sunset Strip in West Hollywood. The guest list included Elizabeth Taylor, Tom Cruise, Anjelica Huston, Barbra Streisand, Warren Beatty, Annette Bening, Faye Dunaway, Kevin Costner and just about everyone else who has ever appeared on the cover of People magazine.
"The party began 30 years ago in my home, and it just grew to what it is today," said Mr. Lazar, who has just turned 85. "We invite people because we like them, not because they're important. But, believe me, some people try to take advantage."
Mr. Lazar said a very well-known agent tried to have an equally well-known producer invited several years ago, but the Lazars refused. "Why? Because the guy is a bore," Mr. Lazar said. "The agent said the producer would give $50,000 to charity. I said no. He said the fellow will give $100,000 to charity. I said no. Can you believe it?"
Movie executives spent the weekend and today wining and dining the creators and stars of their Oscar-nominated films at parties in their homes in Bel Air and Beverly Hills. Mark Canton, the chairman of Columbia Pictures, said he was convinced that even in Hollywood, which takes its parties very seriously, the nation's sluggish economy had led to a more low-key Oscar event than usual. Mr. Canton had a party on Saturday night at his home in Holmby Hills for, among others, Barbra Streisand, Nick Nolte and Kate Nelligan of "The Prince of Tides," as well as John Singleton, who was nominated for best director and best screenplay for "Boyz N the Hood."
Despite the glamour and glitz today, Mr. Canton observed, "It's a sobering time now. There's a little bit less flamboyance. People are a little less concerned about the parties."
But many in Hollywood, like elsewhere, simply stayed home and watched the show -- with a difference.
"It's such a company town, such a tight-knit little world, and this is the one really officially sanctioned event," said Robert Cort, the president of Interscope Communications, a film and television production company. Mr. Cort had arranged to watch the show at his Bel Air home with his wife, Rosalie Swedlin, a producer, and several friends. "You tend to know a lot of people who are sitting in the audience, and it's kind of like seeing old friends -- or enemies."
"It's sort of like the end of a long political campaign," he added. "And yet it's Hollywood. You have the advantage here of being part of something -- and yet you know it matters to the rest of the world, too. Everyone cares about the Oscars out there. So it's a pretty heady mixture for everyone in Hollywood, where narcissism runs amok anyway."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Prepare for Lockout In Spring of '93, Fehr Is Warning Players

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., March 30

 BODY:
For four weeks, Donald Fehr has been traveling through Florida and Arizona telling the members of the union he heads to expect their employers to employ a two-stage strategy in the next 12 months:
*Reopen the collective bargaining agreement in December. 
 *Lock out the players from spring training next February.
"It's almost a here-we-go-again thing," Fehr said after one of his recent spring meetings with players. "You don't take it as a certainty because a lot can happen between now and then, but at the moment, I assume they will reopen and I assume they will lock out. They have clearly left the impression with the players that they intend to lock out. If they do, it'll be a long one so you have to prepare for it. You plan for the worst-case scenario."
In planning for that scenario, the Major League Baseball Players Association is in the process of accumulating a fund that a year from now is expected to total between $125 million and $140 million. The money, which would be used in the event of an extended work stoppage, comes from licensing fees that the union is holding instead of distributing to the players.
 
'Reopening Is an Option'
 But concern about a labor confrontation is premature, owners say. "We're a long way from making any of those decisions," said Bud Selig of the Milwaukee Brewers, chairman of the board of directors of the Player Relations Committee, the owners' labor body.
The labor agreement negotiated during a spring lockout in 1990 runs to the end of 1993, but either side can reopen it by giving the other side notice by Dec. 11, 1992. If the contract is reopened, either side would be free to "engage in concerted action."
"Obviously, reopening is an option we have and we'd be silly not to consider the option," said Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox, a member of the Player Relations Committee board.
Reinsdorf, whom the players view as one of the more militant owners, also acknowledged that if the owners did reopen and the two sides could not reach agreement, a lockout could loom.
 
Not Ruling Out Lockout
 "To me," Reinsdorf said, "all a lockout means is there's a work stoppage and the owners have decided the timing. A strike is where the players decide the timing. To me, if we can't reach agreement and we reach an impasse, a lockout is something that would have to be considered."
The owners used that strategy in 1990, and the dispute, primarily over eligibility for salary arbitration, wasn't resolved until March 18. Commissioner Fay Vincent was instrumental in the resolution, but some owners didn't appreciate his involvement, saying that he was too conciliatory. Owners involved in labor relations have made it clear that Richard Ravitch, new president of the Player Relations Committee and a former New York City mayoral candidate, will be management's negotiator.
"The commissioner is not a member of the board of directors of the P.R.C.," said Reinsdorf. "In 1981, Bowie Kuhn did not participate. In '85 and '90, the commissioners did. Technically they probably shouldn't have."
Two years ago, Selig said, "there were more participants, including myself, than there should have been."
"Dick Ravitch is going to do the negotiations for us," Selig said.
 
Ravitch Is the Negotiator
 Asked about the view that Vincent was too involved in 1990, Selig said: "I don't want to comment on that. Everybody is comfortable that Dick is the negotiator."
Everybody perhaps except the players. They viewed Vincent's involvement as a positive step in the quagmire that passes for baseball's labor relations and would like to have his input again in the next negotiations.
The commissioner said he was aware of the Player Relations Committee's position on negotiations and said Ravitch should do the job he was hired to do.
"I didn't think it was my role to be involved in the last negotiation," Vincent said. "The only reason I got involved was nothing was being done."
Whether or not the Player Relations Committee approves, the commissioner could step into negotiations under the "best interests of baseball" clause in the major league agreement.
 
Keeping Commissioner Out?
 There is also the perception in some baseball circles that the joint economic study committee created in the last negotiations is another example of how the owners want to keep the commissioner away from player relations.
The study committee, composed of Fehr, Selig and two outside professionals selected by each side, met here for more than 20 hours Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Vincent had been here visiting spring training camps but was not asked to attend any of the sessions.
"It means nothing, zero," Selig said of Vincent's absence.
Vincent said, "I don't think my not going is a big deal."
Fehr, meanwhile, prepared to wrap up his spring sessions, having two teams left after meeting with Seattle players today. His message remained the same: Be prepared for a reopener and a lockout.
"We hear references to a conflagration coming, about Armageddon on the horizon," he said in an interview. "But the rumor mill seems to have slowed down since I first made comments in Florida, which is another reason I feel I'm right."

HEADLINE: Soil Degradation Study: There Goes the Farm

 BODY:
MORE than three billion acres of land, amounting to 11 percent of the world's vegetated surface area, have become seriously degraded since World War II, an environmental research group has reported.
The soils, mostly in Asia and Africa, have lost much of their capacity to produce crops or lumber or support livestock, the group, the World Resources Institute in Washington, said in a report last week. In total, they represent an area the size of China and India together. 
 "Soil that you can't produce crops on anymore is real serious business," said Robert Livernash, senior editor of the report. "This is an alarm bell."
 
Survey of Scientists
 The study by the World Resources Institute drew on data from more than 250 soil scientists about levels of erosion, salinization, and physical destruction in the world's soils. Major causes of damage include farming, overgrazing and deforestation, the study said.
More than a third of the degraded area is in Asia, where severe water erosion has destroyed soils in western India, the Himalayas, Southeast Asia and China, and wind erosion threatens western China and Mongolia.
Nearly half of Asia's damaged soils were degraded by deforestation and a quarter by overgrazing and most of the rest by agriculture.
When fields become unproductive, farmers often abandon them for newly cleared lands, making soil degradation a major contributor to loss of forests worldwide.
"I rank this as the No. 1 environmental problem in the world," said Dr. David Pimentel, professor of entomology and agricultural sciences at Cornell University.
"Ninety-eight percent of the world's food for people comes from the land as opposed to the sea or rivers or all the rest," he said. "When we degrade this land we get deforestation. We get losses in biodiversity. We get global warming."
 
Very Slow Process
 Dr. Pimentel said the problem of soil degradation received too little attention. "Even farmers don't appreciate the degradation that is occurring because it occurs so slowly," he said.
A farmer can lose one twenty-fifth of an inch of soil in one good rain storm at night, which is more than five tons of topsoil on a single acre.
"The next morning a farmer wouldn't notice that," Dr. Pimentel said. "But about 20 years after this you'd have lost one inch of topsoil, which takes 500 years to reform."
Though soil quality has degraded since 1945, agricultural productivity has risen because of better crop varieties, irrigation, fertilizers and pesticides. But productivity could have been higher had soil quality been maintained.
For instance, farms in the hilly Palouse area of eastern Washington State are estimated to have lost more than 500 pounds of winter wheat per acre because heavy erosion has impoverished their soils.
 
No Hope for Some Lands
 Most of the three billion damaged acres can be restored to full productivity only with major and often costly improvements. More than 22 million of those acres have had their biotic functions fully destroyed so that no amount of effort will restore them.
While many farmers own the land they work and are committed to harvesting from it for the long term, it is often not in their economic interest to invest in conservation or restoration.
In fact, on very fertile lands, an individual farmer may not benefit at all from conservation practices. The World Resources Institute report suggests that it is therefore up to governments to tackle the issue.
"We already know a lot of different ways to solve these problems," Mr. Livernash said, "but it's really a question of having the money and the political will to do it. There are lots of techniques to restore degraded lands or to reduce or prevent soil erosion."
Study results were reported in "World Resources 1992-93," published by the World Resources Institute, P.O. Box 4852, Hampden Station, Baltimore, Md. 21211.

HEADLINE: Novel Strategy Puts People At Heart of Texas Preserve

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO

 BODY:
THE ecological heart of Texas consists not of desert and dust, but of deep, spectacular wooded canyons where eagles soar and rare songbirds nest, and thousands of crystalline springs bubble from the forested hillsides. Beneath the surface lie vast, honeycombed formations of limestone where strange creatures whose kind have not seen the light of day for millennia live in subterranean rivers, caves and flooded crevices.
It is the Texas hill country, and a grand experiment in what might be called the New Conservation is under way to save its distinctive assemblages of flora and fauna. 
 In an area almost twice as large as New Jersey where 2.5 million Texans live, including the cities of San Antonio and Austin, the Nature Conservancy is brokering a pioneering effort involving dozens of public agencies and private interests. The goal of the Conservancy, a nonprofit organization that operates the world's largest system of private nature preserves, is to help the economy and ecology of the hill country flourish together.
The principle, a sharp departure from traditional conservation, is to focus on the entire inhabited landscape, not just individual species or even habitats. That requires humans, too, to be treated as part of the ecosystem.
Conservationists have historically ignored and excluded humans as somehow separate from and antagonistic to the rest of nature. They have tried to set aside nature preserves, keep people out and let nature take its course, reckoning that this was enough. The results have been less than satisfactory. Natural ecosystems have become increasingly fragmented, and even in the preserves native species have often been pushed toward extinction by plants and animals introduced from elsewhere.
"For too long we have behaved as if conservation could be achieved merely by separating nature from people, with detrimental effects on both," said Dr. Robert E. Jenkins Jr., the Conservancy's vice president for science.
Consequently, conservationists increasingly seek to integrate human activity with natural ecosystems. The plan in the case of the Texas hill country is to stitch together a quilt of healthy natural habitat and settled areas, saving as many species as possible while preserving economic vitality.
In attempting to execute the plan, the Conservancy is working with local, state and Federal authorities, environmentalists and landowners in a three-pronged strategy:
*Setting aside a few highly protected and carefully managed "core" reserves for native fauna and flora, in addition to existing park lands.
*Surrounding the core reserves with ecologically friendly buffer zones. These would consist, for instance, of ranches that maintain wild habitat for tourists as well as undeveloped areas of military installations.
*Creating ecologically healthy islands of wildlife habitat on the outskirts of cities while allowing development to proceed around them.
The strategy assumes that when conservationists can plan for an entire ecological region, preserving the most essential tracts of land, it becomes less necessary to protect every scrap of habitat. The hope is that fewer knock-down fights will develop between environmentalists and economic interests, and that fewer wild species will wind up on the endangered list.
The Nature Conservancy and its allies here are not insisting that "every little-bitty bug, every little-bitty tree" be protected, said Beyrl Armstrong, the manager of a 9,300-acre guest ranch west of here where an extensive habitat protection program is under way. This moderate path, he said, opens a welcome middle road between "the screamers on the far right, who say this is my damn land and I can do anything I want with it, and the screamers on the far left, who chain themselves around every tree they come up on."
Experimenters in the New Conservation are still feeling their way, both here and in other parts of the country, and how their efforts will turn out remains to be seen. Not least in Texas, with its highly developed sense of bow-necked, don't-tread-on-me landowner independence, the potential for conflict remains high in the best of circumstances. The fate of some aspects of the hill country project is touch and go.
But a general shift in philosophy is clearly taking hold among conservationists, and in the hill country the challenge is more than matched by the grandeur of the opportunity.
 
Stair Steps
The Ecosystem And the Threat
 The hill country's most distinctive feature is the Balcones Escarpment, a 200-mile-long crescent of limestone stair steps cross-cut by rivers and streams that have carved out the region's characteristic ravines and canyons. Rainwater cascading off the stair steps runs into millions of tiny openings in the limestone and collects underground in a reservoir, one of the biggest and purest in the country.
In the crevices of the aquifer dwell many species of insects, crustaceans, salamanders and small fish, many of them unpigmented and blind. The aquifer, the region's sole source of drinking water, depends for its quality on the integrity of the natural ecosystem above, which buffers it from pollution.
 
158 Species of Birds
 Oak and Ashe juniper, locally called cedar, set the vegetational tone of the region. Its green hills, canyons and tablelands are a biological crossroads for species from grasslands, deciduous forests and deserts. The hill country is host to 17 major plant communities, each with its special assemblage of animals and microorganisms.
One measure of the region's biological variety is the 158 species of birds that have been sighted on the Prade Ranch, managed by Mr. Armstrong, in the heart of the region. On a day earlier this month, three golden eagles wheeled in the sky above a mist-shrouded ridge, while an endangered golden-cheeked warbler, newly arrived after migrating from Central America, appeared in response to Mr. Armstrong's call. "My enchilada from Guatemala," Mr. Armstrong called the bird.
Both the warbler, which nests exclusively in Texas, and the black-capped vireo, also endangered, depend on the hill country habitat.
Over all, some 70 species of hill country plants and animals have been identified as rare or threatened. They include plants like Hellers' false gromwell, the broadpod rushpea and the Comal snakewood, and creatures like the Blanco blind salamander, the Bee Creek Cave harvestman, and the ghost-faced bat.
So far, the hill country still supports most of the species that lived there before Europeans settled the country, and only a tiny fraction of the total are under threat. While the raising of sheep and goats has changed the landscape, it has been spared intensive development.
Until now. The population of the San Antonio and Austin areas is booming, and the beauty of the hill country is an increasingly strong magnet for urban expansion, retirees and tourists. The population of the 26 counties that make up the conservation project grew by 27 percent from 1980 to 1990.
 
Devil's River
Core Preserves And Buffers
 In the hill country, as in 11 other large, diverse geographical areas in the United States and Latin America, the Nature Conservancy has delineated a landscape-wide "bioreserve" planned to include as many of the region's species as possible.
The 18,650-square-mile Texas bioreserve is to contain four to six core preserves. The first of which, through which the Devil's River runs, was purchased by the Conservancy last fall. In the last 40 years, the Conservancy has bought more than 5.5 million acres of ecologically important land in the United States and abroad, reselling 60 percent of its holdings to governments. It operates some 1,300 private nature preserves in the United States and abroad.
The Devil's River core preserve is a spectacular 19,000-acre tract in the relatively dry western part of the hill country. The river's source is the clear springs that flow from towering limestone formations streaked in colors of gray and rust. The centerpiece of the reserve is a lush but ecologically delicate oasis with a cataract called Dolan Falls. Cormorants and great blue herons fly above. Sycamores and oaks line the banks. Killdeer run along the flats. Spotted squirrels batten on acorns. Tiny rare fish swim in the crystal water.
 
Ranches as Buffer Zones
 "This is so fragile," said Jeff Weigel, the Texas Nature Conservancy's director of stewardship. "This is what takes the highest level of protection. It couldn't take a lot of human use."
But neither the Conservancy nor any other group will ever be able to buy up entire landscapes. So the group is trying to work with landowners to promote land use that both turns a profit and is compatible with the ecosystem's health. These tracts would serve as buffers for core preserves. The prospects appear good in the hill country, since much of it is taken up by ranches rich in habitat, many of whose owners have long been concerned with preserving wildlife.
The Conservancy has identified several ranches to serve as examples that other landowners might be persuaded to follow. One is the Prade Ranch, whose 9,300 acres are a biological cornucopia. There, Mr. Armstrong tends a going enterprise based on limited cattle ranching; hunting, which prevents an exploding deer population from wreaking ecological havoc; the hosting of conferences and meetings, and nature study, especially bird watching.
 
Binocular-Toting Tourists
 "When I first came here I looked around and said to myself, 'I could keep this place full of binocular-toting people from New York all day long,' " he said. "People will pay big money to come and see golden-cheeked warblers. I got 'em, and I got more than anybody else, and I know where they are, and I know how to talk to 'em."
Making a go of the venture requires Mr. Armstrong to preserve intact the ecosystem on which it depends, and to manage it carefully. Marrying economics and conservation "is going to have to happen more and more and more," he said, because it is becoming evident that traditional ranching activities are not enough to sustain the high costs of maintaining a ranch.
But there is some distance to go in convincing ranchers to embrace conservation values. Some, Mr. Armstrong said, "were raised on the idea that the Lord gave you dominion over all, and that it was not only your right but your responsibility to go out there and make America safe for domesticated animals and to eradicate anything wild."
 
Austin
Wildlife Habitat In an Urban Area
 The struggle between landowners' prerogatives and conservation values erupted with a vengeance four years ago in the Austin area, and the result has been the birth of a pioneering conservation program for the burgeoning metropolitan area whose progress is being closely watched around the country.
This is the front line of the hill country project, the place where urban development and nature meet head on. The issue was forced in 1988 when developers came into conflict with the Endangered Species Act, under which the golden-cheeked warbler, the black-capped vireo and five species of endangered bugs living in the Austin area are protected. Under the law, developers must comply with Federal regulations protecting the species.
Fearing legal chaos and economic paralysis if each landowner negotiated separately with the Government, developers, environmentalists and local agencies invited the Nature Conservancy to mediate in an attempt to come up with a coordinated, county-wide plan that would allow development to proceed while protecting habitat. Such consolidations are permitted under the Endangered Species Act.
 
60,000 Acres Near Austin
 The result is a conservation plan for the Austin area, developed over the last three years by a committee composed of parties on all sides of the issue. The plan aims to carve out 60,000 acres of the least fragmented habitat within the metropolitan area and establish it as a system of preserves. "Incidental takings" of habitat by developers are to be allowed, said David Braun, the director of the Texas Nature Conservancy. But the most important chunks of habitat, many of them contiguous, will be set aside as "a viable preserve system around which development can occur," he said.
The land is being assembled in a variety of ways. The Federal Government is acquiring half the required acreage. The Conservancy has been taking options on other parcels. Some of the land will be paid for by local governments. Some is being purchased and donated by developers with the understanding that they will be allowed to pursue, uncontested, developments they plan elsewhere in the local area.
The locally financed portion of the plan is poised to go into effect if a bond issue to finance the City of Austin's share of the land acquisition, tentatively set for this August, passes. But there is much contention. While there is considerable support for the plan, some taxpayers balk at putting up the money. Some landowners argue that if anyone should pick up the tab, the public should. The general mood in Austin, a liberal university town, favors the plan, "but the details could kill it" said the Mayor, Bruce Todd, who is also chairman of the project's executive committee. "It can pass, but not without some work."
As for the overall hill country bioreserve project, "they've got a good idea," said Dan Byfield, a lobbyist for the Texas Farm Bureau, which opposes what it sees as the Endangered Species Act's infringement of property rights. The Conservancy "got off on the wrong foot" with landowners by announcing the project without without consulting ranchers, he said. And "once you put that line on a map," he said, "you have inadvertently put somebody in harm's way of the Endangered Species Act. You've said that land is environmentally sensitive."
Nevertheless, he said, "what the Nature Conservancy is doing is probably a concept we've all got to turn toward."

Chart: "An Ecosystem Viewed as a Whole"
A new approach seeks to protect the Texas hill country as an entire inhabited landscape, rather than focusing on individual species and habitats. It combines three elements in an attempt to integrate human activity with nature.
 
1. The wilderness
 Four to six core reserves are to be established to protect and manage natural habitat. The first, north of Del Rio, was bought last fall by the Nature Conservancy.
 
2. Eco-ranching
 Ranchers with vast acreage are being encouraged to bring ecological perspectives to their money-making plans. Some cater to nature study, bird watching and similar activities.
 
3. Habitats near cities
 Governments, environmentalists and landowners in the Austin area are attempting to cobble together healthy islands of wildlife habitat while allowing development to proceed around them.

The Biggest Seed
 Q. Which plant has the largest seed?
A. A tall palm tree called Lodoicea maldivicia, which grows only in the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean, produces the largest single seed known in the plant kingdom, said Dr. Andrew Henderson, a botanist and research associate at the Institute of Economic Botany at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. 
 The two-lobed seed can be 20 inches long. It grows in huge fruits that look something like two coconuts joined together in an almost heart-shaped arrangement, Dr. Henderson said.
To the European sailors who first saw the seeds floating in the ocean, the shape was suggestive of female buttocks. To the tourists who eventually followed, they looked like wonderful souvenirs, and the trees are threatened in the wild because local residents collect the seeds to sell, Dr. Henderson said.
The seeds are also much sought after by amateur palm growers, but they are not easy to cultivate, he said. They have a very slow germination time of several years. Eventually a shoot grows out of the seed and then goes underground.
 
Blood Trouble
 Q. What is vasculitis and what causes it?
A. Vasculitis is a general term for inflammation of blood vessels, according to the American Medical Association. The inflammation usually damages the lining of the vessels, so that they become constricted or blocked. This, in turn, leads to damage and sometimes destruction of the tissues that are normally supplied with oxygen carried by the blood.
In most cases, vasculitis is thought to be caused by bodies circulating in the blood called immune complexes. These are clumps of foreign materials called antigens that are bound to antibodies formed in response to the antigens. Normally the clumps are destroyed by white blood cells called phagocytes, but sometimes they settle in the walls of blood vessels and cause severe inflammation.
Vasculitis is the basic problem in a number of ailments with other names. It can sometimes arise as a secondary problem from infections like hepatitis B, streptococcus or tuberculosis and can also result from oversensitivity to injections of an antiserum of animal origin, like the antirabies serum obtained from horses. However, in many cases the cause is unknown.

Mets Urged To Break Silence

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., March 30

 BODY:
Silence continues to reign in the Mets' clubhouse. Patience, though, may be wearing thin in the front office.
Al Harazin, the team's general manager, said today that he had been working behind the scenes over the last 24 hours to achieve an end to a boycott of the news media being enforced by the players. 
 "Everybody is trying to do what they can, all trying to deal with a sensitive situation," Harazin said. "It would be inappropriate for me to comment further."
Harazin's announcement came against the backdrop of the final week of spring training. The Mets, apparently able to divorce themselves from the disturbing distractions that have plagued them for weeks, have played remarkable baseball recently.
Today, Howard Johnson slammed a pair of home runs, Dwight Gooden pitched another healthy six innings and the Mets won their 12th exhibition game in the last 14. The heart of the lineup has produced dozens of runs, the defense has tightened, and the pitching has Mel Stottlemyre talking about it being superior to the 1988 staff.
It would thus seem to make for a perfect prelude to the regular season for the Mets. They spent millions of dollars and countless hours in the off season overhauling the club, and appear prepared to make good.
But Harazin said that tickets sales for 1992 have been only marginally better than last season. And the fact that the players are not talking is not helping matters.
"Under ordinary circumstances, I'd be more disappointed, but given the nature of the economy in New York, I feel kind of good about it," Harazin said of the ticket sales. "We're not any more insulated from the economy than anyone else."
Harazin confirmed that the Mets and the commissioner's office have been talking about the players' news media boycott, and that the talk would go on. "We're hopeful we can make progress this week," Harazin said.
 
Six Shutout Innings
 The progress on the field for the Mets continued to be accelerated and even exhilarating. Gooden, in his third official start of the spring, worked six shutout innings, his longest, most impressive stint of the spring. Struggling once more for complete control of his repertory, Gooden struck out five, with high fastballs and one 3-2 curve.
"It's amazing when you look up and see the numbers on the scoreboard," said Manager Jeff Torborg. "And when he today reached back, he had pop."
Gooden, of course, had nothing to say afterward. Johnson, who has now driven in 21 runs this spring, wouldn't speak. Junior Noboa, the utility player who was smiling at his strong spring days ago, got another pair of hits, but was prohibited from speaking about what Torborg has termed "the surprise of the spring."
 
INSIDE PITCH
 The Mets, convinced that TERRY BROSS would never be a factor in their plans, Monday traded the right-handed reliever to the Padres for CRAIG BULLOCK, a 20-year-old third-base prospect. "I feel an obligation to try and move a young player once it's clear they aren't going to be with us at the major league level," GERRY HUNSICKER, the vice president for baseball operations for the Mets, said of Bross. "Terry, I believe, can pitch in the major leagues, but it wasn't going to be with us." Bullock, playing in Class A last season, hit .234 with 8 homers and 50 runs batted in. "He's a big, strapping kid, another prospect to add to our organization," said Hunsicker.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Delay Rerouting Of Flights

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERNARDSVILLE, N.J., March 30

 BODY:
Residents of northern New Jersey and Staten Island who have been fighting to change air-traffic patterns near the region's airports to reduce noise will not see any route changes for at least a year, the Federal Aviation Administration says.
Norbert A. Owens, the agency's Deputy Associate Administrator for Air Traffic, said at a hearing of a Congressional subcommittee today that an environmental impact study scheduled for completion in May 1991 would not be finished until the end of 1992. 
 And that study, even if it supports moving takeoff and landing patterns over the ocean, will not be the final step. Mr. Owens said further environmental studies would probably be required to assess the impact of new routes on areas beneath them.
"That's the most important thing I've heard today," said Representative Richard Zimmer, a Republican of Delaware Township, who conducted the hearing. He said the F.A.A. had failed to conduct an environmental study before it changed all the routes in the Northeast in 1987. Now, Mr. Zimmer said, the agency appears to be using the need for such studies to delay making changes that would respond to noise complaints by residents of New York and New Jersey.
Mr. Zimmer asked Mr. Owens how the agency could have failed to anticipate the angry reaction from people living below the new flight patterns. The Federal official said the agency was required to assess noise problems only when planes are at 3,000 feet or below, when they are close to airports. He said the agency made some adjustments in 1989, "albeit after the fact," in response to complaints from people living farther from the airports.
Mr. Owens agreed that the agency "did not assess the level of noise complaints correctly," and added, "but we are listening now." That statement brought groans from many of the 100 people who crowded into a small meeting room at the Bernardsville Municipal Building.
Mr. Zimmer said the 1989 changes simply shifted the noise problems from the air over Cranford to Scotch Plains. "The agency has been basically unresponsive," he said. "For a long time, agency officials took the position that the noise problems were simply figments of residents' imaginations."
Mr. Zimmer is sponsoring legislation to force the Federal agency to use ocean routes where feasible within 18 months. In cases where these routes could not be used, the agency would have to return to routes in use before 1987. Mr. Owens said the 1987 changes were intended to meet a rapid increase in air traffic in the region and that without them, the economies in the area would have suffered.
 
U.S. Threat to Port Authority
 The hearing panel, which included Representatives Susan Molinari, Republican of Staten Island, and Dean A. Gallo, Republican of Parsippany, also questioned the aviation administration about its threat to withold approval of a plan by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to assess a $3 passenger tax on airline travelers to help pay for a $2 billion plan to build rail links to Newark, Kennedy and La Guardia Airports.
The F.A.A. opposes a plan by the Port Authority to accelerate the Federal agency's schedule for eliminating noisy aircraft. The Federal Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 requires airlines to phase out or upgrade their noisiest aircraft over the next 10 years. The Port Authority is scheduled to vote this summer on the plan to move up that schedule.
Louise E. Maillet, director of the Office of Environment and Energy for the F.A.A., said the Port Authority had failed to provide a detailed cost and benefits analysis of its plan. She said a computer model of the entire national air traffic system indicated that the authority's plan could cost an additional $1.2 billion across the system.
Both Mr. Zimmer and Jerry Fitzgerald, Deputy Director of Aviation for the Port Authority, said they doubted the Federal agency's cost estimate. "We'd like to get a look at their computer model," Mr. Fitzgerald said.
Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island Borough President, played a tape of an outdoor speech he made that was drowned out by aircraft noise. "I sympathize with the people in New Jersey," he said. "But in all honesty, our aircraft noise problems are much worse."

HEADLINE: Census Shows Connecticut Is Richest State

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., March 30

 BODY:
Connecticut became America's wealthiest state during the 1980's, as its residents' incomes soared and its poverty rate declined, according to newly released 1990 Census Bureau data.
But there were also signs of increasing economic duress, evident in the rising costs of housing and the number of manufacturing jobs lost, even though the information was collected before the current recession. 
 In many ways, the Census report offers a portrait of a prosperous state just as it was beginning to descend into the economic maelstrom of the last two years. Unemployment, for example, rose from 5.4 percent when the Census collected its data to 7.5 percent in January, and the Connecticut labor force has continued to contract.
The report, the third detailed state report to be released by the Census Bureau, is based on the long-form Census questionnaires sent to one in six households.
The Census also indicated that Connecticut had a fourfold increase in the number of foreign-born residents during the 1980's and that the ranks of working women continued their generation-long growth.
"Connecticut passed Alaska in the 1980's to become the state with the highest per capita income," said James Palma Jr., the planning analyst supervisor with the Connecticut State Data Center, which analyzes Census information for state and local governments. The Census first reported that Connecticut had the nation's highest per capita income in 1986, as the Alaskan oil boom was fading.
The state's median household income -- half the state's households are above this point and half below -- increased 24 percent after inflation, to $41,721 in 1989 from $33,649 in 1979. Per capita income went up even more sharply, to $20,189, from $14,264.
The number of Connecticut residents below the official poverty level dropped from 8.0 percent in 1979 to 6.8 percent in 1989. The poverty level, which varies by household size and other factors, currently is defined as an annual income of $5,947 for an individual or $9,981 for a family with two adults and one child. The percentage of people over 65 years old who were below the poverty level went down from 8.7 percent to 7.2 percent, and the poverty rate for children under 18 went from 11.4 percent to 10.4 percent.
The general picture of growing prosperity was dampened by sharp increases in housing costs. For homeowners with a mortgage, the median monthly cost rose 66.3 percent after inflation, to $1,096. Nearly one-fourth of homeowners spent at least 30 percent of their income on housing, compared with less than one-fifth spending that proportion in 1980. Among renters, 40.5 percent had monthly housing costs of at least 30 percent of their income.
 
Housing Costs 'a Flag'
 "When housing costs are more than 30 percent, that's a flag," Mr. Palma said. "It either means that more people are choosing to spend more of their money on housing or they have no choice. And it's a fair assumption that it's not by choice."
Since 1988, Connecticut real estate prices have fallen by about 20 percent, with half of that decline occurring since the Census, said Nicholas S. Perna, the chief economist for Connecticut National Bank.
He noted that one possible bright spot since the Census data were collected was that "affordability has improved, because house prices and interest rates are down, while incomes rose slightly in 1991."
Although the state's total population grew by 5.8 percent, to 3,287,116, Connecticut's labor force grew more than twice as much, increasing 15 percent, to 1,804,457. The percentage of women in the work force shot up from 53.6 percent in 1980 to 60.9 percent in 1990, while the percentage of men in the work force dipped from 78.3 percent to 77.8 percent.
The number of manufacturing jobs, until recently the backbone of the state's economy, declined to 346,551, from 458,816. By January of this year, the number was 318,200, according to Kathy Hurley, a spokeswoman for the State Labor Department.
 
A Growth of Immigrants
 Conversely, employment in retail trade grew from 215,873 to 260,829, and the number of workers in finance, insurance and real estate increased from 118,702 to 176,421.
In the last year, however, employment in retail trade dropped by 6 percent, Mr. Perna said, and the other fields also showed decreases.
The proportion of Federal, state and local government employees edged slightly downward to about one in eight Connecticut workers; the 1990 total was 217,327, compared with 207,129 a decade earlier.
"We've lost close to 10 percent of our jobs since the peak in late 1988 or early 1989," Mr. Perna said.
 
How the Data Are Gathered
 The Census Bureau's report on Connecticut is the third of the agency's reports on the 50 states and the District of Columbia to be issued. The first state report issued was on Vermont, and the second on Montana.
Reports on New York and New Jersey are "tentatively to be released the week of April 13," said Sharon Massie, an information assistant with the Census. Detailed information for the entire nation is to be released after all state reports are issued.
The data are based on the long-form questionnaire that was distributed in 1990 to one in six, or 17.7 million, housing units throughout the United States.
Among the topics included in the survey are population data on education, citizenship, ancestry, the language spoken at home, veteran status, disability, industry of employment, labor force participation, occupation, income and poverty status.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
Spotlight on Bronx: Heat's on Dinkins

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Today, Mayor David N. Dinkins will move his office to that hoary national symbol of urban problems, the Bronx. But when the Democratic Presidential contenders debate there tonight with the eyes of the nation upon them, their host will be not the Mayor, but Borough President Fernando Ferrer.
After striving for months to spotlight urban problems -- and winning little public attention -- the Mayor found himself last week facing the magic media opportunity of the primary, but one-upped by Mr. Ferrer. The Borough President long ago arranged the televised debate at 7 P.M. at Herbert H. Lehman College, to be shown on WABC-TV and C-Span. 
 So the Mayor, whose weeklong sojourn to the Bronx is part of a continuing public relations campaign to be seen as more responsive to the concerns of ordinary New Yorkers, will end up going back home to ask the candidates about their urban policies at a hastily arranged forum with other mayors at Gracie Mansion this afternoon.
That dichotomy is a metaphor for Mr. Dinkins's political headache these days: How to make the case that Washington's neglect has contributed to New York's problems, and how to persuade his fellow New Yorkers that he can help solve those problems. In other words, how to think globally and act locally.
Of course, if Mr. Ferrer and the Mayor were getting along better, they might have worked out a joint event in the only New York borough on the mainland United States. But the two have been bickering for months, most recently over Mr. Ferrer's failure to include a Hispanic journalist on the panel for tonight's debate. It will be enough if they get along sharing office space in the Bronx County Building, the setting of "Bonfire of the Vanities."
"I am always a good host," Mr. Ferrer said yesterday. "Anyone who comes to my office gets a warm welcome and a cup of coffee. As we say, 'Mi casa es su casa.' "
But he could not resist adding, "Cordially yours," which is how he signed a terse letter to the Mayor last week after Mr. Dinkins complained that the Borough President had not included any Hispanic reporters on his panel of questioners tonight.
The friction spells trouble for the Mayor, who won office with nearly 70 percent of the Hispanic vote and needs to do well again in a borough that has half a million Hispanic residents, nearly half its population. There is also dissatisfaction elsewhere in the borough, and local officials view the Mayor's visit cynically.
 
'Meaningless,' Critic Says
 "It's meaningless," said Councilman Michael DeMarco, who represents the northeast corner of the borough, which went to Mr. Dinkins's Republican rival, Rudolph W. Giuliani. "There's only so much cosmetics you can put on something to make it look good, and unfortunately, we don't look good right now.
"He thinks that by coming to the Bronx and putting on all this schmaltzy stuff, he's going to make a difference. It's like a woman. How much lipstick can you put on her?"
As the Mayor did on his stay in Brooklyn last month, he will hold his daily news conferences in the Bronx, visit neighborhood schools, meet with local politicians, stop by a police precinct and take walking tours of shopping strips. He plans a week in each of the boroughs outside of Manhattan and in a Manhattan neighborhood away from City Hall.
The Bronx became a required stop on political itineraries after President Jimmy Carter swept Mayor Abraham D. Beame to the rubble-strewn remains of Charlotte Street in the South Bronx in 1977, vowing to rebuild. There has been some rebirth since, but Mr. Dinkins never tires of noting that Federal aid has shrunk from 19 percent of the city's budget a decade ago to under 10 percent now.
"I hope the fact that we're in the Bronx will not make the Bronx a presidential photo-op for candidates, but that they will take the opportunity to truly focus on the problems of urban America," Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch said last week. "We want to saturate the borough and highlight some of the positive things going on."
 
Unhappy Hispanic Voters
 But the Mayor will have to do more than that to repair his political coalition, especially his standing with some Hispanic voters who have been unhappy with his appointments and accused him of insensitivity to their concerns. Mr. Ferrer is sometimes rumored as a potential challenger -- or, more likely, a candidate for City Council President on a mayoral ticket with Mr. Dinkins's archrival, Andrew J. Stein -- though Mr. Ferrer said, "I can't conceive of the Mayor viewing me as a threat."
Still, Angelo Falcon, head of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy, a nonprofit group, said Mr. Dinkins is "definitely in trouble in terms of the Latino community."
"We just did a poll of 200 Puerto Rican community activists, and found for the most part very negative feelings toward the Mayor," he said.
 
Divergent Views
 "Unfortunately, it's so close to re-election time that anything he does now is suspect, because people will just dismiss it," Mr. Falcon said.
One thing is clear: How one views these mayoral field trips depends on where one sits. After the Mayor's week in Brooklyn, the Park Slope Paper, a weekly in a liberal neighborhood Mr. Dinkins won last time, asked editorially: "Did we learn anything about the Mayor? Yes -- that he hasn't a clue as to who we are or what he's supposed to do to make things better."
But the Amsterdam News, the Harlem weekly, said, "The Mayor was given a tumultuous welcome in practically every ethnic neighborhood he visited."

HEADLINE: Fighting AIDS, and Fighting One Another;
As the Battleground Shifts, Old and Newer Groups Vie for Scarce Funds

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
With its staff of one, Mothers of Children With AIDS operates out of a donated cubicle in a church office. Its brochure was the gift of an advertising agency and its incorporation papers were filed by lawyers working without charge.
Gay Men's Health Crisis also relies on donations and volunteers, to provide a wide range of services to people who suffer the symptoms of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. But G.M.H.C., formed in 1982 by six gay men, has grown with the epidemic to enter its second decade with a staff of 200 and an annual budget of $20 million. 
 The two groups, despite vast differences in resources and constituencies, come under the same rubric: AIDS organizations. And both are after the same scarce dollars.
 
New AIDS Cases
 They now stand at the crux of a difficult question brought on by stagnant government budgets and hard economic times: whether established AIDS groups should lose some of their funds to new, smaller organizations rooted in black and Hispanic communities, where many of the new AIDS cases are found.
The issue has come to a head in New York State, where officials say the tentative budget of the Department of Health's AIDS Institute for the next fiscal year falls far short of what is needed. The institute has proposed reducing the grants of some traditional recipients, like Gay Men's Health Crisis, to expand existing AIDS programs and finance several new ones geared to minorities, like Mothers of Children With AIDS. The plan has led to open warfare among AIDS organizations, with Hispanic and black groups publicly denouncing G.M.H.C. and other large programs for resisting any cuts.
With the exception of G.M.H.C. -- which raises 85 percent of its funds from private sources -- both large and small AIDS programs depend on government financing for most of their budgets.
The rift has underscored the diversity of those involved in fighting AIDS and exposed the imbalance in resources and political clout among the groups. And the conflict goes beyond one needy group's being pitted against another; it is likely to determine what services are offered to those infected with H.I.V., and who gets help.
The needs of the H.I.V.-infected population -- the largest groups are gay men, intravenous drug users, and black and Hispanic women in poor communities, many of them mothers whose children are also infected -- can be vastly different. More important, experts say prevention and social services may be more effectively delivered by groups attuned to the communities being served. And AIDS Institute officials say that small organizations can sometimes fill that role better than larger groups, even those which already serve a large percentage of minority clients.
 
A National Problem
 AIDS Institute officials say they still hope more money will come out of last-minute budget negotiations, relieving them of the painful task of redistribution.
As of yesterday, institute officials said they expected to receive $55.6 million for the coming fiscal year, up from $51.9 million this year. A total of $371.9 million in state AIDS spending is budgeted for the coming year, mostly for Medicaid. But the increase is not keeping pace with the needs created by AIDS, and the same problem is appearing nationwide, Federal officials and AIDS groups say.
"It's going to be more and more difficult every year," said Gary West, assistant deputy director of the National Center for Prevention Services within the Federal Centers for Disease Control. The center experienced a budget cut this year and anticipates no increase next year.
"Even if we have level funding, level funding actually means reduced services because there is inflation and the demand for services continue to increase," he said.
 
Emphasizing Prevention
 Faced with a budget squeeze, New York State health officials are basing the distribution of funds on the changing pattern of the AIDS epidemic. Early on, reported cases stemming from homosexual and bisexual activity were a majority in New York State, but that proportion has declined to 42 percent. In the meantime, cases stemming from drug use rose to 42 percent, from 31 percent in 1986, and black and Hispanic residents now account for 63 percent of all cases in the state, health officials say.
The AIDS Institute says it will review the 400 programs it finances -- including primary care services in hospitals and education and prevention programs -- to insure a fair distribution.
AIDS organizations that serve different populations sometimes have conflicting interests. For instance, groups based in minority neighborhoods usually place far more emphasis on prevention. They say these programs are particularly crucial in their communities where there is still great ignorance about how to avoid H.I.V. infection.
"For the gay community, care is the central issue because there are so many infected," said Paul A. Kawata, executive director of the National Minority AIDS Council in Washington, D.C., which represents 300 organizations. "But in communities of color we still have the opportunity to prevent disease."
Groups that stand to gain from any redistribution of AIDS Institute money say they would run more prevention programs, including giving clean needles to intravenous drug users. They also say that minority-run programs will be more effective in minority communities.
 
Children With AIDS
 "It has a lot to do with acceptability, not expertise," said Paul Jellinek, vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in Princeton, N.J., which three years ago gave $17 million to 54 groups for AIDS projects.
Some of the groups offer programs fine-tuned to the needs of the emerging AIDS population. For instance, Mothers of Children With AIDS, created by a woman who lost her daughter to AIDS last February, aims to help Hispanic women who care for someone with the disease, often coping with their own infection at the same time.
But some advocates worry that redistributing funds is a bad idea, simply because it suggests that a shift of money, not an increase in spending, will solve the problem.
"It lets the Federal government off the hook," said Dan Broff, executive director of the AIDS Action Council, a lobbying group in Washington that represents 550 organizations. "Our top priority is more money. Had we spent money early on in the epidemic, the needs wouldn't be as great now."
 
Oldest and Largest Group
 G.M.H.C. officials say any cut in public funds would hurt their clients. Already, they say, their public financing has not kept pace with the rising demand for services. The bulk of the agency's money comes from private donations and from big fund-raisers, like the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey "Circus for Life" held at Madison Square Garden last Friday.
The oldest and largest AIDS organization in the country, Gay Men's Health Crisis uses its $1.6 million AIDS Institute grant, one of the largest awarded, for services ranging from help with daily chores to legal services for its 3,300 clients, 78 percent of whom are gay.
David A. Hansell, the group's deputy executive director for policy, said part of the answer to the financing problem is to mobilize black and Hispanic communities, including their more affluent segments, to raise money privately, as gay groups did in the early part of the epidemic.
"Let's not assume that we've exhausted all the money there is for AIDS," he said.
But while lauding gay organizations for their pioneering efforts, some say that the gay response will be hard to emulate, if only because of the generally higher income and education levels in the gay community. Many minority groups also say they are competing for a slice of the pie at a huge disadvantage because the established organizations can pay lobbyists and enjoy the name recognition that make fund-raisers like G.M.H.C.'s successful. They also have a proven track record.
 
Reaching Out to Other Groups
 As the giant that dwarfs all others, however, Gay Men's Health Crisis has also felt a responsibility to help others. It gives 15 percent of the $4 million raised by the annual AIDS Walk to other AIDS groups and it shares its technical expertise, for instance.
The organization has also made an effort to reach clients who are not gay. While it does not accept active drug users, 8 percent of its current clients are women; 20 percent are former drug addicts, and 41 percent are black or Hispanic.
 
Difficult Task
 G.H.M.C. and 13 other AIDS groups, which represent about 4 percent of the applicants but receive 25 percent of the AIDS Institute appropriations, have urged legislators to finance other community groups, but not by taking money away from them. Meanwhile, minority organizations are lobbying for redistribution not only of state money but of AIDS-related grants by the Federal government and the city's Department of Health.
AIDS Institute officials say that the task of reviewing programs will not be easy.
"The H.I.V. virus continues to burn through disadvantaged minority communities while it continues to ravage the gay community," Dr. Nicholas A. Rango, director of the AIDS Institute, said. "The pain experienced by those of us making funding decisions is caused by the failure of every level of government to take prevention seriously and to fund adequately for services going to those already infected."

HEADLINE: Albany Races Its Budget Deadline

 BODY:
Despite a last-minute furor over school aid, leaders in Albany might still make their deadline with a harsh but plausible New York State budget. Could they do better? Yes. But the draft agreement relies on fewer gimmicks than usual and avoids huge tax increases that would hurt during a recession. And it could come in under the wire for the first time since 1984.
Frantic efforts to make last-minute changes before tomorrow's deadline have created chaos in Albany. If more time would produce a better budget, a delay would surely be warranted. But there's no reason to believe that waiting would improve the substance of the budget. Though flawed, an on-time budget might give a weary public some confidence in the ability of public officials to do their jobs. And local governments and school districts wouldn't have to borrow, at high interest rates, to make up for missing state aid. 
 Still, the budget under negotiation has many shortcomings. It's clear that some of the cuts will be counterproductive, costing more in the long run than they save up front. It's also clear that, as usual, the state failed to make the kinds of fundamental changes that would result in more efficient government and permanent savings.
The deal does not, for instance, restructure the school aid formula that still favors more affluent districts over poorer areas. Nor does it provide for fundamental Medicaid reforms or revamp mass transit formulas to give cities the same shake they give the suburbs. Such changes won't emerge by tomorrow. They take time, leadership and commitment -- none of which are in large supply in Albany.
But state lawmakers can still restore cuts that, as Mayor David Dinkins of New York City urgently argues, are damaging to big-city residents, particularly the poor. And legislators can make needed corrections during the legislative process.
The budget defines the state's agenda for the year. But no budget is set in concrete. Some of New York City's education aid could be restored before the deadline, but how much? And a damaging cap on aid for foster care, still in the budget deal, could cost the city up to $44 million. The budget also requires the city to provide $25 million more than it originally anticipated to keep the transit fare at $1.25. And municipal hospitals will no doubt have to make up for cuts and limits in home nursing care and home relief.
The state's options are limited by the economy and a growing budget deficit. But easing some burdens on the cities, either now or later, could make a difficult budget season less painful.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Candidate's Record;
Clinton Remakes Home State in Own Image

SERIES: Clinton as Governor: 12 Years at Arkansas' Helm -- First of five articles

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., March 26

 BODY:
When he was running for his fifth term as Governor two years ago, Bill Clinton made a promise to the people of Arkansas: He was not going to run for President in 1992.
"It was almost a 'read my lips' kind of thing," one local reporter recalled. " 'I will not run.' " 
 A year and a half later, Mr. Clinton changed his mind. He went back to the people of Arkansas, confessed to his changed view and in town meetings across the state asked their permission to enter the race for President.
In Mr. Clinton's view, the answer he heard, in town after little town, was a loud yes.
That's not surprising because during his 12 years in office, in many ways Mr. Clinton has remade Arkansans in his own image: a people easily forgiving of past problems, proud of what has been accomplished, eager to move forward, even if what has been done so far is flawed or incomplete.
With Bill Clinton, as with Jimmy Carter in the spring of 1976, the Democratic Party is considering a Southern Governor as its nominee. The party appears ready to accept both the promise and problems that come with this choice, for in Arkansas, as in much of the South, the requirements for political success and the standards by which candidates are judged on the state level often are less severe than those familiar to the nation's broader electorate as the considers candidates for President.
Indeed, Mr. Clinton's record mirrors that of a modern Southern progressive. It blends several paradoxes, for example, a populist sympathy for the underprivileged along with a cozy, low-tax relationship with his state's economic powers; a commitment to racial justice along with a basic cultural conservatism; a belief in activist government along with fiscal conservatism.
A review of Mr. Clinton's record as Arkansas's longest-serving Governor turns on two pivotal conclusions.
Mr. Clinton can take justifiable pride in moving the state forward in a number of areas that had long been ignored before. Creating more jobs and improving the state's schools are the largest examples. And out of that he has also helped give residents of Arkansas, historically among the poorest in the nation, a warmer view of themselves.
"There's kind of a feeling of pride across the state now, that we've done something worthwhile, helping ourselves along," said John E. Miller, a member of the Arkansas House for the last 34 years.
But the other salient fact is that Mr. Clinton tried to reform one of the nation's weakest, most impoverished states, notably more depressed than even some of the poor Southern states surrounding it.
To overcome that, sometimes he took shortcuts. And that has given him a reputation for misleading legislators in ways that left some of them bitter and others admiring of his political dexterity.
Trying to move Arkansas out of its historic and endemic state of poverty, he grew close to the state's barons of industry, as Southern politicians often do, so that now he is forced to confront increasing environmental problems and accusations of conflicts of interest.
To improve the schools and create jobs, he furthered the imbalance in state taxes, financing substantial tax breaks for business with added sales taxes on low-income people.
Property taxes, a traditional source of money for schools and other local projects in other states, are so low in Arkansas that sales taxes, again, make up the difference. That, the state Government explains, is because county governments, dominated by large landowners in many areas, refuse to raise the property tax rates.
 
Modest Gains
Arkansans Admire Their Governor
 By many important measures, the state is little better off today than when Mr. Clinton first took office 12 years ago.
As an example, the per capita income of Arkansans, among the lowest in the nation as long as the statistics have been collected, has not risen. It has even fallen back a tiny bit, when compared with the other states.
Still, even with the policy failures and vocal enemies that every governor inevitably picks up after 12 years in office, the state's election results and recent public opinion surveys show that Arkansans like and admire their Governor.
They are impressed by his grasp of the issues that affect them; he displays that knowledge almost every time he speaks. Most people do not seem to care that his enemies call him "slick Willie" or that the national press continues to turn up accusations of impropriety and potential scandal.
As soon as Mr. Clinton was declared the winner in presidential primaries over the last few weeks, some Arkansans out on the streets raised their arms and hollered a cheer, as if the hometown basketball team had just won the big game.
In earlier years, before he was a Presidential contender, local political analysts say, his forays into national politics through the National Governor's Conference and other Democratic Party positions made many Arkansans feel proud, not abandoned -- the local boy made good.
And he has been a local boy. Even with his two years at Oxford and his Ivy League law degree, Mr. Clinton is an authentic Arkansan, and so are nearly all of the people he has chosen to work around him. Many of his advisers are friends or political allies; some are former opponents. But nearly all are from Arkansas. And in this state, that alone guarantees a measure of support.
 
Low Expectations
 Though the state has elected several progressive governors in its recent past, Arkansans are a people with particularly low expectations of government.
After all, "people settled here originally to get away from government and taxes and other people -- just to be left alone," said Cal Ledbetter Jr., a professor of political science at the University of Arkansas.
Most Arkansans were aware that Arkansas ranked last or near last in the nation by most measures of quality of life in 1980, when Mr. Clinton took office. They know the state remains there today.
But Mike Gauldin, a Clinton aide, says he is reciting a common piece of Arkansas philosophy when he says: "It took us 150 years to get in this spot, and it might take a good long time to get out of it."
When Mr. Clinton began his first term, he promised his people: "We can fashion a life that will be the envy of the nation." Today, by common consent, Arkansas still has a long way to go, but most people here give him a great deal of credit just for trying.
John Brummett, the editor of Arkansas Times magazine and an occasional Clinton critic, said, "There's a clear perception here that, under Clinton, we have outperformed other states."
Mr. Miller said: "We'd been at the bottom so long, and we really have come a long way. You listen in the coffee shops and talk to people in the streets, and you see a general feeling around the state that we're better off now than we were 10 years ago."
Still, according to the most recent listings by the Southern Regional Council in Atlanta, a private research group, Arkansas ranked 48th in the nation in 1990 when comparing unemployment rates, 50th in the employment of young people, 49th in average weekly wages, 46th when comparing how many people have health insurance and 49th in the overall climate for workers.
Mr. Miller said, "We've always said 'thank God for Mississippi,' " the one state that usually ranks lower than Arkansas, "and some people really took pride in that. But there is no pride when you really are at the bottom."
An examination by The New York Times of Mr. Clinton's record on several major areas that he would have to tackle if he were President found that his administration has made concerted efforts in several areas that had long been ignored.
But over the same period, the examination showed, other states made improvements, too. As a result, in many areas Mr. Clinton's efforts have simply insured that his state did not fall even farther behind.
 
Tall Obstacles
State Has History Of Limiting Power
 All of Arkansas's governors have had to overcome a host of formidable obstacles to effect change. Arkansas was founded 150 years ago as a haven from strong government, excessive taxation and "too many laws," as Mr. Ledbetter put it. Vestiges of that tradition remain.
In the decades before the state enacted its first constitution 118 years ago, Arkansas was governed by corrupt, feuding family hierarchies that plundered whatever wealth was available, provided no services, drove the citizenry deeper into poverty with every passing year and often chose their leaders by murder and duel.
So by the time state Government was formalized, "whatever benefits the average Arkansan had enjoyed from the society and the resources of the state he had gotten from his own efforts, from the local community or from the Federal Government -- and not from the state," a historian, Donald Stokes, wrote in a doctoral dissertation about Arkansas's political development.
With that background, Arkansas enacted a constitution in 1874 that strictly limited the Governor's powers.
 
Diluted Authority
 In her book "Arkansas Politics and Government," Diane D. Blair, a political scientist, noted that "a two-year term, a meager salary specified in the constitution itself, executive power divided between the Governor and other separately elected executives and a veto that could be overridden by a simple majority of the legislature" all combined to dilute the Governor's authority.
With few powers and even fewer expectations, state government did little to improve the people's lot during the next 90 years. In 1900 the Arkansas school year was just 69 days long, as against a national average of 132 days. By 1930 only 8.1 percent of the state's students went on to high school, and 53 percent of the state's farms were farmed by tenants.
Beginning with the election of Winthrop Rockefeller in 1966, Arkansans selected a series of progressive Governors who began trying to turn the state's fortunes around. But given the built-in obstacles, their records were spotty.
Bill Bowen, a retired banker who is Mr. Clinton's chief of staff, said he believed that Mr. Clinton came into office "a beneficiary" of that evolving tradition of office. "But on the downside," he added, "there were still a lot of things that needed to be done."
 
Uneasy Start
Reaching Too Far In His First Term
 By most accounts Mr. Clinton reached too far in his first term, beginning in 1979. He tried to do more than many Arkansans, still imbued with the state's leave-us-alone tradition, were willing to accept. And so he was defeated two years later.
"In his first term," Mr. Miller added, "the perception was out there that he was going to do what he wanted without consulting anybody."
John Lipton, speaker of the Arkansas House, said, "He had lot of maturing to do, and I've watched him do it."
His defeat "helped him toward accelerated maturity," Mr. Lipton added. And by the time he was re-elected two years later, the experience appeared to have altered his political personality.
To his political friends and allies, the change was that "he learned to listen," as Mr. Lipton put it. "He came to realize that to accomplish things, he had to have a cooperative spirit."
To his political foes, however, the Governor had turned into "slick Willie," a politician too eager to please.
"He became very casual about the truth," said Paul Greenberg, a newspaper columnist who has been one of Mr. Clinton's most persistent critics. He was one of the first to begin using the epithet "slick Willie." After Mr. Clinton's defeat in 1981, Mr. Greenberg said, the Governor acquired "a tendency to tell people whatever it is they wanted to hear."
 
'Obsession to Please'
 Mr. Brummett, the magazine editor, said, "I don't know if it's really slickness or indecisiveness or anguish. He tries not to say no to anyone. He has an obsession to please. For years, I've seen legislators from different sides of the same question come out of his office, all thinking he's on their side."
Mr. Lipton, one of those legislators and a supporter, dismissed that complaint, saying, "Any politician does a little of that."
Whether he is slick, indecisive or simply effective, Mr. Clinton has grown to be popular and relatively powerful, given the inherent limits of this office.
In the last few years, the Governor's salary has been increased, to $60,000 a year from $35,000, and the term in office lengthened from two to four years, removing two of the original constitutional restrictions on the Governor. But the two largest impediments to action remain. They are the state's enduring poverty, and the Governor's inability to raise income taxes to improve services without approval of two-thirds of the Legislature.
Under that stricture, Dr. Ledbetter notes, the income tax rate has been raised only once since 1928, and now the top rate is about 7 percent. With all that, Arkansas's governors generally exercise leadership largely through the force of personal persuasion, and Mr. Clinton has learned to excel at that.
Arkansas may still rank near last in the nation by most measures of quality of life. But even his critics believe the state might very well be in a position "where we'd really have to reach up to touch bottom," as one of them put it -- if not for the efforts of Mr. Clinton.
"In the environment of the 80's, many states made advances," Mr. Brummett said. "Given this state's history of anti-tax, anti-government populism, if not for what Clinton did, we'd be at the very bottom right now. No doubt. No doubt."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 1, 1992, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Bill Clinton's record as governor of Arkansas misstated his salary. It is $35,000 a year. A proposal to increase it to $60,000, and to raise the salaries of other state officials has been approved by the state Legislature and the Governor. It will be put to the voters on a ballot in November.
The article also misstated the date that his first term in office began. It was 1979 not 1980.
