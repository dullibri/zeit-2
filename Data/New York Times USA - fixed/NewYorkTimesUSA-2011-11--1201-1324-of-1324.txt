HEADLINE: From Ashes of Olympic Bid, a Future Rises for the Far West Side

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Late in his first term, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg suffered a stinging defeat when, after an extensive planning and public relations effort, New York City lost its bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics.
Now, though, a vibrant neighborhood is rising in the area where the Olympic stadium and complex would have stood on the Far West Side of Manhattan. As a result, officials, developers and urban planners are embracing an unlikely notion: the Olympic bid's defeat may have been one of the best things to happen for the city's growth in recent memory.
The Bloomberg administration repurposed many elements of the bid to create Hudson Yards, the commercial and residential district taking shape west of Eighth Avenue, a once-desolate area of factories, lofts and parking lots between 30th and 43rd Streets.
Fifteen sleek residential towers have sprung up since 2005, the year that the Olympic bid was rejected, and a dozen hotels have muscled their way onto these blocks. 
This month, one of the city's biggest developers, the Related Companies, announced tentative plans to erect a 51-story office tower on the spot where the Olympic stadium would have stood, with Coach, the luxury retailer, as the anchor tenant.
No one expects the Far West Side to look like the office canyons on Avenue of the Americas anytime soon. Another deep recession in the next few years could undermine nascent plans.
Still, city officials predict that within two decades, Hudson Yards could have more office space than Baltimore or Portland, Ore., and as many apartments as Stamford, Conn.
An extension of the No. 7 subway line from Times Square to 34th Street and 11th Avenue, at a cost of more than $2 billion, is two-thirds complete and set to open in December 2013. Work is to begin early next year on a new tree-lined boulevard between 10th and 11th Avenues. Both of these projects were originally conceived for the 2012 Olympics.
Some planners pointed out that if the Games had been held in New York, the city most likely would have had to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns. It also would have been stuck with many underused sports facilities, including the stadium.
''It's ironic that the Hudson Yards was born out of the loss of the Olympic bid,'' said Jeffrey S. Katz, who owns three large development sites in the district. ''At the end of the day, it turns out to be better for the city that the Olympic stadium is not there. We're building a new, vital part of the central business district.
''Imagine what a big stadium would've been like. It would have dominated the area, and not necessarily in a good way.''
The rejuvenation of the neighborhood and the expansion of the business district could be among Mr. Bloomberg's most enduring legacies, achieving a goal that eluded Mayors Edward I. Koch, David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani. Each failed to remake this industrial area after the shipping piers disappeared and the garment district withered.
Even Mr. Bloomberg, who allowed that he ''hates to lose,'' said that in retrospect, the failure of the Olympic bid may have been a blessing for the city.
''Given what happened to the economy, it would've been tough to raise all the money,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in an interview.
But, he added, his administration pushed ahead with many of the projects and land-use changes that were contained in the Olympic proposal, not just on the Far West Side, but in other parts of the city as well.
''We thought the Olympics would be the catalyst to get a lot of things that many people thought the city needed,'' he said. ''In fact, many got done'' anyway.
From the day he took office in 2002, Mr. Bloomberg made the Olympics, as well as the redevelopment of the Far West Side, a signature initiative.
The proposal's chief architect, Daniel L. Doctoroff, a former deputy mayor under Mr. Bloomberg, combined a series of new or refurbished sports facilities across the five boroughs with plans for the redevelopment of waterfront industrial areas.
The rezoning of the West Side for commercial towers was necessary for New York's survival as an international center of finance, media and communications, Mr. Doctoroff and others argued, because Manhattan was running out of room for development.
But the Olympic plan was also tied to an unpopular proposal for a $2 billion stadium and an expanded convention center nearby.
While Mr. Bloomberg lost the Olympic bid, he won the rezoning effort in 2005, with plans for up to 24 million square feet of office space and more than 13,000 apartments.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority selected the Related Companies to develop 12 commercial and residential towers, a park and a cultural center over the rail yards between 10th and 12th Avenues, from 30th to 33rd Streets.
Since then, the Bloomberg administration has invested heavily on the Far West Side, including $3 billion in bonds for the subway extension, new parks and the boulevard between 10th and 11th Avenues, a remnant of the Olympic plan.
The administration has had to tap into the city budget to cover interest payments on the bonds. That cost will be $557 million by 2015, officials said.
The view from the roof of the Ohm, a 34-story rental building that opened in 2010 at 30th Street and 11th Avenue and has attracted tenants who work in the fashion and media industries, offers a sense of how much things have changed on the Far West Side.
There are residential towers on the northern border, along 42nd Street; new hotels and apartment buildings pushing westward from Eighth Avenue; and new residential towers marching northward along the High Line, the elevated park in Chelsea.
A major developer, Avalon Bay, is about to begin construction of its largest residential complex, with 700 rental apartments and a 30-story tower, at 11th Avenue and 29th Street.
In the next month or so, Related will begin work on a 32-story rental building, with 400 apartments, opposite the proposed Coach building.
The Gotham Organization just broke ground on a $520 million residential complex on a block bounded by 44th and 45th Streets, between 10th and 11th Avenues. It will contain 1,232 apartments, including 682 units for poor and moderate-income families, mandated by the Hudson Yards rezoning.
Commercial development has progressed more slowly because of the area's lack of public transportation, its untested location and the costly decks that must be built over the railroad tracks.
Even so, Related, Brookfield Properties, Sherwood Equities and other developers at Hudson Yards said they were optimistic that the first set of commercial buildings was only a few years off, especially with the subway extension set to open in 2013.
Mitchell L. Moss, director of New York University's Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management, said the development underscored how the city was better off with the Olympic plan but without the event itself.
''We've created the opportunity for new housing, new commercial space and an entirely new recreational corridor,'' Mr. Moss, author of the new report ''How New York City Won the Olympics,'' said in an interview. ''In light of how quickly the Far West Side developed, we've done better without the Olympics than anyone would have anticipated.''

HEADLINE: Weinstein Sends Hollywood an Oscar-Time Mash Note

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

 BODY:
BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- There he was, Harvey Weinstein, master of the movie awards game, flanked by a golden Oscar much taller than he, and two dark- haired granddaughters of Charlie Chaplin, the King of Silents.
Mr. Weinstein was onstage at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences last Monday to introduce ''The Artist,'' a (mostly) silent picture that is his latest contender for regular-size Oscars. The Chaplin offspring, Carmen and Dolores, had no particular stake in the film but said their grandfather would have loved it.
An audience packed with awards season voters heard Mr. Weinstein tell how even his brother Bob, a partner in the Weinstein Company, thought he was crazy to risk ''a lot of millions'' on a black-and-white valentine to Los Angeles, and to the movies, and to an industry that was packed into the Academy's own theater to see what the mogul behind last year's best picture, ''The King's Speech,'' had wrought. 
If they gave an Oscar for best campaign moment, Mr. Weinstein could have taken his home that night.
But the Academy Awards are still almost three months away -- time enough to test whether Mr. Weinstein's skills, and Hollywood's fascination with itself, will turn one of the year's least likely contenders into an Oscar-winning best picture. To win it will have to outmatch some ferocious competitors in a late-breaking year that has found no overwhelming favorite, as ''Slumdog Millionaire'' was in 2008, and remains peppered with possibilities.
Not least among those are ''The Descendants,'' from the star George Clooney, the director Alexander Payne, and the company, Fox Searchlight, that made ''Slumdog Millionaire'' a winner. Still ahead, among others, are ''Carnage'' from Roman Polanski, and a pair of possible contenders, David Fincher's ''Girl With the Dragon Tattoo'' and Stephen Daldry's ''Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,'' from the producer Scott Rudin, who had two best picture nominees last year, ''The Social Network'' and ''True Grit.''
And pictures from earlier in the year will surely resurface. Billboards and radio airwaves here have already blossomed with advertisements offering ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2'' as an awards prospect. An Oscar for the last ''Harry Potter'' film might be seen as a vote for the entire blockbuster series.
For the moment, however, Hollywood's professional Oscar campaigners -- who generally do not discuss their craft publicly, for fear of diminishing its effect -- are privately buzzing about Mr. Weinstein's bid to outmaneuver films that are bigger, broader and better positioned for the general audience. He is doing that by playing to the movie industry's wobbly sense of self, exactly at a time when it is fretting about declining attendance, weak economics and constant pressure from other media.
Directed by the French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius, with Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo in lead roles, ''The Artist'' tells of a silent star, George Valentin, who misses the transition to talkies at the end of the 1920s, and of his relationship with a young actress, Peppy Miller, who blooms with the advent of sound. That it plays in almost utter silence, background music aside, has become a selling point for Mr. Weinstein and others, who point to their own bravery in mounting a tribute to the silent era by relying, more or less, on its own techniques.
''The truth is that it was a bad idea, a very bad idea,'' Mr. Hazanavicius told the In Contention Oscar blog -- one among a flood of media reports that are meant to challenge viewers and make a virtue of the movie's primary handicap, its lack of voice.
''The Artist'' opened on Friday in just four theaters, two in New York and two in Los Angeles. San Francisco will see the film on Friday, and more cities and theaters will follow, as expected interest builds.
Among nervous rivals, ''The Artist'' is being compared to an Italian fable about the movies, ''Cinema Paradiso,'' which won the Oscar for best foreign language film in 1990, after being released by the Weinsteins' Miramax Films in the United States.
Yet ''Cinema Paradiso,'' though much loved here, was nominated for no Academy Awards outside the foreign-language category. Other than a brush with the movies in ''Crash,'' in which one of many subplots involved a film director, no film focused squarely on the movies has won best picture Oscar. Perhaps the closest the Academy has come in the last 60 years was the 1951 best picture Oscar for ''All About Eve,'' a show-business drama about the stage.
On Oscar night, almost without exception, Hollywood has favored films that look far from itself. That has meant dwelling on distant wars (''Patton''), epic romance (''Titanic''), utter fantasy (''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King''), or moral triumph (''The King's Speech'') -- in most cases the further from home, the better.
Self-reflection may finally be the order of the day.
Mr. Weinstein seems to thinks so. After all, he has not one but two movie-world fables in the race this year, the other being ''My Week With Marilyn,'' in which Michelle Williams plays Marilyn Monroe. And Martin Scorsese's ode to the pioneering French filmmaker Georges Melies, ''Hugo,'' is also a potential contender.
When it comes to campaigning, it is safe to say that Mr. Weinstein is just getting warmed up with his Academy appearance, another stop shortly before at the AFI Fest film festival here and, this weekend, a first-person piece about what makes him tick on The Huffington Post. A primary focus so far has been on getting those who vote for critics awards to see ''The Artist'' and other Weinstein pictures. Sarah Greenberg Roberts, who is in charge of marketing and publicity for the Weinstein Company, declined to comment on the campaigns. But people familiar with the Weinstein plans have said there will be plenty more to come.
And showing up at the Academy with a Chaplin on either arm can't hurt.

HEADLINE: Senator Questions Extension Of Tax Cut

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The No. 2 Senate Republican, Jon Kyl, expressed concern on Sunday about President Obama's proposal to continue a reduction in the Social Security payroll tax and questioned whether the tax cut had fostered the creation of jobs, as Democrats say.
Mr. Kyl's comments offered a preview of a fight looming in the Senate, which plans to vote this week on the proposal to extend the payroll tax ''holiday'' enacted last December. 
A one-year extension would cost more than $110 billion, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. Senate Democrats want to offset the cost by increasing the tax on income over $1 million a year.
Mr. Obama says that if Congress does not extend the tax cut, ''the typical family's taxes will go up $1,000 next year.'' As a result, he said, consumers will spend less, businesses will sell less and hire fewer workers, and the economy will suffer.
But on ''Fox News Sunday,'' Mr. Kyl, of Arizona, said: ''The payroll tax holiday has not stimulated job creation. We don't think that is a good way to do it.''
Moreover, Mr. Kyl said, increasing taxes on the most affluent Americans, including small-business owners who report business income on their personal tax returns, would undermine the fragile economic recovery.
''The best way to hurt economic growth is to impose more taxes on the people who do the hiring,'' Mr. Kyl said. ''As a result, the Republicans have said, 'Don't raise the existing tax rates on those who do the hiring.' ''
Democrats reject that argument and say that increased taxes on high-income people are justified at a time of growing income inequality.
''Let's pay for this payroll tax cut by imposing the slight increase in taxes on the wealthiest people,'' Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''Those at the very top who have enjoyed tax cuts that have been very, very generous for a long period of time can afford a slight increase in their tax burden.''
He went on: ''I can't believe that at a time when working families in this country are struggling paycheck to paycheck, when we need them to have the resources to buy things in our economy, to create wealth and profitability and more jobs, the Republican position is, they'll raise the payroll tax on working families. I think that just defies logic.''
The 2010 tax law temporarily reduced employees' share of the payroll tax by 2 percentage points, to 4.2 percent from 6.2 percent. The law provides for the transfer of general revenues from other sources into the Social Security trust fund to make up for the reduction in payroll tax collections.
After the Senate rejected Mr. Obama's $447 billion jobs bill in October, Senate Democrats split it into pieces and have tried to pay for each piece with a surtax on income over $1 million. Those efforts have failed, despite numerous campaign-style trips by Mr. Obama intended to mobilize public support for them.
On Wednesday, just as the Senate moves toward a vote, Mr. Obama plans to travel to Scranton, Pa., where he will again push Congress to extend and expand the payroll tax cut.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said Sunday on the NBC program ''Meet the Press'' that Democrats would be willing to consider other ways of financing payroll tax relief if Republicans blocked the surtax on income over $1 million.

HEADLINE: 'Spreading the Wealth' In Democrats' Favor

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Fighting from behind in the final days of the 2008 presidential election, Senator John McCain found a weapon in an unscripted encounter between his opponent, Senator Barack Obama, and a voter.
''When you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody,'' Mr. Obama told Samuel J. Wurzelbacher, better known as Joe the Plumber. Mr. McCain seized on the remark as evidence of Mr. Obama's adherence to ''socialism.''
In most respects, the 2012 Republican nominee will enjoy a more promising electoral landscape than Mr. McCain did. But would spread-the-wealth ''socialism'' be as inviting a target today? Maybe not. 
Indeed, it is a measure of the altered political environment that Democrats now see the distribution of income as a weapon of their own.
''The whole battleground has changed,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the top political strategist among Democrats in the chamber, said in an interview. ''There's been a major shift in public opinion.''
Mr. Schumer is, at least in part, making a case for accountability. In 2009 and 2010, Democrats shouldered the blame for voters' economic pain since they controlled the White House and Congress. Now they share it with a House Republican majority that is committed to government cutbacks.
But he is also talking about the consequences of Occupy Wall Street that linger after the removal of the tents from Zuccotti Park. By highlighting the widening disparity between top earners and everyone else, Mr. Schumer said, the movement has created an opening for Democrats even as the Obama-era economy remains weak.
''Jobs and income inequality are going to be the No. 1 issue'' in 2012, he said. ''Simply cutting government isn't going to work.''
After Zuccotti Park
Mr. Schumer's argument carries a heavy burden of proof. So far, the most conspicuous piece of the Democrats' inequality agenda has flopped.
During the 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama argued for ending the so-called Bush tax cuts for individuals who make $200,000 or more and for couples who earn above $250,000.
But in 2009, as president, Mr. Obama did not seek to roll back the tax cuts, on the grounds that doing so might further weaken the economy. Last year, Democratic Congressional leaders could not muster the votes to end them. And after Republicans routed his party in the midterm elections, Mr. Obama agreed to extend the cuts - along with those for other taxpayers - for two more years.
But now, Mr. Schumer insisted, conditions are tilting in the Democrats' favor.
First, successive rounds of Tea Party-driven budget cuts this year have clarified this tradeoff: unless taxes go up on the wealthy, Medicare and Social Security must be cut drastically.
Second, Occupy Wall Street drew attention to the extent to which income has shifted in favor of the wealthy over the past three decades.
''The Republican/Tea Party narrative about the economy has been superseded by a different narrative - one that emphasizes the growing gap between those at the very top of the economic ladder and the rest of the country,'' Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who advises Mr. Schumer, wrote in a memorandum last week.
Third, Mr. Schumer prevailed in his argument with White House officials that Democrats should focus on taxing million-dollar incomes. That makes it harder for Republicans to persuade middle-income voters that their taxes would rise, too (while also conveniently sparing many upper-middle-class New Yorkers).
Still, Mr. Obama's approval ratings remain weak, and Democrats have not proved that they can harness the sort of political energy Republicans reaped from the Tea Party in 2010.
''That is our challenge,'' Mr. Schumer said.
G.O.P. Takes Note
David Winston, a pollster who advises House Republicans, respects Mr. Schumer's acumen. He credits Mr. Schumer for being earlier than most to spot Republicans' vulnerability during the Bush administration over stagnant middle-class incomes.
And he acknowledges that hard times heighten concerns about income disparities in the American tug of war between policies that enhance individual opportunity and those that equalize outcomes.
But the weakness in Mr. Schumer's analysis, Mr. Winston said, is that Democrats have not persuaded voters of their plans for generating economic growth as opposed to curbing income inequality.
There are signs of Republican caution about the income gap just the same. Former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, generally considered the party's most likely presidential nominee next year, has focused his proposed capital gains tax cut on people who earn under $200,000, in the name of helping those facing the greatest economic squeeze.
This week, Senate Democrats intend to pressure Republicans with a vote on financing Mr. Obama's proposed payroll tax cuts using a surtax on million-dollar incomes. They plan similar votes later for infrastructure and energy programs.
Their reward for persistence, Mr. Schumer said, will be job-creating legislation, political traction or both.
''You can't do it with just one vote,'' he said. ''We're going to keep at it through the winter and spring.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Bitter Allies In Fog of War

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The NATO air attack that killed at least two dozen Pakistani soldiers over the weekend reflected a fundamental truth about American-Pakistani relations when it comes to securing the unruly border with Afghanistan: the tactics of war can easily undercut the broader strategy that leaders of both countries say they share.
The murky details complicated matters even more, with Pakistani officials saying the attack on two Pakistani border posts was unprovoked and Afghan officials asserting that Afghan and American commandos called in airstrikes after coming under fire from Pakistani territory. NATO has promised an investigation. 
The reaction inside Pakistan nonetheless followed a now-familiar pattern of anger and tit-for-tat retaliation. So did the American response of regret laced with frustration and suspicion. Each side's actions reflected a deepening distrust that gets harder to repair with each clash.
The question now, as one senior American official put it on Sunday, is ''what kind of resilience is left'' in a relationship that has sunk to new lows time after time this year -- with the arrest in January of a C.I.A. officer, Raymond Davis, the killing of Osama bin Laden in May and the deaths of so many Pakistani soldiers.
In each of those cases, Pakistan had reason to feel that the United States had violated its sovereignty. Even if circumstances on the ground justified the American actions, they have nonetheless made it difficult to sustain political support inside Pakistan for the strategic cooperation that both countries acknowledge is vital to winning the war in Afghanistan. ''Imagine how we would feel if it had been 24 American soldiers killed by Pakistani forces at this moment,'' Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat from Illinois, said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' The rift is one result of the United States' two-pronged strategy in Afghanistan, which relies on both negotiating and fighting to end the war.
The latest breach in relations came only five weeks after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton led a senior American delegation to Pakistan to deliver a blunt warning to the country's leaders to intensify pressure on extremists carrying out attacks into Afghanistan, while at the same time urging them to help bring more moderate members of the Taliban to the negotiating table.
Mrs. Clinton called the administration's approach ''fight, talk, build,'' meaning the United States and its allies would continue to attack militants in Afghanistan and beyond, seek peace talks with those willing to join a political process and build closer economic ties across the region. All are essential to any hope of peace and stability in Afghanistan, and all rely on Pakistan. That has forced the two countries into a strategic alliance whose tactics seem to strain it over and over again.
Mrs. Clinton's diplomacy -- bolstered by Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and David H. Petraeus, the director of the C.I.A. -- appeared to smooth out the roughest edges in relations, according to officials from both countries.
Recognizing that heightened military activity along the mountainous border with Afghanistan increases the risks of deadly mistakes, American and Pakistani forces have in recent weeks tried to improve their coordination. That cooperation had been largely suspended after the killing of Bin Laden, which President Obama ordered without informing the Pakistani authorities.
Just last Friday, Pakistan's military commander, Army Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, met Gen. John R. Allen, the commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan, in Rawalpindi to discuss ''measures concerning coordination, communication and procedures'' between the Pakistan Army, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force and the Afghan Army, ''aimed at enhancing border control on both sides,'' according to a statement by the Pakistani military.
''Then you have an incident that takes us back to where we were before her visit,'' said Vali Nasr, a former deputy to the administration's regional envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, and now a professor at Tufts University.
The problem, Mr. Nasr said, is that the United States effectively has not one but two strategies for winning the war in Afghanistan.
While the State Department and the White House believe that only a negotiated political solution will end the war, American military and intelligence commanders believe that they must maximize pressure on the Taliban before the American military withdrawal begins in earnest before 2014. The military strategy has led to the intensified fighting in eastern Afghanistan along the border with Pakistan, increasing tensions. A major offensive last month involving 11,000 NATO troops and 25,000 Afghan fighters in seven provinces of eastern Afghanistan killed or captured hundreds of extremists, many of them using Pakistan as a base.
In recent months American forces have complained that they have taken mortar and rocket fire from positions in Pakistani territory, as officials said they did early Saturday in the Mohmand region, just north of the Khyber Pass, prompting American troops to call in airstrikes. ''It's a case of the tail wagging the dog,'' Mr. Nasr said. When they respond forcefully along the border, ''U.S. commanders on the ground are deciding U.S.-Pakistan policy.''
As the Pakistani public and press seethed over the latest attack, the country's leaders closed supply routes to Afghanistan that NATO relies on, as they have at least twice before, and ordered the C.I.A. to vacate a base it has used to launch drone strikes.
It is unclear how long the Pakistanis will keep the supply routes closed, and whether the promised investigation might help assuage the anger over the deaths of Pakistani soldiers.
On one level, it does not matter whether the strikes are justified as self-defense or acknowledged as a catastrophic error, though if an investigation shows that the Pakistani soldiers were complicit in attacking the NATO-Afghanistan forces across the border, the tensions could worsen further.
The damage to the American strategy has been done, and the question is how long it will take for officials from both countries to resume cooperation where it is in their interest to do so.
Asked on ''Fox News Sunday'' how he would respond in such a situation, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., President Obama's former ambassador to China who is now seeking the Republican presidential nomination, said, ''I would recognize exactly what the U.S.-Pakistani relationship has become, which is merely a transactional relationship.'' He said that American aid to Pakistan should be contingent on keeping the supply lines to Afghanistan open and continuing counterterrorism cooperation.
''And I think our expectations have to be very, very low in terms of what we can get out of the relationship,'' he said.

HEADLINE: What Time Should Black Friday Sales Start?

BYLINE: SHANNON DOYNE


HIGHLIGHT: Student Opinion | Should stores change their approach to Black Friday sales? 

 BODY:
In the Op-Ed article "A Voice Suggests Door-Busters Can Wait," James B. Stewart tells about Anthony Hardwick, a worker told to report at Target at 11 p.m. Thanksgiving night :
This didn't sit well with Mr. Hardwick, who figured he'd be sleeping while his fiancee and future in-laws gathered for the traditional turkey dinner. Although a Target spokeswoman told me the company did its best to accommodate employees who wanted the day off, this often isn't possible, and Mr. Hardwick said he wasn't given the option. Mr. Hardwick turned to the Internet and discovered the Web site Change.org, best known for a recent online petition to get banks to roll back debit card fees.
"A midnight opening robs the hourly and in-store salary workers of time off with their families on Thanksgiving Day," he posted on Nov. 3. "A full holiday with family is not just for the elite of this nation - all Americans should be able to break bread with loved ones and get a good night's rest on Thanksgiving!" He asked the Web site's visitors to join him in calling for Target retail stores to restore the 5 a.m. opening time on Black Friday.
... Target has been handling Mr. Hardwick gingerly. "We have a great belief and understanding that team members should express their feelings," the Target spokeswoman said. As Mr. Hardwick's petition gained momentum, his holiday hours disappeared. He said his supervisor told him there had been a misunderstanding and "they were able to meet their staffing needs without my services."
.... He said he hoped that next year, Target would reconsider its early opening, or at least allow employees to opt out of Thanksgiving duty and hire additional workers from the ranks of the unemployed. "This wasn't really about me," he told me on Thanksgiving. "It's about my co-workers, my team members and anyone else in retail."
By 10 p.m. Thanksgiving night a line had formed outside Target's Bloomington, Minn., store, a scene that a spokeswoman said was repeated at their stores around the country. As the line grew to about 1,500 people, employees gathered inside, chanted and then counted down the seconds to midnight. They clapped and cheered as shoppers poured in. Supplies of a Westinghouse 48-inch flat-screen HDTV, offered at $298, sold out in six minutes.
Students: Tell us what you think about the Black Friday phenomenon. What time do you think the stores should open? Has Black Friday changed your Thanksgiving traditions? If so, how? Do you work in a store that opened early on Black Friday? If so, what was your experience like? What considerations, if any, should retail employees be given regarding Black Friday -- and throughout the holiday shopping season?

HEADLINE: This Week In Small Business: What Would Canada Do?

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Have you considered going after markets overseas? 

 BODY:
What's affecting my clients, my small-business and other small-business owners this past week.
This Week's Big Story: The Supercommittee Failed. Or Did It?
Congress balks at across-the-board cuts set off by the supercommittee's failure. Barry Ritholtz says don't blame the president. Michael Moran says it's just politics. This guy doesn't believe they failed at all. Kent Hoover says there are four consequences, and Diana Ransom explains what it means for small business. Senate Democrats respond with proposed legislation to add another $400 billion to the deficit. The G.O.P. says it's willing to work with President Obama on payroll taxes. If you think you can fix the budget deficit, take the Pew Challenge. Randall Palmer and Louise Egan explain how Canada fixed its fiscal problem.
The Economy: Will Inflation Help?
Most economists are predicting no change in our economy or jobless rate next year. Paul Farrell expects very slow growth in 2012. The chief executive of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce looks to energy for job growth. Eighty-seven percent of the 1955 Fortune 500 are gone. NPR asks two economists if 5 percent inflation can kick-start the economy without killing it.
The Data: Bank Deposits Hit a High 
Russell Investments releases its latest economic indicators. Global stocks hit a six-week low. A broker shuts his firm with a chilling letter about the markets. Existing home sales increase 1.4 percent. Manufacturing activity picks up in Chicago (pdf), stabilizes in Richmond and eases in Kansas City (pdf). Bank deposits hit an all-time record. The American Staffing Association's Index reaches a new high. State unemployment rates change little. Gross domestic product is revised down. The American Trucking Association says the economy is not slipping into recession, but road traffic decreases. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index hits its highest level since June. Personal income and consumption increase.
People: A Green Light for Holiday Parties
Here's a flu prevention guide for the workplace. Most companies plan on having holiday parties this year. A company helps businesses benefit from employees who bicycle. Jason Segel cries on meeting Kermit. Drew Olanoff has advice for people who think that working for a start-up would be awesome. Olivia Solon reports that start-ups need to work hard to avoid hiring misfits. My advice: don't put too much faithin an applicant's college education. I'm pretty sure this is the luckiest pass ever.
Start-Up: Lots of Rock and Roll
Sammy Hagar introduces a rum brand, a rock star tries to become a tech star and the former personal manager for Axl Rose starts a new radio network. (And a 9-year-old covers "Crazy Train.") Tara Tiger Brown was agape at a start-up event: "Imagine for a second what your reaction might be if you went to a panel to hear from other women about their experiences doing a tech start-up and a VC, the person that funds start-ups, told you that she thinks that women should work on things they are naturally gifted at, and she believes shopping is one of them." Ebay acquires a recommendation start-up. Sprouter lists its hot start-ups of the week. Harvard opens a start-up incubator. The New York Times publishes a cool map of start-ups in New York City.
Ideas: Bill Clinton Has a Tactic

Nellie Akalp shares the entrepreneur's guide to a good night's sleep.
Marketing: Naughty and Nice
Allison has seven blog ideas for business owners. Jeremiah Owyang explains why your number of fans and followers is not a business metric. Here's why business owners are holding back investing in social media. Consumer Reports releases its list of naughty and nice businesses for the holidays. Diane Mermigas says that retailers are missing an opportunity to reach shoppers with social and mobile commerce: "While consumers charge ahead, marketers and retailers generally are not positioning themselves to take advantage of the phenomenon." Gary Levitt shares five commandments of small business e-mail marketing awesomeness. Here's what it's like to ride the world's scariest roller coaster.
Around the World: That's a Big Tip
Celebrating small-business owners in all parts of the world. More smartphones are being sold in China than in the United States. A Canadian small business shows a lean, mean entrepreneurial spirit by fighting obesity. China's factory sector sinks the most in 32 months. Nargis Namazi lists 10 of the most innovative start-ups in India. Western Union and U.S.A.I.D. introduce the second "African Diaspora Marketplace." Even as the number of small businesses in Australia dwindle, a man leaves $1.28 million in a Sydney restaurant. An underwater ice tornado kills everything it touches. A National Geographic photo contest is still accepting submissions.
Around the Country: Being Thankful Year Round
Mark Perry reports that a new era of oil and gas exploration promises to bring economic boom and 200,000 jobs to Ohio. Small-business owners make the case for being thankful all year round. A Florida beekeeper stays busy selling his honey locally. Arizona's tax credits are rising for businesses. Some small-business owners have been getting squeezed by the N.B.A. lockout.
Finance: Raising Money on LinkedIn
Our wealthiest .1 percent make nearly half of all capital gains. Odysseas Papadimitriou explores the dilemma of whether to use personal or business credit cards: "the most savvy small-business owners use personal credit cards to avoid unwarranted interest rate increases on company debt and business credit cards for expense-tracking and rewards purposes." Retailers sue the Fed over debit card rules. Groupon shares are collapsing, and Nate Hindman reports on new challenges the young company faces. Bookkeepers introduce a pilot project for small-business financing. A chief executive explains how he raised $230,000 in eight days using LinkedIn. The Fed seeks to bolster confidence in banks with new stress tests.
Red Tape Update: Don't Worry About Non-Taxpayers
Tax compliance takes more than seven billion hours. Truckers need to file an important tax return by Nov. 30. The Internal Revenue Service introduces competency testing for tax return preparers. Paul Krugman discusses an analysis that says the optimum tax rate on the wealthy is 70 percent. A report says that most small-business owners do not feel overtaxed or overregulated. Ramesh Ponnuru says there are many things to worry about in this world - but "the number of people paying income tax isn't one of them." Pennsylvania starts creating its health insurance exchange. Kathryn Hawkins explains how to avoid patent-infringement lawsuits.
Technology: Getting Closer to Kevin Bacon
Google drops its plans to make cheap renewable energy. Katie Fehrenbacher lists 25 battery breakthroughs for gadgets, electric cars and the grid. Google has lured small business but few big companies away from Microsoft Office. Lifehacker gives tips on mastering the new Gmail. A slide show recommends 15 Android apps for business. But be careful: most mobile malware is aimed at Android phones. Taking your own device to work is becoming an accepted business practice. Chris Murphy explains why Ford just became a software company. Peter Schlegel offers a three-step guide to help determine if we really need a hot new technology. Researchers focus on wearable computers for our eyeballs. This video shows 25 interesting ways small-business owners are using QR codes. Technology has reduced my degree of separation from Kevin Bacon to 4.74.
The Week Ahead
It's the end of the month, which means unemployment numbers are on the way. ADP reports on Wednesday, weekly unemployment claims come out Thursday and the national rate is released Friday.
The Week's Bests
Analysis of What Chinese Consumers Want. Two McKinsey & Company consultants report: "Many companies can acquire consumers in China's poorer cities, which the government has targeted for development. For example, 15 percent of consumers in and around the city of Chengdu said they had started using personal care products only in the past year compared to just 1 percent in the more developed region around Hangzhou. That's important for growth; many multinational companies still operate only in a handful of top-tier cities in China."
Reason to consider employees before selling a business. A Canadian reporter says don't forget to address human resource issues: "Regardless of the type of sale, it's incumbent upon the parties to consider the H.R. issues that will arise. ... In many cases, it will be advisable to incorporate a 'holdback' into the agreement, whereby a portion of the purchase price is either held back by the purchaser, or held in trust by counsel, for a specified period of time while the purchaser assesses the work force and makes any H.R.-related decisions. The holdback can then be applied toward the costs of those decisions, such as obligations arising in the event of the dismissal of certain employees."
Explanation for why online customer service is the new marketing.Wendy Lea writes: "I used to be in customer relationship management, and we really weren't helping companies get to know their customers better. We were helping customers forecast their sales better. It was about efficiency, not effectiveness. It wasn't about honesty and transparency; it was about control. It was called 'customer relationship management' - it just never did that. This inside-out strategy of C.R.M. bounded by people, process and technology has kind of been exposed and exploded by the Internet and consumerization of applications and a certain generation who wants to be online and wants answers fast and friendly. Companies have to rethink all this."

HEADLINE: Oh? ECD

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: VSPs warn about the mess they made. 

 BODY:
Today, the OECD warns that things are looking vewy, vewy bad:
Decisive policies must be urgently put in place to stop the euro area sovereign debt crisis from spreading and to put weakening global activity back on track, says the OECD's latest Economic Outlook. 
The euro area crisis remains the key risk to the world economy, the Outlook says. Concerns about sovereign debt sustainability are becoming increasingly widespread. If not addressed, recent contagion to countries thought to have relatively solid public finances could massively escalate economic disruption. Pressures on bank funding and balance sheets increase the risk of a credit crunch.
Another serious downside risk is that no action would be agreed to offset the large degree of fiscal tightening implied by current law in the United States. This could tip the economy into a recession that monetary policy could do little to counter.
That's all perfectly sensible. But how did we get here? In large part, by listening to people like ... the OECD, which demanded both fiscal austerity and interest rate hikes back in early 2010. And yes, it was the same people now running scared of the consequences of those spending cuts and rate hikes.
Maybe a little soul-searching might be in order?
To be fair, though, it wasn't just the OECD. Future historians will look back in astonishment at the Great Pivot of 2010, in which all the Very Serious People on both sides of the Atlantic-- and, sad to say, in both parties in the United States -- decided that in the face of high unemployment, weak growth, and low inflation, what the world really needed was austerity.
I'm actually having trouble writing about all this; it's just too depressing.

HEADLINE: Breakeven Bad

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The disaster of 0.88. 

 BODY:
One measure I've been tracking lately is the German 5-year breakeven. That's the difference between the interest rate on ordinary German 5-year bonds and the interest rate on 5-year bonds that are indexed to inflation (as measured by the euro area harmonized CPI); because one bond is protected against inflation while the other isn't, the breakeven amounts to an implicit market forecast of inflation.
If you think about the nature of the adjustment that has to take place in Europe, you realize that inflation had better not be too low. With three percent inflation over the next 5 years, adjustment might work; with 1 percent or less, no way.
Right now the breakeven is 0.88.
Now, there are some funny aspects to the current situation that might make the breakeven unreliable; unfortunately, those funny aspects are themselves indicators of the euro desperation. 
First, you have to wonder what indexation even means right now. If a bond is indexed to eurozone inflation over the next five years, but the eurozone ceases to exist before that time is up, what do investors get?
Second, there might be some version of what happened in the US during the oh-God-we're-all-gonna-die period from Sept. 2008 through the spring of 2009: with capital markets in disarray, the prices of even slightly illiquid assets plunged. This had the effect of causing yields on index bonds to soar, creating false indications of future deflation. That might be happening to some extent in Europe now -- but if so, it's an indication of just how severe the financial disruption already is.
Either way, that breakeven number is telling us that things are very, very not OK.

HEADLINE: On Black Friday, Pepper Spray Carried the Day

BYLINE: DAVID CARR


HIGHLIGHT: We read the retail coverage looking for trends in spending and ... the American way of shopping. 

 BODY:

Each year, retail reporters are expected to step to Black Friday, that hardy perennial of trend stories, and find a fresh angle. (Before the opening gong even sounded, we learned that $395,000 Ferraris were hot and Wal-Mart was not.)
Apart from pointing out that shoppers fought their way through the economic gloom to set a Thanksgiving weekend record, where to go from there? 
Well, anything that emphasizes the atavistic impulses of hoards of people who go to malls and, sometimes, maul each other certainly will do the trick. And this year provided not only plenty of fodder for shopping Grinches among us, but a bit of a toxic meme as well. 
There was the charming lady who allegedly pepper-sprayed 20 or so people because they threatened her grip on an Xboxat a Los Angeles Wal-Mart. You'll be relieved to know that the pepper spray lady created so much mayhem that she was able to proceed to the check-out and buy her half-price Xbox. 
And in North Carolina, a former police officer released a "puff"of pepper spray, reportedly to calm down a crowd that was getting out of hand at another Wal-Mart. 
For those of us who spot the queues at the mall and go the other way as fast as we can, the roundup stories of shopping rage provided an opportunity for a bit of smug satisfaction. No, we did not get a wide-screen television for the price of a box of diapers, but we also did not get body slammed by police, get both robbed and shot by thieves demanding our purchases, or die in an aisle at Target as fellow shoppers stepped over us. 
When it comes to retail coverage, we want to know whether the retailers did, in fact, head into the black, what items were the hot sellers, and most of all, that those of us who sat on the sidelines made a rational choice.

HEADLINE: Drowning in Grover's Lake

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Old macro mistakes in new bottles. 

 BODY:
Never mind drowning the US government in a bathtub: Grover Norquist is trying to drown the whole economy in a lake:
The idea that if you take a dollar out of the economy and then -- from somebody who earned it, either through debt, or through taxes -- and give it to somebody who's politically connected, that there are more dollars around, that if you stand on one side of the lake and put a bucket into the lake, and walk around to the other side in front of the TV cameras, pour the bucket back into the lake and announce you're stimulating the lake to great depths. We just wasted $800 billion on stimulus spending that added to debt, that killed jobs. 
OK, this is just Say's Law. We don't know whether Norquist is honest enough with himself to realize that exactly the same logic applies to any spending, that according to his story anyone who borrows to spend, including companies making investments, is just displacing someone else's spending. To his credit, Brian Riedl more or less admitted that when he made the same argument a couple of years ago.
But it's all wrong, of course. Income can fall to match spending, instead of spending rising to match income -- that's the moral of the babysitting coop story, which I like because it offers an intuitive way to cut through the word games of demand denialists. Too bad that so many prominent economists fall into the same fallacy.
And it really is very disturbing that arguments like this, arguments that were thoroughly refuted three generations ago, are playing a major role in political debate. I mean, what's next? Will they start rejecting the theory of evolution? Oh, wait.

HEADLINE: Mission Not Accomplished

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: But the bankers are OK. 

 BODY:
Matt Yglesias and Kevin Drum say the right thing about revelations that big banks got very easy terms during the financial crisis: the real scandal isn't so much that those banks got rescued as that the rest of the population didn't.
For sure, the Fed and Treasury should have driven harder bargains. I think the political landscape would look different and better right now if the Obama administration had in fact taken at least one big bank into receivership. But in the crisis, money had to flow freely, and the truth is that the gifts bankers received are more a source of annoyance than a source of current problems.
What's unforgivable is the way policymakers, both at the Fed and elsewhere, basically declared Mission Accomplished as soon as the panic in financial markets subsided and stocks were up again. When spring rolls around, we'll reach the third anniversary of Ben Bernanke's declaration that "green shoots" were making an appearance -- and there will still be 4 million Americans who have been out of work for more than a year. Yet there has been no sense of urgency about dealing with unemployment; indeed, most of the elite conversation has been about stuff like cutting Social Security payments a decade or two from now.
As Drum says, that's the true radicalizing experience.

HEADLINE: Memories of VSPs Past

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Greenspan the wise. 

 BODY:
For a longer-term project, I've been doing a bit of research into what Very Serious People believed and preached just before it all went blooey. And -- drumroll -- here's Alan Greenspan:
Deregulation and the newer information technologies have joined, in the United States and elsewhere, to advance flexibility in the financial sector. Financial stability may turn out to have been the most important contributor to the evident significant gains in economic stability over the past two decades.
Historically, banks have been at the forefront of financial intermediation, in part because their ability to leverage offers an efficient source of funding. But in periods of severe financial stress, such leverage too often brought down banking institutions and, in some cases, precipitated financial crises that led to recession or worse. But recent regulatory reform, coupled with innovative technologies, has stimulated the development of financial products, such as asset-backed securities, collateral loan obligations, and credit default swaps, that facilitate the dispersion of risk.
Conceptual advances in pricing options and other complex financial products, along with improvements in computer and telecommunications technologies, have significantly lowered the costs of, and expanded the opportunities for, hedging risks that were not readily deflected in earlier decades. The new instruments of risk dispersal have enabled the largest and most sophisticated banks, in their credit-granting role, to divest themselves of much credit risk by passing it to institutions with far less leverage. Insurance companies, especially those in reinsurance, pension funds, and hedge funds continue to be willing, at a price, to supply credit protection.
These increasingly complex financial instruments have contributed to the development of a far more flexible, efficient, and hence resilient financial system than the one that existed just a quarter-century ago. 
Translation: thanks to securitization, CDOs, and AIG, nothing bad can happen!

HEADLINE: 100 Years of Help: Creative Ideas for Giving Inspired by the Neediest Cases Fund

BYLINE: KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: We're honoring 100 years of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund history by suggesting a number of ideas, based on resources past and present, for thinking about why, how and to whom you, your family or your students might give this season.

From The Neediest Cases Fund: A Brief History:
On Christmas Day 1911, Adolph S. Ochs, publisher of The New York Times, went out for a walk after a big turkey dinner, and encountered a shabbily dressed man on the street. The man said he had just been given Christmas dinner at a Y.M.C.A. but had nowhere to sleep. Mr. Ochs looked him over, decided he looked respectable and gave him a few dollars and his card. "If you're looking for a job," he said, "come see me tomorrow."
The encounter left the publisher thinking about charity. Helping a stranger had given him a sense of satisfaction, and he wondered if one man's feeling might be the basis for a city's good will. The next year, he sent a reporter to several of the city's private welfare agencies to collect stories about the poor. He had a plan: to publish stories about the Hundred Neediest Cases in New York. The appeal would be made not only with a direct request for money, but also with the facts of their lives. These small chronicles, it turned out, sounded a powerful call...All told, the fund has raised over $250 million in its 100 years. 
The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund celebrates its 100th anniversary this year, and we're honoring that history by suggesting a number of ideas, based on Times resources past and present, for thinking about why, how and to whom you, your family or your students might give this season.
What ideas have you had for teaching and learning about giving? Have you, your family or your school done any successful or interesting service projects? Tell us.
Warming Up
To get students thinking about the topic of giving in general, you might start class with a "one-question interview," (PDF) a quick interactive activity that gets every student in the class speaking, listening, note-taking and thinking about a common topic.
 Follow the directions (PDF) to decide whether you'd rather provide students with the questions yourself, or have them brainstorm their own. 
In a 2008 lesson plan on philanthropy during the recession, we suggested using this exercise, and listed a series of general questions to get them started (PDF). You might borrow a few questions from that list, then invite students to add their own. They can then conduct quick interviews, compile their "data" and discuss their results. From there, you can do go deeper with any of the following activities.
Going Further
Why Give?
Whether you're fulfilling a service learning requirement at school, motivated by a particular cause, burnishing your resume or, like the many children quoted in this 1945 article (PDF), giving simply because it's a habit your family instilled from an early age, you should know that giving can be as good for you as it is for those to whom you give. 
Some Tibetan monks even claim giving is selfish since it makes you feel so "fantastic" - and a recent article in the Science Times contends that any act that makes you aware of how grateful you are for what you have is good for your health.
Another reason to give? To honor a person or event important to you. Look over the various entries on the Neediest Cases timeline, and you'll begin to notice that several of the people who gave did it in memory of someone or something.
Many, for instance, contributed in reaction to important world events. In 1963, one man gave to remember President John F. Kennedy (PDF), while in 1986 several gave in memory of those killed in the crash of the space shuttle Challenger (PDF), and in 1991 some contributed in reaction to the war in the Persian Gulf.
What national, local or world events have you given to, or in honor of, in the last several years? Why?
To Whom or What Should You Give?
Deciding to what cause or organization you should give money or time can be a surprisingly difficult aspect of philanthropy, even if you're not Bill or Melinda Gates. An article in this weekend's Sunday Review, for instance, describes the complexities that arise when one extended family decides to choose a project to give to as a group. 
The Times Neediest Cases Fund gives to seven organizations from which Times journalists collect stories each season that then become short profiles of those in need. These stories, which appear daily from November through February, show the work of each organization and motivate giving. 
For instance, in 2010, readers were particularly moved by an article about Thakane Masondo, an 18-year-old who was living in a homeless shelter while attending high school. Many wrote in, offering not only money but a room in their homes and help applying to college. A filmmaker expressed interest in making a documentary about her. 
To think about to whom, or what, you should give, you might ask yourself some of questions we posed in a 2006 lesson in which students investigate charities they might support:

        
What is the charity's mission?
        
Who are the recipients of their services?
        
What are the main problems or challenges facing this group?
        
What specific programs or activities are in place to support the charity's constituents?
        
What fund-raising initiatives does it have in place?
        
Where does the money go? What percentage goes to overhead in running the organization?
        
What types of donations does it accept, apart from money?
Deciding What to Give, and How
In 1928, an anonymous woman left a thousand-dollar bill at The Times's offices for the Neediest Cases Fund. In 2010, Courtney Martin gave nine friends $100 each and challenged them to give it away:
Ms. Martin is not a civil rights leader. She's a Brooklyn-based writer who, five years ago, was shocked to find herself in possession of a six-figure book advance. She wanted to give a chunk of it away, but was not sure how. So she decided she would make it someone else's problem - nine other people's problems. She chose nine thoughtful friends, gave them each $100, and told them they would be expected to account for what they had done with it at a gathering a month later. 
What creative thing can you do or give? You might donate money you would have spent on something else, like the ex-smoker who gave to the Neediest Cases Fund in 1973 (PDF) by saving what she would have spent on cigarettes for 58 weeks. Or you might use a skill you have, like the children last year who made ornaments and sold them to earn money to donate. Or you might simply donate your skill - whether in baking for a local shelter, tutoring someone in math, or dog-walking at an animal shelter - or collect something like books, coats or toys for a drive. 
Or, do what The Times does and persuade others to give by telling the story of a person, organization or place in your area in need, and publishing the article in a school or community newspaper, or posting a video online. 
Our collection of resources on service learning and community service lists additional ideas, lesson plans, student opinion questions and more that might provide inspiration, including the story of a boy who started his first charity at six and walked across the U.S. to raise funds for homeless children at 12. 
Look around your community. What needs do you see? How might you and your friends, family or classmates help meet it?

HEADLINE: The Life Report: Neil Richard Parnes

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS


HIGHLIGHT: The life reports are in. Meet Neil Richard Parnes. 

 BODY:
Final Grade: F
Family
Neil was born in 1940 into a Bostonian Jewish family (1st generation American), replete with all the Jewish baggage. He spent his youth in a small anti-Semitic Catholic blue-collar community in rural Massachusetts, and bears both the physical and emotional scars from that experience. As a consequence, he disavowed Judaism the moment he reluctantly finished reciting his haftarah and became an atheist, agnostic and, in contradiction, a student of Zen Buddhism. After spending his lifetime witnessing Israeli arrogance and provocation, he has also become an ardent anti-Zionist.
Neil vowed to escape his hometown and never return. That has come to pass. Happily, he was taken for a Gentile for the rest of his life, so never suffered another arrow.
Neil's father was an attorney; his mother, although college-educated was, by edict, sentenced to life as a stereotypical housewife. As a consequence, Neil became an outspoken proponent of women's self-determination and the pursuit of higher education.
Neil's mother was a loving, protective parent. Neil's father was authoritarian and dictatorial. He resorted to corporal punishment, especially on every occasion when Neil asked "Why?" As a consequence Neil was, and remains, anti-authoritarian and benevolent. Unable to tame him, Neil's father turned him over to the Gestapo at the Valley Forge Military Academy (a distinction he shares with J.D. Salinger and, ironically "Stormin' Norman"). Not surprisingly, VFMA failed in its mission (as it failed with J.D, who fled in a hurry) and produced, instead, a quasi Holden Caulfield.
Despite the inner turmoil, and utter lack of self-confidence that plagues him to this day, Neil found his calling at age 10 - architecture - and somehow went on to earn degrees and scholastic honors from both the University of Pennsylvania and the Architectural Association in London.
Wishing nothing more to do with his father, who was not a positive role model and prophesied, "Neil will never amount to anything," Neil unconfidently spent the rest of his life running away and fulfilling that prophecy.
After completing an undistinguished (owing to his innate disregard of authority) 2-year military service as an Army officer, Neil first went on to practice architecture, but only in other people's firms working on prodigious projects, most of which never materialized. Lacking sufficient design talent and self-confidence, he authored no work of his own.
He willingly spent his entire architectural career outside the U.S. (further distancing himself from his father), but never in one country long enough to put down roots. However, he achieved fluency in several languages, enabling him to easily form strong bonds with his foreign colleagues and their communities and assimilate their cultures, with one glaring exception discussed below.
Neil's last posting was in Tokyo, where he fell victim to Japan's economic collapse of the late '80 -early 90's. It was during his tenure that he met his future wife, a much, much younger Chinese physician and the daughter of non-Communist Chinese surgeon father and chemist mother who were persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. They married---he very, very late in his life---in Tokyo.
Given his age and long absence from the U.S., prospects for finding employment were few. So Neil and his wife changed horses and headed west. Thanks to opportunities created by Deng Xiaoping's Open Door Policy, they created trade, manufacturing and winery businesses in China. There, for the only time in his life, Neil encountered an inscrutable people (a trait heretofore and naively not evidenced in his wife) and the great east-west moral and ethical divide, one he was unwilling to cross at any cost. Neil wished to leave the Middle Kingdom. His wife declined. She had the best of both worlds: U.S. citizenship, businesses in her motherland capitalized entirely by her husband and their 2 children. Everyone reaches a defining moment in his life. This was Neil's. He abandoned everything and everyone and returned alone, at long last, to the U.S.
Neil has been estranged from his wife, now a naturalized American, for 6 years. He fathered 2 daughters, American citizens, to the education of whom he (unlike his own father) devotes his entire energy. Both are being raised non-sectarian, but aware of their Jewish roots. The first, raised and educated both in the U.S and China, is now, from all outward appearances, a confident, well-adjusted and studious U.S. university sophomore with a strong foundation anchored in her two cultures who is finding her voice and searching for her place in the world. The second lives in China, being raised solely in the Chinese culture by her mother and relatives, and educated in a Chinese elementary school. She appears to be growing up well, despite the absence of her father and lack of exposure to American culture, except for mandatory ESL classes. Only time will tell. Although he does not visit China, Neil is in frequent communication with her.
Neil found architectural employment upon his return to the U.S., but fell victim to the Great Recession in 2009. An aged dinosaur, the prospects of being rehired were nil. He changed horses once again and was retained by The First Tee organization to instill sustainable core values through the game of golf in at-risk inner-city children. He lives alone, in good physical health. Less must be said of his state of mind. Family, for him was everything; without it, he merely exists.
Neil has a sister 3 years older than he with who he was rivals, and a brother 8 years younger, too much separated by age to bond with. His lifelong physical separation from his siblings led to an emotional one as well. Neil's later return to the U.S. has done nothing to alter the estranged relationships.
In summation, the sad condition of Neil's family lives appears to be the consequence of Nurture defeating Nature. He never took ownership of them, deferring instead to the dictates of his father's script and prophecy. He abandoned both of them. Although he is a father, given his conduct, there is some question as to whether he warrants the distinction of parent. If there is anything redeeming in his latter family life, it may be the lives of his daughters. Until they come to be judged, Neil's entire family life must be considered a failure.
Grade: F
Faith
Neil is a man of little faith: He believes in the Golden Rule. He believes in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy. He believes in the tenets of the U.S. Constitution. He used to believe that Love conquers all.
As for Faith, Neil has none. Throughout history, more death and destruction has been perpetrated in its name than any other. So much, but not exclusively, for Judaism. In the 21st century, both secular and sectarian institutions are perpetuating the destruction. In whom or what, then, does Neil place his faith?
In summation, Neil has failed to find and follow his spiritual lodestar. Surely, there is one in the vast firmament. Perhaps, his parents failed to teach him how to search. Perhaps he hasn't searched hard enough. Whatever the case, he failed.
Grade: F
Community
As noted above, Neil's first exposure to local community was painful. His hometown was steeped in anti-Semitism. And hypocrisy. Its Gentile members were not above calling him a Dirty Jew and keeping its children away from him, and disassociating themselves socially from his parents at one moment, then running to his father to defend their felonious parent or relative the next. So Neil grew up intolerant of prejudice and bigotry. So he did take an eye for an eye. Neither did he feel any sense of obligation to serve the community that persecuted him.
Owing to the peripatetic nature of his life, Neil never became attached to the communities in which he sojourned; yet willingly agreed to be the ESL tutor to his office colleagues and their communities. It was his way of repaying the numerous cultures that embraced him without prejudice, and the world community at large. Neil was most often mistaken for a citizen of a country other than the U.S., as he did not fit the stereotype of an arrogant, supercilious and unworldly American. Upon discovery, most foreigners favorably altered their misperceptions.
After a 50-year absence, Neil is slowly adapting to life in the U.S. He lives in a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-religious housing complex in one of the most dangerous metropolitan areas of the country. He and his immediate neighbors live in harmony. In addition to his work with at-risk youth, he volunteers his services to an organization that collects and distributes medical supplies to medical clinics and hospitals in third world nations.
In summation, Neil has made a modest effort to serve the communities in which he has lived. Perhaps, it has been too little, too late.
Grade: C-
Self-Knowledge
"If only Neil knew then what he knows now..." But exactly what, in fact, does Neil really know about anything?
He knows, for sure, that life passes in the blink of an eye;
He knows that he has been blessed with a healthy life and, although a member of the (gainfully unemployed) lower class, has been relatively free from want;
He knows he was blessed to be born in the U.S., and raised in its democratic yet unequal, unjust and prejudiced society;
He knows he was blessed to be educated in the U.S.;
He knows he was blessed with full faculties, a myriad of opportunities and great potential that, for lack of self-confidence and determination, he didn't access, seize and realize;
He knows he failed to achieve mediocrity, let alone greatness;
He knows that every choice he made, from marching to a different drummer to taking the road less traveled had consequences that brought him to where he is, for good or ill;
He knows what it feels like to be persecuted, to hate and to fall in love;
He knows how to smile, laugh, cry, howl at the moon, sing and dance;
He knows how to cut the umbilical joining a mother to his daughter;
He knows the scent of a woman and a rose;
He knows the taste of a grand cru and of tears;
He knows the joy of cooking;
He knows the rapture that comes from making and listening to beautiful music;
He knows the pleasure of comprehending fine literature, poetry, painting and architecture;
He knows travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness;
He knows the indescribable feeling of his child's hand in his;
He knows the value of friends and enemies;
He knows happiness and sadness;
He knows what it feels like to be young and grow old;
He knows what it feels like to fear dying;
He knows the feeling of loss of a loved one;
He knows the ecstasy and agony of marriage;
He knows, to paraphrase Michael Josephson, "Though he may judge himself by his best traits and most noble acts, he will be judged by his last worst act." For Neil, that last worst act being his abandonment of his family;
He knows he can't re-live his life and "do it right;"
He knows what it is to fail;
He knows how much he doesn't know, which is almost everything;
In essence, Neil knows he was and is
an Eeyore not a Tigger;
a pessimist, not an optimist;
an aimless grasshopper, not a purposeful ant;
a dreamer, not a doer;
a nomad not a settler;
a voyager, not an adventurer;
a spectator, not an actor, player or participant;
an ascetic, not a Sybarite;
a grasshopper, not an ant;
an architect, not a designer;
a follower, not a leader;
a slave, not a master;
a recipient, not a contributor;
a student, not a teacher;
educated, not learned;
intelligent, not knowledgeable;
ignorant, not erudite;
a loser, not a winner;
a coward, not a hero;
an American, not a Chinese;
a loving husband, not a beloved husband;
a father, not a parent;
a failure, not a success;
a sad human being, not a happy one.
In summation, Neil never amounted to anything

HEADLINE: The Life Report: B. Clewly Johnson

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS


HIGHLIGHT: The life reports are in. Meet B. Clewly Johnson. 

 BODY:
I was born in Shanghai in 1940. The first five years of my life were spent in a Japanese concentration camp. I broke my arm in the camp but the Japanese set it badly. It's the only physical scar of that time.
My British parents divorced at the end of the war. My father immigrated to Brooklyn, NY. My mother and I immigrated to Cape Town, South Africa. I was nine when that happened. I spent the next eight years at boarding school and acquired a sense of self-reliance that has lasted a lifetime.
I finished high school and, because my mother lacked the funds to send me to college, I started work in the mailroom of a local advertising agency. I married at twenty-two. Within seven years we had produced three children and I was manager of the ad agency. I have no doubt that my white skin facilitated my rapid progress in a country where managerial talent was in short supply. By then I'd come to realize the awfulness of the South African regime. I transferred to London and began work with the same company.
After the hedonistic life of a white South African middle manager (chauffeur-driven car, beach side second home, private schools), English life was tough. In the UK in the mid-seventies, the miners were on strike, Murdoch was fighting the print unions, and inflation was twenty-seven percent. Every time I received a salary increase, the government took seventy percent of it. I was trying to send three children to private schools and had debts to show for it. But the adversity was good for me. Then Margaret Thatcher became prime minister and things got better.
Ten years later, I was divorced. I'd been traveling extensively around Europe, finding new clients for the agency, and this had taken a toll of my marriage. When I turned fifty, I remarried and became a father again. Almost immediately, my company promoted me to their Manhattan headquarters. There, I continued to do the same job, only this time my responsibilities were global. Within four years, my second marriage had dissolved. On reflection, I categorize this as, so far, the lowest point of my life.
By 1994 I was alone and divorced in New York. As a global director of the company, I faced mandatory retirement at 55 so I moved to Paris for a year, starting a consultancy that specialized in helping organizations 'identify, entice, and capture' new clients. I won assignments in Europe, Canada and the US. Life began to compose itself. My children visited me from London. I took my 6 year-old to Disneyland (my older children, to my joy, had begun a relationship with their stepsister).
It was my children, not anyone else that pulled me through the scary transition from corporate life to the world of the self-employed.
Wanting to be nearer my family, I moved to London in 1996. For six years I lived in a small apartment in the suburbs. My children took turns to stay, one at a time. I collected my young daughter from school every day. My consultancy business continued to thrive, although I'd noticed that most of my business came from North America.
I watched the century turn in Cape Town. In August 2000 I was on vacation in the Hamptons. I met a woman at a party and experienced what the French call a 'coup de foudre', a bolt of lightning. Although I was still based in London we saw each other on my frequent visits to New York. Prompted by this compelling new relationship and my thriving US consultancy business, I moved to New York the year after 9/11. I became a US citizen in 2008.
Now, I 'live together, apart' with the same woman I met in the Hamptons ten years ago. She lives in her Brooklyn apartment (weirdly, a few blocks from where my father spent his final days) and I live in my Long Island beach house. Between our two homes, we lead a happy, productive life. My four children and five grandchildren love my partner. They visit often. We visit them in Britain and, in February, we spend a few weeks in Cape Town. We've both been married and have six adult children between us. For now, this arrangement seems to suit us best.
Often, people say 'you have a perfect life'. And I reply, 'Thanks, but it's taken me 70 years to figure it out!'
Has my faith helped? Although I went to a cathedral boarding school and was an acolyte, I go to church rarely. Yet I believe in a power greater than myself. In my 50s I went to India and met the Dalai Lama. I became a student of Buddhism and spent time in ashrams. I still hum hymns while I'm working. All of this mild devotion to an unseen power has helped me through the taxing periods of my life. I try to live life as it lives itself, rather than agonizing over making it more to my liking. Like the Stoics, I believe there's a grand design for each of us; we simply have to let it take us along.
What have I learned in my 70 years? Here are ten things:

        
. Don't stay with people who, over time, grow apart from you. Move on. This means do what you think will make you feel okay - even if that makes others feel temporarily not okay.
        
 I spent 32 years with one organization. There were few days when I didn't look forward to going to work. The company helped me to see the world, meet wonderful people, and achieve heights of professional satisfaction. They also equipped me with the knowledge to run a successful one-man business after I retired.
        
 I married at 22 and had three children by the time I was 30. The biggest disadvantage was that I spent my 50s trying to live the carefree 20s that I missed - with disastrous results. The biggest advantage is that my older children are barely more than a generation away in age. And my youngest child, now 21, has taught me wonderful things about technology!
        
 I moved from South Africa to the UK with my young family, leaving a very good life for a more challenging one. I moved from the UK to the US when I was fifty, with a new wife and a new child. I moved from the US to France when I was fifty-four, divorced and pretty much broke, because I wanted to start a new chapter. I did the same when I was 62, moving from the UK to the US. At the time, these moves meant a leap into the unknown. I regret none of them.
        
 Despite the hard times I've put them through, I've tried to keep our relationships intact. I've concluded that I'm much better at being a father than a husband. I love my children more than life, and I think they love me - most of the time. Also, be generous with your ex-wives, if you have them. Your children will thank you.
        
 I now find I'm with someone whom I regard as the love of my life. My two wives gave me four wonderful children but, in my own life, lovely women became wives, and then they became mothers. The man/woman magic palls. Unless you're either very fortunate or very wise, it's hard to keep that early attraction alive; you become other people. I know I did. I changed, but I failed to adjust my perceptions to changes (or lack of changes) in the other person. I could have been more patient.
        
 I have a dozen firm friends around the world. Ironically, all of them are in long marriages. But I'm reminded what Beatle George Harrison's widow said when asked for the secret of a long marriage: 'you don't get divorced'. Can it be that simple?
        
 I run half-marathons, and box, and climb mountains. I watch my diet. Even so, I have hypertension and high cholesterol. But at my age, I'm not going to give up on good food and fine wines. Life today is, literally, too short.
        
 I read a lot. I'm nuts about foreign movies. I've self-published a thriller. I'm writing a memoir, and a book based on my consultancy work. I love to cook and to travel.
        
 There should always be room to learn more

HEADLINE: At Top Colleges, Anti-Wall St. Fervor Complicates Recruiting

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: The antibank fervor of the Occupy Wall Street movement has entered college campuses, complicating the on-campus recruiting process for applicants and recruiters. 

 BODY:
9:40 a.m. | Updated 
NEW HAVEN - College students seeking jobs on Wall Street have always had hurdles to overcome - grueling applications, endless rounds of interviews and fierce competition for the relatively few available spots at top firms.
This year's Wall Street hopefuls have had a new force to contend with: the wrath of their peers.
 Banks and hedge funds have long wooed undergraduates from elite colleges with lavish dinners, personalized e-mails and free trips to New York for interviews. It's all part of an annual courtship ritual known as on-campus recruiting. 
But this fall, the antibank animus of the Occupy Wall Street movement has seeped onto college campuses. At some schools, anger at big banks has turned the on-campus recruiting process into a crucible of controversy.
"I teach financial markets, and it's a little like teaching R.O.T.C. during the Vietnam War," said Robert J. Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale University. "You have this sense that something's amiss."
Even at universities traditionally considered to be Wall Street feeder schools, student bodies are becoming polarized over recruiting. At Harvard, Dartmouth and Cornell, student newspapers have featured polemic columns that urged fellow students to consider working somewhere - anywhere - outside finance. At Stanford, an opinion column that took aim at Wall Street's "aggressive, sophisticated and well-funded recruitment system" resulted in "Stop the Brain Drain," an online campaign that is trying to stem the tide of top students flooding into banks, hedge funds and private equity firms.
"We think it's really problematic," said Nathan Gusdorf, 22, a senior at Dartmouth College who is an organizer of the Occupy Dartmouth movement. "There's a culture here that takes a lot of people and directs them towards jobs in the finance industry. We breed a lot of the technocrats who go on to administer the global financial system." 
Wall Street has been steadily losing its allure on college campuses since the financial crisis, when many banks reduced hiring and left many finance-minded graduates in the lurch. Amid new uncertainty and lower profits, banks are again laying off workers, and most of those still working in the industry have seen their paychecks shrink.
Goldman Sachs, which was hard hit by this year's downturn, canceled its fall information session for undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania, traditionally one of its core recruiting schools. (The firm is still planning to hold a session for summer intern recruits in January.) At Harvard, only 17 percent of last year's class planned to go into financial services after graduation, according to a survey of graduating seniors, compared with 25 percent in 2006, before the crisis. 
But with the added vitriol of Occupy Wall Street, this year's recruiting process is even more forbidding.
The new recruiting climate was on display at Yale in mid-November, when a group of Yale students turned a Morgan Stanley information session into a protest site. While their fellow students, clad in suits and clutching folders with resumes, filed into The Study at Yale, a local hotel, to learn more about the investment bank, a group of approximately 25 Yale undergraduates protested outside. They held signs and chanted slogans like "Take a stance, don't go into finance" and "25 percent is too much talent spent" - a nod, protest organizers said, to the quarter of Yale graduates who typically take finance and management consulting jobs after graduation.
Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, said in a statement: "Morgan Stanley respects and supports everyone's right to protest and express their opinions. The event was well attended and we plan to continue to provide opportunities for discussions like this with any interested students."
Yale, which has graduated financial heavyweights like Stephen A. Schwarzman, the co-founder of the Blackstone Group, is traditionally considered a Wall Street feeder school. But the Occupy New Haven movement wants to change the focus.
Alexandra Brodsky, a Yale senior who helped organize Tuesday's protest, said in an interview that recruiting "serves to divide the campus."
Ms. Brodsky added that she had recently begun openly questioning the career choices of her finance-minded friends, because "these are people who could be doing better things with their energy."
Kate Orazem, a senior in the student group, added that Yale students often go into finance expecting to leave after several years, but end up staying for their entire careers. 
"People are naive about how addictive the money is going to be," she said.
Even without protests and antagonism, Wall Street firms would very likely have drawn a smaller percentage of the Ivy League's class of 2012 than top-flight firms in other industries.
According to a recent survey conducted by Universum, a consulting firm, the most coveted positions among young workers these days are jobs at technology firms like Google, Apple and Facebook. The highest rated investment bank in the survey, JPMorgan Chase, was ranked 41st, with only 2 percent of respondents listing the firm as their first choice of employer.
But for those students still hoping to land a job in finance, the added peer pressure has forced some of their enthusiasm underground.
"I can feel when my students tell me they're going into I-banking, they're a little more reserved about it than they used to be," said Chris Wiggins, an associate professor in Columbia University's department of applied physics and applied mathematics.
Mr. Wiggins, who is also an organizer of HackNY, a technology-focused group that tries to steer engineers and programmers away from Wall Street, said that the well-oiled recruitment process would be difficult to stop. 
"Zero percent of people show up at the Ivy League saying they want to be an I-banker, but 25 and 30 percent leave thinking that it's their calling," he said. "The banks have really perfected, over the last three decades, these large recruitment machines."
 Several days before the Morgan Stanley recruiting session at Yale that was greeted by protests, a recruiting session for Goldman Sachs confirmed that those machines, however battered, are still in operation. At the event, more than 100 students filed into a ballroom at the Omni Hotel, where they mingled with Goldman recruiters.
Nicholas Lombardo, a junior at Yale who attended, said that although he hoped to land a job on Wall Street upon graduation, he did not necessarily plan to spend his entire career in finance. He said that he had some concerns about the financial industry, but that the prospect of learning basic financial skills in a challenging, fast-paced environment had won out.
 "My friends and I joke about, 'Oh, are you going to the dark side?' " Mr. Lombardo said. "But it still seems like the smart thing to do."

HEADLINE: How the Fed Rescue Benefited Banks

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: A calculation by Bloomberg News shows how banks profited from the emergency lending provided by the Federal Reserve over a two-year period to rescue the financial system. 

 BODY:
A report by Bloomberg News offers a new way of quantifying the Federal Reserve's vast efforts to save financial companies from collapse during the crisis that peaked in 2008.
The central bank provided emergency loans, asset purchases and other aid totaling roughly $7.8 trillion during a two-year period ending in March 2009, easily the largest component of the government efforts to bulwark the financial system.
In an article in the January issue of Bloomberg Markets, published online Sunday night, Bloomberg offers an estimate that the aid allowed financial companies to book profits of roughly $13 billion during that period, largely by borrowing from the Fed at low interest rates and then using the money to make loans and investments with higher rates of return.
The benefit for the six largest American banks was about $4.8 billion, according to Bloomberg's calculations, or roughly one-quarter of their total profits over the two years.
The profit estimate is based on the simple expedient of multiplying the amount each firm borrowed from the Fed by its net interest margin - a key indicator of bank profitability that measures the difference between the amount the bank pays to get money and the amount it charges to provide money. In other words, the Bloomberg calculation basically assumes that banks invested the money they got from the Fed at roughly the same rate of profitability as money they acquired from other sources.
The estimate may well overstate the direct value of the Fed's loans, as banks used much of the money for short-term purposes that tend to have lower profit margins. Importantly, however, it also greatly understates the broader value of the loans: The money helped many recipients to survive.
Citigroup is a case in point. Bloomberg estimates that the Fed's loans increased the bank's profits by $1.8 billion. The real story, of course, is that government help saved the troubled bank from collapse.

HEADLINE: The AT&T and T-Mobile Pullback: The Web Reacts

BYLINE: BRIAN X. CHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Over Thanksgiving, AT&#038;T and T-Mobile USA said they would withdraw their application with the F.C.C. to join their cellphone operations. How did tech-watchers react? Many observers are saying that a deal is unlikely. 

 BODY:
 Over Thanksgiving, AT&T and T-Mobile USA said they would withdraw their application with the Federal Communications Commission to join their cellphone operations. How did tech-watchers react? Well, the companies may be saying they still plan to deal with the Justice Department and pursue a merger, but many observers are saying that a deal is unlikely.
In The Economist's "Schumpeter" column, a writer named M.G. says that AT&T is desperately hoping to get the green light from the Justice Department before taking its application back to the F.C.C. But even AT&T knows its chances are slim, which is why the company has already set aside $4 billion to cover the break-up fee if the merger fails.
As a result, T-Mobile USA will most likely have to find a new partner, and AT&T may have to look elsewhere, like companies in the television industry, to expand its business, the writer says:
Moving on from the T-Mobile deal will not be easy. But it is time for AT&T's managers to face up to the fact that its failure is inevitable.
Kevin Fitchard, a senior writer for GigaOM, says he believes that the chances of an AT&T and T-Mobile merger are extremely slim. He pointed out that the last time the F.C.C. referred a case to a judge, which it had said it would do in this case, was in 2002, which prevented a merger between Echostar and Hughes:
If the F.C.C. was in the mood to play ball, it would have gone into its usual 'approval with conditions' mode. There's practically no chance that the deal could get that far.
Anton Troianovski, a mobile reporter for The Wall Street Journal, writes in the Deal Journal blog that the episode is a "turning point" for the wireless industry:
The way things go will have a big impact on the rest of the industry. The deal's failure, for example, could mean continued competition for prepaid carriers Leap Wireless International and MetroPCS Wireless Inc., which have seen T-Mobile aggressively going after no-contract customers in recent months with smartphone data plans as low as $30 a month . However, a busted merger could be good for companies that own a lot of spectrum - including Time Warner Cable, Comcast, and financially teetering Clearwire Corporation - as AT&T looks for other ways to access more of the airwaves.
Harold Feld, legal director of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit group that focuses on information policy, foresees that AT&T will drag out its fight with the Justice Department for as long as possible, but says it is only delaying the inevitable:
While we remember Lee's surrender at Appomattox as the end of the Civil War, the war continued for several months. It took time to negotiate the surrender of more than 115,000 Confederate soldiers still in the field. So too with AT&T's efforts to acquire T-Mobile.
Finally, Michael Mandel, a contributor for The Atlantic, had a very different view on the blocked merger. He argued that AT&T should be applauded for investing in a domestic business. Instead, it is being sued by the government, which sets a bad precedent, Mr. Mandel says:
You would think that during a business investment drought, any company that puts big money into the United States would be patted on the back. But no AT&T is also getting sued by the Justice Department to block the merger with T-Mobile. Frankly, this sends a signal to United States companies that getting out of the reach of government regulators by going overseas is the right strategy.

HEADLINE: Breakfast Meeting, Nov. 28

BYLINE: NOAM COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Movie ticket sales over the holiday weekend dip from the previous year, a look at Adbuster magazine's role in starting the Occupy Wall Street movement and more media news. 

 BODY:
Ticket sales for Hollywood's five-day Thanksgiving sales period - an important springboard to Christmas - totaled about $234 million, an 11 percent decline from the period a year earlier, Brooks Barnes reported. The No. 1 film was a holdover, "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1" (Summit Entertainment), which took in an estimated $62.3 million during the long weekend. It had a two-week total of $221.3 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles ticket data. At No. 2 was a new release, "The Muppets" (Walt Disney Studios), which had estimated ticket sales of $42 million.

        
In the art house results, "The Artist," a $14 million black-and-white silent film from the Weinstein Company that is playing in four theaters in New York and Los Angeles, had a per-screen average of $52,604, one of the year's best results for the specialty marketplace; total sales were $210,414.

        
As Michael Cieply reports, Harvey Weinstein has been in full Oscars promotional mode for "The Artist," which has some obvious handicaps in reaching a wide audience, but perhaps can benefit with Academy voters by being, in essence, a love letter to old, old Hollywood.
For the moment, however, Hollywood's professional Oscar campaigners - who generally do not discuss their craft publicly, for fear of diminishing its effect - are privately buzzing about Mr. Weinstein's bid to outmaneuver films that are bigger, broader and better positioned for the general audience. He is doing that by playing to the movie industry's wobbly sense of self, exactly at a time when it is fretting about declining attendance, weak economics and constant pressure from other media. ... That it plays in almost utter silence, background music aside, has become a selling point for Mr. Weinstein and others, who point to their own bravery in mounting a tribute to the silent era by relying, more or less, on its own techniques.

        
Looking to the spring, Michael Cieply sees the potential for a showdown over projected shortfalls in health and pension plans for Hollywood's craft and blue-collar unions. No one is talking of a strike yet, he writes, but the expected shortfall - $500 million by 2015 - is of a scope that makes an easy solution seem unlikely.

William Yardley writes from Vancouver about the anticonsumerist Canadian magazine, Adbusters, which conceived the Occupy Wall Street movement back in the summer as a way to channel the simmering discontent in the United States. The editor, Kalle Lasn (pronounced KAL-luh LAS-en), says he believes in the power of words and images to create a new "meme," or a kind of transcendent cultural message. Adbusters came up with the name, which began as a hashtag on Twitter, and a poster showing a ballerina dancing on the back of the muscular sculptured bull near Wall Street in Manhattan. "There's a number of ways to wage a meme war," Mr. Lasn says. "I believe that one of the most powerful things of all is aesthetics." (NYT)

        
The New Yorker wrote about the role of Adbusters in its reconstruction of the protest in Zuccotti Park. The "tactical e-mail" the magazine sent on July 13 raced across Twitter and Reddit. Micah White, the senior editor of Adbusters and Mr. Lasn's close collaborator, told Mattathias Schwartz: "Normal campaigns are lots of drudgery and not much payoff, like rolling a snowball up a hill. This was the reverse."

The Guardian profiles Andrew Rashbass, the chief executive of the Economist group. In the first six months of the year, The Economist's audited sales were 1,486,838, up more than 3 percent compared with the period a year earlier. It reported sales of 844,000 copies in the United States. Mr. Rashbass gives a glimpse of his own reversals about incorporating digital products. At first he was convinced that visitors to the Web site were eager for a more-engaged "lean-forward" experience, rather than the "lean back" experience of print. With the rise of tablet reading devices - the magazine has 100,000 digital subscribers, the bulk of whom use the iPad app - Mr. Rashbass said he had changed course back to replicating the print magazine experience:
We made a conscious choice to avoid the Web-style interactive approach. Instead, we saw the potential of delivering a better lean-back experience than we have ever achieved in print.

David Carr writes about the peculiar situation facing Amelia Hill of The Guardian. She helped the newspaper break the phone-hacking story involving the now-closed News of the World tabloid, but in the summer she was brought in for questioning by the authorities over her article about the arrest of the former Hollywood reporter for The News of the World. The police decided that their investigation had been leaked, Mr. Carr writes, and Ms. Hill was initially questioned on a charge that she had induced a police official to illegally share information. Later, word came that she might be charged under Britain's Official Secrets Act; the police backed off that charge, but she remains at risk of being prosecuted on the original charge. (NYT)

        
A political blogger has been summoned to give evidence to the Leveson Inquiry investigating press ethics in Britain, The Guardian reports, after his blog published a document purporting to be the evidence of Tony Blair's former communications adviser, Alastair Campbell, three days before it was due to be heard.
An increasingly vituperative review and response (and response and response) between Pankaj Mishra and Niall Ferguson in The London Review of Books over Mr. Ferguson's new book, "Civilization: The West and the Rest," could be headed for court, according to The Guardian. In his initial response to the review, Mr. Ferguson, a history professor at Harvard, wrote that Mr. Mishra "strongly implies that I am a racist," demandeding an apology. Mr. Mishra's reply - "Ferguson is no racist, in part because he lacks the steady convictions of racialist ideologues" - did not do the trick. In an interview with The Guardian, Mr. Ferguson said about potential legal action: "If he won't apologize for calling me a racist, I will persecute him until he does."

HEADLINE: Barney Frank's War of Words With Wall Street

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: Barney Frank, the famously grumpy Massachusetts representative, who announced on Monday that he will not seek re-election next year, has been a harsh critic of big banks over the years. 

 BODY:
Barney Frank, the famously grumpy Massachusetts representative, who announced on Monday that he will not seek re-election next year, has had a 16-term legacy studded with legislative accomplishments.
Among them: his work on the House Financial Services Committee, which he chaired from 2007 through 2011, and his co-authorship, with former Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut, of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law in 2010.
With Mr. Frank leaving Congress, Wall Street is losing a major critic. Over the years, the politician -- known for his witty and cantankerous turn of phrase and for being the first openly gay member of Congress -- has often taken aim at the big banks and other financial firms.
Here's are some of his greatest hits.
On Wall Street's response to the harsh rhetoric circling the industry:
"I hate to say this, but the impression I get most is that their feelings are hurt. Mostly what I get is, 'Oh, you were rude to us. You said we were fat cats'...Get over it. I'm in the kind of business where people say rude things about us all the time." - as told to DealBook
On the mixed blessings of being Congress's resident financial expert:
"I know more now about repos and derivatives than I ever wanted to know. I hope I'll some day be able to forget it." - as told to DealBook
On the nature of slow change:
"We've brought the cost down a little bit in a less orderly way. I tend to eat when I'm under stress. I want to lose twenty-five pounds - but not by Sunday. And that's how home prices have come down." - as told to The New Yorker's Jeffrey Toobin
On marketing the Troubled Asset Relief Program and other bailout legislation:
"The problem in politics is this: You don't get any credit for disaster averted. Going to the voters and saying, 'Boy, things really suck. But you know what? If it wasn't for me, they would suck worse.' That is not a platform on which anybody has ever gotten elected in the history of the world." - to the CBS "60 Minutes" correspondent Leslie Stahl
On political motivation, in response to a question about why the White House had not pushed harder for more government intervention during the response to the financial crisis:
"[It's] like asking me to judge the Miss America contest - if your heart's not in it, you don't do a very good job." - to The New York Times, in 2008
On Newt Gingrich's suggestion, at a Republican presidential debate, that he should be arrested for his leading role in Wall Street reform:
"Apparently, Newt Gingrich - who considers himself one of the intellectual leaders of the free world - is so embarrassed by the fact that he is running behind Michele Bachmann in Republican polls that it has increased his already well-developed propensity to utter outlandish things."
On the relationship between I.Q. and financial culpability:
"No dumb people got America into this problem. You had to be really smart to understand collateralized debt obligation derivatives." - to The New York Times, in 2008
On his job as a legislator, and the moment in American liberalism:
"We are at a moment now when liberalism is poised to have its biggest impact on America since Roosevelt, because the conservative viewpoint has been so thoroughly repudiated by reality. Someone asked Harold Macmillan what has the most impact on political decisions. He said, 'Events, dear boy, events.' Events have just totally repudiated them, and we're now in a position to take advantage of that...You know Hegel. Thesis: No regulation at all. Antithesis: Now the government owns the banks. What I gotta do next year is the synthesis." - to The New Yorker
On the relationship between legislation and zoology (and in reference to Spencer Bachus, an Alabama Republican who had sparred with Mr. Frank on a debt-relief provision):
"If you want to look at this as one big circus, today is the day that the gentleman from Alabama gets to clean up after the elephants. And I mean elephants." - on the House floor, according to C-SPAN
On being everything for everybody:
"The notion that this bill doesn't keep people out of foreclosure is true. It doesn't combat global warming. It doesn't get troops out of Iraq. It won't help me lose weight. There are a lot of things this bill won't do that I very much want to do. None of them are a reason to vote against a bill that doesn't do what it doesn't say it's going to do but does what it does. What it does is go to the aid of cities that have been victimized." - to The New York Times
And finally, on the role Congress plays in regulating the economy:
"We have a very large number of people who, through no fault of their own, have lost everything they have. Now, I'm a great believer in the free-market system, but I also believe that there are important values that can only be vindicated if we act together through government." - to The Boston Globe, in 2005

HEADLINE: Democrats Take Aim at Romney in New Ad

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: Called "Trapped," it is styled as a parody of a sci-fi movie trailer for "the story of two men trapped in one body." 

 BODY:
The Democratic National Committee on Monday escalated its effort to define Mitt Romney,seeking the Republican nomination for president in 2012, as a flip-flopper with a new ad in five battleground states. Called "Trapped," it is styled as a parody of a sci-fi movie trailer for "the story of two men trapped in one body."
THE SCRIPT 
A man's ominously urgent voice announces, "From the creator of 'I'm running for office, for Pete's sake' " -- a line Mr. Romney delivered during a recent Republican debate - "comes the story of two men trapped in one body, 'Mitt versus Mitt.' " A younger Mr. Romney appears in a video clip, saying with emphasis, "I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose." Another clip shows a slightly gray-haired Romney saying, "The right next step is to see Roe v. Wade overturned." The never-seen narrator pronounces, "Two Mitts willing to say anything."
Segue to two more video snatches of Mr. Romney. In the first, predating passage of President Obama's health care law, Mr. Romney refers to the Massachusetts law he signed as governor, which created an insurance policy exchange with coverage options for the uninsured. "We've put together an exchange and the president's copying that idea. I'm glad to hear that," he says. In the second, post-enactment, he says, "Obamacare is bad news," punching the air with each word for emphasis. The narrator intones, "See it all at Mittvmitt.com."
ON THE SCREEN
The screen is dark throughout and slashed repeatedly by light flashes or the written words of the narrator, in the manner of special effects. As he says, "The story of two men," two head shots of Mr. Romney appear, one black and white, the other in color; as he continues, "trapped in one body," the Romneys collide into one shaky blur of the man. Next, profiles of Mr. Romney bookend the screen, seeming to stare each other down as a fireball explodes between them with the words "Mitt vs. Mitt" both spoken and written. The phrases "pro-choice" and "anti-choice," "pro-health care" and "anti-health care" appear beside the pertinent videos of Mr. Romney speaking.
ACCURACY
The ad is mostly accurate, underscoring the central weakness of Mr. Romney's candidacy - the contradictory positions he has taken on a variety of issues during his campaigns for governor and the United States Senate in Massachusetts, and during his runs for the 2008 and 2012 Republican presidential nominations. Those positions are preserved in video archives now being mined by his opposition in both parties.
One quibble could be made about the ad's health insurance section. It focuses on the fact that both Mr. Romney's Massachusetts law and Mr. Obama's federal statute created an insurance exchange where consumers could shop for coverage policies. But Mr. Romney's attacks on what Republicans call "Obamacare" have mainly focused on its mandate that individuals buy coverage, not on the exchanges. Yet Mr. Romney is not in a position to complain: He has been on both sides of the individual mandate issue, too.
In response, a Romney campaign spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, did not address the ad's particulars. In an e-mail, Ms. Saul criticized Mr. Obama's job-creation record, and said, "Instead of focusing on the economy and creating jobs, President Obama and Democrats are focused on tearing down Mitt Romney."
SCORECARD
The Democratic National Committee would not disclose how much airtime it has bought for the 31-second ad in five battleground-state cities - Albuquerque; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; Columbus, Ohio; Pittsburgh; and Milwaukee. It did not buy much; the ad will run just this week and not often enough to reach unengaged voters. Indeed, like a movie trailer, the ad is intended to draw plugged-in partisans to the full-length (four-minute) feature on a new Web site, Mittvmitt.com. Links will also go to millions of Americans by e-mail, Twitter and Facebook, underscoring the Internet's value to election campaigns in defining races for would-be supporters.

HEADLINE: Barney Frank, Moderate

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: The outgoing representative from Massachusetts is not a radical. Economically, he's a centrist. 

 BODY:
Conservative web sites are already cheering Barney Frank's announcement that he will retire from his Massachusetts House seat at the end of his term. But whether or not they say so publicly, many Republicans on Capitol Hill will actually miss him.
He is the most caustically hilarious member of the House, and is anything but the socialist caricature invented by the right. Back when such things were actually possible, he regularly worked with Republicans on significant bills. In a 2009 survey of House members by The Hill, he was named one of the most partisan and one of the most partisan members of the chamber (the only House lawmaker to make both lists), and was effusively praised by several Republicans. "He's a guy you can sit down and deal with," said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma.
Much of the animus against Mr. Frank from the right stems from his advocacy of gay rights, and his 1990 reprimand for hiring his roommate as a personal aide. No one is more withering about the dismal state of the House and the Republican party that controls it, as he demonstrated in his news conference today: "It consists half of people who think like Michele Bachmann," he said, "and half of people who are afraid of losing a primary to people who think like Michele Bachmann."
But economically, Mr. Frank is essentially a centrist. He believes in markets, supported free-trade agreements, and talks often of the need for a "grand bargain" between business and liberals. He worked with Republicans on housing policy and on the bailout of the banks. Nearly a third of the $13.1 million he raised since 1989 came from the financial, insurance, and real estate industries, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Most Republicans refused to sign on to the financial reform bill he sponsored along with Senator Christopher Dodd last year, but it was hardly a foot on the neck of the financial system. As a result of intense lobbying, Mr. Frank's bill contained several gaping holes: it did not break up large banks, and it permitted excessive risk-taking, including derivatives trading. Most seriously, it left too many of the most crucial details to be determined by regulatory agencies, leaving it vulnerable to the stubborn opposition of the industry and Republicans on the Hill. This has severely reduced its effectiveness.
Conservatives love to blame him for the housing crisis, pointing to his ties to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Although he could have exercised greater oversight, the connection between the mortgage companies and the subprime crisis is demonstrably false, invented to take the blame away from Wall Street and the big banks.
Mr. Frank supports a muscular government that exercises both oversight and aggressive action on behalf of the less fortunate. That used to be a fairly standard position for many members of both parties. Congress may be losing one of its best-informed and quotable members, but it is not losing a radical.

HEADLINE: Putting Others Ahead, And Then Falling Behind

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
There is a certain type of woman who is good at taking care of everyone but herself.
She is the sort who, when her older brother is suffering from a lung disease, will sit beside his bed on Staten Island and encourage him, in the most determined words, to get up on his feet and move about the house. She is also the one who, when this brother dies, will set aside a portion of her $81 weekly unemployment check to ensure he receives a proper burial.
She is a fixer of dinner and a folder of laundry -- and, most of all, a worrier over her children's well-being. You know this woman by the humorously frustrated sign she posts on a cabinet in her kitchen: ''If you can't clean, don't cook.'' The photos on her walls say things about her that she will not say about herself: they show parents, siblings, cousins, friends and neighbors. Which is to say, they show everybody's faces except her own.
Michelle Gore is that type of woman. 
''I don't know -- I just want to make sure that everybody else is, you know,'' Ms. Gore said the other day in her living room in the Louis H. Pink Houses in East New York, Brooklyn. Is what? she was asked. She shrugged, seeming embarrassed to continue. ''Is, you know, happy before I am,'' she said. ''I don't want anyone left out.''
Ms. Gore, 45, was the one left out in September, when she suddenly discovered she could not make the $537-a-month rent on her seventh-floor apartment. Two things brought her to this pass, she said: death and life.
There was a lot of death in recent years. In August 2010, Ms. Gore's brother Tony Gore, who she said had been abandoned by his former wife and children, died of a leaky heart valve. That same year, the father of her youngest child, Dennis White, died of a brain aneurism. Before her other brother, Jackie, died on Staten Island in July, there were months of coughing fits and trips to the hospital.
''One day, he ran to the bathroom and was throwing up blood,'' recalled Ms. Gore, who would visit Jackie frequently with gifts of food and clothes and with stern words of reassurance. ''Then he fell down on the floor in his kitchen. The ambulance came, but they couldn't save him.''
She and her two remaining siblings split the $1,000 funeral bill. Ms. Gore, by then, was out of work. In February, she lost her job as a wheelchair attendant for a charter airline service at John F. Kennedy Airport after the company made budget cuts. This development was part of what she meant by ''life.''
Life also includes caring for Dennis, a large boy with a kind smile and a learning disability. Dennis attends Thomas Jefferson High School, where he is enrolled in the integrated co-teaching program, which is designed for students with disabilities. With the coming of autumn, there were new clothes and school supplies to buy. Dennis turned 18 in September.
Between paying for a funeral and catering to Dennis's needs, Ms. Gore found herself in the red. She sought assistance from Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Ms. Gore, the helper, received some help herself: $537 to pay September's tardy rent.
''I get it from my mother,'' she said of her service to her family. Her mother, Mildred Gore, was from Chadbourn, N.C. She had eight children. ''She's the one who taught me to keep the family together, to keep the house clean and cook and wash dishes,'' Ms. Gore said.
She smiled -- or she tried to. ''I do everything,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Panel Urges Sharp Change For Hospitals In Brooklyn

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
The New York State health commissioner should be given sweeping new powers to replace the executives and board members of private hospitals, a group appointed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo recommended Monday in a report on how to restructure Brooklyn's failing hospitals and health system.
The report calls for legislation to provide such authority ''not just in Brooklyn and not just for troubled hospitals, but across the state and along the continuum of care.'' 
At the same time, it called for changes in the law that could open hospitals and physicians' practices to investment by large private companies. But in a nod to strong opposition from defenders of the state's nonprofit hospital tradition, it added: ''Private investment must not be allowed to undermine a facility's commitment to the community or its accountability.''
Both ideas -- the state exerting more control over private hospitals, and encouraging profit-motivated investment -- are attempts to help struggling hospitals adapt to drastic changes in federal and state health care financing.
''It's very hard when you're living through a transition,'' said Stephen Berger, the chairman of the Brooklyn Work Group, which produced the report. ''But we are moving to a different health delivery system, and everybody's going to have to get on board.''
But the proposals drew quick pushback from Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, the industry lobbying group. Mr. Raske said that the association would continue to oppose investor-owned hospitals, and that new state powers had to be very narrowly drawn to avoid ''the potential of an autocratic action.''
Mr. Raske agreed, however, that such power should apply to troubled institutions expecting state aid to restructure, including the half-dozen Brooklyn hospitals that the report recommends for mergers.
Three described as in immediate danger of financial collapse, Brookdale Hospital Medical Center, Interfaith Medical Center and Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, would be joined with other hospitals that are stronger but not considered viable on their own.
No hospital would simply be bailed out, the report said, but all would have to apply for support based on new patient-centered delivery models being promoted by the government to reduce Medicaid costs and improve outcomes. Support could include forgiveness of long-term debt, which could be controversial if private investors play a role.
The report calls for Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center, in East Flatbush, to lead in establishing an integrated system with Brookdale, in Brownsville, under a new executive and board of directors. Brooklyn Hospital Center, in Fort Greene, ''which recently emerged from bankruptcy and is demonstrating sound financial practices,'' the report said, would lead an integration with Wyckoff Heights, in Bushwick, and Interfaith, in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Other recommendations include closing inpatient services at Kingsboro Psychiatric Center; consolidating State University of New York-Downstate medical beds on the campus of Long Island College Hospital; and bringing salaries and fringe benefits for both unionized employees and hospital executives into line with revenue.
The report now goes to Nirav Shah, the state's health commissioner, who will consult local leaders, legislators and hospital administrators to determine the best options, said Jeffrey Gordon, a Health Department spokesman.
In a signal of support, Dr. Shah announced Monday that $450 million in grants would be available early in 2012 to help health care facilities across the state ''that are working to transition to a more sustainable, patient-centered approach that reduces over-reliance on inpatient care in hospitals and nursing homes.''
Critics point out that combining ailing hospitals has rarely created healthy ones in Brooklyn, where more than one in five residents live below the poverty line, two in five receive Medicaid, and many have no primary care physician.
The 88-page report noted that some of the hospitals' problems were beyond their control. But without naming names, the report was also sharply critical of the boards of some of the endangered hospitals for adopting a failed strategy ''that seeks merely to be the last man standing in their communities.''
''They have not evaluated financial and clinical performance, set strategic goals to address them, and held management accountable,'' the report said.

HEADLINE: Closer Look At Teeth May Mean More Filling

BYLINE: By RITCHIE S. KING

 BODY:
Until 2010, Amelia Nuwer, 22, visited the same dentist every year in Biloxi, Miss., her hometown. And every year she came back with a clean bill of dental health: no fillings necessary.
Then, as a junior at the University of Alabama, she saw a new dentist who delivered her first negative diagnosis: two cavities. Six months later, the dentist told her she had two more. Earlier this year, he once again had bad news: yet another cavity.
Somehow, in 12 months she had gone from perfect oral health to five fillings. ''It felt wrong to me,'' she said. 
Her hometown dentist, Dr. Francis Janus, was surprised, too. He examined his longtime patient after she graduated. Ms. Nuwer's so-called cavities, he concluded, had actually been ''incipient carious lesions,'' a form of early-stage decay that some dentists call ''microcavities.''
''He said that he wouldn't have filled them,'' she recalled. ''I was so upset and angry.'' The five fillings cost her almost $500 out of pocket.
Ms. Nuwer is hardly alone. With increasingly sophisticated detection technology, dentists are finding -- and treating -- tooth abnormalities that may or may not develop into cavities. While some describe their efforts as a proactive strategy to protect patients from harm, critics say the procedures are unnecessary and painful, and are driving up the costs of care.
''A better approach is watchful waiting,'' said Dr. James Bader, a research professor at the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry. ''Examine it again in six months.''
Every time a dentist drills into a tooth, he added, ''you're condemning that person to a refilling'' years down the road.
An incipient carious lesion is the initial stage of structural damage to the enamel, usually caused by a bacterial infection that produces tooth-dissolving acid.
The lesion doesn't always lead to a full-blown cavity, which entails decay of the layer right beneath the enamel, called dentin. Mineral-containing saliva can repair these lesions, especially when bolstered with fluoride.
Many experts think it doesn't make sense to operate in the early stages of decay. ''If you don't have any kind of demonstrable collapse of the enamel wall, then you shouldn't put in a filling,'' Dr. Bader said.
Yet a majority of practitioners are inclined to do so. According to a 2010 National Institutes of Health survey, 63 percent of more than 500 practicing dentists said they would operate on a tooth with decay that had not progressed beyond the enamel, even if the patient had a history of good dental hygiene.
Such operations typically cost $88 to $350 per filling, according to a 2007 survey in the magazine Dental Economics. According to the American Dental Association, about 175 million filling operations are performed in the United States every year.
Insurance plans cover all fillings, whether for microcavities or full-blown cavities, because dentists bill based on the work they've done, not the symptoms they've observed.
''In an ideal world, we would have a diagnostic code'' for cavities, said Dr. John Yamamoto, vice president of Delta Dental, a major provider of dental insurance. ''We know what tooth, we know what surface, but we don't know the severity of it.''
Different dentists hold to different treatment philosophies, and the dental association intentionally offers little guidance. Aside from endorsing the use of fluoride and dental sealants to prevent cavities, the association eschews formal treatment recommendations and ''does not have a policy on the treatment of incipient caries,'' or decay, according to a representative.
Dr. Douglas Young, a dental diagnostician at the University of the Pacific, thinks that ''watchful waiting'' doesn't make sense.
''If you were to go to a physician and he were to diagnose risk factors for heart disease, the physician would take action and treat the early signs of disease and try to prevent future disease,'' said Dr. Young, who helped develop a standardized cavity risk assessment adopted by the dental association.
To find incipient caries that can't be seen with X-rays or the naked eye, dentists like Dr. Young use a variety of new and sophisticated detection methods that include fiber-optic techniques and infrared laser scanning. The Diagnodent is a popular fluorescent light scanner that picks up on abnormalities in tooth density.
Whether to fill based on a Diagnodent reading ''depends on the risk,'' said Dr. Margherita Fontana, an associate professor at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry. An adult with great dental hygiene is probably at lower risk of seeing a microcavity progress than a teenager who drinks soft drinks all day, she said.
But other experts are critical of the Diagnodent and other early-detection devices because they identify areas on teeth that aren't actually carious lesions. What's more, even with a risk assessment, it's hard to know whether a true lesion will develop into a cavity or not.
''What's going to happen to it over the next five years is unclear,'' Dr. Bader said. ''That data isn't available yet.''
Gabriella Ribeiro Truman, 36, who runs a travel agency in New Jersey, has never had a cavity. ''I've never had any extensive dental work, and I go for a cleaning twice a year,'' she said.
About a month and a half ago, however, she went to a see a new dentist. He took some high-resolution pictures of her teeth and enlarged the images on a screen. He pointed to six microcavities, and a possible seventh.
He said that ''these could turn into something major,'' she said. ''Root canals. I could lose my teeth.''
''You feel uncomfortable when you're put in that position,'' she added.
The dentist handed her a quote for $3,500 worth of work. The high figure gave her pause.
''To go from great dental health to something like that?'' she said. ''I would rather get somebody else to look at them beforehand.''

HEADLINE: At Top Colleges, Anti-Wall Street Fervor Complicates Campus Recruiting

BYLINE: By KEVIN ROOSE

 BODY:
NEW HAVEN - College students seeking jobs on Wall Street have always had hurdles to overcome - grueling applications, endless rounds of interviews and fierce competition for the relatively few available spots at top firms.
This year's Wall Street hopefuls have had a new force to contend with: the wrath of their peers.
Banks and hedge funds have long wooed undergraduates from elite colleges with lavish dinners, personalized e-mails and free trips to New York for interviews. It's all part of an annual courtship ritual known as on-campus recruiting.
But this fall, the antibank animus of the Occupy Wall Street movement has seeped onto college campuses. At some schools, anger at big banks has turned the on-campus recruiting process into a crucible of controversy. 
''I teach financial markets, and it's a little like teaching R.O.T.C. during the Vietnam War,'' said Robert J. Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale University. ''You have this sense that something's amiss.''
Even at universities traditionally considered to be Wall Street feeder schools, student bodies are becoming polarized over recruiting. At Harvard, Dartmouth and Cornell, student newspapers have featured polemic columns that urged fellow students to consider working somewhere - anywhere - outside finance. At Stanford, an opinion column that took aim at Wall Street's ''aggressive, sophisticated and well-funded recruitment system'' resulted in ''Stop the Brain Drain,'' an online campaign that is trying to stem the tide of top students flooding into banks, hedge funds and private equity firms.
''We think it's really problematic,'' said Nathan Gusdorf, 22, a senior at Dartmouth College who is an organizer of the Occupy Dartmouth movement. ''There's a culture here that takes a lot of people and directs them towards jobs in the finance industry. We breed a lot of the technocrats who go on to administer the global financial system.''
Wall Street has been steadily losing its allure on college campuses since the financial crisis, when many banks reduced hiring and left many finance-minded graduates in the lurch. Amid new uncertainty and lower profits, banks are again laying off workers, and most of those still working in the industry have seen their paychecks shrink.
Goldman Sachs, which was hard hit by this year's downturn, canceled its annual information session for undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania, traditionally one of its core recruiting schools. At Harvard, only 17 percent of last year's class planned to go into financial services after graduation, according to a survey of graduating seniors, compared with 25 percent in 2006, before the crisis.
But with the added vitriol of Occupy Wall Street, this year's recruiting process is even more forbidding.
The new recruiting climate was on display at Yale in mid-November, when a group of Yale students turned a Morgan Stanley information session into a protest site. While their fellow students, clad in suits and clutching folders with resumes, filed into The Study at Yale, a local hotel, to learn more about the investment bank, a group of approximately 25 Yale undergraduates protested outside. They held signs and chanted slogans like ''Take a stance, don't go into finance'' and ''25 percent is too much talent spent'' - a nod, protest organizers said, to the quarter of Yale graduates who typically take finance and management consulting jobs after graduation.
Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, said in a statement: ''Morgan Stanley respects and supports everyone's right to protest and express their opinions. The event was well attended and we plan to continue to provide opportunities for discussions like this with any interested students.''
Yale, which has graduated financial heavyweights like Stephen A. Schwarzman, the co-founder of the Blackstone Group, is traditionally considered a Wall Street feeder school. But the Occupy New Haven movement wants to change the focus.
Alexandra Brodsky, a Yale senior who helped organize Tuesday's protest, said in an interview that recruiting ''serves to divide the campus.''
Ms. Brodsky added that she had recently begun openly questioning the career choices of her finance-minded friends, because ''these are people who could be doing better things with their energy.''
Kate Orazem, a senior in the student group, added that Yale students often go into finance expecting to leave after several years, but end up staying for their entire careers.
''People are naive about how addictive the money is going to be,'' she said.
Even without protests and antagonism, Wall Street firms would very likely have drawn a smaller percentage of the Ivy League's class of 2012 than top-flight firms in other industries.
According to a recent survey conducted by Universum, a consulting firm, the most coveted positions among young workers these days are jobs at technology firms like Google, Apple and Facebook. The highest rated investment bank in the survey, JPMorgan Chase, was ranked 41st, with only 2 percent of respondents listing the firm as their first choice of employer.
But for those students still hoping to land a job in finance, the added peer pressure has forced some of their enthusiasm underground.
''I can feel when my students tell me they're going into I-banking, they're a little more reserved about it than they used to be,'' said Chris Wiggins, an associate professor in Columbia University's department of applied physics and applied mathematics.
Mr. Wiggins, who is also an organizer of HackNY, a technology-focused group that tries to steer engineers and programmers away from Wall Street, said that the well-oiled recruitment process would be difficult to stop.
''Zero percent of people show up at the Ivy League saying they want to be an I-banker, but 25 and 30 percent leave thinking that it's their calling,'' he said. ''The banks have really perfected, over the last three decades, these large recruitment machines.''
Several days before the Morgan Stanley recruiting session at Yale that was greeted by protests, a recruiting session for Goldman Sachs confirmed that those machines, however battered, are still in operation. At the event, more than 100 students filed into a ballroom at the Omni Hotel, where they mingled with Goldman recruiters.
Nicholas Lombardo, a junior at Yale who attended, said that although he hoped to land a job on Wall Street upon graduation, he was not planning to spend more than two or three years working in finance. He said that he had some concerns about the financial industry, but that the prospect of learning basic financial skills in a challenging, fast-paced environment had won out.
''My friends and I joke about, 'Oh, are you going to the dark side?' '' Mr. Lombardo said. ''But it still seems like the smart thing to do.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Pakistan: Children With Pneumonia Fare Better With Home Treatment, Study Finds

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
Letting ''lady health workers'' in rural northern Pakistan treat children with severe pneumonia in their homes worked better than the established practice of telling parents to take them to a hospital, a new study has found. 
The study, published in The Lancet this month, followed 1,857 children who were treated at home with oral amoxicillin for five days and 1,354 children in a control group who were given standard care: one dose of oral cotrimoxazole and instructions to go to the nearest hospital or clinic.
The home-treated group had only a 9 percent treatment-failure rate, while the control group children failed to improve 18 percent of the time.
Some parents could not afford to take their children to hospitals, which were often understaffed.
Researchers from Save the Children, the World Health Organization and Boston University did the study, which was financed by the United States Agency for International Development. Pneumonia is a major killer of infants and toddlers.
Pakistan's network of 90,000 ''lady health workers'' was founded in 1994 by Benazir Bhutto, then the prime minister.
''It's one of the best community-based health systems in the world,'' said Dr. Donald Thea, a Boston University researcher who was one of the authors.
A Lancet editorial cautioned that not all local health workers are as well trained and supervised as Pakistan's and that since northern Pakistan has a low AIDS rate, it would be wrong to assume that every country would do as well with such a system.

HEADLINE: Keep the Clean Water Act Strong

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. REILLY. 
William K. Reilly was the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency from 1989 to 1993 and was the co-chairman of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling.

 BODY:
San Francisco
NEXT year will mark the 40th anniversary of the Clean Water Act, a milestone for a series of landmark environmental laws that began with the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970. Those actions set our nation on a course to restore our damaged natural resources, but today, because of political pressures and court rulings, the extent and durability of some of those key protections are at risk.
Since its enactment in 1972, the Clean Water Act has encountered resistance from powerful business interests that have tried to fill wetlands, drain marshes, develop shorelines and allow pollution to flow off their property. One approach these developers have used to weaken the law has been to try to limit its jurisdiction, to say it shouldn't apply to this or that water body. The rationale has always been to argue that the water on the particular property in dispute didn't connect with interstate bodies of water and therefore should be exempt from federal regulation. 
When the act became law, two-thirds of our nation's lakes, rivers and coastal waters were unsafe for fishing or swimming, and untreated sewage and industrial waste was routinely dumped into our waters. The law was partly a response to the shock the nation experienced when the filthy Cuyahoga River in Cleveland erupted in flames. Since then, industrial pollution has declined significantly. Fish have returned to countless water bodies that were once all but lifeless. Progress has come in fits and starts -- despite more litigation filed than the law's proponents expected or wanted -- but it is real and evident.
Still, there are reasons for concern.
One is the ambiguity introduced by two Supreme Court decisions -- Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. Army Corps of Engineers in 2001 and Rapanos v. United States in 2006 -- over which American waters fall under the law. The law was intended to protect ''all the waters of the United States.'' But the decisions can be taken to suggest that the law does not protect certain waterways -- those that are within one state or that sometimes run dry, for example, and lakes unconnected to larger water systems. As a result, fewer waters are protected, and those who wish to build on land that requires dredging and the depositing of the fill elsewhere face confusion, uncertainty and delay as federal regulators try to determine which water bodies fall under the law.
The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that about a third of the nation's waters are still unhealthy. About 117 million Americans -- more than a third of the population -- get some or all of their drinking water from sources now lacking protection. Given the deep antipathy to regulation on Capitol Hill -- the House actually approved a measure in July to strip the E.P.A. of some of its authority to enforce the Clean Water Act -- Congress has been unable or unwilling to clarify the law so that progress can continue in restoring and protecting these waters.
That has left it to the E.P.A. and the United States Army Corps of Engineers to draft new rules to make clear which waterways are protected. This guidance would keep safe the streams and wetlands that affect the quality of the water used for drinking, swimming, fishing, farming, manufacturing, tourism and other activities. The new rules would also bring clarity to the issue. Routine agricultural, ranching and forestry practices will not require permits under the Clean Water Act. Formal rulemaking will follow, though that will take time and will most likely be contentious.
The American economy has performed well over the past four decades: real per capita income has doubled since 1970 and pollution is down even with 50 percent more people. The choice between a healthy environment and a healthy economy is a false one. They stand, or fall, together. We've been blessed in the United States with abundant water resources. But we also face daunting challenges that are putting new demands on those resources -- continuing growth; the need for water for food, energy production and manufacturing; the push for biofuel crops; the threat of new contaminants; climate change and just maintaining and restoring our natural systems.
If we narrow our vision of the Clean Water Act, if we buy into the misguided notion that reducing protection of our waters will somehow ignite the economy, we will shortchange our health, environment and economy.

HEADLINE: Judge Rejects An S.E.C. Deal With Citigroup

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Taking a broad swipe at the Securities and Exchange Commission's practice of allowing companies to settle cases without admitting that they had done anything wrong, a federal judge on Monday rejected a $285 million settlement between Citigroup and the agency.
The judge, Jed S. Rakoff of United States District Court in Manhattan, said that he could not determine whether the agency's settlement with Citigroup was ''fair, reasonable, adequate and in the public interest,'' as required by law, because the agency had claimed, but had not proved, that Citigroup committed fraud.
As it has in recent cases involving Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, UBS and others, the agency proposed to settle the case by levying a fine on Citigroup and allowing it to neither admit nor deny the agency's findings. Such settlements require approval by a federal judge.
While other judges are not obligated to follow Judge Rakoff's opinion, the 15-page ruling could severely undermine the agency's enforcement efforts if it eventually blocks the agency from settling cases in which the defendant does not admit the charges. 
The agency contends that it must settle most of the cases it brings because it does not have the money or the staff to battle deep-pocketed Wall Street firms in court. Wall Street firms will rarely admit wrongdoing, the agency says, because that can be used against them in investor lawsuits.
The agency in particular, Judge Rakoff argued, ''has a duty, inherent in its statutory mission, to see that the truth emerges.'' But it is difficult to tell what the agency is getting from this settlement ''other than a quick headline.'' Even a $285 million settlement, he said, ''is pocket change to any entity as large as Citigroup,'' and often viewed by Wall Street firms ''as a cost of doing business.''
According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Citigroup stuffed a $1 billion mortgage fund that it sold to investors in 2007 with securities that it believed would fail so that it could bet against its customers and profit when values declined. The fraud, the agency said, was in Citigroup's falsely telling investors that an independent party was choosing the portfolio's investments. Citigroup made $160 million from the deal and investors lost $700 million.
Judge Rakoff said the agency settlement policy -- ''hallowed by history, but not by reason''-- creates substantial potential for abuse because ''it asks the court to employ its power and assert its authority when it does not know the facts.'' That undermines the constitutional separation of powers, he said, by asking the judiciary to rubber-stamp the executive branch's interpretation of the law.
The agency said that it disagreed with the judge's ruling but did not say whether it would appeal, or try to refashion the settlement or prepare to begin a trial, as the judge directed, on July 16.
Robert Khuzami, the agency's director of enforcement, said in a statement that the Citigroup settlement ''reasonably reflects the scope of relief that would be obtained after a successful trial,'' and that the decision ''ignores decades of established practice throughout federal agencies and decisions of the federal courts.''
Citigroup said it also disagreed with Judge Rakoff's decision, adding that it would fight the charges if the case indeed went to trial.
''We believe the proposed settlement is a fair and reasonable resolution to the S.E.C.'s allegation of negligence, which relates to a five-year-old transaction,'' Edward Skyler, a Citigroup spokesman, said in a statement. ''We also believe the settlement fully complies with long-established legal standards. In the event the case is tried, we would present substantial factual and legal defenses to the charges.''
In his decision, Judge Rakoff called Citigroup ''a recidivist,'' or repeat offender, for having previously settled other fraud cases with the agency where it neither admitted nor denied the allegations but agreed never to violate the law in the future.
Citigroup and other repeat offenders can agree to those terms, the judge said, because they know that the commission has not monitored compliance, failing to bring contempt charges for repeat violations in at least 10 years.
A recent analysis by The New York Times of the agency's fraud settlements with Wall Street firms found 51 instances, involving 19 companies, in which the agency claimed that a company had broken fraud laws that they previously had agreed never to breach. Securities law experts said that the ruling presents the agency with a tough dilemma. In future cases, it will have to consider the risk that another judge may be reluctant to approve a settlement given the Rakoff ruling.
''This is clearly a case of great significance,'' said Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the agency who is now chief executive at Kalorama Partners in Washington. ''It's also a case for which there is no direct precedent. Courts have been approving settlements by government agencies without any admissions of wrongdoing for years.''
On the other hand, Mr. Pitt noted, ''there is no suggestion here that this decision would apply in every single case,'' because Citigroup has reached such settlements before, a situation that sets this case apart from many Securities and Exchange Commission settlements.
Judge Rakoff has been a frequent critic of the agency's settlements. In 2009, he rejected a proposed $33 million settlement with Bank of America for a case in which the agency said the bank had misled shareholders over its acquisition of Merrill Lynch. He eventually approved a $150 million settlement after the agency presented further evidence of the bank's wrongdoing.
The judge also noted the difference between the agency's settlement with Citigroup and its settlement last year with Goldman Sachs in a similar mortgage-derivatives case. Goldman was required to say that its marketing materials for the product ''contained incomplete information.''
In the Citigroup case, no such facts were agreed on. ''An application of judicial power that does not rest on facts is worse than mindless, it is inherently dangerous,'' Judge Rakoff wrote. ''In any case like this that touches on the transparency of financial markets whose gyrations have so depressed our economy and debilitated our lives, there is an overriding public interest in knowing the truth.''
Mr. Khuzami took issue with the judge's characterization of the settlement. ''These are not 'mere' allegations,'' he said, ''but the reasoned conclusions of the federal agency responsible for the enforcement of the securities laws after a thorough and careful investigation of the facts.''
Barbara Black, a professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Law who edits the Securities Law Prof Blog, said that the decision was interesting because Judge Rakoff carefully treads the line between the deference that judges are supposed to show to regulatory agencies while also ensuring that the court does not simply rubber-stamp decisions.
In a legal dispute between two private parties, they can agree to whatever settlement they desire, Ms. Black said. But in a case involving a public agency with consequences that affect the public interest, there has to be some kind of acknowledgment that certain things did occur, she added.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Rise; Prices Fall

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans bought slightly more new homes in October, the Commerce Department said Monday, but the median sales price fell to its lowest level of the year. And the annual sales rate is trailing last year's, which was the worst in half a century. 
New-home sales increased 1.3 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 307,000, the department said. That was less than half the 700,000 that economists say indicate a healthy housing market.
September's figures were revised down significantly to show a weaker rate than first estimated. The 323,000 new homes sold last year were the fewest since the government began keeping records in 1963. This year is not faring much better.
Sales were uneven across the country. They increased 22.2 percent in the Midwest and 14.9 percent in the West. But they were unchanged in the Northeast and fell 9.5 percent in the South.
While new-homes sales represent a fraction of the housing market, they have an outsize impact on the economy. Each home built creates an average of three jobs for a year and generates about $90,000 in tax revenue, according to the National Association of Home Builders.
Many builders have stopped working on new projects because they cannot obtain financing. The number of new homes for sale in the United States fell in October to a record low of 162,000.
Builders are also struggling to compete against cheaper resales, even as they lower their own prices. The median sales price of a new home fell 0.4 percent in October from September, to $212,300.
Steven Wood, chief economist at Insight Economics, said the small number of new homes for sale should help the housing market recover quicker when prices began to rise.
But he said, ''A sustained rebound in new-home sales appears unlikely.''

HEADLINE: Mourning a Cultural Hub Disguised as a Used Bookstore

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
METUCHEN, N.J. -- Even admirers concede it was always a stretch to imagine a combination literary bookstore, avant garde cultural center and family-friendly guerrilla street theater emporium here on Main Street. So Alex Dawson's seven-year run at the Raconteur, which will come to an end on Jan. 31, was about seven years longer than anyone should have expected.
Still, more than just another bookstore is closing in Mr. Dawson's plans to shut down his eerily orderly kingdom of antiquated arcana with the scrap-metal Don Quixote statue out front. The Raconteur bucked the awful economy, the impossible economics of the book business and the big-box magnets sucking life from suburban downtowns. Even if he went out on his own terms, that seems small consolation to adherents. 
''It was like the least cynical place on earth,'' said Mike Edison, a Metuchen native and a writer, editor and musician. ''There's no way you could possibly have turned that trick and ended up rich, but he turned it into a kind of clubhouse for the community and somehow it worked.''
Mr. Dawson, now 41, had quite a full life going on when he decided to create a bookstore on the order of Shakespeare & Company in Paris or City Lights in San Francisco. He grew up in New Jersey and then on an Alabama horse farm. He studied art at Rutgers and had traveled widely and worked as a bartender, bouncer, playwright and artistic director of the Bon Bock theatrical company on the Lower East Side when he heard in 2003 that the desultory secondhand bookstore in Metuchen where he lived was up for sale.
He opened the Raconteur in November 2004 with a partner, selling used books, renting DVDs and hosting readings, films and theatrical events.
Mr. Dawson said one of his goals was ''to return rare and exotic entertainment to the village square.'' The shop hosted 75 free events a year, and about a dozen paid ones at other locations. Highlights included readings and talks by Pulitzer Prize winners like the Irish poet Paul Muldoon and the American novelist Jennifer Egan. There was punk rock in the children's section, sword swallowers and fire eaters on Main Street and Keith Nelson, a performer with the Bindlestiff Cirkus, swallowing a three-foot illuminated neon tube. On the first Sunday of each month, there was a trans-Atlantic jam session via a Google webcam with a pub in Reading, England.
''The Raconteur was not just a bookstore,'' said one loyal customer, Janice Fried. It was, she went on, a place where her husband played music, she displayed collage art and her son learned to play chess. ''It was what a bookstore should be, with an owner who used it as place to enlighten, delight and inspire,'' she said.
But, if the shop became known internationally and regularly brought customers and artists from New York City for events, it barely broke even. Mr. Dawson paid himself a salary between $10,000 and $20,000, but as time went by, the pull of his own writing and ambitions in the theater became stronger than the lure of keeping the shop going.
''I still love being here and meeting the people,'' he said. ''But I feel like I don't want to be a shop clerk anymore. That's what it boils down to.''
And so on Nov. 15, the seventh anniversary of the store's opening, he announced the closing in an e-mail to his customers and on Facebook. Some customers are looking into keeping it going, though running the store and matching his events would be a daunting challenge.
''It's not a question of being forced out, certainly not one of eviction,'' he wrote. ''It's more an issue of quitting while ahead, more 'Seinfeld' than 'Happy Days.' ''
Since then, he said, the place has been like an Irish wake.
One customer wrote him: ''I couldn't help thinking of the words by Poe, after I read your e-mail two nights ago, 'Darkness there, and nothing more.' I really felt as if someone had just died. You have given this community a soul and a heart.''
Fans said the Raconteur was what the urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg called a Third Space, that place in addition to home and work -- maybe a neighborhood bar, maybe the local barber shop -- where people can congregate to find communion they do not get elsewhere. But there are fewer of them around, and, as the author Robert Kaplow, a Raconteur regular, suggests, maybe the Third Space is now Facebook or Twitter.
Mr. Dawson cites a friend's remark that the greatest thing about the Raconteur was its ability to create the unexpected amid the comforts of suburbia. ''What the store did was create a note of unpredictability,'' he said. ''You never knew what was going to be down there on a Tuesday or a Friday. It might be a folk band from Georgia, fire spitters or a Pulitzer Prize winner.''
Yes, it is the death of one small store in one small town, but in the loss of that unpredictable note, that elusive, intensely personal Third Space, the fans of Raconteur say they see something more.
''Thanks for making something special,'' someone else wrote. ''There aren't many cool secrets anymore, but your shop was one I always took pride in revealing to others.''

HEADLINE: Shares Soar on Talk of a Europe Deal

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks and the euro rose sharply Monday, as investors took heart at signs that European leaders were pushing toward new measures to rescue the currency union.
The surge in equities ended a seven-day losing streak for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, pushing it nearly 3 percent higher. It was a welcome change of direction from last week, when Wall Street lost more than 4 percent as markets reacted to rising borrowing costs for European governments and the failure by a Congressional committee in Washington to reach an accord on ways to cut the budget deficit.
On Monday, traders reacted to the news that Germany and France have been discussing a deal to hasten European budget and financial coordination. Analysts said a deal that did not require renegotiating European Union treaties could reassure markets and bring skeptics on board to support the euro. 
''We are seeing slightly better news out of Europe,'' said Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones. With last week's oversold conditions, she added, ''not surprisingly, there are a lot of attractive opportunities.''
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.59 percent, or 291.23 points, to 11,523.01. The S.& P. 500 jumped 2.92 percent, or 33.88 points, to 1,192.55, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 3.52 percent, or 85.83 points, to 2,527.34.
There were reasons to be guarded about the significance of one day of gains, however. Monday's surge had not pushed any of the major indexes into positive territory for the month or year.
It could also be another sign of rising market volatility. The S.& P. 500, for example, has closed up at least 4 percent in one day eight times since the beginning of 2009, as the financial crisis set in, while it has fallen by 4 percent or more 10 times in that period.
Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for Standard & Poor's, said a high proportion of the index's big swings had, in fact, occurred just since 2009: of 164 times the index had moved by at least 4 percent since 1962, 26 had been in the last three years.
In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, rose 5.73 percent. The CAC 40 in Paris was up 5.46 percent, and the DAX, the German index, rose 4.6 percent. The FTSE 100 index in London gained 2.87 percent. The euro rose to $1.3308, from $1.3239 late Friday in New York.
In the bond market, the 10-year note fell 1/32, to 100 9/32, and the yield remained at 1.97. The comparable German bond rose 4 basis points, to yield 2.29 percent.
Bonds of countries that have been seen as more risky rose in price. Italian 10-year bonds traded to yield 7.191 percent, down four basis points. Spanish 10-year bonds were down 13 basis points at 6.50 percent.
''Talk that European countries were discussing bilateral treaties to strengthen fiscal ties across the current monetary union seems to be easing tensions somewhat this morning, and driving a sizable sell-off in the U.S. rates markets,'' Guy LeBas, the chief fixed-income strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott, wrote in a research note.
Investors seemed to shrug off dire warnings from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and Moody's Investors Service, both of which warned that the euro zone problems were well on their way to becoming serious issues for noneuro countries.
Markets also took a measure of optimism from the National Retail Federation, which said on Sunday that spending in the United States during the Thanksgiving weekend surged 9.1 percent over last year -- the biggest increase since 2006 -- to an average of almost $400 per shopper. On Wall Street, consumer stocks were up about 3 percent, while energy stocks were up more than 3.5 percent as oil prices rose.
United States Steel rose 8.49 percent, or $1.89, to $24.16, as the materials sector over all rose 3.6 percent.
Marathon Oil was up 5.35 percent at $25.98, and consumer shares were helped by Netflix, which jumped 9.54 percent, to $69.95.
Commercial Metals Company pushed 23.76 percent higher, to $14.17, after Carl C. Icahn offered to acquire the company, a recycler based in Irving, Tex., for $15 a share.

HEADLINE: Public Sector Sheds Jobs; Blacks Are Hit Hardest

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
Don Buckley lost his job driving a Chicago Transit Authority bus almost two years ago and has been looking for work ever since, even as other municipal bus drivers around the country are being laid off.
At 34, Mr. Buckley, his two daughters and his fiancee have moved into the basement of his mother's house. He has had to delay his marriage, and his entire savings, $27,000, is gone. ''I was the kind of person who put away for a rainy day,'' he said recently. ''It's flooding now.''
Mr. Buckley is one of tens of thousands of once solidly middle-class African-American government workers -- bus drivers in Chicago, police officers and firefighters in Cleveland, nurses and doctors in Florida -- who have been laid off since the recession ended in June 2009. Such job losses have blunted gains made in employment and wealth during the previous decade and undermined the stability of neighborhoods where there are now fewer black professionals who own homes or who get up every morning to go to work. 
Though the recession and continuing economic downturn has been devastating to the American middle class as a whole, the two and a half years since the declared end of the recession have been singularly harmful to middle-class blacks in terms of layoffs and unemployment, according to economists and recent government data. About one in five black workers have public-sector jobs, and African-American workers are one-third more likely than white ones to be employed in the public sector.
''The reliance on these jobs has provided African-Americans a path upward,'' said Robert H. Zieger, emeritus professor of history at the University of Florida, and the author of a book on race and labor. ''But it is also a vulnerability.''
A study by the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California this spring concluded, ''Any analysis of the impact to society of additional layoffs in the public sector as a strategy to address the fiscal crisis should take into account the disproportionate impact the reductions in government employment have on the black community.''
Jobless rates among blacks have consistently been about double those of whites. In October, the black unemployment rate was 15.1 percent, compared with 8 percent for whites. Last summer, the black unemployment rate hit 16.7 percent, its highest level since 1984.
Economists say there are probably a variety of reasons for the racial gap, including generally lower educational levels for African-Americans, continuing discrimination and the fact that many live in areas that have been slow to recover economically.
Though the precise number of African-Americans who have lost public-sector jobs nationally since 2009 is unclear, observers say the current situation in Chicago is typical. There, nearly two-thirds of 212 city employees facing layoffs are black, according to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Union.
The central role played by government employment in black communities is hard to overstate. African-Americans in the public sector earn 25 percent more than other black workers, and the jobs have long been regarded as respectable, stable work for college graduates, allowing many to buy homes, send children to private colleges and achieve other markers of middle-class life that were otherwise closed to them.
Blacks have relied on government jobs in large numbers since at least Reconstruction, when the United States Postal Service hired freed slaves. The relationship continued through a century during which racial discrimination barred blacks from many private-sector jobs, and carried over into the 1960s when government was vastly expanded to provide more services, like bus lines to new suburbs, additional public hospitals and schools, and more.
But during the past year, while the private sector has added 1.6 million jobs, state and local governments have shed at least 142,000 positions, according to the Labor Department. Those losses are in addition to 200,000 public-sector jobs lost in 2010 and more than 500,000 since the start of the recession.
The layoffs are only the latest piece of bad news for the nation's struggling black middle class.
A study by the Brookings Institution in 2007 found that fewer than one-third of blacks born to middle-class parents went on to earn incomes greater than their parents, compared with more than two-thirds of whites from the same income bracket. The foreclosure crisis also wiped out a large part of a generation of black homeowners.
The layoffs are not expected to end any time soon. The United States Postal Service, where about 25 percent of employees are black, is considering eliminating 220,000 positions in order to stay solvent, and areas with large black populations -- from urban Detroit to rural Jefferson County, Miss. -- are struggling with budget problems that could also lead to mass layoffs.
The postal cuts alone -- which would amount to more than one-third of the work force -- would be a blow both economically and psychologically, employees say.
Pamela Sparks, 49, a 25-year Postal Service veteran in Baltimore, has a brother who is a letter carrier and a sister who is a sales associate at the Postal Service. Her father is a retired station manager.
''With our whole family working for the Post Office, it would be hard to help each other out because we'd all be out of work,'' Ms. Sparks said. ''It has afforded us a lot of things we needed to survive really, but this is one of the drawbacks.''
In Michigan, Valerie Kindle, 61, who was laid off in April as a state government employee, said the loss of her $50,000-a-year job with benefits had caused her to put off retirement. Instead, she is looking for work. Two relatives have also lost state government jobs recently.
''There hasn't been one family member who hasn't been touched by a layoff,'' Ms. Kindle said. ''We are losing the bulk of our middle class. I was much better off than my parents, and I'm feeling my children will not be as well off as I was. There's not as much government work and not as many manufacturing jobs. It's just going down so wrong for us. When I think about it I get frightened, so I try not to think about it.''
Mr. Buckley, the unemployed Chicago bus driver who now lives in his mother's basement, said his mother, a Postal Service employee, had grown tired of him ''eating up all her food.''
''She's ready for me to get up out of here,'' he said. In the meantime, Mr. Buckley says his life has drifted into the tedium of looking for decent-paying jobs that do not exist.
''I was living the American dream -- my version of the American dream,'' he said of his $23.76-an-hour job. ''Then it crumbled. They get you used to having things and then they take them away, and you realize how lucky you were.''

HEADLINE: A Jack-of-All-Trades (Well, Almost)

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF

 BODY:
You won't take homilies about fear from just anybody. What do they know of yours? But you will take them from a man who regularly gets out in front of an excellent band and six high-grade gospel singers, takes his position behind the central microphone and reveals that he has a very ordinary voice.
Kirk Franklin has been doing this since the mid-1990s, while pushing gospel and hip-hop together for a mass audience that has dwindled as his novelty has faded. 
In 1997, at his height, his New York appearance was a 20-night residency at the Beacon Theater; now it's one show at the Best Buy Theater, where he played on Sunday, the final stop of the North American leg of his ''Fearless'' tour.
He's still something to see. Mr. Franklin is one of the great overdriven factotum performers of American music, in the tradition of Cab Calloway, James Brown and Prince. Dancing, jumping, talking, joking, playing keyboards, cuing audio clips of Tony Bennett and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to serve his own ends, he manically controlled the flow and density of music and voice onstage, then stepped back to admire his own work.
His show blasted through several generations of gospel: the old hymn ''Blessed Assurance''; old-school Pentecostal shout choruses; his high-energy early hits; and recent iterations from his new album, ''Hello Fear,'' like ''Everyone Hurts,'' with roiling organ over slow and skeletal drum-machine beats, and ''Today,'' with bits of grandiosity borrowed from Coldplay and techno.
He passed very little time by preaching, though he did some of that too. He's an all-rounder, and a man for whom music is never free of business. He gives the impression that he's interested in many things equally: the promoter, the sound mix, the arrangements, the blocking of his dance movements, the set list, his entire aesthetic context. (''This building is owned by AEG,'' he reminded the audience, referring to the entertainment conglomerate. ''If you like the show, e-mail them and say, yes! Do more gospel shows!'') And, perhaps last in line, his voice.
But being honest about that shortcoming has become a kind of indirect gift to the audience; it's a key to understanding him.
''I can't sing, but I'm going to work hard for you to like me,'' he said at the beginning of the show, intoning ''The Story of Fear,'' a poem included on the new album.
Mr. Franklin kept returning to the well of challenges, real and imagined, pretending to try some melisma, mock-bragging that he taught his male backup singers everything they knew, referring to his own problems and others'.
''This song is dedicated to people like me: those who struggle with insecurities, self-acceptance and self-esteem,'' he said with confessional eyes before ''Imagine Me.'' He mentioned the recession more than he mentioned his new album.
His set was preceded by four young singers of indisputable talent: Deon Kippin, Jason Nelson, Isaac Carree and, finally, Amber Bullock, the most recent winner of ''Sunday Best,'' the gospel-singing contest hosted by Mr. Franklin that recently ended its fourth season on BET.
In Mr. Franklin's own set he repeatedly used his backup singers as the main event: Mr. Carree and Eric Moore on the right; Ms. Bullock, Charmaine Swimpson, Anaysha Figueroa and Nikki Ross on the left.
The women had their breakout moment in ''Don't Cry,'' a song from ''The Rebirth of Kirk Franklin,'' from 2002. They sang the refrain -- ''Don't cry/wipe your eye/He's not dead'' -- over and over, until the band dropped out, and they sang in delirious improvised counterpoint. Then, at Mr. Franklin's command, they each sang it individually and virtuosically.
Middle-aged, seated, undistracted by alcohol, some holding children in their laps, the members of this audience had a purpose; they weren't impressed by celebrity alone. They cheered Ms. Bullock's opening set when she showed her entire range (raw and penetrating at the top end, soft and husky in the low register, jazzlike runs in between), but not for any other reason. They fell almost completely quiet as soon as she left the stage.

HEADLINE: Nicaragua's Leader Rules Airwaves to Control Image

BYLINE: By BLAKE SCHMIDT

 BODY:
MANAGUA, Nicaragua -- The election this month in which President Daniel Ortega won a third term and a supermajority in Congress may have been marred by irregularities -- the European Union's electoral mission called the vote tally ''opaque and arbitrary,'' and observers were blocked from monitoring some polls -- but on most TV news channels, things looked different.
Video of flag-waving Ortega supporters flooding the streets and shooting off homemade explosives filled screens. One television anchor called the election a ''resounding victory'' as festivities were underscored by the governing party's rewrite of the song ''Stand by Me,'' despite Sony's demand that it be pulled for copyright infringement. ''Nicaragua is free and just wants jobs and peace,'' so the chorus goes. 
The jubilant imagery reflected one of Mr. Ortega's biggest accomplishments in the five years since he returned to power: his tightened grip on the news media.
He has bolstered investment in traditional Sandinista Party outlets like the television station Multinoticias and Radio Ya, while cutting government advertising in non-Sandinista outlets. The former revolutionary now controls nearly half of Nicaraguan TV news stations; his children run Multinoticias and Channels 8 and 13, and Channel 6 is state-run. He has also started two news Web sites.
Political analysts say that the media power has given Mr. Ortega a tool to discredit critics, and that the positive exposure helped him finish with 63 percent of the vote, according to official returns, up from his plurality of 38 percent in 2006.
''There was a fundamental shift in Ortega's image over five years, and one could argue that among contributing factors is his greater presence in the media,'' said Arturo Cruz, a political analyst at Managua's Incae Business School who served as Nicaragua's ambassador to Washington in Mr. Ortega's second term.
Mr. Ortega's allies already run the electoral council (which oversees elections) and dominate the courts, and this month's vote nearly doubled his party's seats in Congress to 62, a majority big enough to rewrite the Constitution and change the limits on re-election he has challenged through the judiciary. With the media now one of the last bastions of opposition, said Robert J. Callahan, who left his post as the American ambassador to Nicaragua in July, the Ortega family's growing influence recalls the way Anastasio Somoza used nepotism to control the economy before Mr. Ortega's Sandinistas overthrew his dictatorship in 1979.
''Nicaraguans call this Somocismo without Somoza,'' Mr. Callahan said, using a term that refers to Somoza's style of ruling through favoritism.
Mr. Ortega's chief spokeswoman, who is his wife, Rosario Murillo, did not respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Ortega has said right-wing ''oligarchs'' still have a stronghold in the media despite his advances. ''The forces of savage capitalism have TV stations and a monopoly on newspapers,'' he said in a speech in March.
He has had less success gaining control of newspapers, which have a smaller audience than TV and radio, especially among the half of Nicaragua's population that lives in poverty and those who struggle with illiteracy.
That is not for a lack of trying. Mr. Ortega's wife tried buying shares in El Nuevo Diario, one of the biggest newspapers in the country, after the government cut publicity that accounted for a quarter of the paper's advertising revenue. Negotiations fell through when another buyer entered the fray.
Many suspect that Venezuelan aid is behind the Sandinista media conquest. The manager of Albanisa, a joint energy venture between the Nicaraguan and Venezuelan state oil companies, was sent back to Venezuela after he told reporters that the company had bought Channel 8 last year for $10 million. The company denied the comments.
Tracing the Venezuelan money is difficult because Mr. Ortega has refused to include a five-year, $1.6 billion Venezuelan aid package in the budget, where it would face congressional oversight.
The Ortega outlets cast him in a light that is benign, or at least innocuous.
When Mr. Ortega cast his vote, non-Sandinista reporters were cordoned off, while those for Multinoticias on the scene asked him about the weather.
On Sandinista-favored outlets, the first lady releases poetic communiques and exclusive reports record debaucheries of Ortega critics. One report showed feminist opponents of an abortion ban sponsored by Mr. Ortega caught driving drunk after a ''girls only'' beach bash. Headlines describe Mr. Ortega's political rivals as ''parasites'' and ''promoters of death.''
Non-Sandinista reporters can face threats for their coverage of the government. One journalist, Silvia Gonzalez, fled the country in September, saying she had received death threats after reporting for El Nuevo Diario that soldiers may have killed a rebel in northern Nicaragua who opposed Mr. Ortega's re-election.
The Chamorro family, longtime foes of Mr. Ortega, come in for heavy scrutiny in his media.
The Chamorros run El Nuevo Diario and La Prensa, and La Prensa's former publisher Violeta Chamorro defeated Mr. Ortega in the 1990 presidential race. Mr. Ortega's government has investigated Ms. Chamorro's younger son, Carlos Fernando, over money laundering accusations and last year bought the television station that had been broadcasting his newsmagazine, ''Esta Semana,'' which often investigated accusations of Sandinista corruption.
In seeking another channel to broadcast his show, Mr. Chamorro found that other outlets -- including those owned by Angel Gonzalez, a Mexican media mogul whose stations are known for gentle treatment of the governing party -- would not have him. Eventually, Channel 12 picked up the show. ''There are outlets that aren't controlled by the Ortega family but are co-opted nonetheless,'' said Mr. Chamorro, a former Sandinista who became a journalist after Somoza gunmen assassinated his father, the editor of La Prensa, in 1978. ''All spaces for critical journalism are shrinking dramatically in Nicaragua.''

HEADLINE: A Setback for Electric Cars

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Even as they pour money into developing a range of electric vehicles, automakers have acknowledged that widespread sales of battery-powered models are years away.
Now a federal investigation into the Chevrolet Volt could make the pitch for the electric cars that much tougher.
General Motors said on Monday that it would offer free loaner cars to Volt owners worried about the safety of their vehicles, a move that underscored the fragile reputation of automobiles powered primarily by batteries and the growing consternation set off by the federal action. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Friday opened a formal defect investigation into the Volt after two batteries caught fire as part of testing by regulators. 
''Our customers' peace of mind is too important to us for there to be any concern or worry,'' Mark L. Reuss, head of G.M.'s North American division, said in announcing the offer of loaner cars. ''This technology should inspire confidence and pride, not raise any concern or doubt.''
G.M. executives defended the safety of the Volt's lithium-ion batteries, and said the loaners were being offered as a gesture of good will -- not because of safety concerns.
But the federal investigation represents an unexpected hurdle for the nascent technology. While the electric car market is in its infancy, more models are coming soon. And questions about their safety, whether proved real or otherwise, threaten to puncture the Volt's aura, auto analysts said.
Even some of the car's staunchest defenders acknowledged on Monday that questions raised about its safety were unsettling.
''The reality is that it does make me a little uneasy -- a little bit, a tiny bit,'' said Lyle Dennis, a New York neurologist and early owner who founded the Web site GM-Volt.com.
Electric models represent a fraction of the overall auto market. G.M. has sold 5,300 Volts since introducing the car a year ago -- the first plug-in electric vehicle to be mass-marketed by an American carmaker -- in late 2010, and the Japanese automaker Nissan has sold 7,200 all-electric Leafs in the first 10 months of this year. The specialty carmaker Tesla has sold about 2,000 electric cars since 2008. A total of 9.5 million new vehicles had been sold in the United States this year through October.
As other automakers plan to begin offering their own electric models next year, G.M. is expecting to substantially increase Volt production. The blitz of new electric cars is partly a response by the industry to substantially higher fuel-economy regulations enacted by the government. Most automakers will need a significant number of electric models in their fleets to achieve the target of 54 miles a gallon in 2025 proposed by the Obama administration.
Until now, the biggest drawbacks to buying an electric vehicle have been practical ones -- the limited driving range a battery provides, the need to charge cars overnight and prices that are higher than comparably equipped models powered by traditional engines.
G.M. believed it had an answer to range anxiety with the Volt, which travels under electric power but has a small gas engine that assists the battery on the go. However, some analysts said that the Volt investigation, regardless of its outcome, could cause fuel-conscious consumers to migrate toward the growing number of compact cars and gas-electric hybrids on the market.
''Consumers wary of the new electric vehicle technology have an array of less expensive, fuel-efficient options to choose from,'' said Bill Visnic, an analyst with the auto-research Web site Edmunds.com.
The focus of the Volt investigation has been the stability of its battery after an accident. In June, a fire occurred at a storage facility in Wisconsin after the Volt was crash-tested by federal regulators.
Then on Thursday, a Volt battery pack caught fire after being intentionally damaged a week earlier by N.H.T.S.A. officials. The agency has also said that another battery pack emitted smoke and sparks after a similar test.
The agency has said that there was no evidence of fire problems in real-world crashes involving the Volt.
''However, the agency is concerned that damage to the Volt's batteries as part of the three tests that are explicitly designed to replicate real-world crash scenarios have resulted in fire,'' the N.H.T.S.A. said in a statement.
The rechargeable lithium-ion batteries are optimal for energy storage and have been commonly used in consumer electronics. However, the chemistry of the batteries can be volatile when ruptured or overheated. While this is the first time car batteries have raised such concerns, millions of laptop computer batteries, also lithium ion, have been recalled in recent years because of the possibility of fire.
G.M.'s head of global product development, Mary T. Barra, said Monday that consumers were not in danger in the immediate aftermath of a collision. Rather, she said the bigger concern was what happened to the batteries in the days and weeks after an accident.
''We don't think there is an immediate fire risk,'' said Mrs. Barra. ''This is a postcrash activity.''
G.M. has sent its engineers to all accidents involving a Volt, she said. None of those incidents -- she said there were ''very few'' -- had resulted in a fire.
A pressing issue, Mrs. Barra said, is ensuring that batteries are de-powered by trained service personnel after a collision. ''When electrical energy is left in a battery, it's similar to having gasoline in a tank of a car that has been damaged,'' she said.
G.M. is working with federal regulators on the Volt tests.
Until the matter is resolved, G.M. will provide loaners to Volt owners wanting one, Mr. Reuss said. And the company is also contacting all owners ''to assure them and reassure them that our cars are safe to drive.''
One analyst said that G.M.'s decision to offer loaner cars was prudent given the level of media attention that the Volt investigation had generated.
''The stakes are very high with a new technology product, and that's just good customer service,'' said Eric Fedewa, an analyst with the research firm IHS Automotive. ''The fact is that good news travels slow, and bad news travels extremely fast.''

HEADLINE: Iran Moves to Downgrade Its Relations with Britain

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Artin Afkhami contributed reporting from Boston.

 BODY:
Iran enacted legislation on Monday to downgrade relations with Britain, in retaliation for intensified sanctions imposed by Western nations last week to punish the Iranians for their suspect nuclear development program. Britain promised to respond ''robustly.''
The Guardian Council, an Iranian clerical body that has oversight on bills passed by Parliament, unanimously endorsed a bill approved on Sunday to expel Britain's ambassador and reduce diplomatic contacts, Iranian news agencies reported. 
The council determined that the legislation was ''not in violation of Islamic principles or articles of the Iranian Constitution,'' the Fars News Agency quoted a council spokesman as saying.
The United States and the European Union imposed harsher sanctions on Iran on Nov. 21 after the United Nations' nuclear monitoring agency released a report on Nov. 8 that said Iran might be working on a nuclear weapon and missile delivery system.
Iran has denied those accusations and insists that its nuclear program is peaceful. It has called the United Nations report a false and shameful propaganda display done at the behest of the United States and its allies.
The sanctions imposed by Britain required that all contacts with the Iranian Central Bank be severed, a step that the United States has already taken.
Iranian lawmakers had signaled last week that they would move quickly to downgrade diplomatic ties with Britain. The Foreign Office in London responded to the passage of the bill on Sunday by calling the action ''regrettable.''
On Monday, William Hague, Britain's foreign secretary, told British lawmakers that ''if the Iranian government confirms its intention to act on this, we shall respond robustly in consultation with our international partners,'' news agencies reported from London.
The Guardian Council's speedy approval of the measure cleared the way for it to have the force of law and reflected Iran's deepening anger over the sanctions.
Under the terms, Britain's ambassador, Dominick John Chilcott, must leave Tehran within two weeks, according to a report on the legislation by Press TV, a state-run English-language news site in Iran.
Iranian anger at the West was also evident in news reports on Monday that Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, had been forced to cancel a trip to The Hague because Hungary had refused permission for his aircraft to cross its airspace.
It was not immediately clear why Hungary had taken such a step. Mr. Salehi is not on a list of Iranian officials who are banned from travel to the European Union under the current sanctions. Iran state television said the Hungarian ambassador had been asked for an explanation. Mr. Salehi had planned to attend a United Nations conference on the prohibition of chemical weapons.
Concern that Iran may be close to producing a nuclear weapon has grown since the release of the United Nations report, particularly in Israel, which considers Iran its most dangerous enemy. Iranian warnings to Israel against attempting a pre-emptive military strike on Iran's nuclear installations have also escalated in recent weeks.
The heightened sensitivities to the possibility of such a strike were apparent on Monday when a few Iranian news agencies reported on a suspected explosion near the central city of Isfahan, where the Iranians process uranium. The accounts of a blast being heard in the city were skimpy and contradictory, but that did not stop the Israeli news media from leading their evening broadcasts with the news. It was also the top item on the Web site of Haaretz, a major Israeli newspaper, with the headline ''Report: Explosion rocks Iran city of Isfahan, home to key nuclear facility.''

HEADLINE: Crisis in Europe Tightens Credit Across the Globe

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; Reporting was contributed by Jack Ewing, Keith Bradsher, Stephen Castle and Sara Hamdan.

 BODY:
Europe's worsening sovereign debt crisis has spread beyond its banks and the spillover now threatens businesses on the Continent and around the world.
From global airlines and shipping giants to small manufacturers, all kinds of companies are feeling the strain as European banks pull back on lending in an effort to hoard capital and shore up their balance sheets.
The result is a credit squeeze for companies from Berlin to Beijing, edging the world economy toward another slump.
The deteriorating situation in the euro zone prompted the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on Monday to project that the United States economy would grow at a 2 percent rate next year, down from a forecast of 3.1 percent growth in May. It also lowered its economic outlook for Europe and the rest of the world, and a credit contraction could exacerbate the slowdown. 
In addition, Moody's Investors Service, the credit-rating agency, on Monday raised the possibility of mass downgrades of European government debt if a forceful resolution to the escalating crisis was not found.
Investors have begun to treat Europe's big banks as the weak link in the global financial chain because of their huge holdings of bonds issued by debt-laden governments like Italy and Spain.
American money market funds have been closing the spigot of money they lend to European banks, forcing them to tighten lending standards and, in some cases, even withdraw financing from longtime customers. To make matters worse, European institutions are simultaneously under pressure from their regulators to hold more capital for each dollar they lend, prompting many banks to reduce their portfolio of loans. Analysts say Europe's banks could shed up to 3 trillion euros of loans over the next few years, equal to about 10 percent of their total assets.
''If your largest banks aren't able to provide credit, it hinders economic development and contributes to a recession,'' said Alex Roever, a fixed-income research analyst at JPMorgan Chase.
Air France, for example, typically relied on French banks like BNP Paribas and Societe Generale to help it finance about 15 percent of what it spends to purchase airplanes. Now those banks are retreating from making airline loans to save capital.
As an alternative, Air France officials say that they started developing closer ties with Chinese and Japanese banks, which have not faced the same pressure as their euro zone counterparts, to help pick up the slack.
Executives of Emirates Airlines, based in Dubai, are turning to the Islamic financing system, as well as to lenders in emerging markets, to help pay for its new fleet as some of the European banks shut off lending. Emirates has ordered 243 aircraft, worth more than $84 billion, from Airbus, Boeing and other aerospace companies.
''We were kind of planning for finance from the European banks,'' Tim Clark, president of Emirates, told Reuters. ''It's just a bit difficult now.''
A failure to secure financing could quickly add up to lost jobs in the United States, Latin America and elsewhere.
The airplane maker Boeing recently warned that a European pullback could affect its business next year. With some European banks out of the picture, ''this leaves a difference that must be made up by other sources if airplane deliveries across the industry, already set to increase in 2012, are to occur as planned,'' said John Kvasnosky, a spokesman for the company.
Embraer, a Brazilian aerospace company, tempered its growth expectations despite having a pickup in commercial and business jet sales in the third quarter.
''This whole situation in Europe again has stalled this recovery process,'' said Frederico Curado, chief executive of Embraer, in a conference call with investors in early November. ''The way we see the world going forward is of a moderate growth.''
It remains to be seen, though, whether even moderate growth can be achieved. Moody's cautioned that there was an increased chance that more than one country in the euro zone could default. In spite of that warning, investors put their fears aside and sent stocks up Monday by nearly 3 percent in New York.
Investors remain hesitant about government bond offerings, though. A tepid auction in Germany last week was particularly unnerving since its economy has long been seen as Europe's financial bulwark. In Italy, weak demand for bonds pushed yields back above the critical 7 percent threshold, a level that has prompted other government borrowers to seek bailouts.
Higher interest rates on government debt quickly translate into higher borrowing costs for European banks, and in turn, for local companies and consumers in need of loans. Meanwhile, those banks' own costs are also rising because the dollars they need to lend are in short supply.
So the banks are tightening their lending standards, squeezing businesses like airlines, shipping companies and exporters of oil, steel and food staples -- industries that are critical to the health of the world economy.
''The strains and stress are increasing,'' said Dirk Schumacher, a senior European economist at Goldman Sachs. ''Funding conditions for corporations will get tougher going forward.''
One sign of this strain is that European lenders are quietly withdrawing from big infrastructure projects, like power plants and water developments, especially in the Middle East. Just this month, the $10 billion Barzan gas project in Qatar secured financing from 31 lenders, but three of the biggest French banks -- BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and Natixis -- were notably absent.
''These guys are usually very active and this is a material sign that European lenders are holding back,'' said Khalid Howladar, an analyst at Moody's.
Large shipping companies are finding fewer lenders, too. Only a few years ago, Europe's biggest banks were clamoring to supply credit at very attractive terms. Now, as freight rates collapse amid a global slowdown, those banks are tightening their purse strings. Frontline Ltd., an oil tanker giant in financial straits, said last week that it had lined up financing for only two of the seven vessels it planned to build.
The economic fallout from a global decline in shipbuilding affects not only the workers at the dry docks but also hundreds of businesses that supply parts and raw material to the industry. In Germany, for example, more than 5,000 people have lost their jobs in major ports like Hamburg, Kiel and Rostock, according to a local trade group.
Smaller companies are also struggling to secure credit. In Ireland, a survey by the local Small and Medium Enterprises Association found that 58 percent of companies that had approached banks for loans were turned down.
''We have many, many businesses that are viable, but the banks are not lending to them in the short term,'' said Mark Fielding, its chief executive.
In Eastern Europe, where Western European banks have retrenched, leaders are sounding alarms. Traian Basescu, president of Romania, accused Austrian regulators of ''choking the Romanian economy'' after they ordered banks to limit lending outside its borders.
In Hungary, new construction for shopping centers and other commercial developments has come to a halt. Nora Demeter, an architect in Budapest, said her 20-member firm had already laid off a handful of employees and was likely to make further cuts. ''The chance of getting a major project off the ground in this country is virtually over,'' Ms. Demeter said. She added that ''2012 is looking even bleaker.''
Even companies as far away as China are being hurt by Europe's economic slowdown. Jacky Xu, the sales manager of the Yongkang Wanyu Industry and Trade Company in eastern China, said European orders for its scooters, skateboards and other children's toys were down 20 to 30 percent this fall from a year ago. Several months ago, his company stopped accepting letters of credit from Greek banks, forcing Greek retailers to put down cash deposits of around 30 percent for new orders -- a move that will worsen the decline.
''There are fewer people coming by from Europe,'' he said.

HEADLINE: For New Coach at Ohio State, It's First Down and $4 Million

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

 BODY:
Ohio State University hired Urban Meyer as its football coach Monday, giving him one of the richest contracts ever in college sports -- the latest indication that the big business of college football is undeterred by the nation's broader economic woes or by concern about the prominence of sports on campus.
The contract includes $4 million in base salary, bonuses -- for everything from players' graduation rates to playing in a national championship, up to $700,000 annually -- and lump payments in 2014, 2016 and 2018. The deal is worth more than three times the $1.32 million that the university's president, E. Gordon Gee, made in 2010, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.
Mr. Meyer and Ohio State reached the lucrative deal amid a chaotic year in college athletics. The University of Miami was rocked by a report that a donor lavished football players with gifts for years; and longtime assistants for the Penn State football and Syracuse men's basketball teams are facing allegations that they sexually abused young boys. Several other prominent programs are being investigated by college athletics' governing body, the N.C.A.A., for myriad violations. 
Even the Buckeyes await potential N.C.A.A. sanctions because players traded memorabilia for cash and tattoos, which led to the ouster of Jim Tressel as their coach six months ago.
Still, the college football arms race shows no signs of slowing. To replace Mr. Tressel, Ohio State will invest at least $26.65 million over six years in Mr. Meyer, 47, who won two national championships at Florida. That will include an annual automobile stipend, a golf club membership, 50 hours of private jet use and 12 tickets to each home game.
''It's symbolic of the condition we're in,'' said William C. Friday, the president of the University of North Carolina system from 1956 to 1986. ''There's an unrestrained salary march, where universities are trying to superimpose an entertainment industry on an academic structure. Any salary in that range is excessive.''
Even Mr. Gee, the university president who hired Mr. Meyer on Monday, has described the system as broken. In an interview with The New York Times in August, he said: ''College athletics has gotten beyond itself. Do I think it's broken? Yes.''
On Monday, Mr. Gee called Mr. Meyer's contract ''a mark of our dignity and nobility.''
''I'm not certain I've ever made as much as a football coach,'' Mr. Gee said in a telephone interview. ''We live in a world of markets and opportunities. A number of surgeons here make more than I do. I'm about having the best physics faculty, the best medical school faculty and the best football coach.''
Mr. Friday was a co-founder of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics. He watched as shoe companies paid large sums to coaches, as broadcast deals boomed. What Mr. Friday called the ''invasion of money for commercial television'' started about 10 years ago, he said.
Now, by any financial measure, college football has never been more prosperous. Five sports conferences have signed billion-dollar broadcast deals, fueled by the popularity of football.
In the Pacific-12 Conference, where games were once shown on national networks and local channels, officials have decided to create six regional networks instead. The template: the network for the Big Ten Conference, which includes Ohio State. The Big Ten network, according to SNL Kagan, a research firm, earned $227.1 million for the conference in 2010.
Contracts for college football coaches have increased at a similarly rapid pace. If Mr. Meyer reaches his benchmarks for bonuses, he will be among -- and may even surpass -- the upper echelon of college football coaches: Mack Brown at Texas, Nick Saban at Alabama, Bob Stoops at Oklahoma and Les Miles at Louisiana State.
Mr. Gee said that according to Ohio State's data on college football coaches' salaries, Mr. Meyer would rank fourth among his peers, emphasizing that much of Mr. Meyer's bonuses is tied to academics and his staying at O.S.U. for all six years.
An analysis this month by USA Today found the average salary for a major college head coach jumped nearly 55 percent in the past six seasons, to $1.47 million this year from $950,000 in 2006. This season, according to the analysis, 64 coaches made at least $1 million, with three over $4 million and Mr. Brown of Texas over $5 million, making him the highest-compensated coach.
For David Ridpath, a professor of sports administration at Ohio University and a member of the Drake Group, a network of professors who lobby for academic integrity in college sports, this represents far more than the going rate, which is the typical justification used by universities.
''We've long gone past anything that's reasonable,'' he said. ''If you put too much value on a program, it starts to swallow the university. It starts to guide the moral compass. Soon, a coach is going to make $10 million a year. There's just no stopping it.''
Early in his career, Mr. Meyer worked as a graduate assistant at Ohio State, starting in 1986. The coach who hired him, Earle Bruce, reportedly earned $87,000 a year. Now, despite the increase, the Buckeyes believe Mr. Meyer is worth every penny of his contract.
His decorated coaching resume includes a 104-23 record in 10 seasons as the coach at Bowling Green, Utah and Florida. He holds a 7-1 record in bowl games and a 4-0 mark in Bowl Championship Series games.
Citing health concerns, Mr. Meyer said he was retiring from coaching in December 2009. A day later, he said he would continue coaching. After the 2010 season, he again announced his retirement, citing family reasons. He has spent this season as an analyst for ESPN.
A native of Ashtabula, Ohio, Mr. Meyer returns to right the state's most prominent program. Ohio State, with the 100,000-plus fans who pack its stadium for home games, with college football as its cash machine, sputtered to a 6-6 record this season under the interim coach Luke Fickell and lost to its rival Michigan for the first time since 2003.
At his news conference Monday, Mr. Meyer said he felt ''fantastic'' and had learned from his time away from coaching.
While Meyer was being hired, several coaches at major programs have been fired in the past few days, including Turner Gill (Kansas), Dennis Erickson (Arizona State), Rick Neuheisel (U.C.L.A.) and Ron Zook (Illinois). Gill is owed roughly $6 million.
''Some schools want to pay their coach more than anybody else,'' said Dick Tomey, who made $35,000 in 1977 in his first head-coaching job at Hawaii, where he is now an assistant. ''That's part of it. But that adds to the pressure, which is why you see a lot of guys losing their jobs.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 30, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Tuesday with the continuation of an article about Ohio State's hiring of Urban Meyer as football coach misidentified the game and the year in which Meyer faced Jim Tressel when Meyer coached at Florida and Tressel was at Ohio State. Meyer won the Bowl Championship Series national title game against Ohio State in 2007, not the Fiesta Bowl in 2008. The caption also misidentified the coach Meyer succeeded at Ohio State. It was the interim coach Luke Fickell, who replaced Tressel in May after Tressel resigned in the wake of an N.C.A.A. investigation. Meyer did not succeed Tressel.

HEADLINE: A Natural Diversion

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Sales of electronics and their gear in airports have gone from little more than an afterthought a few years ago to a rapidly growing presence.
Electronics ''fit the airport market really well,'' said Bruce Boudreau, a director of LeighFisher, airport consultants in Burlingame, Calif. ''There are lots of business travelers, lots of tech-savvy people who are looking to try new things or replace things they already have. They might need batteries, want to replace their headphones, kill time or reward themselves for a good idea or a good business trip.''
One retailer, APW Brands, plans to open a new type of store next year where employees will wear electronic nametags with multimedia displays to demonstrate equipment to customers. Next year, too, OTG Management plans to rent iPads to travelers for their tripsand sell downloadable content for the iPads. The Paradies Shops, which operates a variety of branded stores like Brooks Brothers and newsstands at airports,has joined forces with the video game company Electronic Arts on a new retail concept. 
Mark Knight, president of Airmall USA, an airport retail developer owned by Prospect Capital, a private equity company, said sales volumes of electronics retailers at airports exceeded sales volumes of retailers specializing in items like clothing or gifts. Electronics are ''hot in their sales performance,'' he said, ''because they have such broad appeal and are constantly changing. They've got natural, built-in momentum.''
Mr. Knight also said that electronics retailing was a natural fit for airports because the merchandise, which is usually not large, could be sold in ''small, efficient settings,'' like carts and shops that are essentially cubbyholes. Although some electronics stores are outside of security checkpoints, most stores are near the gates, thus providing a diversion for travelers waiting for their flights.
Mr. Boudreau said prices charged for electronics at airports were typically equal to or within 10 percent of prices at retailers elsewhere.
The largest retailer of electronics at airports is InMotion Entertainment, which started out renting DVD players in 1999 and now operates 68 stores at 33 airports in the United States. Their stores go under the names of InMotion Entertainment, which sells a wide variety of electronics and accessories; Soundbalance, which offers environmentally friendly products like solar-powered batteries; and BlackBerry Store from Wireless Giant, which sells BlackBerry merchandise.
APW Brands, based in Wellington, Fla., began in 1997 as a cart at Philadelphia International Airport, where the founder, Iris Goldschmidt, sold cellphones. The company now operates 15 TechShowcase and 20 Airport Wireless stores in about 20 airports in the United States. The Airport Wireless stores offer a wider selection of equipment and accessories than TechShowcase. The company has a joint venture with InMotion Entertainment on Soundbalance stores, and also operates Tech in a Sec carts at several airports.
APW Brands' newest retail concept, Tech Interaction, is scheduled to open at airports in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Baltimore early next year. Customers will be able to research their electronics needs on touch screens on store walls, examine merchandise and try out equipment like headphones.
Bluwire, which has been in business since 2007, has 12 outlets in eight airports. Christopher Burden, Bluewire's co-chief executive, said headphones were his company's best-selling item. ''If you spend $700 on an iPad, you want to enjoy it with a suitable pair of headphones,'' he said.
Another electronics retailer, Brookstone, has stores at 50 airports in the United States. Don Eames, Brookstone's vice president of retail stores, said half the stores' merchandise was electronics-related. He also said the category was the ''fastest-growing part'' of Brookstone's business, with items like iPhone cases and a roll-up keyboard among top sellers.
Zoom Systems, based in San Francisco, operates Best Buy Express vending machines in most of the 50 largest airports. The machines sell 60 to 70 items carried by the retailer, including the Apple iPod Touch and Nano.
Several companies also cater to the current demand for Apple's iPad and similar devices. OTG Management will open OTG Media Bars at its Cibo Express Gourmet Markets in Delta's Concourse G in Terminal 1 at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport next year.Travelers will be able to rent an iPad or pay to download content for their own iPad; rentals, available for a minimum of one day, will start at $29.95. Virgin America, which offers Wi-Fi on all flights, in July began giving passengers on certain flights the option to try, free, a Google Chromebook at the gate or in flight. This promotion ends Jan. 15.
Even airport newsstand specialists sell electronics and accessories. In September, the Paradies Shops opened an EA Sports Experience store at Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina where customers could play with and purchase Electronics Arts video games and other merchandise. Two more are scheduled to open this month. In addition, all Hudson Group newsstands carry chargers and other accessories, while the largest offer a wider selection of merchandise. The company also operates three freestanding Tech on the Go electronics stores at airports.
''This is a category that simply did not exist for us even a couple of years ago,'' said Michael S. Levy, senior vice president of merchandising for the Hudson Group.
Duty-free stores at major airports worldwide outside the United States -- run by companies like DFS Group, Dufry, Nuance Group and World Duty Free -- also sell consumer electronics free of local taxes and import duties to departing international passengers. Mr. Boudreau said the decision to buy at these stores should be based on a comparison of prices at the airport and at the traveler's place of residence, where local taxes could be imposed. Savings can be considerable for travelers from high-tax countries like those in the European Union and Brazil, where local taxes can add as much as 40 percent to some items.
Mr. Knight of Airmall said electronics retailing at airports was somewhat recession-proof because the income level of many travelers was typically higher than that of the general population, which ''mitigates some of the impact of general economic conditions.''
But Kerry Moyer, senior director of retail membership for the Consumer Electronics Association, a trade group, cautioned that retailers had to be careful with what they offered. ''If it's an impulse purchase that satisfies an immediate need, people won't hesitate spending $50 or $100,'' he said. ''If you have something that's priced too high, say over $200, then they might hesitate and think about it.''

HEADLINE: Woman Claims Affair With Cain, and He Denies It

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
An Atlanta woman came forward in an interview broadcast Monday night with details about what she called a 13-year affair with Herman Cain, the Republican presidential contender whose campaign was already struggling to overcome damage from accusations of sexual harassment.
The woman, Ginger White, made the disclosure in an interview with Fox 5 News in Atlanta, becoming the fifth person to accuse Mr. Cain of improper behavior. Ms. White is not, however, claiming that harassment took place. Rather, she described what amounted, in her words, to a romance. 
''It was pretty simple,'' Ms. White said. ''It wasn't complicated. I was aware that he was married. And I was also aware I was involved in a very inappropriate situation, relationship.''
Ms. White showed the news station some of her cellphone bills that included 61 phone calls or text messages to and from a number she said was for Mr. Cain's private cellphone. The contacts were made during four different months -- as early as 4:26 a.m. and as late as 7:52 p.m. The most recent were in September.
The television station said that it had sent a text message to the number Ms. White gave it and that Mr. Cain had returned the call. In the call, Mr. Cain said that he ''knew Ginger White'' and that she had his number because he was ''trying to help her financially.''
Mr. Cain, speaking on Monday afternoon to Wolf Blitzer on CNN, acknowledged knowing Ms. White, whom he called an acquaintance, but denied having a sexual relationship with her.
''I have nothing to hide,'' he said. ''I did nothing wrong.''
Asked directly by Mr. Blitzer, ''Was this an affair?'' Mr. Cain responded, ''It was not.''
The accusations come as Mr. Cain's standing has been falling in recent polls with his campaign battling not only the earlier accusations of sexual misconduct but also the reaction to the candidate's trouble answering questions on subjects like President Obama's handling of the conflict in Libya.
In her interview, Ms. White told Fox 5 News that Mr. Cain had showered her with gifts and flown her around the country to meet him at various engagements after they met in the late 1990s in Louisville, Ky., when Mr. Cain was president of the National Restaurant Association.
After that first meeting, Ms. White said, she and Mr. Cain had drinks, and he invited her back to his hotel room, where they planned their next meeting. It went on like this for years, she said, until Mr. Cain began to seriously consider the presidency. She said their sexual relationship ended about eight months ago.
Ms. White said she came forward after seeing how Mr. Cain, a businessman who lives in Atlanta, treated the women who had accused him of harassment.
''It bothered me that they were being demonized,'' Ms. White said. ''I felt bad for them.''
She said she also ''felt trapped,'' after a tipster alerted the local Fox station about her and other news outlets began to call.
''I wanted to give my side before it was thrown out there and made out to be something filthy,'' Ms. White said. ''Some people will look at this and say that is exactly what it is. I'm sorry for that.''
A lawyer for Mr. Cain, L. Lin Wood, released a statement about Ms. White's claim on Monday night. ''This appears to be an accusation of private, alleged consensual conduct between adults -- a subject matter which is not a proper subject of inquiry by the media or the public,'' he said.
Ms. White is an unemployed single mother. Before the interview, Fox learned that she had filed a sexual harassment claim against an employer in 2001. That case was settled. The station also found a bankruptcy filing nearly 23 years ago in Kentucky, and several eviction notices in the Atlanta area over the past six years.
The station also reported that Ms. White had a former business partner who once sought a ''stalking temporary protective order'' against her for ''repeated e-mails/texts threatening lawsuit and defamation of character.'' The case was dismissed, but it was followed by a libel lawsuit against Ms. White. A judge entered an order against Ms. White because she failed to respond to the lawsuit, Fox reported.
Mr. Cain went on CNN on Monday afternoon to pre-emptively address Ms. White's claims, saying, ''I want to give you a heads-up and everyone a heads-up.''
Mr. Cain took a nonchalant attitude in his attempt to get ahead of the story, saying he was not concerned for himself or his reputation. ''I am more worried that this is going to hurt my wife and my family,'' he said. ''I can take the lumps.''
He refused to go into any detail about Ms. White, and also told Mr. Blitzer that he had already informed his wife, whose response was, ''Here we go again.''
Accusations of sexual harassment against Mr. Cain began surfacing at the beginning of this month, all dating from the years that he ran the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s. Mr. Cain has repeatedly denied the allegations.
Asked on CNN whether he would consider dropping out of the race, as his campaign has been in crisis mode and off its message for weeks now, Mr. Cain said, ''We're going to stay focused on this campaign.''

HEADLINE: Gingrich Wields History, Seeking To Add Chapter

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Newt Gingrich is a historian. He earned a Ph.D. in history. If you've forgotten, he'll remind you.
During a six-candidate forum in Iowa recently, Mr. Gingrich dropped in references to the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, Capt. John Smith's leadership of Jamestown, the French Revolution and, as a bonus, the Latin root of ''secular.''
A few days earlier, as guests at a fund-raising breakfast forked into slabs of coffeecake, Mr. Gingrich told a lengthy anecdote about John Quincy Adams.
And in New Hampshire before that, he referred at a Tea Party forum to the Louisiana Purchase, Thomas Jefferson's abolition of federal judgeships and, again, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. 
Mr. Gingrich taught college history before entering politics, and his historical references on the campaign trail are such a feature of his public remarks as to be nearly a rhetorical tic. They strike some as evidence that Mr. Gingrich is the smartest candidate in the room -- and others that he is a man determined to let you know how much he knows.
In an election season rife with factual misstatements, deliberate and otherwise, Mr. Gingrich sometimes seems to stand out for exhibiting an excess of knowledge. It is hard to imagine him not knowing that the Battle of Lexington and Concord took place in Massachusetts, not New Hampshire, where Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota located it this year.
But in some ways Mr. Gingrich seems not just to know history, but to think of himself very self-consciously as part of it, and not always in a small way. In an interview with The New York Times in 2009, he said he subscribed to the historian Arnold J. Toynbee's theory of ''departure and return,'' the notion that certain great leaders must endure a long political exile before returning to power. He indicated that Charles de Gaulle, the French general who became president only after years out of power, was a role model.
''Some people say he sounds arrogant. I see it as confidence,'' said Josh Byrnes, an Iowa state representative who threw his support to Mr. Gingrich after he spoke at his daughter's school. ''I think what Newt's doing, he's using historical lessons to take on this current situation we're in.''
Mr. Gingrich's deep identification with this role was highlighted recently when he said in a debate that Freddie Mac, the home mortgage giant, had hired him as a ''historian,'' not a lobbyist, as it fought off government regulators before the financial crisis.
When it came out that Mr. Gingrich had earned as much as $1.8 million from Freddie Mac, he was mocked by liberal critics as the best-paid historian ever.
At a forum on Monday night in Charleston, Mr. Gingrich fingered his lapel pin and said it represented George Washington's campaign flag, with ''13 stars on a gold background representing the 13 states.''
Fellow historians are generally pleased that Mr. Gingrich brings history into the national conversation, even if some dispute his insights. Last year, he said he agreed with a controversial essay linking President Obama to a ''Kenyan, anti-colonial'' world view. On Conservativenet, a listserv of historians, Prof. Lawrence Squeri of East Stroudsburg State wrote the other day, ''I always did feel that Gingrich should have stayed in academia, conducting seminars that would make students rave or fume and send impassioned posts to the Rate My Professors Web site.''
Mr. Gingrich has been out of power since quitting Congress under pressure in 1998, but has surged in recent polls, and he is fond of citing historical crucibles to dramatize the stakes he sees for the 2012 election. In South Carolina this month, he said the country was facing a ''choice comparable, I think, to 1860 and it may be comparable in some ways to 1788,'' a brainy reference, apparently, to the year the Constitution was debated and ratified.
Mr. Gingrich reminded the same audience, ''I studied American history'' and offered a lengthy back story to the Lincoln-Douglas debates. ''In 1858, Stephen Douglas was the most famous man in the United States Senate,'' he began.
The Civil War era is one he often comes back to. He and a co-author have written three counterfactual historical novels, beginning with ''Gettysburg,'' in which Pickett's charge succeeds and the Lost Cause is redeemed.
''Every politician believes he can be president,'' said Richard Brookhiser, the author of biographies of James Madison and George Washington. ''Because Gingrich is also interested in history, he has it to an unusual degree, so naturally he sees himself in this progression of titans.''
While stumping, he frequently mentions his academic career, often to contrast his Main Street credentials teaching at West Georgia College (now the University of West Georgia) with Mr. Obama's elite education at Columbia and Harvard Law School.
Mr. Gingrich's Ph.D. is from Tulane. His dissertation was on ''Belgian Education Policy in the Congo: 1945-1960.''
While teaching history and environmental science for eight years at West Georgia College, Mr. Gingrich ran unsuccessfully for Congress twice; he succeeded on his third attempt in 1978.
As House speaker, a history course he taught by satellite television was the focus of an ethics investigation in which he was fined $300,000. He was found to have misused money from a political action committee to underwrite the course, ''Renewing American Civilization.'' In the inquiry, a document emerged from the conservative scholar James Q. Wilson offering feedback on the course. ''It is bland, vague, hortatory and lacking in substance,'' Dr. Wilson wrote about a chapter he had been asked to review by a Gingrich aide.
''Historically, it does not represent Adam Smith correctly,'' he added. ''The Founders are also treated somewhat cavalierly. It is true that George Washington spoke often of the importance of virtue, but he didn't write the Constitution; Madison and a few others did.''
Professional historians are divided in their assessments of Mr. Gingrich's analysis of the past.
He has called for the abolition of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which many Republicans detest for its liberal rulings, citing the precedent of Jefferson's repeal of the Judiciary Act of 1801, which eliminated some federal courts.
''If something happened once 200 years ago, to what extent is that really a precedent?'' said Geoffrey Kabaservice, the author of a coming book, ''Rule and Ruin,'' on the decline of Republican moderates since the 1950s.
''My problem with Gingrich as an historian,'' Mr. Kabaservice added, ''is that history's a big grab bag. You can find precedents for anything you want in there. Gingrich's approach to history is like his approach to politics -- sloppy, undisciplined, occasionally brilliant, but more often missing the mark.''
Sean Wilentz, the Princeton historian, said in an interview, ''I have a weakness for any public figure who talks about history in any way that is at all serious.''
''I find the Speaker is serious,'' said Professor Wilentz, who has written books about Andrew Jackson and the age of Ronald Reagan. ''I don't find him profound in any way.''
Well, Back in the 1780s . . . Asked this month at a family values forum in Iowa about the link between happiness and religious piety, and why he was under attack from the left, Newt Gingrich digressed into American and French history during the late 1700s: ''The pursuit of happiness in the 18th-century Enlightenment meant wisdom and virtue. The 1780s said -- the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 to organize Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin says religion, morality and knowledge being important, we need schools. It was the Pelosi House that cut off the first three words and said, 'knowledge being important.' None of the founding fathers would have said that education without character is useful. They would have said it is in fact dangerous. What you have today is an outgrowth of the French Revolution -- Gertrude Himmelfarb's brilliant book on three Enlightenments captures it perfectly. The French Revolution was an anticlerical, anti-God rejection of the larger world in favor of secularism. It has dominated our academic world -- our academic world supplies our news media, and our courts and Hollywood, and so you have a faction in America today which believes things which are profoundly wrong. Now that is a fight; it is not a passivity.''

HEADLINE: The Ad Campaign: Democrats Take Aim at Romney's Shifts

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
The Democratic National Committee on Monday escalated its effort to define Mitt Romney, seeking the Republican nomination for president in 2012, as a flip-flopper with a new ad in five battleground states. Called ''Trapped,'' it is styled as a parody of a sci-fi movie trailer for ''the story of two men trapped in one body.''
THE SCRIPT 
A man's ominously urgent voice announces, ''From the creator of 'I'm running for office, for Pete's sake' '' -- a line Mr. Romney delivered during a recent Republican debate - ''comes the story of two men trapped in one body, 'Mitt versus Mitt.''' A younger Mr. Romney appears in a video clip, saying with emphasis, ''I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose.'' Another clip shows a slightly gray-haired Romney saying, ''The right next step is to see Roe v. Wade overturned.'' The never-seen narrator pronounces, ''Two Mitts willing to say anything.''
Segue to two more video snatches of Mr. Romney. In the first, predating passage of President Obama's health care law, Mr. Romney refers to the Massachusetts law he signed as governor, which created an insurance policy exchange with coverage options for the uninsured. ''We've put together an exchange and the president's copying that idea. I'm glad to hear that,'' he says. In the second, post-enactment, he says, ''Obamacare is bad news,'' punching the air with each word for emphasis. The narrator intones, ''See it all at Mittvmitt.com.''
ON THE SCREEN
The screen is dark throughout and slashed repeatedly by light flashes or the written words of the narrator, in the manner of special effects. As he says, ''The story of two men,'' two head shots of Mr. Romney appear, one black and white, the other in color; as he continues, ''trapped in one body,'' the Romneys collide into one shaky blur of the man. Next, profiles of Mr. Romney bookend the screen, seeming to stare each other down as a fireball explodes between them with the words ''Mitt vs. Mitt'' both spoken and written. The phrases ''pro-choice'' and ''anti-choice,'' ''pro-health care'' and ''anti-health care'' appear beside the pertinent videos of Mr. Romney speaking.
ACCURACY
The ad is mostly accurate, underscoring the central weakness of Mr. Romney's candidacy - the contradictory positions he has taken on a variety of issues during his campaigns for governor and the United States Senate in Massachusetts, and during his runs for the 2008 and 2012 Republican presidential nominations. Those positions are preserved in video archives now being mined by his opposition in both parties.
One quibble could be made about the ad's health insurance section. It focuses on the fact that both Mr. Romney's Massachusetts law and Mr. Obama's federal statute created an insurance exchange where consumers could shop for coverage policies. But Mr. Romney's attacks on what Republicans call ''Obamacare'' have mainly focused on its mandate that individuals buy coverage, not on the exchanges. Yet Mr. Romney is not in a position to complain: He has been on both sides of the individual mandate issue, too.
In response, a Romney campaign spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, did not address the ad's particulars. In an e-mail, Ms. Saul criticized Mr. Obama's job-creation record, and said, ''Instead of focusing on the economy and creating jobs, President Obama and Democrats are focused on tearing down Mitt Romney.''
SCORECARD
The Democratic National Committee would not disclose how much airtime it has bought for the 31-second ad in five battleground-state cities - Albuquerque; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; Columbus, Ohio; Pittsburgh; and Milwaukee. It did not buy much; the ad will run just this week and not often enough to reach unengaged voters. Indeed, like a movie trailer, the ad is intended to draw plugged-in partisans to the full-length (four-minute) feature on a new Web site, Mittvmitt.com. Links will also go to millions of Americans by e-mail, Twitter and Facebook, underscoring the Internet's value to election campaigns in defining races for would-be supporters.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Obama Meets Leaders Of the European Union

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama met with top European Union leaders as the euro zone sovereign debt crisis entered a perilous new phase, with increasing worries about the sustainability of the 17-country monetary union and borrowing costs climbing to new peaks.
Again, he urged an immediate resolution to the debt crisis, saying the issue is ''hugely important'' for the United States but stressing that the answer to Europe's problems lies in Europe. 
The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, told reporters, ''We continue to believe that this is a European issue, that Europe has the resources and capacity to deal with it, and that they need to act decisively and conclusively to resolve this problem.''
Mr. Obama met Monday with Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission; Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council; and Catherine Ashton, the European foreign policy chief.
The summit meeting came as the United States received a reminder of its own debt woes. Fitch Ratings lowered the country's ratings outlook to negative from stable, though it maintained its sterling AAA grade for United States debt.
Fitch had said in August that a failure by the special bipartisan committee in Congress on deficit reduction would probably result in a negative rating.
Senior Obama administration officials describe a two-pronged policy response, expected to last for months, to the European crisis. First, in numerous private conversations and increasingly forceful public statements, policy makers are urging their European counterparts to take big steps and move fast to reassure markets. Second, Washington is increasing efforts to shelter American institutions from European turbulence.
President Obama and his policy team have said that there is no greater threat to the fragile American recovery than a contracting and destabilized Europe -- a belief repeated on Monday.
''I communicated to them that the United States stands ready to do our part to help them resolve this issue,'' Mr. Obama said. ''If Europe is contracting, or if Europe is having difficulties, then it's much more difficult for us to create good jobs here at home.''
On Monday, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned thatthe euro crisis was a drag on global economic growth. ''Decisive policies must be urgently put in place to stop the euro area sovereign debt crisis from spreading and to put weakening global activity back on track,'' it said.
In light of the continuing troubles, Mr. Obama and Mr. Carney repeated the administration's belief that Europe needed to quiet debt markets immediately. In past weeks, Treasury officials including Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Lael Brainard, under secretary for international affairs, have made the same call.
''It is crucial that Europe move quickly to put in place a strong plan to restore financial stability,'' Mr. Geithner said at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Hawaii this month.
Mr. Obama said Monday that the United States stood ''ready to do its part.'' The administration has held scores of private conversations, with everyone from Mr. Obama to Treasury aides involved, to help ease the crisis in the past months.
Treasury officials say that European policy makers need to build a ''fire wall'' to stabilize borrowing costs for afflicted euro zone members. Then, they need to begin to repair individual countries' balance sheets. They describe their talks with Europe as advisory, often repeating that the solution must be European.
Administration officials say that they frequently refer to Washington's experience in thawing the credit squeeze and backstopping financial markets after the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
''It is unbelievably hard to create new mechanisms during a crisis,'' a senior administration official said. ''They are facing legitimately difficult political and institutional constraints.''
The administration officials have provided European officials with background on the construction of American emergency programs to ease credit markets, like the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility. They have also discussed Washington's efforts to stabilize and recapitalize banks.
Given the United States' own recent financial crisis, the Obama administration is also watching closely for signs of contagion and urging banking institutions to cut their exposure to Europe.
The Financial Stability Oversight Council, established by the Dodd-Frank financial law, has held repeated calls on the European situation. The discussions have included top financial regulators, like Mr. Geithner and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, as well as lower-level aides.
''The continued rise in sovereign-debt spreads for some countries, more generalized market volatility, and political turmoil that we have seen in recent days speak to the need for forceful action,'' Janet L. Yellen, vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, said in a speech this month discussing the government's oversight policies.
The Fed, she said, is ''actively engaged in ensuring that U.S. financial institutions are appropriately managing their credit and liquidity risks.''
The Federal Reserve last week ordered the biggest American banks to perform rigorous stress tests of their portfolios, to ensure they have enough capital to cover losses in a significant economic deterioration.
To address the euro zone crisis, the Federal Reserve also said the six largest firms would test the impact of a ''global market shock'' incorporating ''potential sharp market price movements in European sovereign and financial sectors.''

HEADLINE: Syria Calls the Arab League's Sanctions 'Economic War'

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Hwaida Saad contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DAMASCUS, Syria -- The Arab League declared ''economic war'' on Syria when it leveled broad trade sanctions against it, Syria's foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, said on Monday, warning that the country could use its strategic location to retaliate.
''Syria cannot be treated like this,'' Mr. Moallem said at a news conference broadcast live around the region. He was by turns indignant and incredulous that the Arab League had turned the tool of sanctions, which it had long reviled, on one of its own. 
''Sanctions can cut both ways,'' he said. And while he contended that he did not want to threaten anyone, he said, ''We should study well Syria's geographic location as a transit point for commercial traffic.''
Many airlines cross Syrian airspace, Mr. Moallem noted. In addition, Syria is part of the main route for heavy trucks heading from Europe and Turkey to the Persian Gulf, where Qatar and Saudi Arabia are among Syria's harshest critics.
His remarks were the first official reaction to measures imposed by the Arab League on Sunday after weeks of wrangling over a peace plan that stipulates that the government of President Bashar al-Assad end all violence, withdraw its armed forces from civilian areas and allow Arab or other monitors to circulate freely within Syria.
With Syria showing no signs of acceding to the demands of the Arab League, including that it stop using violence to suppress antigovernment protests, the regional confrontation deepened.
Although everyday life in downtown Damascus appeared normal on Monday, Syria's economy had already been sputtering because of sanctions previously imposed by the European Union and the United States.
It was difficult to assess how the new measures might affect the country, because the Arab League has not released details and because important neighboring states like Iraq and Lebanon said they would not participate. But they raised the prospect that should the latest sanctions bite deeply, some of Mr. Assad's key constituencies, including Sunni business leaders, might turn on him. While Mr. Moallem chastised the Arab League at great length for what he called a hasty, one-sided decision, dissidents here either applauded the organization's decision or criticized the league for not acting more quickly to stanch the bloodshed.
''The government blocked the road to any interior solution through violence, killing, arrests and storming private houses,'' said Hassem Abdel Azim, a lawyer who leads a coalition of about 16 opposition groups.
But Louay Hussein, the leader of a nascent opposition party, said the Arab League should have pressed ahead with an initial group of about 40 monitors once Syria said on Nov. 2 that it accepted the peace plan.
The sanctions include a travel ban against scores of senior Syrian officials, a freeze on government assets in Arab countries, a ban on transactions with Syria's central bank and an end to all commercial exchanges with the Syrian government.
Mr. Moallem sidestepped a question about why the Assad government had not presented the results of a promised investigation into the jailing and torture of children in the southern town of Dara'a, the event that ignited the uprising nationwide.
In Geneva, however, an independent commission organized by the United Nations Human Rights Council released a long-awaited report on rights abuses by Syria's security forces. Based on interviews with 223 victims and witnesses, the report documented what it described as ''patterns of summary execution, arbitrary arrest, enforced disappearance, torture, including sexual violence, as well as violations of children's rights.''
The commission expressed concerns that ''crimes against humanity have been committed.''
Mr. Moallem said Syria rejected any assertions that its military was responsible for civilian bloodshed, saying both the West and the Arab world refused to accept the Assad government's view, which is that the country has been the target of armed gangs financed from abroad.
He presented a gruesome, 10-minute video that showed what he said were photos of murdered security personnel, some of them hacked to death. As in most such video recordings presented by both sides, the contents were impossible to confirm independently.
Syria rarely grants visas to Western reporters, and a sudden invitation into the country seemed intended both to highlight the news conference and to address demands from the Arab League that more international correspondents be given entry. Such visits are heavily supervised, however, starting at the border.
The only demonstrators visible on the streets of Damascus on Monday were government supporters, adolescents wearing face paint of the black, white and red Syrian flag and screaming out of taxi windows as they headed to a downtown rally.
''In the heart of the city, life resembles something normal,'' said Mr. Abdel Azim, the dissident lawyer, ''but in the suburbs just four kilometers from where we are sitting there are always protests.''
Antigovernment protests are difficult to stage in Damascus, residents said, because it is impossible for more than 10 people to gather for more than five minutes before ever-vigilant security services attack.
Even before the latest sanctions, the Syrian pound was declining against the dollar. This has made life markedly more expensive, as the costs of imports have surged. Parts of Damascus suffer power cuts for about 90 minutes a day, residents said, and some public buildings are decidedly chilly.
Syrians can basically be divided into three groups, Mr. Hussein said: Some people think the government will not be shaken and will continue as always; some think the violence will grind on in a stalemate for years; and some worry about foreign intervention and the possibility that the country will collapse like Libya, but with fierce sectarian fighting making things much worse.
Syria's Foreign Ministry, once in a modest villa in a residential neighborhood, is now a cavernous white cake of a building standing by itself. Asked how old it was, a reporter at the news conference responded, ''Isn't it a beautiful building? We are so worried that NATO will come bomb it.'' Those who are not in despair try to make jokes. One refers to the current Arab uprisings and an old canard from Syrian governments that a police state's vigilance is necessary to recapture the Golan Heights, lost to Israel in 1967.
As the joke goes, a Rip van Winkle character falls asleep in a cave. Handily, the cave has a satellite TV, and when the character awakes, he flips through the channels to find that democracy is thriving in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. But when he reaches the Syrian channel, the announcer drones, ''President Assad XVI has vowed to liberate the Golan Heights,'' and the man goes back to sleep.

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Offer Plan To Extend Cut in Payroll Tax

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats introduced legislation Monday to extend and expand an expiring payroll tax cut, setting the stage for a showdown with Republicans who are almost certain to reject the Democrats' proposal for paying for the cut. 
The bill, which could be voted on as early as Friday, would reduce the Social Security payroll tax paid by employees and the self-employed by half, to 3.1. percent of wages from 6.2 percent, for 2012. Those taxes were reduced to 4.2 percent of wages this year under a law set to expire at the end of the year. Under the Senate measure, the average working family would have close to $1,500 a year more to spend, according to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader.
In a Monday conference call with reporters, Mr. Reid said that with millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet, ''seems to me the most important thing we can do is to make sure they have money to keep their bills paid to the best of their ability.'' Lower- and middle-income workers are the greatest beneficiaries of the tax cut.
The bill would also reduce the Social Security payroll tax paid by employers on the first $5 million of taxable payroll to 3.1 percent from 6.2 percent. This proposal was part of President Obama's jobs program that previously failed in the Senate. In 2011, the tax cut resulted in $67.2 billion of lost revenue for Social Security, although that money is recouped, by law, through the government's general fund.
Republicans -- who have adamantly defended a renewal of the so-called Bush tax cuts, which also expire at the end of the year -- have been lukewarm on extending the payroll tax holiday, arguing that it would not stimulate the economy. They are particularly displeased with the Senate proposal to pay for it: the bill calls for a 3.25 percent tax on gross income over $1 million for single filers and married couples filing jointly.
''Republicans have said that extending the payroll tax break is a potential area of common ground,'' said Michael Steel, a spokesman for the House speaker, John A. Boehner, ''but coupling it with a job-killing tax hike on small businesses makes no sense whatsoever.''
Senate Democrats are almost certain to make the extension of the cut a signature issue over the next few weeks. ''We are not going to let this lapse,'' Mr. Reid insisted.
At one point, the payroll tax cut was expected to be rolled into a deal proposed by the ill-fated deficit reduction panel, along with the extension of unemployment benefits for roughly 2.2 million Americans. Under current law, unemployed Americans receive up to 99 weeks of benefits; next year, without the extension, it would drop to a maximum of 26 weeks.
House Republicans are working with Senate Democrats on a deal that could put that issue to rest, perhaps by reducing the number of weeks of benefits by roughly three months. While extending the benefits is controversial among Republicans, it is more popular right now than the extension of the payroll tax cut.

HEADLINE: Why Are Primaries Hard To Predict?

BYLINE: ANDREW GELMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Presidential elections often come down to the state of the economy the year before the votes are counted. Why are presidential primaries so much more volatile? 

 BODY:
Presidential elections are predictable. At the national level, economic conditions - measures like the change in per-capita income in the year or so preceding the election - usually do a good job predicting the popular vote. At the state level, you can usually predict the outcome given the vote last time, after adjusting for the economy and the home states and regions of the candidates. At the level of individual voters, preferences are largely predictable from political ideology, degree of partisanship, and, again, recent economic conditions.
This has all been known for a while, at least since the work of political scientists Doug Hibbs in the 1970s and Steven Rosenstone and Robert Erikson in the 1980s.
In 1993, Gary King and I wrote a paper, "Why are American presidential election campaign polls so variable when votes are so predictable?" Our answer was that early polls are not very meaningful and that during the election campaign voters tend to move toward their predictable positions. Fluctuations during the campaign (for example, the well-documented "bump" that candidates receive during their nominating conventions) are part of a shaking-out process, and it makes sense to look toward where the polls will end up at election time rather than at the changes that happen to occur during any particular week of the campaign.
But even though statistical analysis has demonstrated that presidential elections are predictable given economic conditions and previous votes in the states, (go here for an analysis I did with Kari Lock that uses state-level poll data), it certainly doesn't mean that everyelection can be accurately predicted ahead of time.
Presidential general election campaigns have several distinct features that distinguish them from most other elections:
1. Two major candidates;
2. The candidates clearly differ in their political ideologies and in their positions on economic issues;
3. The two sides have roughly equal financial and organizational resources;
4. The current election is the latest in a long series of similar contests (every four years);
5. A long campaign, giving candidates a long time to present their case and giving voters a long time to make up their minds.
Other elections look different. In Europe, for example, the major parties of the left and the right are not so distinct on economic policies, and there are typically three or more major parties competing. Referenda in American states typically feature highly unequal campaigns with one side much better funded than the other. In addition, referenda typically address new issues so that you cannot predict the outcome based on previous elections on the same topic. Campaigns for governor, senator and the House are also often highly unbalanced in resources.
And while presidential elections are predictable, the nominating contests that choose the candidates are not. Presidential primaries often have none of the five features I mentioned earlier. With three or more candidates, there is an incentive for strategic voting (not wanting to waste your vote on a candidate who doesn't have a chance); this creates a positive feedback or "bandwagon" effect in which strong candidates get stronger and weak candidates disappear, an effect that we do not see in two-candidate contests. 
The candidates in a primary election are of the same political party and typically differ in only minor ways in their political positions, so it is easier for voters to change their opinions. Primary election campaigns can be highly unequal too, with different candidates pouring their efforts into different states. And during the heat of primary season, voters may have only a week or two to make up their minds in light of the news from the most recent primaries elsewhere.
As a result, it's no surprise that primaries are unpredictable. Once the dust clears, though, we get to a general election campaign that, for all the noise, is mostly determined by the state of the economy. Yes, "it's the economy, stupid" when November comes along - a fact that has driven many of the economic and political calculations of President Obama and congressional Republicans over the past few years - but the primaries tell their own story.

HEADLINE: How to Succeed in Business? By Reading, India Says

BYLINE: SARITHA RAI


HIGHLIGHT: Business books were the big sellers at the Bangalore Book Fair. 

 BODY:
It was a different kind of shopping trip for Pallavi Rao, 24, a trendy human-resources consultant who normally picks up things like sunglasses, bags and short jackets. After work last week, she browsed among dozens of stalls at Bangalore's annual book fair and carefully selected a handful of titles on management and leadership. 
"Books are my personal mentors, they inspire me to do better at work," said Ms. Rao. 
Indian readers, particularly young ones, have been devouring books on business, management, careers and money in recent years. In storefront displays and airport bookstores across India, these tomes get pride of place, relegating fiction and books about politics to the back row.
Bangalore's annual book fair, which was held over 10 days this month in the grounds of the Bangalore Palace, a Windsor Castle lookalike from the Raj days, attracted dozens of business-focused publishers and retailers with catchy names like Success and Genius, as well as more than 200,000 attendees. 
Young Indians graduating from management schools "are voracious readers of nonfiction, they read to get a competitive edge," says Krishan Chopa, chief editor for nonfiction at HarperCollins Publishers India. India's growing economy has accelerated changes in business and at the workplace, he said, and authors who write about these changes are popular because the "country's book-reading public is eager to stay updated." 
Bestsellers in India do not sell in the millions, as some do in the West; the most popular titles sell about 50,000 copies the year they are released. (Walter Issacson's biography of Steve Jobs, by comparison, sold more than 379,000 copies in its first week in the United States). India's publishing market, when compared to the West's, is still tiny, fractured and hard to measure.
But more people are reading, which, along with a competitive printing industry, appears to be fueling a publishing boom. As literacy rates climb (to 74 percent, according to the latest census) and as expenditure for private consumption grows (projected to rise 7.5 percent in the fiscal year ending March 2012, according to the Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy) , book buying is expected to ascend as well.
India's educated, savvy middle class has caused the market for business and management books to "explode," said the Bangalore-based IT entrepreneur Subroto Bagchi, an author and the vice chairman of MindTree, a Bangalore base software services firm. This is especially true in smaller Indian cities, he said. Mr. Bagchi's three books include "The Professional" and "The High-Performance Entrepreneur,'' both published by Penguin; together they sold more than 150,000 copies. With his fourth book, "Business at 16," Mr. Bagchi hopes to get teenagers interested in business, partly by using fictional anecdotes, including boy-meets-girl stories. 
Business biographies and management guides are a top-selling category at the online retailer FlipKart, whether the author is Indian or foreign, said the company's chief executive, Sachin Bansal. "Successful entrepreneurs are young India's role models and their narratives offer valuable lessons," he said. 
Sales of such books on FlipKart are up 191 percent in the first ten months of 2011 compared to the entire year before, he said. Among the current chart toppers is Rashmi Bansal's "I Have a Dream," on social entrepreneurs.
Penguin Allen Lane launched a separate imprint for business books called Penguin Portfolio in India in 2006, when readership for the genre began accelerating. "Indian readers are more informed, curious and proactive than ever," says Udayan Mitra, publisher of Penguin's Allen Lane and Portfolio."There is a desire to read in and around the area people work in." 
That segment has seen 100 percent growth in value terms over the last three years, and makes up about one-third of nonfiction sales at his publishing house, Mr. Mitra says.
Two distinct categories have emerged within the segment, Mr. Mitra said. High-end corporate biographies, such as the low-cost airline founder G.R. Gopinath's "Simply Fly" or "The TCS Story . . . and Beyond" by the former Tata Consulting Services chief executive S. Ramadorai, and leadership strategy books command a significant slice of one end of the market, as do mass-market business self-help books. 
Over 700 readers crammed into a bookstore at a mall in Delhi's Vasant Kunj neighborhood recently for the release of the real-estate tycoon K.P. Singh's autobiography "Whatever the Odds." The author, founder of the development company DLF, made a video appearance from his Florida home via satellite. 
It is an exciting time to be a publisher in India, says Kapish Mehra, managing director of Rupa Publications. Mr. Mehra published the retail entrepreneur Kishore Biyani's autobiography, "It Happened in India," which sold over 200,000 copies at 99 rupees, or about $2, each. Mr. Mehra says his publishing firm will release a dozen new titles on business and management in the next six months.
Mr. Chopra of HarperCollins says that even a few years ago, only a couple of his business books sold more than 10,000 copies per year. "These days, a dozen or more sell between 10,000 and 20,000 copies every year,'' he says. 
Regional-language publishers find that their own markets are keeping pace. "Small-town Indians want to know how successful people made it, and want to read to pick up lessons from their life and work," says Badri Seshadri, managing director of the Chennai-based Tamil-language publishing house New Horizon Media, which has published biographies of the outsourcing company founder Azim Premji and Reliance Industries' founder, the late Dhirubhai Ambani.
But Mr. Seshadri's runaway bestseller has been an initiation into the Indian stock markets, which has sold 100,000 copies and is going into further reprints. The title is "Alla alla Panam," or "Tons of Money.''

HEADLINE: Why a Mediocre Web Site Is So Dangerous

BYLINE: GABRIEL SHAOOLIAN


HIGHLIGHT: A Web site can be a small business's single most important marketing and sales tool. Do it right or don't do it at all. 

 BODY:
In my last post, I asked, "Can a Marketing Contest Increase Sales for This Online Retailer?"
The online retailer, you may recall, was Don Chernoff, the inventor of SkyRoll, a carry-on bag that was designed to minimize wrinkles in suits and shirts. SkyRoll has sold thousands of units in retail stores but relatively few through the company's Web site. In an effort to bolster the site's traffic and sales, Mr. Chernoff created the "Crazy Carry-On Contest." Unfortunately, the contest has done little to improve the site's performance. We asked the readers of this column to take a look at the site and offer their views on why the site is failing to deliver sales and why the contest has failed to generate buzz.
As usual, the readers zeroed in on the crucial issues, offering insights and providing a lot of practical advice. When selling online, there are three things you have to do: make people want to buy your product, create a level of trust so people will be willing to buy from you and make the buying process as simple and intuitive as possible. The readers clearly believe (as do I) that the site has failed in all three areas. 
Lucy, from Moab, Utah: "I wondered if there would be enough room for everything else I wanted to carry if I used this system. An artist's line drawing of an X-ray view of the bag, with items nestled within and around the roll would be helpful. Or possibly a photo of everything that fit within the bag laid out for all to see. After all, potential customers of Skyroll already use a carry on roller bag AND a garment bag. Surely a concern would be, 'Could I fit everything into this one bag?'"
Sporty from Atlanta: "The description on how to use the bag makes it sound really complicated and shuts down the sale. Why not simply do a lovely video that shows how easy it really easy to pack clothes. Additionally, it is not clear how much can fit in the cylinder. That can be shown on the video as well."
In addition, I'd like to give a big thank you to Jen in New York who found the site for Max Mirani luggage. This site succeeds in many ways that SkyRoll does not. Starting with the home page, the site has a clean, uncluttered design. And as you can see below, it demonstrates the capacity of the luggage through illustration and explanation, making it much easier for visitors to decide if this is the right product for them.
Readers also picked up on the fact that little seems to have been invested in the SkyRoll site. Lucy from Moab thought there needed to be "more excitement," while Susan from North Carolina didn't mince words. "It is a terrible Web site," she wrote. "The paragraphs are disjointed, with way too many words. The product itself looks great, but obviously no one with marketing experience was involved. And frankly the Web site construction is flat and dated as well."
New York's Anonymous Coward summed up the issues: "The big problem is there is nothing on the home page that says this item is for sale. The site looks like a brochure and not an e-commerce site. There needs to be something on the front page that tells the visitors, 'we sell great bags and you can BUY THEM NOW.' Right now it just says 'we make great bags'."
Mr. Chernoff was especially interested in reader reaction to his Crazy Carry-On Contest, which was introduced in March but has generated little buzz. Site visitors were invited to submit photographs and videos of odd or unusual carry-on bags, but few have been submitted. The readers were not impressed.
Joshua from Maine: "It took me a while to find (the contest) on the site. It's not really a contest if winning is that you own and post their picture on your site. You may consider a time frame and offering an actual prize, such as a free bag. The problem with the contest as it currently stands is that you first have to find the product, then the contest."
Jen in New York: "I think the owner needs to be very clear on who his intended audience is, and then design the message and site accordingly. I can't imagine that the ideal customer is the same person that might engage in this contest (photos/videos of funny, weird carry-ons might be more of a college student thing)."
The contest was also featured on SkyRoll's Facebook page, but that did little to generate interest. "I checked out your Facebook page -- obviously something that you want visitors to the site to do since it's so prominent on the homepage," wrote LeNerd. "You've got people submitting content on the Facebook page, but you're not responding to them! Granted, you don't have a large enough fan base yet to get a constant stream, but why would you leave those excited customers hanging out to dry? One person asked about submitting photos for the contest on the Facebook page, and you told them to do it via email instead. Why? It's so much more compelling to see user-generated content right away!"
Mr. Chernoff Responds
Mr. Chernoff thought most readers missed the point. He was looking for better ways to promote the contest and was surprised how much people were focusing on the presentation of the contest on the Web. "I was not looking for advice on Web site design," he said. "The Web site is not the vehicle for promoting the contest. Having people write or blog about it is the goal."
He said it would be difficult to set deadlines for the contest or to offer rewards because, to date, there has only been one entry. "If we get a steady stream of entries and the contest gathers momentum," he said, "I can see giving away a free SkyRoll every month or so to the best entry."
He also dismissed the more general comments about the site. "There was a lot of hipster whining about our Web site, but very little actionable advice," he said. "I disagree with the many comments that say I need a 'call to action' and that the site isn't 'sales oriented.' The site is designed to explain a product that is unique and benefits from explanation. It is easy to buy one. There is a 'Where to buy' link on the home page and a 'buy now' button on each product page."
My Take
Mr. Chertoff says his goal is to get bloggers to write about the "Crazy Carry-On Contest" because he feels that kind of attention will create buzz, traffic, participation and, ultimately, more sales. But I'm not sure he understands the way bloggers and other "influencers" work.
Some influencers wield enormous power. The reason they enjoy huge audiences is because they provide information that is of real value to their audiences. They succeed because they do their homework and only endorse Web sites and products that they genuinely like and respect.
Every time influencers recommend a site or a product, they put their own credibility on the line. And contrary to what Mr. Chernoff says, his Web site is the important place for promoting the contest. Unless your site presents the contest in a creative and fun way, no influencer is going to risk his or her credibility by sending readers to your site.
If Mr. Chernoff is fortunate enough to get bloggers to visit his site, what will they find when they get there?
 The contest is buried on the bottom navigation of the home page.
 The contest page looks slapped together.
 The few photographs posted aren't particularly "crazy."
 The videos have nothing to do with the contest.
 There are no prizes offered.
 There is no time frame.
This is not a case of "build it and they will come." Mr. Chernoff needs to build it extremely well before anyone will come -- and recommend that others follow. This will not be cheap and this will not be easy. A Web site and its marketing and promotion are a reflection of the brand behind the site. If a contest looks slapped together, it will all but guarantee that visitors will not come back -- and they certainly won't buy from your site.
While Mr. Chernoff was not looking for a review of his Web site, the site itself is at the heart of the difficulties he has been having. Without a redesign and a more creative and structured approach to the contest, the site will not draw much traffic, the contest will not get much buy-in and visitors will not purchase SkyRolls in significant numbers.
When conceiving a contest -- or any other attempt to drive traffic with user-generated content -- it's important to keep a few things in mind:
 Make sure the contest aims at an audience of potential and current customers.
 Give them incentives to contribute (prizes, recognition).
 Give them reasons to keep coming back (pick daily, weekly, monthly winners or featured contributors).
 Promote the contest through multiple channels (like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube).
 Promote the contest on appropriate travel blogs.
 Create new contests and promotions on a regular basis.
A good example is a contest created by the Irish brewery Guinness. The Guinness Storehouse is a combination museum, visitor center, pub, brewery and restaurant. Thousands of visitors tour the storehouse each year, so Guinness created a contest to encourage visitors to share their photos of the Storehouse online. More than 20,000 people have done so, making the contest an enormous success. The contest offers monthly prizes, and it awards a grand prize of 1,000 pounds. And Guinness actively promotes the contest on its Twitter account.
Here's the bottom line: Any business that fails to take its online business as seriously as its offline business is committing economic suicide. Introducing a mediocre Web site or online promotion with a minimal budget and little thought is worse than a waste of money. It sends a message that you are unprofessional or incompetent or both. Your Web site can be your single most important marketing and sales tool. Do it right or don't do it at all.

HIGHLIGHT: A summary of what's on today's editorial page. 

 BODY:
Judge Jed Rakoff was right to reject a plan by the S.E.C. to settle a securities fraud case against Citigroup. Until prosecution results in exposure and punishment, bankers are unlikely to change their behavior, and will keep putting the country at risk of another financial meltdown.
Washington and Islamabad need to ensure that this weekend's NATO strike on two Pakistani border posts does not destroy their already troubled relationship. A full and transparent investigation is the best way to discover what happened, and to come back from the brink.
Thanks to a federal appellate court ruling, grizzly bears in the Rocky Mountains will continue to enjoy protection as an endangered species.
It's common sense that college administrators need to contact off-campus law enforcement authorities immediately when they receive allegations of criminal conduct.

HEADLINE: Debt History

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: America's story, borrowed. 

 BODY:
As part of that long-term project, I've been looking at the long-term debt history of the United States, using both the Fed's flow of funds data (which start in 1952) and the earlier, not quite comparable, data from Millennial Historical Statistics. Here's what I think is a key chart; it shows nonfinancial private-sector debt as as percentage of GDP:
One thing that jumps out is the surge in the debt ratio during 1929-33, which is due to a plunge in GDP rather than a rise in debt -- call it Irving Fisher's revenge. Another is the fall in the debt ratio during World War II, reflecting a combination of income growth, low borrowing, and some very helpful inflation; I'd argue that this debt reduction played a key role in the economy's ability to avoid a relapse into depression.
But a broader point is the U-shaped trajectory over time. This matches up with a lot of things. Gary Gorton's "quiet period" of freedom from financial crisis probably has a lot to do with low debt, as well as deposit insurance. The trajectory also matches long-term trends in income inequality and political polarization.
More on this eventually; for now, I think the data are really interesting.

HIGHLIGHT: In Tuesday's Times, Steve Lohr writes about a new software tool that can detect how much beauty and fashion photos have been retouched, on a 1-to-5 scale. Developed by a Dartmouth computer science professor and his graduate student, the software uses an algorithm to measure the alterations. 

 BODY:
Body image and tech?
In Tuesday's Times, Steve Lohr writes about a new software tool that can detect to what extent beauty and fashion photos have been retouched, ranking them on a 1-to-5 scale. Developed by a Dartmouth computer science professor and his graduate student, the software uses an algorithm that "statistically measures how much the image of a person's face and body has been altered," the article says.
In their research, the academics recruited hundreds of people online and asked them to compare sets of before-and-after pictures to establish the 1-to-5 scale of touchups. The human rankings were used to train the software.
The professor, Hany Farid, who is also a digital forensics expert, became interested in the issue after reading about proposals by feminist legislators in Europe that digitally altered photos be labeled, as a kind of truth in advertising and a way to combat unrealistic notions of body image.
Idealized photographs of models and celebrities have been a concern for awhile among psychologists and others, who say they could lead to problems like eating disorders, especially among younger women. The Web site Jezebel has run many articles on retouching photographs, which it has called "one of America's growing industries."
Publications commenting on the Dartmouth research include The Economist blog and Nature. The Independent had a little fun with its headline: "I'm Ready for My Touchup."

HEADLINE: Early Holiday Spending Comes Despite Tight Consumer Budgets

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A consumer distress index suggests that holiday spending will be constrained -- unless shoppers buy on credit. 

 BODY:
Continued housing distress and rising prices for food and gas are weighing heavily on American families' finances as the holiday shopping season begins, a quarterly analysis shows.
The CredAbility Consumer Distress Index, a measure of household financial stability, fell sharply in the third quarter, largely erasing improvements made over the prior three quarters. An uptick in late mortgage and rental payments and higher prices at the grocery store and gas pumps were the chief culprits.
CredAbility, a nonprofit consumer counseling agency based in Atlanta, crunches national data in five different categories -- employment, housing, credit, household budget and net worth -- to compile the index. A score below 70 indicates financial distress.
In the latest analysis, United States households scored 66.7 on the index's 100-point scale, a "significant" drop from 69.2 in the second quarter, and the largest drop since the third quarter of 2008, the agency found. The nation's consumers have now been in financial distress for 12 consecutive quarters, according to the index. (The analysis also measured consumer distress in individual states and found that only 19, as well as the District of Columbia, had scores above 70.)

"The average American family is feeling significant distress," said Mark Cole, chief operating officer of CredAbility and the index's author. The unemployment rate hasn't changed, but the rate of "under-employment," in which people are working part-time rather than full-time for economic reasons, increased in the quarter.
Despite the gloomy index numbers, indications are that retail sales were up significantly over the bellwether Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Mr. Cole said he did not think that sort of spending could continue, given that the average family has shrinking savings and less left over at the end of the month. People fatigued by living within tight budgets may be looking for bargains, he said, but "It's hard for me to imagine there's that much spending power left."
"The only way those gains are sustainable is if they borrow money," he said, noting that consumers have been doing better at managing debt. "My hope is they're not going to borrow money to buy holiday gifts."
What are your plans for holiday spending? Does your budget allow for gifts, or do you plan to borrow to buy presents?

HEADLINE: The Poorest and Richest Counties

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The county with the lowest poverty rate last year was Falls Church, Va. -- actually an independent city -- where about 3 percent of residents live in poverty, the Census Bureau reports. The highest rate was in Ziebach County, S.D. 

 BODY:
The county with the lowest poverty rate in America last year was Falls Church, Va. -- actually an independent city -- where about 3 percent of residents live in poverty, according to a new data release from the Census Bureau. The highest poverty rate was in Ziebach County, S.D., where about half of residents are below the poverty line.
Between 2007, the year the recession began, and 2010, the poverty rate rose by a statistically significant amount in nearly a quarter of counties (722 of 3,142) across the country. 
Median incomes were, as you might expect, pretty closely related to poverty rates. The county with the highest median income in 2010 -- $119,075 -- was Loudoun County, Va., which is near Falls Church in the Washington suburbs. The lowest median income was in Buffalo County, S.D., just a hop, skip and jump away from Ziebach County. In Buffalo County, the median income was $20,577.
The interactive map above shows poverty rates for all adults, for children only and for school-age children (ages 5 to 17), as well as median incomes. You can click on the map and choose one of these options from the pull-down menu in the legend, and then mouse over any county to see how it fares.

HEADLINE: Brother, Can You Spare a Line?

BYLINE: D.W. GIBSON


HIGHLIGHT: A freelance writer collects the stories of the unemployed. 

 BODY:
This past summer I drove across the country interviewing people who had lost their jobs since 2007 - since the housing market disintegrated, since Lehman Brothers evaporated, since layoffs subsumed the work force. I asked for details about the climactic phone call, the conference room, the look of the sky out the window, the security escort, the drive home: all the particulars of the experience.
I met a mortgage broker who, one morning, learned he had been laid off when he found the door to his office building padlocked. I met an H.R. executive who had laid off a couple of hundred people before she herself was laid off. I met a husband who was laid off two weeks after his wife announced she was pregnant. I met a wife who laid off her husband.
I was collecting these stories for a forthcoming book about the experience of being unemployed. Modeled on Studs Terkel's "Working," the genre-defining oral history of what people do all day and how they feel about what they do, this book will be called "Not Working." Accompanying me on the two-month trip were the filmmaker M J Sieber, who was helping to film a companion documentary, and the playwright Mallery Avidon, who was helping to find subjects, taking notes for a script and discovering a talent for writing haikus. We drove from Orange County, Calif., to New York City in a 1999 Jeep with 142,000 miles on it; we ran on the unexpected and inexplicable stamina that came with hearing mostly demoralizing stories.
Since it was work people had lost, and work that they sought, I ended every conversation by asking each person to define the word. "Work" never means the same thing, it turns out. Rather, we negotiate a complicated relationship to the idea, rooted in our own achievements and defeats, our own pursuits and resources. "It's what I do to know I'm being a good person," said Wendy Hamilton, 34, who had lost two jobs in a row at nonprofits in Omaha. "It's a paycheck," said Jim, 43, an underemployed, union-eschewing and last-name-concealing drywall man in Lemon Valley, Nev. The range of answers has common themes but no duplications and is riddled with contradictions.
Taking this trip meant going M.I.A. on my wife, Tasha Garcia Gibson, who is an owner of a couple of small New York City restaurants that demand seven-day workweeks. I have picked her up at 2 a.m. enough times to know what the closing minutes of a 14-hour day look like: the floors get mopped; the security gates come down; busboys, waiters and cooks gather at the door. They're exhausted and eager to start long subway rides home, but they wait because leaving before my wife finishes payout is not an option. Rent is needed now, so is dinner and a refill on the Metrocard.
On the road, I felt closest to my wife when 2 a.m. rolled around. Not only could I visualize exactly where she was, but the image was also emblematic of what I was encountering across the country. The unemployed, the underemployed, the still-employed but ridiculously overworked: everyone was gasping from week to week.
I know the sensation of gasping for air. I maintain no fewer than four jobs as a writer and publishing professional. I am a cog in the wheel that is optimistically referred to as the creative services, euphemistically referred to as freelancing, realistically referred to as I-take-what-I-can-get. We work from home and make our own hours, sure, but we also survive without things like medical benefits or long-term financial planning. Work is the opportunity standing in front of us right now, if there is one at all. Otherwise, it's unreturned calls and empty in-boxes. We must make work.
When my editor brought up the idea for a book collecting the stories of the unemployed - for some writer somewhere - I persuaded him the commission was mine because I was seized with a conviction about the project. I cleared my summer calendar of all face-to-face meetings and resolved to fulfill my responsibilities by way of a laptop that would, over the next several weeks, glow in darkened motel rooms from Rawlins, Wyo., to Columbus, Ohio.
Some of the people I interviewed were curious, maybe even a bit suspicious, about my relationship to work. They understood that I was traveling and conducting interviews but remained unclear on whether such tasks qualified as work: "This is your job?" "Who's paying you for this?" I told them I had a small book advance that would get me across the country. A few of them noted that if my income was spent in short order, I wouldn't have anything left when I sat down to write the book. They asked who would pay me then. I confessed I had not yet thought that far.
But staving off anxiety is rather straightforward when your work is interviewing people like Scott Cooksley, 47, of Reno, Nev. He lost his managerial job at a casino, then staggered to his feet after homelessness, two heart attacks and four kinds of cancer, now in remission. As of summer he was back in an apartment with a regular paycheck, managing the food bank that helped save him. "Work is not just to get an income," he said. "It's to feel self-worth. You have to have that."
In the face of stories like Scott's - scores and scores of them - I found myself wondering about the worth of the work I had created. I tended to question it most in the moments before I approached a possible interviewee. It wasn't easy walking up to strangers in cities and states where I had never been, asking them not only to come to a complete stop on the sidewalk but also to sit down and tell me about an experience they would probably like to forget.
Sandra, for instance, did not come to a complete stop. Mallery and I spotted her in a strip mall parking lot in Fresno, Calif., and accompanied her to the front door of an unemployment office. The following day, we met on a bench inside an air-conditioned mall. An out-of-work home nurse and mother of four who did not want to give her last name, Sandra explained that she enrolled in high school at 38 because she wanted a diploma instead of a G.E.D. "Work shows your character," she said. "How are you going to say you want something and you don't work for it?"
When Sandra asked me to explain my own situation, I referred to my trip as "work" but stayed away from "job." "Job" implied a layer of obligation I didn't feel; "work," on the other hand, implied the purpose I sought. On the best of days, there is a beneficiary of one's labor. As Dale Harris, 64, a former St. Louis cop who after several months of unemployment recently secured a graveyard shift guarding a nuclear-waste site, told me, "Work is producing something that's of benefit to someone else."
The service of listening, inherently passive, often felt inadequate. It might have aided cathartic venting, but it was always useless when it came to meeting immediate, practical needs. I left many conversations with unresolved endings - forthcoming state budget cuts, next week's foreclosure date.
Tammy Moss's foreclosure date was imminent. A petite woman with cropped hair and dark brown eyes, Tammy, 51, wore a freshly pressed shirt and, as she spoke, her hands remained clasped on the glass surface of her dining table in Missouri. She was paid the day she was laid off from a title company, a check for one week's salary at 5 p.m. on a Friday. Her supervisor said things had slowed and that, when they picked up again, she would call. When Tammy gave me her definition of work, she sat perfectly straight, as though anticipating that someone might set a batch of bank reconciliations in front of her. "I'd like to get back to it," she said. "That's my definition of work: I'd like to get back to it."

HEADLINE: Council Resolution Calls for Support of Occupy Wall Street

BYLINE: MATT FLEGENHEIMER


HIGHLIGHT: Councilman Ydannis Rodriguez, one of the resolution's authors, along with Councilman Jumaane D. Williams and Councilwoman Letitia James, said the resolution already had the support of 13 members. 

 BODY:
 Three City Council members introduced a resolution Tuesday that would formalize support for Occupy Wall Street and its message condemning economic inequality.
 "The Occupy movement is more than occupying a public square," said Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez, one of the resolution's authors, along with Councilman Jumaane D. Williams and Councilwoman Letitia James -- all Democrats. "It is about the frustration of the working class and the middle class who feel we have not received a fair share."
 The resolution describes a protest "fueled by disheartened New Yorkers" and calls on members to defend a peaceful approach to "the divisive economic and social realities facing our nation." 
 Councilman Rodriguez said the resolution already had the support of 13 members, including the authors. He noted that councils in other cities, including Buffalo, Los Angeles and San Francisco, had presented similar resolutions of support in recent weeks.
 Councilman Rodriguez and Councilman Williams were arrested during separate incidents this month in which they joined protesters in Lower Manhattan. On Nov. 15, shortly after the Zuccotti Park encampment had been evicted by police officers, Councilman Rodriguez was taken into custody a few blocks from the park, as demonstrators encountered barricades preventing them from reaching the park. Two days later, Councilman Williams was arrested as part of a group that sat down in the roadway at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge.
 During his roughly 16 hours in custody, Councilman Rodriguez said, he missed an appointment at a school where he may try to send his young daughter. The councilman's wife had issued just one warning when he left for Zuccotti Park in the middle of the night, he said: "Don't get arrested."

HEADLINE: Pushing Latin American Banks to Lend

BYLINE: ELISABETH MALKIN


HIGHLIGHT: In a region once shaken by banking crises, financial institutions now seem sturdy, but are contributing too little to social welfare and economic growth, a World Bank study finds. 

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- As economic turmoil whiplashes banks in Europe and poses new threats to American financial institutions, the view from Latin America is very different. Well off the radar screen of the global economic crisis, Latin America's banks have proven their sturdiness, emerging relatively unscathed from the collapse. 
The problem, according to a study released by the World Bank on Tuesday, is that they just don't lend very much. 
Latin America's banking crises are well behind it, part of the detritus of economic mismanagement in the 1980s and 1990s. Since then, regulators, particularly in the region's most developed countries, have focused on ensuring the banks' stability and resiliency. Worries about a contagion effect on the Latin American subsidiaries of European and North American banks are held in check because they have to follow local capital requirements. 
But the banks have failed when it comes to contributing to social welfare and economic growth, says Augusto de la Torre, the World Bank's chief economist for Latin America and the Caribbean, and an author of the report. The problem now is how to keep the banks stable and make them "more useful," he said in an interview.

Credit to the private sector is low by global standards, about half of what it should be, according to calculations based on benchmarks for middle-income countries. When the banks do make loans, they are tilted in favor of consumption - think credit cards - rather than investment or mortgages. Housing loans, for example, account for 14 percent of total credit in the region compared to 58 percent in China and 47 percent in the developed countries of the G-7. 
When it comes to lending to small firms, the picture is more mixed. Lending to them lags sharply behind lending to large firms, but over all, small firms in the largest Latin American economies use bank credit at rates comparable to firms in Asia and Eastern Europe; they just pay more for it, the report found.
On top of that, bank users pay higher fees than anywhere else in the world. 
Mr. de la Torre says there are three causes of the banks' hesitation. The first is that the effects of a financial crisis tend to linger for as long as 15 years as banks and regulators act cautiously against any possibility of a relapse. 
The second cause is that contract rights in Latin America are generally weak and hard to enforce. While systems to manage credit card risk are easily imported and adapted to the region, "legal innovations cannot be imported," he said. 
Lastly, there is a more amorphous reason that might explain why banks are not lending, particularly to businesses: low productivity, or what Mr. de la Torre calls insufficient prospects. There may simply not be that many bankable projects. "Finance is crucial, but it's not the whole story," he said. 
The question now is whether banks can increase their lending without creating the sort of bubbles that have led to past crises.And they must do it in an increasingly fragile global environment. Drawing from the lessons of the subprime crisis, the authors warn against rushing to close the banking gap too quickly. A "slower but more sustainable, less fiscally risky catch-up is preferable to a more ambitious program of financial sector expansion that ends badly," the report says.

HEADLINE: For 92nd St. Y, a Break From Wall St. Worry

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN and JENNY ANDERSON


HIGHLIGHT: The hedge fund manager John A. Paulson and three other board members of the 92nd Street Y or their families manage some of its investment portfolio and have promised to cover any losses. 

 BODY:
Clients of John A. Paulson, the billionaire hedge fund manager, have had a brutal year, absorbing losses of as much as 50 percent.
But one of Mr. Paulson's investors - the 92nd Street Y - has nothing to worry about.
 That's because Mr. Paulson, a member of the organization's board, has guaranteed he will cover the Y for any losses it incurs in his funds. Barring a sharp recovery, Mr. Paulson will have to write a personal check to the organization for several million dollars.
"This is a very uncommon arrangement," said Andrew M. Grumet, a lawyer specializing in philanthropy. "But the 92nd Street Y isn't your average nonprofit, and John Paulson isn't your average money manager."
One of New York's premier cultural institutions, the 92nd Street Y also houses an exclusive preschool and nursery school, which Mr. Paulson's daughters attended. Tuition runs as high as $27,150 a year. The Y, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, is headed by a board that includes some of best-known names in business: Bronfman, Lauder, Tisch.
Its board is also stocked with Wall Street titans, including Mr. Paulson, who emerged from relative obscurity a half-decade ago to become one of Wall Street's most successful speculators. He made about $4 billion in 2007 by betting against subprime mortgages. He made another $5 billion in 2010, largely from investments in gold.
But his fortunes have turned this year. Mr. Paulson's largest funds - his assets under management had swelled to nearly $40 billion - are down 30 to 50 percent, largely as a result of a wager that the economy would recover more quickly than it has.
As a result of such losses, he could owe the 92nd Street Y as much as $4 million, according to two people with knowledge of the agreement who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it. Yet given Mr. Paulson's wealth - Forbes magazine estimates his fortune at $15.4 billion - a $4 million check would be pocket change for the 55-year-old native of Queens.
Mr. Paulson is the 92nd Street Y's largest outside manager, running about $10 million of the school's $37.9 million in investments, the two people said.
"We're certainly not ashamed of any of this," said Sol Adler, the executive director of the 92nd Street Y. "This institution has particularly generous board members, including John and a number of others."
Mr. Paulson's agreement to backstop his fund's losses at the 92nd Street Y is alluded to in the organization's financial statements, where it is disclosed in a footnote titled "related-party transactions." The disclosure says that four board members or their immediate families manage money for the 92nd Street Y's investment portfolio, and that they promised to cover any losses. They also agreed to reimburse the organization for certain fees on the investments.
Other hedge fund managers who have the arrangement with the 92nd Street Y are board member Curtis Schenker, the chief executive of Scoggin Capital Management, and Ricky Sandler, the head of Eminence Capital, whose wife serves as a director. The fourth manager was not disclosed. Mr. Paulson and the other hedge fund managers declined to comment.
"Paulson & Company manages funds for approximately 50 foundations and endowments," said Armel Leslie, a spokesman for Mr. Paulson. "Due to client confidentiality, we do not disclose either the names of our clients, or the terms of their investments with us."
The 92nd Street Y's board approached Mr. Paulson and the other managers with the idea several years ago, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The concept was to gain the benefits of the directors' investment expertise while protecting itself against losses. Also, by securing such extraordinary terms, the board felt it would eliminate any concern that the board would favor its own trustees over a disinterested money manager.
Philanthropy and corporate governance specialists said that while agreements to personally guarantee against losses were highly unusual, they did not violate any nonprofit laws - as long as the organization made the proper disclosures and forbade trustees from voting on matters in which they had a personal stake.
Several experts said they admired the deal the 92nd Street Y had with the fund managers because of how it upended the traditional risk-reward equation that came with investing, especially in the more volatile hedge fund sector.
"It's the proverbial win-win," said a New York-based philanthropy adviser who requested anonymity because she works with a number of the city's charitable organizations and did not want to risk alienating them. "The Y gets the benefit of potentially lavish hedge fund returns, while limiting their downside risk to zero."
But others point to an issue that has long been debated in philanthropy circles: Should members of a nonprofit's board be managing its money, regardless of any special deals they cut for the organization?
The problem is that a nonprofit that does business with its board members subjects itself to accusations of favoritism, say critics of the practice. Another concern is whether the organization has done the same due diligence on its directors' money management firms as it would for funds unconnected to the board.
"With all the money managers in New York City, I'm not sure it's necessary to select people who are also trustees of the school," said Richard Chait, a research professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
New York's elite private schools have something of a high-class problem, as their boards are filled with top Wall Street executives. They write big checks for capital campaigns and consistently donate generous sums to the annual fund. But they also offer access to hedge funds and private equity funds, many of which are closed to new investors - or at least nonconnected ones.
As colleges and universities have shifted investments over the last decade away from plain-vanilla stocks and bonds and into more high-risk, high-reward investments like hedge funds and private equity, private schools have followed suit. And a driving force has been the presence of some of the prominent investors on the schools' boards.
At Horace Mann there's Eric Mindich, the former Goldman Sachs wunderkind who founded Eton Park Capital Management, a multibillion-dollar hedge fund. The Ethical Culture Fieldston School has Laura Blankfein, the wife of the Goldman Sachs chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein. The Dalton School's board includes Douglas Braunstein, the chief financial officer of JPMorgan Chase.
Yet despite these schools' deep Wall Street ties, several of them, including Dalton and Horace Mann, have a policy of not investing money with their trustees to avoid a conflict of interest or any appearance of favoritism.
Many of the 92nd Street Y's board members send, or have sent, their children to its nursery school, where the competition for openings is intense. Their largess also accounts for a sizable portion of the institution's financing. During 2009 and 2010, board donations accounted for nearly half of the 92 St Y's total contributions, according to its financial statements.
A decade ago, the 92nd Street Y suffered through an embarrassing episode when it emerged that Sanford I. Weill, then the chief executive of Citigroup, tried to help the twins of Jack Grubman, the bank's star stock analyst, gain admission to the preschool. Citigroup donated $1 million to the organization around the time that Mr. Weill made his request. Both Citigroup and Mr. Weill denied any wrongdoing.
Mr. Paulson's two daughters attended the 92nd Street Y nursery school. At least one of them now goes to Spence, an all-girls private school on the Upper East Side. Mr. Paulson joined Spence's board last year and manages money for the school.
It is unclear whether he has a similar agreement in place with Spence as his one with the 92nd Street Y. A representative for Spence declined to comment.

HIGHLIGHT: General Motors began production of its 100 millionth small-block V-8 engine, a 638-horsepower LS9, on Tuesday. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 On Tuesday, workers at the General Motors Performance Build Center began producing the 100 millionth example of the company's small-block V-8 engine. The engine, an LS9 that, when built, would typically be fitted to a Chevrolet Corvette ZR1, is destined for the company's historical collection. The first small-block V-8 was developed by G.M. in 1955. (General Motors)
 Mazda signed a memorandum of understanding with OJSC Sollers, the Russian automotive manufacturer, to establish a joint venture in Russia. Under the deal, Sollers would build and sell Mazda-branded passenger cars to serve Russia's far eastern market. Sollers had previously entered an agreement with Ford to manufacture Ford-branded passenger cars for the Russian market. (Agence France-Presse)
 A123 Systems, the battery manufacturer based outside Boston, is expected to idle 125 workers at two plants in Michigan, where it builds lithium-ion battery packs to serve General Motors and other automakers. An executive with the manufacturer attributed the slowdown to production delays at Fisker Automotive, which revised its 2011 delivery targets from 7,000 to 1,500 units after issues with its wiring harnesses caused the automaker to slow production of its Karma hybrid. The Karma uses a pack developed by A123. (Automotive News)
 Volvo is offering a power upgrade for XC60, XC70 and S60 models equipped with the automaker's 3-liter in-line 6-cylinder engine. A dealer-installed software upgrade remaps the control unit on T6 engines to yield 25 extra horsepower, for a total of 325. Torque is increased from 325 pound-feet to 355 pound-feet. Fuel economy ratings are unchanged, according to Volvo. The upgrade costs $1,495. (Automobile)
 On Monday, Volvo also announced the immediate appointment of John Maloney as the new president of its American unit. Mr. Maloney was formerly the automaker's vice president of marketing communications in the United States, but was acting president since May. He replaced Doug Speck, who moved to a senior marketing appointment at the Volvo Car Corporation. To date, sales for the automaker are up 27 percent in the United States over their 2010 levels. (Volvo)
 A software developer recently demonstrated how to remotely fire the ignition of his Acura with the voice-recognition software of his Apple iPhone 4S. The developer used the voice-command system, called Siri, in tandem with the Viper Smart Start, an aftermarket push-button remote ignition system. The spoken command of "Start my car" turned over the car's engine, while "Stop my car" disengaged it. (Gizmodo)

HEADLINE: Americans Used to Be Much More Anti-Tax

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Congressional Republicans may have become more anti-tax in the last 30 years, but the American public has made the opposite transition. 

 BODY:
In addition to his Economix post, Bruce Bartlett also has a Tax Notes column today looking at public support for raising taxes (instead of or in addition to cutting spending) to narrow federal deficits. He found dozens of surveys conducted over the last year showing that most Americans believe that taxes should be part of any deficit reduction package.
Incidentally, for an article (and related blog post) I wrote a while back on the evolution of deficit deals, I asked The Times's polling department to see how American attitudes toward debt consolidation packages had changed in the last three decades. They pulled up the polls below.
As you'll see, Congressional Republicans may have become more anti-tax in the last 30 years, but the American public has made the opposite transition: in March 1982, three-quarters of Americans said spending cuts alone should be used to reduce deficits; today, about the same share say tax increases should be included in any debt-reduction package. Remember, of course, that tax rates were much higher 30 years ago than they are today.
NBC News/Associated Press Poll, March 1982
In order to help reduce the federal budget deficit, which of the following would you prefer -- federal income tax increases or federal spending cuts?
13% Tax increases
77% Spending cuts
4% Both (volunteered)
6 % Don't know
Time/Yankelovich, Skelly & White Poll, November 1985
What do you think should be done to reduce the federal deficit? Do you think we should: cut government spending, raise taxes, or both cut our spending and raise taxes?
54% Cut government spending
4% Raise taxes
36% Both cut our spending and raise taxes
6% Not sure (volunteered)
Gallup, May 1988
There are a number of ways to reduce the federal budget deficit, if the government decides to. Some people say we can reduce the deficit simply by cutting spending. Others say a combination of spending cuts and tax increases is required. Which of these views comes closer to your own?
47% Cutting spending
39% Combination of spending cuts and tax increases
2% Do neither (volunteered)
12% Don't know/Undecided
Quinnipiac University Poll, March 2010
To reduce the federal budget deficit do you think there should be a combination of tax increases and spending cuts, or that only taxes should be raised, or only that spending should be cut?
42% Combination
4% Only tax increases
49% Only spending cuts
5% Don't know/No answer
New York Times/CBS News, September 2011
Do you think any plan to reduce the federal budget deficit should include only tax increases, or only spending cuts, or a combination of both tax increases and spending cuts?
3% Only tax increases
21% Only spending cuts
71% Both
5% Don't know/No answer
Time/Abt SRBI Poll, October 2011
Over all, what do you think is the best way to reduce the federal budget deficit -- by cutting federal spending, by raising taxes, or by a combination of both?

HEADLINE: Cain Speaks on Foreign Policy, Avoiding Accusations

BYLINE: SUSAN SAULNY


HIGHLIGHT: Herman Cain addressed a crowd of several hundred in a college gymnasium in Michgan, but he made no mention of the allegations against him, instead focusing on vague and optimistic foreign policy ideals. 

 BODY:
HILLSDALE, Mich. -- Seemingly unbowed by the escalating scandal about his sexual conduct, Herman Cain addressed a crowd of several hundred in a college gymnasium here Monday night, but he made no mention of the allegations against him, instead focusing on vague and optimistic foreign policy ideals.
The speech was intended to bolster Mr. Cain's standing on international issues and national security, areas that - in addition to the multiple allegations of sexual harassment and now the claim of an extramarital affair - have proven to be major stumbling points on the campaign trail. Mr. Cain delivered the speech in his usually dramatic tone, replete with catchy, preacherlike cadences, but it fell flat with the audience for a lack of detail and because it ignored the main issue on everyone mind: is he or isn't he dropping out of the race?
Mr. Cain, who arrived to the gym and left without taking questions or speaking with reporters, did not say. Mr. Cain did make several oblique references that might have seemed to be about his own predicament. But overall, his message was directed outward and was not introspective.
"Life can be a challenge," he said. "Life can seem impossible. It's never easy when there's so much on the line. But you can make a difference. There's a mission just for you."
At no point did Mr. Cain get the kind of boisterous responses that had become typical for him on the campaign trail. There were no ovations or chants of his name. Many in the audience were students at Hillsdale College, a school in a politically conservative county in southern Michigan, west of Detroit.
At times, the applause seemed only tepid. After one attempt at a joke, Mr. Cain wondered aloud whether anyone got it.
Of his foreign policy philosophy, he said: "Our objective is real simple: peace. We've always been about peace. But the question is how do we maintain peace in the world? It starts with strength. Military strength, economic strength and moral strength. No strength, no peace."
"I thought it was impressive in some parts, but some of the statements were really cliche," said John Rasche, 22, of Hillsdale. "I thought it was a good speech, but I don't know if it will help him in the long run."
"Right now, I'm jaded about the whole scandal," he continued. "I'm really disheartened by this, because I thought he was a promising candidate. Now he's reconsidering his campaign. So if he's shaken by it, the rest of the country must be, too."
After Mr. Cain's remarks, J.D. Gordon, his spokesman, confirmed that the campaign was continuing to reassess its strategy. But when asked how that strategy might change, he would only say, "That remains to be seen."

HEADLINE: Big City Book Club: 'Breakfast at Tiffany's'

BYLINE: GINIA BELLAFANTE


HIGHLIGHT: Starting at 1 p.m., the Big City Book Club will be discussing Truman Capote's "Breakfast at Tiffany's," a magnificent, economical account of failed reinvention in a city where, needless to say, legions come and never ascend as high as their aspirations would have them go. 

 BODY:
Norman Mailer famously called Truman Capote the most perfect writer of his generation, saying of "Breakfast at Tiffany's'' that he would not change two words. The 1961 film that came out three years after the novel's publication of course changed many words, siphoning off the book's abiding spirit of melancholy. When I encountered it for the first time, years ago, just out of college, I felt a race of fury over the liberties and licenses Hollywood had taken in its rendering. Holly's profession is hardly glossed over in the novel, and her neighbor, the book's unnamed narrator, does not and cannot provide her with a happy ending. I'm interested in hearing from all of you, but especially from those who have just read the book for the first time, presumably after some familiarity with the iconic film. 
"Breakfast at Tiffany's'' is a magnificent, economical account of failed reinvention in a city where, needless to say, legions come and never ascend as high as their aspirations would have them go. The subject was one in which Capote had a visceral interest. His own mother, Lillie Mae Persons, fled the South and remade herself as Nina Capote, after marrying a Cuban businessman, but killed herself in 1954, four years before "Breakfast at Tiffany's'' was published. Holly Golightly, born Lulamae Barnes, hails from Tulip, Texas, and shameful beginnings she is ever reluctant to discuss. "The main reason I wrote about Holly," the author said in a Playboy interview, "outside of the fact that I liked her so much, was that she was such a symbol of all these girls who come to New York and spin in the sun for a moment like May flies and then disappear."
These women still come and languish and get weeded out, unable to stand up to the city's incivilities. They cannot land their acting careers or book contracts or wealthy Park Avenue husbands. Holly is eaten up by the high life. Her stuttering, belle laide roommate lands the wealthy gay bachelor. The rich Brazilian flees. Her relationships with gangster pals result in drug charges. Her failure is baroque. It was not enough for Capote to send her off to middle-class housewife existence - perhaps in Queens or Staten Island or New Jersey. That, of course, would have been its own kind of tragedy, but Capote allows Holly to be banished by the force of her own hope. She is somewhere far away, still propelled by a wondrous, misguided optimism.
For decades readers and writers have speculated about the real Holly Golightly. Who was the inspiration? Was it Capote's mother? Gloria Vanderbilt? The beautiful New Yorker writer Maeve Brennan? From the '50s through the early '70s, Brennan wrote the Long Winded Lady column for that magazine. Like Holly, she was in possession of childlike eccentricities, an air of elusiveness and a devotion to both big glasses and her cat. Holly was all of those people, surely, and perhaps most significantly Capote himself, the ultimate "real phony,'' a man whose crazed wish to inhabit his affectations had a kind of undeniable purity. (For a terrific account of the concept of "real phonies'' in post-war American literature, I recommendthis book, by the way.)
So what do you all make of Holly Goligthly? Is she a timeless representation of a certain kind of New York existence? So many people do come here to sell something in the end, don't they? And what of Holly's relationship to the narrator? This kind of friendship, too, seems so particular to New York (or rather to the New York that belongs to the young): languorous, intense, fleeting, full of lost hours in the night. I will be eager to keep the discussion afloat and answer all questions this afternoon, starting at 1 p.m. Thanks for joining me.

HEADLINE: Straight Talk on Climate Progress in California and Beyond

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: More analysis supports the need for intensified research on energy frontiers if ambitious greenhouse gas targets are to be met. 

 BODY:
Dec. 7, 1:11 a.m. | Updated below |
With the latest round of contentious international climate treaty negotiations getting under way in Durban, South Africa, it's worth revisiting what would be required to meet ambitious targets set for greenhouse gases in California, a state that already has pledged meaningful action.
There's a new peer-reviewed study of California's plans, published in the current issue of Science, that largely echoes points made in a study by the California Council on Science and Technology issued earlier this year showing the scope of what would have to happen and the limits of known technologies.
Some details on the new study are below. But first it's worth checking in on realistic paths to climate progress with a reliable guide -- Nate Lewis, the head of the federal energy innovation hub on fuels from sunlight and a chemist at the California Institute of Technology.
Lewis is not only involved with cutting-edge research on next-generation technology, but has contributed to various assessments of options for achieving targets in that state and the nation, including the California Council study.
A few weeks ago, we had a long Skype chat about California's much discussed plan to cut its emissions of greenhouse gases 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.
His conclusion, which I see as robustly supported by peer-reviewed work (including the new paper), is that California could get roughly halfway to that goal in a perfect world - one without impediments such as higher costs, nimby fights and resistance from consumers and industries wedded to fossil fuels.
But even in that perfect world, Lewis says, citing the reviewed literature, fundamental leaps in basic energy sciences would be required to get all the way - and the nation and world are not investing at anywhere the level that would be required in the related sciences and in development and demonstration of promising technologies.
Looking beyond California to the nation, Lewis cited a National Academy of Sciences report he co-authored with 40 experts in energy technology on a path to getting more than half of the country's electricity from renewable sources by mid-century:
Everybody agreed that if we were going to get more than half of our electricity in our country from renewables by 2050 we were going to have to do things that we simply don't know how to do today at all and fundamentally change the way we use, generate and consume energy [relevant section here]. That's completely in agreement with the California report. And it's different than people who would tell you that we have all the technology we need and we just need the political will and let's be done with it. That's not what any technically knowledgeable panel concludes.
Here's a bit more from Lewis on this point, with more below:

It's notable that Lewis said this in a chat recorded weeks ago, well before publication of the new Science paper -- "The Technology Path to Deep Greenhouse Gas Emissions Cuts by 2050: The Pivotal Role of Electricity."
Joe Romm, the senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who writes the Climate Progress blog, proclaimed awhile back that I pulled a "Charlie Sheen" when I blogged on the California Council study that Lewis participated in. (Romm removed the Charlie Sheen headline from his post soon after it was published, but it lives on.)
[Nov. 30, 4:11 p.m. | Update | Romm covered the new paper by posting the Lawrence Berkeley news release, which includes this optimistic conclusion: "The scientists say that all of this will be technologically feasible by 2050 if today's pace of innovation continues."
That line seemed at odds with the conclusions of the paper, so I checked with Margaret Torn, one of the authors of the study from Lawrence Berkeley. She wrote: "The phrase 'today's pace of innovation' ... does not come from the study and was poorly chosen; it should have been 'an aggressive pace of innovation'..."]
One thing Romm forgets (or chooses to ignore) when he tries to rebut me is that I'm not debating him; I'm his arguments, along with output from a host of people directly involved in energy research and analysis. 
Even with all of the potential flaws in peer review, I'll take such sources any day over other input. If you take "80 by 2050" arguments seriously, don't take my word for it in weighing the merits and flaws of Romm's call for massive deployment with a sprinkling of R&D. Listen to Lewis, and -- more important -- read the reports he cites.
In considering California's energy challenge, the required breakthroughs of deepest concern to Lewis are:
- the need for a transportation fuel that is produced with no emissions of greenhouse gases (his research focus),
- the need to deal with the reality that any very low emissions path for California will require the state's production of electricity (without emissions) even after an aggressive, sustained push to conserve energy. (This doubling is required because so many energy services now supplied with fossil fuels would have to be electrified.)
Among other issues, doubling the state's electricity supply by 2050 while cutting emissions is only possible if there is some way to compensate for the inevitable large fluctuations in solar or wind supplies using some large source of electricity -- but one that produces no emissions.
Keep in mind, of course, that for any of this to influence trajectories for climate in this century, whatever energy revolution is pursued in California would have to be echoed from Texas to Ohio and eventually to China and India.
Here's more from my chat with Lewis:
I asked Lewis if California is a worst case or best case for carbon dioxide cuts compared to the rest of the country, given its success in energy thrift in recent decades. His response? It's both.
I asked him to characterize how important it would be to bolster the country's "intellectual infrastructure" even as work is done to update our energy infrastructure. He said:
You cannot get to where we need to go with just what we know how to do today. Which means we need to learn to not only evolve faster, better, cheaper what we know how to do today, we also need to do things we don't know how to do today. That doesn't mean you don't start now doing what you know how to do. It does mean that you shouldn't have your head in the sand and know that 40 yards away you can't get from here to there because the Grand Canyon is in between and you never built a bridge.
So if you really cared about meeting the target, if you really cared about making sure hat the odds were stacked in your favor, if that's what you really cared about, you would be deploying, you would be lowering costs and you would be having multiple options to figure out a way to do the stuff that we don't know how to do so that we would succeed. If you don't care about succeeding and you just care about pushing your agenda then you would leave out that last key step and I'm not willing to bet the Earth on leaving it out.
When I asked what level of public investment in R and D would be appropriate to the task, he answered:
If you look at the percentage of revenue devoted to R and D by industries that have to run fast or die it's between 10 and15 percent . By that measure we should be spending $150 billion a year on energy R and D to run fast or die. You can say maybe the private sector should be spending two thirds of that. That still leaves $50 billion a year. Maybe that's too high. Cut it by two, you're $25 billion a year on R and D. That's roughly comparable to the National Institutes of Health, which I think is the right measure.
We don't even spend $2 billion on clean energy R and D in our country. Unless we get the number up to something like $20, 30 or $50 billion a year, based on tried and true business practices, we are very unlikely to be able to meet the technology pace of change that would be needed.
I also asked him to characterize the views of those opposing any action to constrain emissions. He replied with an allusion to "Dirty Harry":
This is much more a question of, "Do you feel lucky, punk?" with the Earth. If you want to roll the dice you do what you're doing. And I think it's pretty interesting that the people who call themselves by label, quote, "conservatives," are the big gamblers here. And the people that want to see the planet the way we got it from our parents and theirs and keep it the way it is are called the nonconservatives in this particular debate.
I'll close out with a bit more on the news Science paper. There's more on California's (and the world's) energy options in an audio interview conducted by Science's news staff with one of the authors of the new paper, Snuller Price, an energy and climate policy analyst at E3, a consulting firm in San Francisco.
In the interview (transcript here), Price describes the scope of the challenge created by the massive electrification of nearly every energy sector this way:
Even after the amount of energy efficiency that we're talking about, California would still need to build [the equivalent of*] one and a half to two new nuclear plants every year through 2050. To put it in perspective, California only has two nuclear plants.
A direct challenge to Joe Romm's "deploy, deploy, deploy" mantra comes in Price's answer to a question about priorities from the interviewer, Kerry Klein. Here's her question:
So, this is all centered around these goals that have to be implemented by 2050. So, right now in the year 2011, almost 2012, what do we have to do right now?
Here's Price's answer:
So, the most important thing that we have to do right now, and it is quite urgent, is continuing to invest in research and development. If you think about the scale of the amount of new electric generation we need, it's truly massive. And this is the decade to really improve the technology and get the costs down to a level where we can really keep it on a sustainable, long-term path, so getting the costs down of renewable energy, figuring out how we can do energy efficiency and retrofits more cost effectively. Basically, we have to get the learning done so that the prices are reasonable, before we have to buy in bulk.
Just in case Romm and Robert Collier, the "leading journalist and climate expert" heavily cited in Romm's California post, are tempted to criticize Price as an energy Charlie Sheen, they should note that his co-authors on the new study include several analysts at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the federal research hub that Collier called "the Vatican of energy efficiency work."
3:31 p.m. | Updated above |
*Snuller Price wrote to say that he said, or intended to say, "the equivalent of" one and a half to two nuclear power plants in the interview with Kerry Klein quoted above (from the Science transcript). He added, "For what it is worth I'm not a big fan of massive deployment of new nuclear using the existing technologies because of waste, accidents, and proliferation." 
Dec. 7, 1:12 a.m. | Updated 
Robert Collier posted a piece on the disagreement between Joe Romm and me over the mix of deployment of known technology and basic inquiry and development of new technology required if targets for greenhouse gases like those of California are to be seen as more than wishful thinking. I added this comment there:
When virtual knives (or charges of Charlie Sheen moments) aren't flying, Joe and I clearly agree on the false dichotomy of deploy OR invent/innovate. I've said this; he's said this. In my video interview with Nate Lewis of Caltech in the relevant post, he said this as well. Two parts are here: http://www.youtube.com/revkin
I stress innovation and R&D because they are deeply discounted in our politics and discourse, which are torqued toward the near term and off the shelf (even at a big price premium). Joe stresses massive deployment, which is his privilege. 
My take also draws on the wisdom of people like Lewis, the Caltech scientist who runs one of the federal energy innovation hubs. Here's a bit more from our Q&A in case you don't have time to listen to the tape:
Revkin: There's all this, to me, false drama about deployment versus innovation or whatever. To my mind, and I think to your mind, this is hardly an either or situation, is that fair to say? 
Lewis: It's not even hardly either-or. It's an and-and or it won't get done.
Revkin: How important is it to factor in building our intellectual infrastructure even as we work on these questions about changing our energy infrastructure? 
Lewis: You cannot get to where we need to go with just what we know how to do today. Which means we need to learn to not only evolve faster, better, cheaper what we know how to do today, we also need to do things we don't know how to do today. That doesn't mean you don't start now doing what you know how to do. It does mean that you shouldn't have your head in the sand and know that 40 yards away you can't get from here to there because the Grand Canyon is in between and you never built a bridge. 
So if you really cared about meeting the target, if you really cared about making sure that the odds were stacked in your favor, if that's what you really carted about, you would be deploying, you would be lowering costs and you would be having multiple options to figure out a way to do the stuff that we don't know how to do so that we would succeed. If you don't care about succeeding and you just care about pushing your agenda then you would leave out that last key step and I'm not willing to bet the Earth on leaving it out.

HEADLINE: Worker Transit Benefits Scheduled to Shrink

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Pretax benefits for those who take public transportation to work are scheduled to shrink Jan. 1. 

 BODY:
If you qualify for pretax transit benefits, you'll probably see the perk shrink starting in January.
The benefit allows employees to lower their federal tax bill by setting aside pretax money to pay for the cost of taking public transportation (or van pools, in less urban areas) to work. The cap, now $230 a month, was about half that amount until Congress increased it temporarily in 2009. The move put the transit benefit on par with a similar $230-a-month benefit available to help commuters pay for parking.
The maximum parking benefit will become $240 monthly as of Jan. 1, because of an adjustment for inflation. The transit benefit, however, is scheduled to drop to $125 a month, unless Congress acts to extend the higher benefit level or to make it permanent. Roughly 2.7 million people use the transit benefit, according to Commuter Benefits Work for Us, a coalition of transit groups and businesses.
Last year, facing a similar deadline, lawmakers voted to extend the higher level of transit benefits for 2011. But it's unclear if Congress will take action on the issue before the end of this year, said Scott Bogren, a spokesman for the Community Transportation Association of America, which supports the higher benefit level.
The association and other coalition members are urging those who use public transportation to voice their support for an extension of the higher benefit level on a special Web site.
Do you use the pretax transit benefit? Will the reduction in benefit affect your commuting plans?
A report in the Best of Bucks column on Saturday about a reduction in federal pretax transit benefits for 2012 misstated the maximum amounts employees can set aside before taxes next year to pay for the cost of parking or taking public transportation to work. The maximum monthly parking benefit, starting in January, is $240, not $230, and the maximum monthly transit benefit will be $125, not $120.

HEADLINE: Christmas in the Family Car

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: The "60 Minutes" segment on homeless kids full of gratitude and hope may have you rethinking your holiday budget. 

 BODY:
Do we think "60 Minutes" intentionally aired its second "Hard Times Generation" segment, profiling kids living in cars, brushing their teeth at gas stations and telling the reporter Scott Pelley that they just do what they have to do to get by, on the Sunday between Black Friday and Cyber Monday? We do.
More than 15 million Americans watched as Arielle Metzger, a high school freshman who has lived in a van for the past five months, declared her gratitude for her father and brother and her intent - after she takes full advantage of the education that's "everything" to her - to become a children's defense lawyer. On the other hand, the National Retail Federation reports that 226 million of us shopped online or in stores over the weekend. That's not exactly a contrast - there's no real connection between watching "60 Minutes" and consumer spending - but I'm willing to bet that if 226 million people watched 8-year-old Jade Wiley and her family paint hotel rooms in order to keep the one they're staying in, or heard Marquis Gines talk about staying up all night to watch over his mom and keep her safe, at least 200 million of us would at the very least feel even more grateful that we had that money to spend.
The Annie E. Casey Foundation's Kids Count puts the number of kids living in poverty in America at close to 25 percent. Nineteen percent live in homes that are "food insecure" and 28 percent in homes without a parent who has full-time, steady employment. What you think should be done to help those kids depends in large part on your politics, but I hope that whether we need to help isn't a question. 
I don't think charity is in any way a full answer, but while we work toward long-term change that will help prevent "60 Minutes" from filming "Hard Times Generation" Segments 3 through 10, donating time or money to charitable organizations working with homeless families is the best way to offer immediate help. There are Florida charities, some mentioned in the "60 Minutes" story. There are local charities, or The New York Times's Neediest Cases fund (which recently featured a homeless teenager preparing for college). If you're so moved, and capable, you could find one and donate.
But donations aside, what are we - as a nation - going to do, not only to help the kids who are already homeless, but to keep others from joining their ranks? These numbers, and these stories, beg for action. But if the answers were easy, Arielle Metzger wouldn't be doing her homework in the front seat.
An earlier version of this post, citing "60 Minutes," erroneously stated that one-third of homeless families in America live in Florida. According to The St. Petersburg Times, while a third of all families without any kind of shelter at all live in Florida, the state's share of all homeless families, including those with and without shelter (for example, those staying in motels or with relatives), is 10 percent.

HEADLINE: S.&P. Cuts Its Ratings for 15 Banks

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG, BEN PROTESS and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ


HIGHLIGHT: Using a new standard announced recently, Standard and Poor's reduced the credit rating for seven of the top eight American banks, as well as banks in Europe. 

 BODY:
9:37 p.m. | Updated 
Standard & Poor's on Tuesday downgraded some of the world's largest financial institutions, another blow to an industry that continues to struggle three years after the darkest hours of the financial crisis.
The agency lowered by one notch its long-term credit ratings on some of the biggest and best-known banks in the United States, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase. The action, the result of S.&P. applying new standards to 37 financial firms around the world, prompted a downgrade of 15 banks. Among the eight largest banks in the United States under review by S.&P., only Boston-based State Street was spared.
"We've been doing a lot of deep thinking, and this goes back to taking account of lessons learned during the financial crisis," said Craig Parmelee, head of the agency's North American financial institutions practice.
Rating agencies, which were criticized for being too slow to sound the alarms about the 2008 financial crisis, have recently been carrying out an aggressive wave of downgrades. In September, Moody's cut its credit ratings on three large banks: Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. Moody's said the downgrades were warranted because it believed the federal government was less likely to extend a helping hand to ailing banks as it did in the wake of the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in the fall of 2008.
On Tuesday, S.&P. left 20 other banks unchanged and actually increased the ratings on two Chinese firms, the China Construction Bank and the Bank of China.
But for most financial institutions in the United States and Europe, it has been tough sledding this year.
In the United States, banks have been battling falling profits as economic woes and new regulations have eaten into profits. Overseas, concerns that European countries like Greece and Italy could default on their own debt payments have sent shockwaves through global markets, deepening the problems of American banks.
As the profit engines have slowed, cost-cutting has become a central focus. Over the summer, Goldman said that it would wring out $1.2 billion in costs from its operations by mid-2012, a move that eliminated more than 1,000 jobs. Bank of America, perhaps the most beleaguered of all banks, announced it could eventually lay off 30,000 employees as part of a wide-ranging plan to save $5 billion in annual costs by the end of 2013.
Even before the downgrade by S.&P., which came after the stock market's close on Tuesday, Bank of America's shares were hitting new lows for the year. At one point the stock touched $5.03, before closing at $5.08, a loss of 3.2 percent for the day.
This was the lowest point for Bank of America since the dark days of March 2009, when bank stocks and the broader market hit bottom in the wake of the financial crisis.
Some investors are uneasy that breaking the $5 level will mean a new chapter in Bank of America's troubles, causing some institutional managers to sell and taking the bank into the low single-digit realm usually reserved for faltering companies.
"Bank of America is a microcosm of the crisis of confidence in the industry - in the numbers, the managers and the regulators," said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst with Credit Agricole.
Bank of America is not alone in watching its stock price fall. Shares of Goldman Sachs have dropped more than 47 percent so far this year. Its stock closed Tuesday at $88.81.
S.&P.'s decision to issue broad downgrades is hardly surprising. The action come weeks after the rating agency overhauled its method for grading financial institutions. Now, the agency plans to keep a closer watch on whether banks have put away enough capital for rainy days. It also will pay particular attention to the overall health of the economy in the institution's home country, and whether that country's government will step in to bail out firms in times of extreme stress.
Mr. Parmelee of S.&P. likened the change to "emphasizing the neighborhood before we begin to analyze the house."
At the time of S.&P.'s announcement of its new rating method earlier this month, the agency signaled that it would lower the long-term ratings of as many as 15 percent of the banks it reviewed and would change the ratings on 40 percent. Investors, analysts said, should also pay particular attention to any short-term rating changes because that affects a bank's cost of daily borrowing.
"We believe that the industry is at a crossroads and that there are several inflection points, and it's too early to tell how each will play out," Jayan Dhru, S.&P.'s head of global financial ratings, said in a video explaining the new criteria. "With more stringent capital and liquidity requirements and restrictions on higher-risk activities, the profitability of banking is likely to be much lower than it was before the crisis. This may be acceptable from a creditworthiness perspective, but the impact of business models and global growth may be significant."
Investors continue to keep a close eye on Bank of America.
While the firm is in a stronger financial position than it was in 2009, investors remain deeply concerned about its potential losses from harmful subprime mortgages packaged by Countrywide Financial, the mortgage specialist Bank of America acquired in 2008.
In addition, as the second-largest bank in the United States after JPMorgan Chase, it remains vulnerable to any downshift in the United States economy, which has been posting anemic growth. Mr. Mayo said the ratings cut was not "life-threatening," but was another indication that the Bank of America would face higher financing costs in the future. That would eat into its thin profit margins.
Then there is Europe. Bank of America has several billion dollars in direct exposure to Europe, but investors also worry that a deepening of the crisis over sovereign debt will hurt the broader banking group and ripple through financial markets.
Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer, questioned the timing of the downgrade, noting that Bank of America's loan losses and nonperforming assets were at levels well below where they were two years ago, while its capital had nearly doubled.
"They should have downgraded Bank of America back then," he said. "This is confirmation that rating agencies are lagging indicators."

TOP STORIES
Parent of American Airlines Files for Bankruptcy | The AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday in an effort to reduce labor costs and shed its heavy debt burden.
AMR was the last major airline company in the United States to file for Chapter 11. Analysts said that its reluctance to do so earlier had left it less nimble than many of its competitors.
The company says it intends to operate a normal flight schedule throughout the bankruptcy process, as previous airlines have done, and does not expect the restructuring to affect its frequent flier programs. 
As of Sept. 30, AMR had $24.7 billion in assets and $29.6 billion in debt, according to a filing with the federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan. DealBook 
Money Found in Britain May Belong to MF Global | About $200 million in customer money that vanished from MF Global is believed to have surfaced at JPMorgan Chase in Britain, according to people briefed on the matter. The discovery could be the most significant breakthrough in a monthlong hunt for the missing funds.
During MF Global's last chaotic days, the brokerage firm overdrew an account at JPMorgan, according to another person close to the matter. Some investigators now believe the firm used customer funds to patch at least some of the hole, which would have been a significant breach of federal law.
MF Global transferred the roughly $200 million in the days before the firm filed for bankruptcy, said the people, who requested anonymity because the investigation was incomplete. DealBook

Mergers & Acquisitions 
AT&T's 11th-Hour Plan to Save Its Deal With T-Mobile | AT&T is knee-deep in talks with Leap Wireless, a second-tier but growing wireless player, to sell it a big piece of T-Mobile USA's customer accounts and some of its wireless spectrum, according to people involved in the negotiations, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in his DealBook column.
AT&T hopes such a deal would placate the Justice Department enough for it to drop its opposition to AT&T's acquisition of T-Mobile, these people said, or at least to strengthen AT&T's hand if it goes to trial. The deal would make Leap the fourth-largest wireless carrier in the nation, but it would allow AT&T to retain enough of T-Mobile's valuable wireless spectrum, which it says it badly needs to provide the kind of next-generation service that its customers expect, these people said.

HEADLINE: Barron's Heroes, Felder's Ambitions and Other Bits of Politics

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: Whatever they may lack in cosmic value, some recent political developments have eye-catching potential. Also, what City Room is reading in other newspapers and blogs. 

 BODY:
Take a few days off, and you never know what you'll miss in this city. So for the benefit of those of you who had better things to do during the Thanksgiving break, here's a roundup of some political developments. They make up in eye-catching potential for what they may lack in cosmic value.
 On Sunday, City Councilman Charles Barron announced that he would run for the House seat held by Representative Edolphus Towns. Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries is also interested in replacing Mr. Towns. All are Brooklyn Democrats, though Mr. Barron allowed that he was as "sick and tired" of his own party as he was of the Republicans. "They're all the same," he said.
 But party labels are not the issue here. The real point is that if most voters in that district love despots, especially African despots, Mr. Barron should be a shoo-in.
 "Robert Mugabe is my hero," he told dozens of supporters gathered on a street corner in East New York.
 "And guess what? So is Muammar Qaddafi." 
 This is well-worn territory for the councilman, a former Black Panther who delights in laying most of the world's ills at the feet of white men (and who, it must be said, is not wide of the mark in certain situations).
 In 2002, he was host to a City Hall reception for Mr. Mugabe, the president of Zimbabwe, who once liberated his country from oppressive rule by a white minority in what was then called Rhodesia. That was long ago. For many years now, Mr. Mugabe is known primarily for having turned Zimbabwe into a land of hunger - a human-rights basket case as well as an economic disaster.
 Mr. Barron is unfazed by such inconvenient details. "He's an African hero," the councilman said on Sunday.
 Colonel Qaddafi - how is it that, through four decades of ruling Libya, he never made it to the rank of general? - has entered the Barron pantheon since his death at rebel hands last month. "You should never have bombed Libya, and you should never have murdered Qaddafi," the councilman said to the crowd on Sunday. "He's an African hero."
 Another hero.
 We'll say this for Mr. Barron: Not everyone would think about running for office on a pro-Qaddafi plank. "I'm going to tell it like it is," he said. Of course, that depends on what one's definition of "is" is. Some would say there are two realities. There's Mr. Barron's reality. And then there's reality.
 It is hard to disagree with the councilman on at least one point, though. In discussing Congress, he pointed out that "they only have 9 percent approval rating." They "deserve every bit of the 9 percent," he added.
 In another part of Brooklyn, Borough Park, there was political talk of a different sort. The Daily News reported on Monday that Simcha Felder, a deputy city comptroller and a former city councilman, would abandon his fellow Democrats and run in 2012 as a Republican for a State Senate seat that would be created through redistricting.
 If true, it would make Mr. Felder a serial political jumper, someone who makes a weather vane look like a symbol of constancy.
 In 2008, he was a leading force in the extension of term limits, a self-serving change that made it possible for him and other council members - and let's not forget the mayor - to seek third terms otherwise prohibited to them. Sure enough, Mr. Felder ran in 2009, and won.
 But a mere five days into his new term, he resigned to become a deputy comptroller, at a salary nearly 50 percent higher than what he had been making. Mr. Felder, an Orthodox Jew, described this move at the time as "Kiddush Hashem" - sanctification of God's name, in Hebrew.
 Now, not even two years into his sanctifying job in the comptroller's office, he may be on the go again.
 A polite man, Mr. Felder returned a phone call that we placed to ask if the latest report about him was true. "The only thing that's true," he said, "is that I have no comment."
 We'll take that as a nondenial.
 Oh, one more bit of politics that you may have missed was a new rumbling that Donald J. Trump might consider running for president.
 What's that you say? On that score, you missed nothing?
 Yeah, maybe you're right.

HEADLINE: Romney Nabs Influential Endorsements in Florida

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: The Cuban-American leaders in Florida - Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Mario Diaz-Balart and Lincoln Diaz-Balart -- agree to disagree with Mitt Romney about immigration. 

 BODY:
MIAMI - Standing amid boxes of agua de coco and guava bites, Mitt Romney came to southern Florida and imbued his usual speech with some Spanish flair.
Referring to Conchita, the family-owned grocery wholesaler here where he held his event, Mr. Romney said it felt appropriate to start off by talking about his own family.
"You probably did not know that my dad was not born in this country - he was born in Mexico," Mr. Romney said. "And at age 5- or 6-year-old, because of revolution in Mexico, my dad's dad came back to the United States and began a construction business. Didn't go so well, actually, not as well as Conchita has gone. He went bankrupt more than once."
Moments later, Mr. Romney called a member of his own family, his youngest son, Craig, up on stage.
"He's not always on the campaign trail, but I scooped him up from California, asked him to come join me today," Mr. Romney said. "He took a couple of years of Spanish in high school, so his Spanish wouldn't be terribly good, but he also lived in Chile for a couple of years. So I'm going to ask, you can you still speak a little Spanish?"
A bit bashfully, Craig took the microphone and offered a few words in Spanish to the crowd, which applauded loudly.
Mr. Romney was introduced by three influential Cuban-American leaders in Florida - Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, and former Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart. Earlier that morning, Mr. Romney had announced the support of Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and the Diaz-Balart brothers, and named them foreign policy advisers and members of his Latin American working group.
Four years ago, the three members of Congress endorsed Mr. Romney's rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and Mr. Romney struggled to win the support of Florida's Hispanic community. This time around, Mr. Romney - who has also nabbed the endorsement of former Senator Mel Martinez, another powerful Cuban-American leader - hopes to fare better, using Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and the Diaz-Balart brothers' existing political operations to help him shore up support among Cuban-Americans here.
"I am proud to be working with Ileana, Mario, and Lincoln," Mr. Romney said, in an e-mail statement. "They're conservative leaders who will help me articulate my vision to make America more prosperous at home and respected throughout the world."
Their support, however, could create an awkward situation for Mr. Romney, who recently has been critical of both Newt Gingrich and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas over their immigration stances, which he has cast as weak. Both Mario and Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen crossed party lines in 2010 to help House Democratslegislation, which would have created a path to legal status for some children of illegal immigrants.
In an interview before the event, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said that she did not agree with Mr. Romney on the issue of immigration, but that she was willing to overlook that in these tumultuous economic times.
"I'm never going to find a candidate with whom I agree 100 percent of time with 100 percent of the issues, but I think the election hinges on the economy," she said. "I don't agree with Governor Romney's position on immigration, but I agree with him solidly on the economy and for me, that's the driving force in this election."
Mr. Romney did not mention immigration at all, and kept his focus largely on the economy and President Obama, with nods to Miami's large Hispanic community. He attacked Mr. Obama on foreign policy, saying that the president had "distanced himself from some of our best friends - Colombia, Israel."
"If I'm president of the United States, I will strengthen America by maintaining a strong economy, strong culture, and strong military, but also by linking arms with our friends around the world, because America is strong if we stand with strong friends and I will do that," he said. "This is not a time for weakness or retreat. President Eisenhower said that care of liberty will not long be entrusted to the weak and the timid. Right now there's huge changes going on in Latin America, right here so close to our home. The changes could lead in either direction, either positive or negative. This is not a time for us to retreat from our principles."
After the event, when asked by a reporter about an ad that the Democratic National Committee released Monday attacking him, Mr. Romney seemed buoyant and confident.
"They don't want to see me as the nominee, that's for sure," he said. "It shows that they're awfully afraid of facing me in the general election. They want to throw the primary process to anybody but me, but bring it on. We're ready for 'em!"

HIGHLIGHT: What our writers have been reading. 

 BODY:
It's usually boring when critics criticize critics or analysts analyze their fellow analysts. As Yeats put it in "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen,"
Mock mockers after that
That would not lift a hand maybe
To help good, wise or great
To bar that foul storm out, for we
Traffic in mockery.
But a number of recent articles on the phenomenon of despising President Obama caught the attention of the writers and editors of Campaign Stops. We are passing them along to you in the first installment of what we're calling Primary Sources, which is essentially a collection of articles, essays and charts that we found useful or provocative as we put together Campaign Stops over its first few weeks.
Jonathan Chait, writing in New York magazine, takes liberal critics of the president to task for a host of failures that can be summed up in one word: whininess. At the Atlantic, Conor Friedersdorf argues that Chait leaves out presidential decisions and actions that should make liberals angry and fearful. This is turn provoked a guest blogger at the Angry Black Lady Chronicles to take Friedersdorf on. In the same issue of New York, David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, writes about how conservative critics of the president have gone a bit crazy. All of which prompted our own Ross Douthat to assess both Chait's and Frum's arguments and to find a few similarities among left- and right-wing critics of the president.
A Thanksgiving tradition at our house, in the year before a presidential election, is to make everyone sitting around the table write down on a slip of paper who they think will win the election, which we then collect in an envelope. After the election the following year, we open them. At Campaign Stops, we know how to live.
Often this exercise illustrates just how long a year in politics is. For example, more than one person picked Rudy Giuliani to win in 2008 (although of course this may also reflect a New York-centric bias). It also reveals how little the grownups know: that same year, the three youngest people, two of whom were 7 and 10 years old, were the only ones to correctly predict an Obama victory. The adults mostly thought it would be President Hillary Clinton. Talking about this opened up a debate that must have been happening elsewhere, too, between those who thought a Clinton presidency would have been better than Obama's so far and those who did not. Which brought to mind this older piece by Rebecca Traister from the Times Magazine, where Traister weighed in more recently on whether disappointed Obama supporters were making too much of Elizabeth Warren's senate candidacy in Massachusetts.
Analyzing demographics and economics brought us to this interesting argument about the decline of the meritocratic ideal by Luigi Zingales, which asked "Who Killed Horatio Alger?" Here's Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, laying out his thinking in a speech at the Heritage Foundation. The Columbia Journalism Review criticized the arguments of those who complained about "the myth of inequality." Jonathan Chait also had something to say on this subject. All of this back and forth left us wondering, what does the top 1 percent really pay in taxes? Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, prepared a speech for delivery at the Wharton School that he did not in fact deliver there, but which contains interesting material on how the Republican Party sees economic growth and inequality. In the National Review, Ramesh Ponnuru made strong points about what he called the freeloader myth popular on the right.
Larry Bartels, an incisive political scientist at Vanderbilt University, suggests that 2009 may tell us a lot about what might happen in 2012. The dream of a third party has not died yet. Will the Democratic Party return to its populist roots? Is the answer to inequality more capitalism? How should we look at the spread of inequality by region, particularly in Washington? With all the talk of college not being worth the cost, were you wondering whether the key to success, not to mention the growth of inequality, was postgraduate education? These economists were.
We could go on, but we would rather turn it over to you. If you have enlightening links that you'd like to share with other Campaign Stops readers, please post them in the comments section.

HEADLINE: The Politics of Economics: Feedback

BYLINE: BILL KELLER


HIGHLIGHT: Fortunately, enough readers found things to disagree with in my last column that we need not take part in a kumbaya hug. 

 BODY:
So many readers agreed with the thesis of my last column - economics has been corrupted by the same virus that has hit the rest of our national discourse - that my contrarian, live-to-argue side almost wanted to take it all back. But, no. Fortunately, enough people found things to disagree with that we need not suffocate in a big kumbaya hug. Let me respond to a few of the more popular complaints.
I referred to "a colossal, bipartisan lack of the political courage required to tell people what they sort of know but don't want to hear." A number of readers took issue with the word "bipartisan." 
"Democrats have embraced the balanced approach most economists support," one commenter wrote. "Republicans have taken an extreme, hardline, no-new-taxes, never-compromise approach to governing. Republicans have put party before country. Republicans have made making Obama fail their single, over-riding goal."
As I wrote in the column, the Republicans have indeed occupied the cynical low ground. And it is true that Obama has put out a plan that is at least a good start. 
But Democrats have not been all innocence. (Being Democrats, they've rarely been all anything, except all over the map.) They've huddled around pork-barrel spending. Some have voted with Republicans against defensible tax hikes. And they have mau-maued the Republicans on entitlements. Just as there are ways to raise taxes that are compatible with conservative principles - abolish some of the loophole gimmickry that amounts to government meddling in the marketplace, then lower rates, especially on small business and the middle class - there are liberal ways to cut the safety net, most obviously by means-testing. To the extent Democrats are unwilling to consider touching Social Security or Medicare, I think they share the blame. 
 "Our economic discourse has been corrupted not by bloggers and amateur commentators but by moneyed interests (large corporations and billionaires, mainly)," wrote one reader. "Reinstating the power of authority figures and the mainstream media will not fix the problem, because the super rich have their own harems of kept academics at elite universities, plus corporate propaganda machines like the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute."
In the column I apportioned blame to both the well-heeled lobbies that swarm to protect their perks and to the think tanks (which are more abundant on the right) that reward political conformity rather than intellectual rigor.
But nobody will be surprised that I do think the mainstream media has important responsibilities - fact-checking dubious claims, exposing economic flim-flam, identifying the biases of people they trot out as experts. Amateurs and ordinary citizens play a part here, too, but the major papers and broadcast outlets still retain a measure of authority with an engaged and influential audience. The better they use it, the more they earn it.
"The problem is that economics is not a science, not even a 'dismal science,' but it is junk science. Nowhere is this more evident than in the fact that you can get 'renowned' and 'serious' economists to vehemently argue for exactly opposing macroeconomic policies, and claim that their views are supported by 'models' and 'theories' of their 'science.'"
My impression, from conversations with economists, is that in their lowest, most insecure moments many of them privately suspect the writer is onto something. Maybe their science is built on hocus-pocus! Maybe they are actually imposters! My attempt to learn more about this subject has not nearly reached the point where I'm prepared to pass cosmic judgment on economics as a scientific discipline. But I think dismissing economics is both wrong and dangerous. Science - whether it's the study of disease, or human behavior, or the particles that make up the universe -- is less a set of absolutes than a quest based on evidence. Evidence grows and changes over time, and so does the state of knowledge. If economists are scientists, we are entitled to say: "Show me. Prove it. What's your evidence?" If economics is not science, we just trust the politicians to work it out. Uh huh.
Invariably when I write something suggesting that the Internet is not an unmixed blessing, Twitter lights up with groans from digital true believers. Those who see the Internet as a wonder drug with no unpleasant side effects are beyond my reach. But, to re-repeat myself, the Internet is an environment. Blogs (and Twitter) are tools. They enable human behaviors, not all of which reflect well on the species, but they do not force us to do anything. To blame the Internet for the level of noise and illiteracy in our public discourse would be like blaming Nature when the city doesn't send out the snow plows.

HEADLINE: Choosing Between the Rich and Everyone Else

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans who oppose the payroll tax cut extension are in a tight spot. 

 BODY:
Republicans have been railing against the latest Democratic plan to extend the payroll tax cut, and it's pretty clear why. Of all the contortions they've been forced to make by their refusal to raise taxes on the rich, this is the most painful. It is the one that will affect average Americans the most directly, and will starkly illustrate the advantage Republicans prefer giving to the rich over everyone else.
President Obama and Congressional Democrats want to cut the payroll tax even below its current reduced level, which is scheduled to go back up at the end of the year. They also want to lower the portion of the tax paid by small businesses. That would cost about $115 billion a year, and to pay for it, they've proposed a 3.25 percent surtax on incomes of $1 million or more.
The proposal, which will come up in the Senate later this week, left Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell sputtering on Monday that it was obviously political. The White House and Senate Democrats, he said, "would rather spend their time designing legislation to fail, in the hopes of trying to frame up next year's election."
Mr. McConnell seems to think Democrats should only propose legislation that his party agrees to in advance. But he was also implicitly acknowledging the enormous political power of this choice.
Are Republicans going to deny the average working family a $1,500 tax break in order to spare millionaires a modest increase? That $1,500 or so, multiplied by every paycheck in America, would have a huge effect on economic growth next year, widely estimated as between 1.5 and 2 percentage points. The tax increase would affect only a tiny fraction of small businesses with employees, despite the endless Republican claims that it would stifle job creation.
If Republicans refuse that deal, it will play directly into Democratic hopes of shaping next year's election around the increasingly popular theme of income inequality. ("Why did your taxes go up? So that Republicans could protect millionaires.") They could pay for it with cuts to federal programs that benefit the middle class, which would be self-defeating. Or, if they approve the payroll tax cut without paying for it (as they did last year), that would increase the deficit and reveal the Republican hypocrisy in preferring low taxes for the rich over deficit-cutting.
Either way, the anti-tax crowd is boxed in.

HEADLINE: Counting the Underwater Homeowners

BYLINE: SHAILA DEWAN


HIGHLIGHT: A new report finds a slight decline in the ranks of those who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, but the figure still comes to one in five. 

 BODY:
Analysts have been celebrating various pieces of good economic news, including an uptick in consumer spending. But the housing hangover is still raging. 
At the end of the third quarter, 10.7 million homeowners owed more on their mortgages than their home is worth, according to new data from CoreLogic. That is down but a smidgen from the second quarter, when 10.9 million homeowners were underwater. But it is still more than one in every five mortgages.
Those homeowners may continue to pay their note, but those who suffer a shock like job loss or illness are at a high risk of foreclosure because they are unable to downsize by selling. Some conservative economists have suggested that the housing market be left to heal itself, while liberals and, increasingly, centrists have warned that failure to intervene will severely restrict the economy's ability to grow. 
The 200,000 decrease did not represent homeowners whose home values suddenly recovered, but people who lost their homes. They were easy to find in a report on household debt by the New York Federal Reserve, which found that 264,000 people had a foreclosure noted in their credit report in the third quarter. The total of seriously delinquent mortgages increased for the first time since the third quarter of 2009. 
Underwater, or negative equity, mortgages continued to be heavily concentrated in certain states. For the first time, Georgia, with 30 percent of its mortgages underwater, edged out California for a place in the top five states. No. 1 was Nevada, with more than half its homeowners owing more than the value of their property. Still, outside the top five states, 17.6 percent of homeowners over all are in that predicament.
Forty-five percent of borrowers have less than 20 percent equity in their homes, and almost 70 percent of those mortgages carry interest rates above 5 percent, while the current average rate for a 30-year loan is closer to 4 percent. Recent changes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's refinancing programs are supposed to make it easier for those homeowners, who number about 15 million, to lower their monthly payments.

HEADLINE: For AMR's Now-Former Chief, a Long Career Felled by Chapter 11

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Long reticent to put the airline into bankruptcy, Gerard Arpey is giving up the top spot at AMR Corporation and joining the private equity firm Emerald Creek Group as a partner. 

 BODY:
Throughout his eight-year tenure as the AMR Corporation's chief executive, Gerard J. Arpey had consistently emphasized one strategic point: He would not put the airline into bankruptcy.
But by late last week, when it became clear that AMR, the parent of American Airlines, would need to seek Chapter 11 protection, Mr. Arpey decided that he would rather retire, a person briefed on the matter told DealBook.
Alongside its announcement to file for bankruptcy on Tuesday, AMR said that Mr. Arpey had stepped down and would be succeeded by the company's president, Thomas Horton.
 A 29-year veteran of AMR who joined as a financial analyst, Mr. Arpey became the company's chief executive in 2003 and its chairman in 2004. At the time, the airline industry was besieged by change, including the post-Sept. 11 travel slump and the growth of low-cost airlines.
Other legacy airlines, beginning with the UAL Corporation's United Airlines, had begun filing for bankruptcy protection to help shed costs and make themselves more competitive. But Mr. Arpey emphasized repeatedly that AMR could turn itself around without resorting to Chapter 11, a process that would likely harm employees' pensions and other benefits.
Yet over recent weeks, AMR found itself in an increasingly difficult position, confronted by economic uncertainty, the potential for higher fuel costs and a credit rating downgrade by Standard & Poor's two weeks ago. Over that time, AMR's board gradually came to the conclusion that its financial situation was untenable, and that it needed to consider bankruptcy, people briefed on the matter said.
But the board still wanted Mr. Arpey to remain at the company in some leadership capacity, and on multiple occasions over the last few weeks directors and Mr. Horton asked him to stay, one of these people said.
By late last week, Mr. Arpey decided that he would leave.
"Both the board and Tom Horton throughout this process asked Gerard Arpey to stay on," Thomas A. Roberts, an outside lawyer for AMR's board, said. "This was a decision that Gerard made himself because the company was turning in a new direction."
Despite his long tenure as AMR's chief executive, however, Mr. Arpey is not expected to leave with a big payout. Under the terms of his contract, he will receive not receive any severance, according to the research firm Equilar. And with AMR skirting $0.35 a share right now, his stock holdings are essentially worthless.
Mr. Arpey won't be taking much of a break. Shortly after AMR announced that it had filed for bankruptcy, the Emerald Creek Group announced that it had hired him as a partner who will lead the private equity firm alongside its founder, Lawrence W. Kellner, a former Continental Airlines chief executive.
"I have known Gerard for many years, and watched with admiration as he led American Airlines, with steadfast integrity and fortitude, through the most challenging decade in the history of the airline industry," Mr. Kellner said in a statement.

HEADLINE: The Huntsman Handicap

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Why isn't Huntsman the conservative alternative to Romney? 

 BODY:
"I don't claim to be the perfect candidate," Newt Gingrich told a South Carolina radio station last week, as he settled into his role as the latest not-Romney in the Republican race. "I just claim to be a lot more conservative than Mitt Romney and a lot more electable than anybody else."
It's a plausible line, evoking William F. Buckley Jr.'s often-quoted admonition that right-of-center voters should support the most electable conservative in any given race. But is it accurate? Not if you judge candidates on their record, rather than by their affect. By that standard, the most electable conservative remaining in the Republican race is probably Jon Huntsman.
Huntsman is branded as the Republican field's lonely moderate, of course, which is one reason why he's current languishing at around 3 percent in the polls. But as Michael Brendan Dougherty noted in a summertime profile for the American Conservative, Huntsman's record as Utah's governor isn't "just to the right of other moderates, it is to the right of most conservatives." 
Huntsman has none of Romney's health care baggage, and unlike the former Massachusetts governor, he didn't spend the last decade flip-flopping on gun rights, immigration and abortion. Meanwhile, on many of the highest-profile issues of the primary season (the individual mandate, Paul Ryan's House budget, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), he has arguably been more consistently conservative than Gingrich.
At the same time, because Huntsman is perceived as less partisan than his rivals, he has better general election prospects. The gears and tumblers of my colleague Nate Silver's predictive models give Huntsman a 55 percent chance of knocking off the incumbent even if the economy grows at a robust 4 percent, compared to Romney's 40 percent.
In theory, then, Huntsman seems like he could occupy the sweet spot that Gingrich claims to have all to himself. In practice, though, his campaign to date has been an unmitigated disaster.
This isn't for want of substance. On issues ranging from foreign affairs to financial reform, Huntsman's proposals have been an honorable exception to the pattern of gimmickry and timidity that has characterized the Republican field's policy forays.
But his salesmanship has been staggeringly inept. Huntsman's campaign was always destined to be hobbled by the two years he spent as President Obama's ambassador to China. But he compounded the handicap by introducing himself to the Republican electorate with a series of symbolic jabs at the party's base. 
He picked high-profile fights on two hot-button issues - evolution and global warming - that were completely irrelevant to his candidacy's rationale. He let his campaign manager define his candidacy as a fight to save the Republican Party from a "bunch of cranks." And he embraced his identity as the media's favorite Republican by letting the liberal journalist Jacob Weisberg write a fawning profile for Vogue.
This was political malpractice at its worst. Voters don't necessarily need to like a candidate to vote for him, but they need to think that he likes them. Imagine a contender for the Democratic nomination introducing himself to liberal voters by attacking Planned Parenthood, distancing himself from "left-wing nutjobs" and giving a series of interviews on Fox News, and you have the flavor of how Huntsman's opening act was perceived on the right. The substance mattered less than the symbolism, which screamed: I want your vote, but I don't particularly care to be associated with your stupidities.
The campaign hasn't repeated these mistakes, and Huntsman's debating style - initially unctuous and tone-deaf - has improved with time. (His to-and-fro with Romney over Afghanistan in last week's foreign policy debate was his best moment yet.) He's polling at 11 percent in New Hampshire, his make-or-break state, which is much better than his national numbers. And every so often, a prominent conservative activist or blogger will write a "second look at Huntsman?" post: There was one from RedState's Erick Erickson a few weeks ago, and one from HotAir's pseudonymous Allahpundit last week.
In a sense, Huntsman's best hope may be his relative invisibility. With name recognition numbers that lag his rivals by almost thirty percent, there's still time for him to introduce himself to primary voters afresh. (At the very least, the ongoing implosion of Herman Cain's campaign could buy him more face time in the next few debates.)
Time, but probably no real opportunity. As plausible a nominee as Huntsman may still be on paper, there was always going to be a narrow window for another wealthy Mormon governor with good hair and establishment credentials to elbow his way into the not-Romney space in the Republican field. Thanks to his own campaign's blunders, that window may have closed several months ago.
Huntsman no doubt regrets those blunders. But it's the Republican voters stuck choosing between Gingrich and Romney who may ultimately regret them even more.

HEADLINE: What Would Gandhi Do?

BYLINE: By IAN DESAI. 
Ian Desai, who will be a visiting assistant professor of history at Wesleyan University beginning in January, is writing a book about Gandhi's library.

 BODY:
New Delhi
GANDHI has been all over New York lately. First he appeared at Occupy Wall Street as a patron saint of sorts, inspiring the protest's nonviolent tactics. (The demonstrators even named a lane for him.) Then he emerged at the Metropolitan Opera as the star of Philip Glass's opera ''Satyagraha.''
But with the Zuccotti Park encampment removed, and the opera closing tomorrow, is that it for Gandhi in New York? Or is it worth asking, what would Gandhi do in the world today? 
Throughout his life, Gandhi was preoccupied with putting universal morals into practice. In doing so, he attempted to dissolve the division between ideas and action. This blend of ideas and action animates Mr. Glass's ''Satyagraha.'' During the almost four-hour performance, Gandhi's career as a young freedom fighter is set in the context of his intellectual debts to Tolstoy, Tagore and above all the Bhagavad Gita.
Along the way, the opera reveals the often-overlooked fact that Gandhi's accomplishments were enabled by a core group of spirited collaborators amid a larger body of followers. In capturing the political drama of Gandhi's life, the roots of his intellectual universe, and his reliance on the community he led, ''Satyagraha'' gives us a richer vision of Gandhi than most contemporary portraits of the Mahatma.
It can be difficult, though, to overlook the incongruity of Champagne corks popping at intermissions, the see-and-be-seen atmosphere and the steep ticket prices at the Met. These trappings have little to do with Gandhi's ideas of social justice and make opera an uneasy medium for his political vision; in fact they lend an unhappy irony to the very deftness of the rendering of that vision on the stage. Mr. Glass's opera ultimately lets its audience off the hook, leaving them uplifted but not necessarily more engaged in social problems or willing to redress them. The production shows us what Gandhi did, yet it never suggests how we might join in the action, and collapse the distance between the house and the stage.
For that, the show to see was downtown, at Occupy Wall Street. It was at once political theater, countercultural commune, and recruiting agent for progressive causes.
I believe Gandhi would have admired the energy and community spirit in Zuccotti Park, but if he were at the protests, he would have taken up the human microphone and suggested some modifications.
First, Gandhi would reject the division between the 99 percent and the 1 percent. Gandhi did not believe in enemies: he worked on the premise that solutions emerged only from cooperation. This truth is often lost in discussions of his political tactics of noncooperation and civil disobedience. Noncooperation is best understood as an invitation to cooperate. ''We are the 100 percent'' may not make for a dramatic slogan, but from Gandhi's perspective, it is the only way to achieve true and lasting change in society.
Gandhi would underscore that social transformation requires significant responsibility on the part of each of us. The world is not a static system or an unalterable one. Society exists in a certain way when we enter it, but it is our actions or our inaction that maintain the status quo, make things worse, or transform them for the better. Gandhi explained this most pointedly when he declared that the British Empire existed because Indians had let it exist. He would say the same thing about the drastic income inequality in America today: it is here because Americans collectively allow it to be here.
He would therefore encourage the protesters to focus their efforts on direct social assistance and positive political action. In regard to social work, the protesters' eviction from their tents in the park may be a blessing in disguise. At the height of his prominence in 1930, Gandhi renounced his own home and political headquarters and later moved into the heart of rural India to set up service organizations and promote ''village industries'' and sustainable small-scale economies.
Although the young Gandhi focused on protest and political organizing, the more mature one made his central focus ''constructive work'' and service. He realized that most important battles in the struggle for a just world were fought in the world -- in community centers, schools, shelters, charities, clinics and churches, on street corners and across the countryside in rural communities.
As for political action, Gandhi would also want a more systematic, constructive plan for the movement. While he would have been patient as objectives and tactics were debated, he would insist that eventually the protesters adopt goals, define their strategy, and communicate these to their opponents and the broader public. That is the responsibility would-be revolutionaries must assume. If you want transparency, fairness and conscientiousness from your opponent, you have to become an exemplar of those virtues yourself.
Pointing fingers and assigning blame is easy -- it can even be helpful. Protesting in the park downtown can be quite useful. So, for that matter, can patronizing the arts. To the extent that both help us think through the current state of our society, they contribute to a common cause of uplift and improvement. But they are most meaningful when they set the stage for constructive social action, through which we might begin to mend the world.

HEADLINE: Treating People With Schizophrenia

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Finding Purpose After Living With Delusion'' (''Lives Restored'' series, front page, Nov. 26) addresses something many psychiatrists, including me, who trained years ago know: psychotic symptoms are not just ''biological,'' and there is meaning behind them.
Today, there are pressures to see far greater numbers of patients for shorter periods of time, and the predominant focus is on medications that often reduce the psychosis to prevent hospitalizations. For people with other psychiatric conditions, it is generally those who can pay out of pocket who use talk therapy. 
The symptoms of paranoia and hallucinations make it difficult for most people with schizophrenia to hold the types of jobs that would generate the income to pay for a more comprehensive therapy. With luck, the excellent treatment portrayed in your ''Lives Restored'' series will contribute to a rethinking about how we care for our most severely mentally ill.
JEFFREY B. FREEDMAN New York, Nov. 26, 2011
The writer is a former president of the New York County branch of the American Psychiatric Association.
To the Editor:
In the late 1980s, I was privileged to organize one of the first ''Clozaril clinics'' in Massachusetts. Back then, the drug (clozapine) seemed to produce almost miraculous recoveries in some patients who had been suffering for decades with schizophrenia.
But our state-financed center was able to provide more than medication: patients also had access to supportive counseling, social services and personalized case management. (In today's spartan economy, money for such services is often nonexistent.)
Your article about Milt Greek once again demonstrates the benefits of a holistic approach to severe psychiatric illness -- one that is broad enough to incorporate treatments ranging from medication to meditation.
As for helping the patient understand his delusions and place them in the larger context of his life, the psychiatrist Silvano Arieti was writing about this back in the 1970s. Today, we also use cognitive behavioral strategies in dealing with the delusions of schizophrenia. Milt Greek's story should remind us that psychiatry needs to be as comfortable with meanings as with molecules.
RONALD PIES Lexington, Mass., Nov. 26, 2011
The writer is a psychiatrist on the faculty of SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, and Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston.
To the Editor:
Milt Greek, in your wonderful article about his recovery from schizophrenia, describes being traumatized in an early encounter with a psychiatrist. As you reported it, ''The doctor never asked what he thought his hallucinations meant, or whether strange thoughts were linked to experiences in his life.'' In all likelihood, his psychiatrist responded in this way because he or she was trained that showing interest in the psychotic symptoms would be ''collusion'' and make matters worse.
Mr. Greek's experience is not uncommon. We find that rejection of the personal meaning of symptoms often backfires, and has the unintended consequence of driving patients away from accepting effective treatments.
In Britain, there is a growing awareness of how important it is for mental health clinicians to remain interested in the personal meaning of psychotic experiences, and of the fact that fears of ''collusion'' are unfounded. We believe that it is possible to help someone navigate through his psychotic experience without alienating him from effective treatments. We are working to bring these techniques to American psychiatry.
PETER J. WEIDEN DOUGLAS TURKINGTON Chicago, Nov. 27, 2011
The writers are professors of psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago Medical Center and the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England.

HEADLINE: College Athletes Move Concussions Into the Courtroom

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
The punt soared through the night air, arriving just before the tackler crashed into Derek Owens. No penalty flag was thrown, and Owens maintained one would not have been justified. It was football, the sport he still loves, despite his concussions.
''They just killed him!'' Teresa Owens blurted in the stands, reacting with a mother's horror. The strange thing was, Owens held on to the ball, jumped up and darted for the sideline. Since then, his life has not been the same.
A few days later, a Tulsa newspaper ran a brief article about the proud tackler with the headline ''Headhunter.'' How prophetic that was.
Owens, 22, is under medical care, about to resume his education at the University of Central Arkansas. He can never play a contact sport again. He is also one of four plaintiffs in a class-action suit that claims the N.C.A.A. has been negligent regarding awareness and treatment of brain injuries to athletes. 
The suit, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, represents Owens, Adrian Arrington and Mark Turner, recent college football players, and Angela Palacios, a former college soccer player.
The legal action comes after a five-year flurry of awareness of brain injuries in contact sports and follows lawsuits filed this year by dozens of former N.F.L. players who claim the league was negligent in its handling of brain trauma. The issue has moved from science labs to Congress and now to courtrooms, where the financial exposure of the sport's governing bodies may be tested.
The N.F.L. is subsidizing care for some of the most seriously damaged of its former players, after public and Congressional pressure forced the league to acknowledge the gravity of the issue. But the damage did not begin with the first hit in an N.F.L. training camp. Players have been absorbing blows to the brain since they were children.
''I hear from former players who were taught spearing,'' said Representative Linda T. Sanchez, Democrat of California, who has been an active participant in Congressional hearings into brain damage among N.F.L. players. Her constituents tell her how they learned to use modern helmets as weapons to injure their opponents in youth leagues or high school.
''It's quite savage,'' said Sanchez, who notes that former pro players are filing workers' compensation claims in California because its eligibility requirements are more lenient than elsewhere. She acknowledges that college players are not salaried employees, which complicates the issue of long-term care for injured players.
But it is not impossible that an improved system of insurance and aftercare for athletes beyond their playing days could imperil football and maybe hockey and other contact sports.
Owens does not want to tear down football. With a loving smile, he recalled somebody defining it as ''a violent sport, played by jerks'' -- including himself, of course. For now, he is a man in the shadows, dealing with the migraines and dark impulses that sometimes cause him to lock the door and stay in bed.
Before the concussions, he was an A student and a three-sport star and the lead trumpeter in his high school band, who could do mathematics in his head without a calculator or writing down the intermediate steps. After the concussions, his grades fell drastically. He dropped out for this semester because he could not memorize material for tests.
Something to Prove
Why did Owens not signal for a fair catch that night in Tulsa? He said he did not believe in fair catches because he wanted to prove that a 5-foot-8, 165-pound player could thrive in Division I football. He had high goals for himself, and still does.
Owens can recall at least five concussions since high school, but he said it was not until August 2011, nearly a year after the fearsome hit on the punt return, that anybody used the phrase ''postconcussion syndrome'' on him. He thought concussions were simple: ''You get your bell rung. You get smoked. And then you go back in.''
A sentence at the beginning of the class-action suit reads, ''The N.C.A.A. has engaged in a long-established pattern of negligence and inaction with respect to concussions and concussion-related maladies sustained by its student-athletes, all the while profiting immensely from those same student-athletes.''
The suit lists as a defendant the N.C.A.A., not the University of Central Arkansas, where Owens is still enrolled, and to which he professes loyalty. A former player at another university was originally listed as a plaintiff, but on Nov. 19, the suit was amended to drop that player and include Arrington, who played for Eastern Illinois University; Turner, formerly with Fordham University; and Palacios, who played soccer for Ouachita Baptist University in Arkansas. The suit at first concentrated on football but now notes concussions in other sports.
Calling the suit ''wholly without merit,'' Donald Remy, the N.C.A.A. general counsel and vice president for legal affairs, said the organization had ''great compassion'' for injured athletes and had been ''at the forefront of safety issues.''
''The N.C.A.A. is an attractive target for opportunistic plaintiffs' class-action lawyers,'' Remy said in a statement via e-mail, adding, ''To date, none of these cases have been proven to have merit.''
The suit is spearheaded by Steve W. Berman of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro L.L.P., based in Seattle. The firm says it ''represents workers, whistleblowers, investors and consumers in complex litigation'' against the tobacco and automobile industries, among others.
Since 2009, Berman has represented Sam Keller, a former college quarterback whose suit claims college athletes should be paid for the use of their likeness in official N.C.A.A. video games.
In an interview in his 33rd-floor office overlooking Seattle, Berman characterized the N.C.A.A. as ''an uncaring cartel that takes care of its own'' and added, ''This whole notion of protecting amateurism -- that's a farce.''
Berman is a former soccer goalkeeper at Michigan, despite his modest height of 5 feet 9 1/2 inches. He attributed his ability to block shots to being smart and knowing the angles, and he says he has an affinity with Owens, who volunteers that he has a ''little man complex,'' trying to prove himself in a big man's world.
Owens also acknowledges that he is fortunate in that he and his two sisters are part of a comfortable family in Russellville, Ark. His mother, Teresa Owens, was a point guard in college, which shows in her minute-by-minute vigilance in his recovery. His father, Lee Owens, was a star college baseball player, and Derek ruefully admits he probably should have concentrated on that sport, saying, ''I was the ideal size for a middle infielder.'' He readily identifies himself as a Southerner who loves hunting and the outdoors, and he sticks to his causes, including the sport of the South.
''I was a big-play guy,'' Derek Owens said of his outstanding high school career, sounding matter of fact, not boastful. ''We'd get in the huddle and I'd say, 'Get me the ball and I'll make a play.' '' He recalls a third-down-and-35 that he converted by being inventive after making the catch.
He said he had two concussions in high school but went back in when he felt better. In the summer of 2008, he reported to workouts at Central Arkansas conducted by the players. ''They said it was optional, but everybody knew it wasn't,'' he said. In a simple passing drill, without pads or helmets, he collided with a larger teammate and was so stunned that he had to give up the so-called optional drills. He said no trainer was present, and the university had not given any instructions about potential concussions or other injuries.
When the actual camp began, Owens was feeling better. He dressed for the first game but did not play, and in midweek he collided with a large linebacker and went down again. He was driven to his apartment, and he said the solicitous team trainer told a roommate to wake Owens every few hours to make sure he was all right.
Teresa Owens said she never would have known her son was injured if she had not sent him a text message. When he responded with gibberish, she drove the 45 minutes to campus and found him bedridden, in a fog. The school decided to give him redshirt status, to hold him out for the season, but he said there was never any discussion of potential lingering conditions.
He had signed an official N.C.A.A. form agreeing to report any injuries so they could be treated. (The athletic director, Brad Teague, said the university declined to comment on the suit.)
'Wom-Wom-Wom'
Owens played in 2009, mostly as a spare receiver and punt returner and holder for placements. Early in 2010, the Tulsa long snapper raced downfield and nailed Owens, later professing regret that Owens's helmet did not come flying off -- a sure ticket to prominence in the brave new world of YouTube, in which others' pain or embarrassment becomes instant entertainment for the masses.
Although Owens jogged off the field, he said his head went ''wom-wom-wom'' when he removed his helmet. In the bus heading back to campus, he began to feel sick. Afterward, he said, he could not concentrate in class, but he managed to play all 11 games that season.
By the spring of 2011, Owens was failing and dropping courses he had previously aced. He began using alcohol and marijuana for the first time -- to dull the pain, he said.
Owens claimed he was unaware of the growing public evidence of long-term dementia suffered by former N.F.L. players like John Mackey and Dave Duerson, who recently committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest and willed his intact brain for an autopsy (which showed trauma-induced disease).
But the rising evidence of brain damage has led to public dialogue, including a symposium on concussions Nov. 16, sponsored by the New York University School of Continuing and Professional Studies and the N.Y.U. Langone Medical Center.
One of the major themes, said Robert Boland, an associate professor and panelist, was whether football or any sport ''with so much collision and contact'' could survive, as ''acceptably safe.'' The quandary, Boland added, is that college players are demonstrably bigger, faster and more lethal than a generation or two ago, but treatment is also likely to be better at the so-called programs than at smaller rural high schools.
Last August, the Owens family decided to spend $1,500 for testing by Dan Johnson, a clinical neuropsychologist in Jonesboro, Ark. The report, made available by Owens, noted his above-average mental skills but added, ''He is likely experiencing postconcussive syndrome symptoms, which are adversely affecting his cognition in several key ways as well as emotional/behavioral status.''
The report praised Owens's decision to give up contact sports. A medical doctor subsequently put Owens on two medications, which have alleviated headaches and reduced depression and anxiety.
Feeling badly about slumping as a student and no longer being a player, Owens took off the fall semester. He went to work at a dude ranch in Colorado and, while escorting a group of lawyers on a riding trail, had a conversation with Elizabeth A. Fegan of Chicago, a colleague of Berman's. As his mood improved, Owens was willing to be part of a class-action suit.
Push for Follow-Up Care
Berman said he wanted to force the N.C.A.A. to arrange insurance that would provide for training and evaluation for players and follow-up care for former athletes.
''The goal of the lawsuit is to force the N.C.A.A. to take this seriously, so that they are really policing and making the effort that is required to prevent these injuries,'' Berman said. The suit alleges that the N.C.A.A. makes an annual profit of $750 million, and that top schools make fortunes from television contracts. Berman said the profit could pay for improved medical care: ''And it could be that when they are hurt economically, that's what it will take to take these injuries seriously.''
Recalling his own college career as a soccer goalkeeper, Berman said it was unrealistic to expect athletes to monitor their own injuries, particularly involving concussions.
''You know you can get hurt, but you think you're invincible,'' he said. ''You never think about the cost of an injury, who's going to bear those costs.'' Berman added, ''If you break an arm, you break an arm.'' But with a concussion, ''a lot of these times, it comes and goes and you don't really know you've hurt yourself.''
Berman described the series of concussions sustained by Owens: ''He's a very bright kid, but he was clueless. If the N.C.A.A. was doing its job, he should not have been clueless. ''
There is considerable evidence that all levels of organized football have paid more attention to brain injuries in recent years, as evidence began to accumulate about concussions and continuing damage to former players. The N.C.A.A. has a relationship with the Matthew Gfeller Sport-Related Traumatic Brain Injury Research Center at the University of North Carolina, which recommends a seven-day shutdown for players with concussions. After studies indicated that a majority of concussions took place in practice, the Ivy League cut back contact practices to two a week.
The 2011-12 N.C.A.A. Sports Medicine Handbook devotes four pages (pp. 53-56) to brain concussions, including symptoms, and it lists a revised 2010 ''management plan'' for all athletes showing signs of concussion. But the Owens suit insists the N.C.A.A. guidelines of the time did not prepare him for how he would feel after repeated concussions.
''I consider myself lucky,'' Owens said. ''I'm not drooling. I can perform daily tasks.'' As he gears up to return to classes next semester, he said he could feel a ''night-and-day difference.'' He said his headaches, depression and anxiety had gone down in recent weeks, but his mother and his girlfriend, Shelby Twedt, said he still had his down moments.
Owens loves his sport and his college. But he said he would be happier if people could pursue football and other contact sports -- even field punts -- and be better prepared, and treated for whatever comes crashing down on them.

HEADLINE: Group Predicts 28% Gain In Carmaking Jobs by 2015

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Employment in the auto industry will return to prerecession levels by 2015, with carmakers and their suppliers adding about 167,000 jobs by then, according to estimates by an auto industry research firm. 
The job growth would represent a 28 percent increase over current levels but would still replace only about a third of the jobs lost in the last decade. And much of the increase is made possible by labor agreements ratified this fall that allow the Detroit automakers to hire more workers on the lower of their two pay scales.
The industry group, the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich., said it expected the Detroit automakers to hire 14,750 hourly employees in the next four years. They would receive entry-level wages of $16 to $19 an hour. Workers hired before 2007 earn about $29 an hour.
The group projected that about 15 percent of the new jobs would be at Detroit automakers, and nearly 80 percent would be at suppliers. Foreign automakers would account for the rest.
Sean McAlinden, the group's chief economist, said that about one in six hourly workers at the three Detroit companies would be earning entry-level wages in 2015. They will account for 23 percent of hourly workers at Chrysler, 17 percent at General Motors and 12 percent at Ford, he said.
Currently, about 5 percent of hourly workers at the three automakers are paid entry-level wages.
Mr. McAlinden said that he expected the companies eventually to stop using a two-tier wage system but that it would most likely survive past their next contract negotiations with the United Automobile Workers union, in 2015. Chrysler's chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, unsuccessfully pushed to eliminate the system during this year's negotiations, though he said he did not propose cutting wages for any existing workers.
The two-tier system was created in 2007 to help the automakers cut labor costs as they were hemorrhaging money, but only recently were they able to begin hiring new workers in large enough numbers for the savings to have a noticeable effect on the bottom line.
''This was the only real option for lowering labor costs and increasing employment,'' said Kristin Dziczek, director for the labor and industry group at the Center for Automotive Research.
The automakers have said the new contracts would result in a minimal increase to their labor costs, which was their overarching goal during the negotiations, while the union tried to recover some of the concessions it had given up in recent years.
Mr. McAlinden estimated that the new contracts would add $114, or 8 percent, to the companies' average per-vehicle labor costs by 2015. The increases range from $85 a vehicle at G.M. to $166 at Chrysler, though Chrysler's per-vehicle labor costs would remain the lowest of the three, at $1,293.
About 590,000 people now work in the auto industry, 13 percent more than in July 2009, when G.M. emerged from bankruptcy, Ms. Dziczek said. That figure is expected to grow to 756,800 in 2015.
Much of the job growth will happen in Michigan, where the three Detroit automakers cut more than half of their jobs since 2001, she said.

HEADLINE: At the 92nd Street Y, a Cushion Against Wall Street

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN and JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
Clients of John A. Paulson, the billionaire hedge fund manager, have had a brutal year, absorbing losses of as much as 50 percent.
But one of Mr. Paulson's investors - the 92nd Street Y - has nothing to worry about.
That's because Mr. Paulson, a member of the organization's board, has guaranteed he will cover the Y for any losses it incurs in his funds. Barring a sharp recovery, Mr. Paulson will have to write a personal check to the organization for several million dollars.
''This is a very uncommon arrangement,'' said Andrew M. Grumet, a lawyer specializing in philanthropy. ''But the 92nd Street Y isn't your average nonprofit, and John Paulson isn't your average money manager.''
One of New York's premier cultural institutions, the 92nd Street Y also houses an exclusive preschool and nursery school, which Mr. Paulson's daughters attended. Tuition runs as high as $27,150 a year. The Y, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, is headed by a board that includes some of best-known names in business: Bronfman, Lauder, Tisch. 
Its board is also stocked with Wall Street titans, including Mr. Paulson, who emerged from relative obscurity a half-decade ago to become one of Wall Street's most successful speculators. He made about $4 billion in 2007 by betting against subprime mortgages. He made another $5 billion in 2010, largely from investments in gold.
But his fortunes have turned this year. Mr. Paulson's largest funds - his assets under management had swelled to nearly $40 billion - are down 30 to 50 percent, largely as a result of a wager that the economy would recover more quickly than it has.
As a result of such losses, he could owe the 92nd Street Y as much as $4 million, according to two people with knowledge of the agreement who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it. Yet given Mr. Paulson's wealth - Forbes magazine estimates his fortune at $15.4 billion - a $4 million check would be pocket change for the 55-year-old native of Queens.
Mr. Paulson is the 92nd Street Y's largest outside manager, running about $10 million of the school's $37.9 million in investments, the two people said.
''We're certainly not ashamed of any of this,'' said Sol Adler, the executive director of the 92nd Street Y. ''This institution has particularly generous board members, including John and a number of others.''
Mr. Paulson's agreement to backstop his fund's losses at the 92nd Street Y is alluded to in the organization's financial statements, where it is disclosed in a footnote titled ''related-party transactions.'' The disclosure says that four board members or their immediate families manage money for the 92nd Street Y's investment portfolio, and that they promised to cover any losses. They also agreed to reimburse the organization for certain fees on the investments.
Other hedge fund managers who have the arrangement with the 92nd Street Y are board member Curtis Schenker, the chief executive of Scoggin Capital Management, and Ricky Sandler, the head of Eminence Capital, whose wife serves as a director. The fourth manager was not disclosed. Mr. Paulson and the other hedge fund managers declined to comment.
''Paulson & Company manages funds for approximately 50 foundations and endowments,'' said Armel Leslie, a spokesman for Mr. Paulson. ''Due to client confidentiality, we do not disclose either the names of our clients, or the terms of their investments with us.''
The 92nd Street Y's board approached Mr. Paulson and the other managers with the idea several years ago, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The concept was to gain the benefits of the directors' investment expertise while protecting itself against losses. Also, by securing such extraordinary terms, the board felt it would eliminate any concern that the board would favor its own trustees over a disinterested money manager.
Philanthropy and corporate governance specialists said that while agreements to personally guarantee against losses were highly unusual, they did not violate any nonprofit laws - as long as the organization made the proper disclosures and forbade trustees from voting on matters in which they had a personal stake.
Several experts said they admired the deal the 92nd Street Y had with the fund managers because of how it upended the traditional risk-reward equation that came with investing, especially in the more volatile hedge fund sector.
''It's the proverbial win-win,'' said a New York-based philanthropy adviser who requested anonymity because she works with a number of the city's charitable organizations and did not want to risk alienating them. ''The Y gets the benefit of potentially lavish hedge fund returns, while limiting their downside risk to zero.''
But others point to an issue that has long been debated in philanthropy circles: Should members of a nonprofit's board be managing its money, regardless of any special deals they cut for the organization?
The problem is that a nonprofit that does business with its board members subjects itself to accusations of favoritism, say critics of the practice. Another concern is whether the organization has done the same due diligence on its directors' money management firms as it would for funds unconnected to the board.
''With all the money managers in New York City, I'm not sure it's necessary to select people who are also trustees of the school,'' said Richard Chait, a research professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
New York's elite private schools have something of a high-class problem, as their boards are filled with top Wall Street executives. They write big checks for capital campaigns and consistently donate generous sums to the annual fund. But they also offer access to hedge funds and private equity funds, many of which are closed to new investors - or at least nonconnected ones.
As colleges and universities have shifted investments over the last decade away from plain-vanilla stocks and bonds and into more high-risk, high-reward investments like hedge funds and private equity, private schools have followed suit. And a driving force has been the presence of some of the prominent investors on the schools' boards.
At Horace Mann there's Eric Mindich, the former Goldman Sachs wunderkind who founded Eton Park Capital Management, a multibillion-dollar hedge fund. The Ethical Culture Fieldston School has Laura Blankfein, the wife of the Goldman Sachs chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein. The Dalton School's board includes Douglas Braunstein, the chief financial officer of JPMorgan Chase.
Yet despite these schools' deep Wall Street ties, several of them, including Dalton and Horace Mann, have a policy of not investing money with their trustees to avoid a conflict of interest or any appearance of favoritism.
Many of the 92nd Street Y's board members send, or have sent, their children to its nursery school, where the competition for openings is intense. Their largess also accounts for a sizable portion of the institution's financing. During 2009 and 2010, board donations accounted for nearly half of the 92 St Y's total contributions, according to its financial statements.
A decade ago, the 92nd Street Y suffered through an embarrassing episode when it emerged that Sanford I. Weill, then the chief executive of Citigroup, tried to help the twins of Jack Grubman, the bank's star stock analyst, gain admission to the preschool. Citigroup donated $1 million to the organization around the time that Mr. Weill made his request. Both Citigroup and Mr. Weill denied any wrongdoing.
Mr. Paulson's two daughters attended the 92nd Street Y nursery school. At least one of them now goes to Spence, an all-girls private school on the Upper East Side. Mr. Paulson joined Spence's board last year and manages money for the school.
It is unclear whether he has a similar agreement in place with Spence as his one with the 92nd Street Y. A representative for Spence declined to comment.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Cleveland Turns Uptown Into New Downtown

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
CLEVELAND -- Since 1950, when its population peaked at 914,808, Cleveland has steadily shed residents and jobs. In 2010, just 396,815 people lived within the city limits, almost 81,000 fewer than a decade before, and about the same number of people who lived in Cleveland in 1900.
The sequence of events is sadly familiar: the disappearance of labor-intensive industry that paid a living wage, followed by entrenched poverty and the social disruption that it brings. 
But in recent years Cleveland's municipal government and its Regional Transit Authority have rallied major employers, banks, foundations and developers around a central goal of rebuilding the city's core according to the new urban market trends of the 21st century -- health care, higher education, entertainment, good food, new housing and expanded mass transportation.
A point of focus has been the emerging Uptown arts and entertainment district along Euclid Avenue, near where John D. Rockefeller and other industrialists and financiers built opulent mansions.
When it is finished next year, the new $27 million Museum of Contemporary Art, designed by Farshid Moussavi, will perch, like a lustrous black gem, at the entrance to the district, at Euclid and Mayfield Road. A pedestrian plaza designed by James Corner Field Operations, a designer of the High Line elevated park in New York City, separates the new museum from two four-story, mixed-use residential buildings under construction on the north and south sides of Euclid.
The 60,106-square-foot south building will have 70 rental apartments above 21,189 square feet of restaurant and retail space. The north structure, larger at 84,399 square feet, has 44 apartments and 36,480 square feet of retail space that includes a bookstore and a big grocery, the first in the area. Both buildings were designed by Stanley Saitowitz of Natoma Architects in San Francisco, and built at a cost of $44 million by MRN Ltd., a Cleveland development group.
To get residents and visitors to and from the arts district, the Regional Transit Authority is planning to move two existing rail stops on the city's 19-mile Red Line closer to Uptown, nearby Little Italy and Case Western Reserve University at a cost of nearly $30 million.
''All of this new construction is enhanced by international design,'' said Ari Maron, a 33-year-old partner in the family-owned MRN Ltd. ''The focus is the street. You provide the right mix of assets. You fill the buildings with people and open the storefronts to the sidewalk. You create a place where people want to be which didn't exist before.''
In effect, the Uptown area will be what amounts to a new downtown for the University Circle neighborhood on the east side of the city. Within the square mile of University Circle, and within easy walking distance of Uptown, are Case Western Reserve, the Cleveland Institute of Art, the Cleveland Institute of Music, University Hospitals, Cleveland Clinic, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Museum of Art and the Museum of Natural History.
Spread across a campuslike expanse of green space, these institutions form a distinct economic microclimate that has fostered the highest growth in job numbers, income and residents in a city that lost 17 percent of its population from 2000 to 2010.
''There are 5,000 more jobs here than in 2005,'' said Chris Ronayne, an urban planner who is president of University Circle Inc., a nonprofit community service organization that has helped manage the area's development. ''About 50,000 people work here. The number of residents grew 11 percent since 2000. And there are 10,000 people who live here now.''
By almost any measure of civic energy and interest, Uptown looks to be a success. Mr. Maron said MRN Ltd. had already leased all three retail and seven restaurant spaces in his project. The one-bedroom, one-bathroom, 750-square-foot apartments have drawn strong interest and will rent for about $1,500 a month when they go on the market in January, he said.
Other new projects in Uptown include a planned $26 million, 150-room Marriott hotel just down Euclid on Cornell Road. The Cleveland Institute of Art now trains 520 students in a 155,000-square-foot building, where Ford Model Ts were once made, that was recently renovated at a cost of $35 million. Next June the institute is scheduled to break ground on a $30 million, 91,000-square-foot, four-story addition -- designed by Stantec Architecture, which has an office in Cleveland -- that will be clad in multicolored panes of glass, said Grafton Nunes, the president and chief executive.
And just a block away, Case Western Reserve in 2002 completed a $62 million, 152,000-square-foot classroom building, designed by Frank Gehry, for its Weatherhead School of Management.
''That area of the city is really coming fast as a center of Cleveland's growth,'' said Tracey A. Nichols, the director of the city Department of Economic Development. ''We are convinced projects like Uptown will continue to be built and in the next generation this will be a city of 500,000 people again.''
One of the first major projects for Uptown, completed in 2008, was the $200 million reconstruction of Euclid Avenue, which included installing a dedicated lane for an unusual bus rapid transit line. The three-year-old line has attracted 12 million riders and connects the city's central Public Square to University Circle.
The bus service, known as the HealthLine, and the reconstructed boulevard are credited with contributing to a boom in development that The Plain Dealer reported in July had reached a total of $5 billion. Along with Uptown, where the investment so far totals $162 million, other big projects include a $560 redevelopment of University Hospitals Case Medical Center, a $350 million casino on Public Square and a $465 million, 555,000-square-foot convention center and medical mart downtown.
''There were skeptics about the HealthLine,'' said David Beach, an urban design expert with the Museum of Natural History. ''It's proving that an investment in transit and improvements in streetscape do start to change real estate investment patterns over time. In a slow economy it takes a few years. But we are seeing new development up and down the Euclid corridor now.''

HEADLINE: Line Grows Long For Free Meals At U.S. Schools

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON; Robbie Brown and Kimberley McGee contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Millions of American schoolchildren are receiving free or low-cost meals for the first time as their parents, many once solidly middle class, have lost jobs or homes during the economic crisis, qualifying their families for the decades-old safety-net program.
The number of students receiving subsidized lunches rose to 21 million last school year from 18 million in 2006-7, a 17 percent increase, according to an analysis by The New York Times of data from the Department of Agriculture, which administers the meals program. Eleven states, including Florida, Nevada, New Jersey and Tennessee, had four-year increases of 25 percent or more, huge shifts in a vast program long characterized by incremental growth.
The Agriculture Department has not yet released data for September and October.
''These are very large increases and a direct reflection of the hardships American families are facing,'' said Benjamin Senauer, a University of Minnesota economist who studies the meals program, adding that the surge had happened so quickly ''that people like myself who do research are struggling to keep up with it.'' 
In Sylva, N.C., layoffs at lumber and paper mills have driven hundreds of new students into the free lunch program. In Las Vegas, where the collapse of the construction industry has caused hardship, 15,000 additional students joined the subsidized lunch program this fall. In Rochester, unemployed engineers and technicians have signed up their children after the downsizing of Kodak and other companies forced them from their jobs. Many of these formerly middle-income parents have pleaded with school officials to keep their enrollment a secret.
Students in families with incomes up to 130 percent of the poverty level -- or $29,055 for a family of four -- are eligible for free school meals. Children in a four-member household with income up to $41,348 qualify for a subsidized lunch priced at 40 cents.
Among the first to call attention to the increases were Department of Education officials who use subsidized lunch rates as a poverty indicator in federal testing. This month, in releasing results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress, they noted that the proportion of the nation's fourth graders enrolled in the lunch program had climbed to 52 percent from 49 percent in 2009, crossing a symbolic watershed.
In the Rockdale County Schools in Conyers, Ga., east of Atlanta, the percentage of students receiving subsidized lunches increased to 63 percent this year from 46 percent in 2006.
''We're seeing people who were never eligible before, never had a need,'' said Peggy Lawrence, director of school nutrition.
One of those is Sheila Dawson, a Wal-Mart saleswoman whose husband lost his job as the manager of a Waffle House last year, reducing their income by $45,000. ''We're doing whatever we can to save money,'' said Ms. Dawson, who has a 15-year-old daughter. ''We buy clothes at the thrift store, we see fewer movies and this year my daughter qualifies for reduced-price lunch.''
She added, ''I feel like: 'Hey, we were paying taxes all these years. This is what they were for.' ''
Although the troubled economy is the main factor in the increases, experts said, some growth at the margins has resulted from a new way of qualifying students for the subsidized meals, known as direct certification. In 2004, Congress required the nation's 17,000 school districts to match student enrollment lists against records of local food-stamp agencies, directly enrolling those who receive food stamps for the meals program. The number of districts doing so has been rising -- as have the number of school-age children in families eligible for food stamps, to 14 million in 2010-11 from 12 million in 2009-10.
''The concern of those of us involved in the direct certification effort is how to help all these districts deal with the exploding caseload of kids eligible for the meals,'' said Kevin Conway, a project director at Mathematica Policy Research, a co-author of an October report to Congress on direct certification.
Congress passed the National School Lunch Act in 1946 to support commodity prices after World War II by reducing farm surpluses while providing food to schoolchildren. By 1970, the program was providing 22 million lunches on an average day, about a fifth of them subsidized. Since then, the subsidized portion has grown while paid lunches have declined, but not since 1972 have so many additional children become eligible for free lunches as in fiscal year 2010, 1.3 million. Today it is a $10.8 billion program providing 32 million lunches, 21 million of which are free or at reduced price.
All 50 states have shown increases, according to Agriculture Department data. In Florida, which has 2.6 million public school students, an additional 265,000 students have become eligible for subsidies since 2007, with increases in virtually every district.
''Growth has been across the board,'' said Mark Eggers, the Florida Department of Education official who oversees the lunch program.
In Tennessee, the number of students receiving subsidized meals has grown 37 percent since 2007.
''When a factory closes, our school districts see a big increase,'' said Sarah White, the state director of school nutrition.
In Las Vegas, with 13.6 percent unemployment, the enrollment of thousands of new students in the subsidized lunch program forced the Clark County district to add an extra shift at the football field-size central kitchen, said Virginia Beck, an assistant director at the school food service.
In Roseville, Minn., an inner-ring St. Paul suburb, the proportion of subsidized lunch students rose to 44 percent this fall from 29 percent in 2006-7, according to Dr. Senauer, the economist. ''There's a lot of hurt in the suburbs,'' he said. ''It's the new face of poverty.''
In New York, the Gates Chili school district west of Rochester has lost 700 students since 2007-8, as many families have fled the area after mass layoffs. But over those same four years, the subsidized lunch program has added 125 mouths, many of them belonging to the children of Kodak and Xerox managers and technicians who once assumed they had a lifetime job, said Debbi Beauvais, district supervisor of the meals program.
''Parents signing up children say, 'I never thought a program like this would apply to me and my kids,' '' Ms. Beauvais said.
Many large urban school districts have for years been dominated by students poor enough to qualify for subsidized lunches. In Dallas, Newark and Chicago, for instance, about 85 percent of students are eligible, and most schools also offer free breakfasts. Now, some places have added free supper programs, fearing that needy students otherwise will go to bed hungry.
One is the Hickman Mills C-1 district in a threadbare Kansas City, Mo., neighborhood where a Home Depot, a shopping mall and a string of grocery stores have closed.
Ten years ago, 48 percent of its students qualified for subsidized lunches. By 2007, that proportion had increased to 73 percent, said Leah Schmidt, the district's nutrition director. Last year, when it hit 80 percent, the district started feeding 700 students a third meal, paid for by the state, each afternoon when classes end.
''This is the neediest period I've seen in my 20-year career,'' Ms. Schmidt said.

HEADLINE: Single Spark Sets Off a Long Year of Debt

BYLINE: By MATHEW R. WARREN

 BODY:
In July 2009, Jose Antonio Ithier woke up coughing and struggling to breathe. Plumes of black smoke were choking his lungs.
''The first thing I saw when I sat up was my kitchen and bathroom completely in flames,'' Mr. Ithier, 23, said, recalling the intense heat he felt as fire reached the living room, where he had fallen asleep on the couch the night before.
He was alone that morning, and he ran through his family's railroad apartment in a five-story walk-up in Morningside Heights to his mother's room and tried to call 911. There was no dial tone. Panicking, he found his cellphone, phoned for help and opened a window. After climbing onto the fifth-floor fire escape, he banged on the window of the adjacent apartment, where his grandparents lived, and they made their way down to the street as fire trucks arrived.
Barefoot, wearing only shorts and a tank top, Mr. Ithier watched from the street as firefighters battled the blaze. He called his mother, who was working 20 blocks away as a baby sitter. She soon joined him, along with his younger brother, Mark, 19, and his sister, Katrina, 27. 
''It was scary seeing my son outside with no shoes on,'' Mr. Ithier's mother, Debra Ithier, said. ''Everything I'd worked for in my life was gone, just like that.''
The electrical fire that had started in the kitchen left the three-bedroom apartment where Ms. Ithier, 50, had lived for 30 years unrecognizable. The computer and television in the living room were melted. The walls had burned down, exposing the charred remains of the building's framework. Furniture, clothing, jewelry, family photographs and birth certificates were all seared. The grandparents' apartment also suffered a lot of damage, both from the fire and the water used to extinguish it.
For six months, as the family waited for the apartment to be restored, Ms. Ithier and her two sons stayed separately with friends and family, while Katrina remained in a shelter with her grandparents.
''I missed my family,'' Mark said. ''I just wanted my house to be fixed.''
Finally, in January 2010, the Ithiers' apartment was repaired, and they were able to move back in. But during the next eight months, Ms. Ithier said, her landlord refused to accept her rent -- which had been suspended after the fire to maintain her status as the legal tenant -- saying a notice from the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal was needed to reinstate the amount she paid. (Ms. Ithier paid $549 a month, and she received a Disability Rent Increase Exemption, which prevents her rent from increasing.)
The only financial assistance Ms. Ithier received after the fire was a one-time payment of $500 from the Red Cross to buy clothes. She said she was forced to use money she would have spent on rent to cover her family's basic needs.
''I would have loved to save the money, but I was in a situation where we needed to get ourselves together,'' she said. ''We didn't have furniture. I had to get bedroom sets, winter clothes and, of course, you have to keep the refrigerator full.''
In September 2010, Ms. Ithier received a notice from the state housing agency that she owed her landlord $5,490 for rent through the following month. Ms. Ithier is divorced and has not held a steady job since she started having psychogenic nonepileptic seizures seven years ago. The condition, for which she takes medication, causes her to shake uncontrollably and black out for short periods.
Ms. Ithier's only monthly income is $1,142 in Social Security disability benefits and $247 in food stamps. Her younger son is in high school and does not work. Her older son was unemployed after the fire and only recently started working as a teacher's aide with special-education kindergartners. Her daughter works in advertising but is paying off student loans.
Last June, Ms. Ithier received a one-shot deal from the city's Human Resources Administration to help with the back rent, but it did not cover all her arrears. She turned to the Community Service Society of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and received $1,000.
Ms. Ithier has not been able to replace most of what was lost in the fire. A collage of the family's surviving photographs hangs in her repaired living room. On a bookshelf sits an ''I Love Lucy'' doll of Lucille Ball in her outfit from the ''Vitameatavegamin'' episode, the only remaining item from Ms. Ithier's once-expansive collection of ''Lucy'' memorabilia.
Emotionally, the family is still trying to recover from the fire.
''I just hope we can be happy again,'' Jose said. ''The financial stress has taken a toll on everyone.''

HEADLINE: A New Shot at Mortgage Relief

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
Like millions of other homeowners, William D. Compton would like to refinance his mortgage so that he pays less each month for his three-bedroom house in Gulf Breeze, Fla. With the savings, he figures he could afford a few extra movies and restaurant dinners or he could buy a new stove and brakes for his car, purchases he has postponed because finances are so tight.
Although he would appear to be a good candidate, Mr. Compton, 57, has been turned down twice for a federal refinancing program aimed at homeowners like him.
Still, he has renewed hope. That's because the government is expanding the Home Affordable Refinance Program, which was meant to help homeowners whose mortgages are backed by the government and whose home values have declined sharply, even below what the borrowers owe. Mr. Compton is one of those underwater homeowners. 
When the Treasury Department announced the program, referred to as HARP, two years ago, it said it could help four million to five million homeowners whose home values had plunged. Yet just 900,000 borrowers -- whose loans are owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored housing finance companies -- have successfully refinanced through the program. Starting early next month, though, banks will begin using new criteria intended to make more borrowers eligible: raising the ceiling on how much owners can borrow over the value of their home as well as relaxing rules that might force banks to take back bad loans from the government. In announcing the change, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, carefully eased expectations, suggesting about 900,000 more homeowners would be helped, roughly doubling the size of the program to date.
Analysts welcomed the change, but some criticized it for still not capturing nearly enough of the people who could benefit from lower interest rates.
Of the 22 million borrowers who could be eligible for the government refinancing program, nearly 70 percent of them are paying interest rates of 5 percent or more, according to CoreLogic, a research firm. Conventional mortgage rates are currently closer to 4 percent.
Greater participation could help the beleaguered housing market, which showed renewed signs of decline in data released on Tuesday, as well as help shore up the broader economy.
''The universe is much larger than what has come through the pipeline,'' said Paul Ballew, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance. Mr. Ballew said that if 10 million more people refinanced and saved an average of $200 a month, that would work out to be about $24 billion a year of additional spending power in the economy.
Other economists and officials of the Federal Housing Finance Agency say it is unrealistic to expect all those borrowers to refinance. Some people are wary of government programs, while others will be put off by upfront application fees and the paperwork burden. Those who have home equity loans or second mortgages could face tougher approvals.
Since the refinancing program is optional, lenders may impose additional restrictions. What is more, it is costly to devote staff to refinancing applications, so lenders may simply be reluctant to do so.
Mr. Compton has calculated that a refinancing would save him and his wife, Lynne, about $275 on their $1,397 monthly payment. He has not missed a payment, despite being laid off from one job and enduring two pay cuts in the last two years. His salary is now roughly two-thirds what it was when they bought the house five years ago -- a house that has since fallen in value.
The loan servicer, JPMorgan Chase, initially turned down the refinancing application because the Comptons had been living in another, smaller property they owned while renting out their main house.
The couple moved back in September and reapplied after changing their drivers' licenses and utility bills.
This time, a loan officer told Mr. Compton, who works as a public transportation planner, that he did not qualify because his loan had been sold to two different investors. Mr. Compton said he confirmed through a government Web site that his loan was now owned solely by Freddie Mac.
''It angers me quite a bit,'' said Mr. Compton, who added that unlike other borrowers, he never took out a home equity loan during the boom and has consistently paid his bills. The refinancing program, he said, should be ''a perfect fit for me.''
He suspects that Chase -- as well as other lenders -- believe ''that if you just tell people 'no' often enough, eventually they will just say O.K., and move on.''
After being asked about Mr. Compton's case, a Chase spokesman said the company was investigating his file. ''We are reaching out to the customer to see if we could refinance him through HARP 2,'' said the spokesman, referring to the expanded government program, ''or offer another option.''
Meg Burns, senior associate director for housing and regulatory policy at the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said the agency could not control individual lenders.
Ms. Burns said the new criteria were intended to ''serve these specific borrowers whose home values had declined and did not otherwise have access to a refinance or at a cost that we thought was reasonable.'' She added that the program was not meant to bolster the overall economy. (Separately, since April 2009, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have refinanced eight million loans through other programs for borrowers who still have equity in their homes.)
Some analysts complain that the new rules are too narrow to spur enough refinancings to actually help the economy. Christopher J. Mayer, a professor of real estate at Columbia Business School, said the new criteria would do little to encourage banks to compete for refinancing business. ''This was a program designed to be very small,'' he said.
Even if the program were to help far more borrowers refinance, some economists expect little increase in consumer demand. A much larger refinancing boom last decade led to a rise in consumer spending that was only ''modest and transitory,'' said Sam Khater, senior economist at CoreLogic.
Indeed, the savings from a refinancing may go toward paying off other debts or creating a cushion for lean times.
It took two years for Leslie Davidson, a consultant who helps companies produce audio and Web conferences, to refinance the mortgage on her townhouse in Pacifica, Calif. After spending more than $1,200 on appraisals and getting rejected by several lenders, Ms. Davidson finally got approved through the federal government refinancing program with her current servicer, CitiMortgage, earlier this year.
She reduced her monthly payments by nearly $400, and bought an Apple laptop. But she is mostly using the savings to pay off more loan principal each month and reduce the credit card debt that she racked up during the economic downturn.
Government officials say the main benefit of the expanded refinancing program is to reduce the likelihood that borrowers -- even those who have consistently made payments -- will eventually default.
''The economy is weak, and the unemployment rate is high, and sometimes bad things happen to good people,'' said Frank E. Nothaft, chief economist at Freddie Mac. ''If they get hit with another whammy such as they lose their job,'' he added, ''they are more likely to go into delinquency and into foreclosure.''
But some critics say the government's refinancing program sidesteps the fundamental problem that drives foreclosures, which is that close to 10.7 million borrowers -- more than a fifth of all mortgage holders -- owe more than their homes are worth. Many of them have already missed too many payments to be eligible for refinancing.
The housing market has yet to see its bottom, and an increasing number of economists worry that depressed housing prices and underwater borrowers are holding back a broader recovery.
''If the group we're trying to reach is those who are underwater,'' said Katherine Porter, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine who specializes in bankruptcy and mortgages, refinancing to lower monthly payments is ''a very odd mismatch between the problem and the solution.''
She added: ''Don't get me wrong, that puts more dollars in families' pockets and may have a stimulus effect, but it's a very tangential way of addressing underwater homeowners.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 1, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about the expansion of a federal program meant to help some homeowners whose home values have declined sharply misstated, in some editions, the amount of spending power that would be added to the American economy if 10 million more homeowners refinanced and saved an average of $200 a month. It is $24 billion, not $240 billion.

HEADLINE: Moving Beyond Yesterday's Standards

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
I HAVE never been one of those people who feel they live in the wrong era. I am eternally grateful, for example, to draw breath in the age of anesthesia. But I have occasionally lamented that I was born just a few years too late.
If I'd learned about wine in the 1960s rather than the '80s, perhaps I, too, could regale you with annoying stories of buying cases of '59 Lafite and '61 Latour for $8 a bottle. Maybe my cellar, such as it is, would be bulging with grand cru Burgundy that I got for a song because, after all, who back then cared about Burgundy? 
By the time I had some money and the inclination to splurge on wine, these historic benchmark wines had become absurdly, ridiculously overpriced.
Consider that back in 1975, Kermit Lynch, the importer and shop owner in Berkeley, Calif., was retailing a case of Domaine Leflaive Bienvenues-Batard-Montrachet 1972 for $125, not cheap then by any means, but doable for the determined. Adjusted for inflation, this excellent white Burgundy from a decent vintage would be the equivalent of $500 today. How quaint. Now, at Sherry-Lehmann in New York, a case from the 2008 vintage runs about $4,800.
Generations of wine lovers learned firsthand of the gorgeous polychromatic potential of wine by drinking those bottles that are almost universally believed to represent the heights of achievement: the first-growth Bordeaux and grand cru Burgundies. Yet an entire younger generation of wine lovers, say those 40-ish and younger, may grow old never having savored a great Musigny or a classic Chateau Latour, unless they are extremely wealthy or very lucky.
Sad, yes. Yet just as certain, we live in the greatest time ever to be wine lovers, with access to more high-quality wine in more different styles from a greater diversity of places than ever before. Just possibly, this wealth of wonderful choices is due partly to the soaring cost of those reference points for greatness.
Years ago, a great wine list was essentially a great Bordeaux list, or a great Burgundy list. Sometimes it was both, with a few more selections, of course. In the early 20th century, you would find Champagne, sherry and, if the obstacle of world wars could be skirted, some German riesling and possibly something from Alsace. Later on you'd also find some wines from Napa Valley and Tuscany, depending on the restaurant's cuisine.
Nowadays, the possibilities seem endless. One reason, I submit, is that with little access to the classically great wines, yet with a public thirst for greatness that far exceeds that of 30 years ago, importers, distributors, sommeliers and consumers themselves have been compelled to seek out wines that nobody paid attention to 25 years ago, if they even existed.
Mr. Lynch, in a telephone conversation, argued against including Burgundy in this equation, saying that barely a thimbleful of grand cru is made each year compared with the rivers of top-flight Bordeaux. But he agreed that the attention diverted from Bordeaux had moved to many formerly esoteric regions, and that this new attention was critical to maintaining diversity in the future.
''In the old days, nobody wanted to hear a word about cabernet francs from the Loire,'' he said. ''Today, it's a big market for me.''
Who, back in 1991, was buying 20-year-old Rioja gran reservas? Not a lot of Americans. Nowadays, we prize a '91 gran reserva from a producer like R. Lopez de Heredia for its aromatic nuances, grace and gentle power.
Sure, back then, the Mosel had its secret admiration society, in which a select few indulged its fascination with the incremental variations in slate-based terroir, as revealed in profound detail by these German rieslings. Nowadays, rieslings have gotten a lot more popular, partly because of the proselytizing of importers and sommeliers. Would they all have been so enthusiastic if these wines had not been so relatively reasonably priced?
What about the Jura? Nobody in this country drank wines from this oddball backwater 25 years ago, beyond the occasional novelty of a vin jaune. But the wonderful savagnins, trousseaus and poulsards now lend vinous street cred to the hippest sommeliers.
The story repeats itself all over the Old World. Priorat, Bierzo and Ribeira Sacra in Spain. The Valle d'Aoste, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Valtellina in northern Italy. Campania, Basilicata and Sicily in the south. If we could buy the best of Burgundy and Bordeaux, would we still be fascinated by the potential of Mount Etna, where vineyards of nerello mascalese, in the hands of risk takers like Salvo Foti and Ciro Biondi, give expression to the terroir of a living volcano?
Would we also care about the assyrtikos of Santorini, and the dry furmints of Hungary, and rejoice when we find them on a wine list? Would we be as curious about the tannats of Uruguay? The malbecs of the Loire -- I mean the cots, as they are called there?
In the New World, the transition hasn't been as smooth. Driven by the extravagant pricing of cult cabernets and a desire to keep up with Bordeaux, even mediocre Napa Valley cabernet sauvignons can cost more than $100. Many consumers take refuge in Argentina or Chile, not indefensible choices, or cheap imitation Napa cabs, no excuses for that. But there are some genuinely distinctive alternatives.
Mount Eden Vineyards in the Santa Cruz Mountains is better known for chardonnays, but it makes superb cabernets that are relative steals for under $50, especially if you value grace and restraint as well as intensity. Arnot-Roberts is known for syrahs, but I love its fresh, tobacco-scented Santa Cruz cabernet from Fellom Ranch. Napa may be the benchmark, but I'll settle for the Santa Cruz Mountains.
I've got plenty of wonderful wines to drink. So you old-timers can keep your memories of great cheap Burgundy, Bordeaux and Napa Valley. I don't need them. Well, not really, but you know what I mean.

HEADLINE: Hopeful Consumer Data Lifts Mood on Wall Street

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced for a second day Tuesday as stronger-than-expected consumer confidence data and hopes for further progress on a solution to Europe's fiscal problems bolstered sentiment.
However, in a sign investors are still nervous about the European debt crisis, defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples were among the best performers. And the Nasdaq composite index closed lower. 
Helping to lift the mood on Wall Street, the Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer confidence jumped to its highest level since July, handily topping economists' forecasts.
''This is a huge rise in consumer confidence,'' said Lindsey M. Piegza, economist at FTN Financial in New York. ''It gets us back to second-quarter levels and further underscores the dramatic move that we've seen in consumer spending.''
Still, the confidence index remains historically low and is well below a recent peak of 72.0 in February.
Financial shares limited the advance, with the S.& P. financial index down 0.6 percent. Shares of Bank of America dropped 3.2 percent to $5.08, its lowest closing level since March 2009.
Bank shares have been battered by worries that the impact of the euro zone crisis could spread through the global financial system, and those losses highlight the fragility of any stocks rally until European Union policy makers resolve the crisis.
''There seems to be some movement on the European front, but things certainly haven't been resolved,'' said Thomas Villalta, portfolio manager for Jones Villalta Asset Management in Austin, Tex. ''Financials are taking a step back and are kind of keeping a cap on the market as a whole.''
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 32.62 points, or 0.28 percent, at 11,555.63. The S.& P. 500 was up 2.64 points, or 0.22 percent, at 1,195.19. The Nasdaq composite index was down 11.83 points, or 0.47 percent, at 2,515.51.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 5/32, to 100 4/32. The yield rose to 1.99 percent, from 1.97 percent late Monday.
The day's most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange was the AMR Corporation, even though it was halted 28 times throughout the day. It plunged 84 percent to 26 cents a share after the company, the parent of American Airlines, filed for bankruptcy protection and named a new chairman and chief executive.
After the market's close, Standard & Poor's reduced its credit ratings on several big banks in the United States and Europe, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.
Weakness in some large-cap Internet stocks weighed on the Nasdaq after strong gains in those stocks on Monday. Amazon.com dropped 3 percent to $188.39.
Separate data on Tuesday showed the beleaguered American housing market was still struggling. The S.& P. Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas for September fell 0.6 percent from August on a seasonally adjusted basis. Economists had predicted no change.
Prices in August were also revised to show a decline of 0.3 percent after originally being reported as unchanged.
The index had leveled off in recent months, and analysts are hoping the market is at least stabilizing. Even so, prices are expected to stay weak into 2013 or longer, given the large number of homes still likely to come up for sale even as buyers stay on the sidelines.
''The supply-demand imbalance that exists in the housing market will continue,'' said Tom Porcelli, chief United States economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
There was some other positive housing news. The number of homeowners who are under water on their mortgages -- they owe more than their home is worth -- decreased modestly in the third quarter, though levels remained high.

HEADLINE: Some Thoughts for the Shopping Season

 BODY:
The big banks canceled plans for new debit card fees after their customers rebelled and members of Congress objected. But if Americans think their debit card problems are over, they're wrong. 
A 2009 law shields consumers from the worst predations of the credit card companies. It requires card issuers to give a 45-day notice before raising interest rates, says late charges and other penalties must be ''reasonable and proportional'' and that the companies clearly show late fees and other facts, such as how long it would take to pay off a balance if less than the full amount is remitted. Debit card and checking customers need similar protections.
In a report on safe checking earlier this year, The Pew Charitable Trusts found that the 10 largest banks reserved the right to reorder debit card transactions and process the largest withdrawals first. That will drain an account more quickly and could generate multiple overdraft charges. The group said four of those banks have dropped reordering for some kinds of transactions, but it said that the banks had retained ''the right to change their account terms and conditions -- including transaction posting order -- at any time, for any reason.''
The Pew group has also found that banks have a bewildering array of charges for checking account customers. Indeed, some banks had as many as 54 possible fees, for such things as depositing large amounts in coins, asking for staff assistance, online transfers and so on. Even the most attentive customers have a hard time figuring out what they're being charged for what service since notice of the fees are scattered throughout disclosure documents that run an average of 111 pages.
The Pew group, along with some members of Congress, are urging the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to take several steps to protect checking account holders. Among other things, banks should be required to disclose important checking account terms in a brief document, refrain from posting deposits and withdrawals in a manner that increases overdrafts and make overdraft fees reasonable and proportional to the customer's offense. That all makes very good sense.

HEADLINE: Suspicious of U.S. Outreach, China Is Stressing Ties With Myanmar

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Li Bibo and Edy Yin contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- When Myanmar's military leader, Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, arrived here on Monday in a crisp tan uniform and a matching cap, he got a welcome from the very highest levels of the Chinese government.
Vice President Xi Jinping, who is expected to become China's top leader in 2012, met with him, as did Gen. Chen Bingde, the chief of the general staff of the People's Liberation Army. General Chen told General Min Aung Hlaing, in the words of the state news agency Xinhua, that ''bilateral relations have developed well through the joint efforts of both sides.''
In any given week, such meetings would have been quickly noted and just as quickly forgotten. But the visit by Myanmar's top general has become a subject of conversation among scholars and journalists because it came just two days before Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is scheduled to visit Myanmar, the first appearance there by an American diplomat of that rank in 56 years. 
One Chinese scholar, Xu Liping from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said in an interview on Tuesday that although the general's trip ''does come at a sensitive time, the meetings are not closely linked to Hillary's visit.'' But another scholar, Mu Gengyuan of the Chinese Institute of International Studies, said the general's arrival was ''clearly an opportunity to reassure Beijing and communicate with Chinese leaders before Hillary's arrival in Myanmar tomorrow.''
The attention paid to General Min Aung Hlaing's visit reveals the importance that Chinese officials and scholars attach to the Obama administration's policy of engagement with Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, and its potential effect on Myanmar's relations with China. This nation is Myanmar's biggest economic partner, and its influence in Myanmar has in recent years overshadowed India's.
China's interests in Myanmar include oil and natural gas pipelines that are under construction; access to the Indian Ocean; and the stability of border regions, where ethnic clashes have broken out between the Burmese military and guerrilla groups. Trade between China and Myanmar reached $5.3 billion last year, and China is the biggest foreign investor in Myanmar, with $15.8 billion in investments there.
Now, the Chinese are warily watching as the United States makes overtures toward Myanmar's leaders.
''There is no doubt that many inside the Chinese establishment interpret it as part of a larger U.S. strategy on China,'' said Mr. Xu, an expert on Southeast Asia. ''It is another step taken by the U.S. to strengthen its presence in the region.''
Conservative voices in Chinese military and foreign policy circles now talk regularly about American attempts to hem in China, despite denials from American officials. On a trip through the region two weeks ago, President Obama announced he was sending 2,500 military personnel members to Australia. He also joined Asian leaders at a summit meeting in confronting Prime Minister Wen Jiabao over China's expansive territorial claims to the South China Sea.
Thomas E. Donilon, Mr. Obama's national security adviser, wrote in an opinion article published on Sunday in The Financial Times that the United States intended to ''maintain and enhance a strong network of allies and partners'' in the Asia-Pacific region. Some Asian countries, Vietnam especially, have expressed concern over China's growing clout. Myanmar has been more circumspect, even under the new government of President Thein Sein, who American officials say has signaled a tolerance for experimentation with political and economic reforms. But one action this year -- the suspension by the Burmese government on Sept. 30 of a Chinese-financed, $3.6 billion dam project that had ignited popular protests -- caught the attention of Chinese leaders.
Some Chinese officials and scholars contend that the Obama administration played a role in persuading Mr. Thein Sein to block the dam or even in stoking the protests. The administration has not acknowledged any involvement.
''The incident sends a clear signal to China,'' said Ms. Mu, the scholar at the Chinese Institute of International Studies, which is linked to the Foreign Ministry. ''With the U.S. strategy of refocusing on the region, it is already making inroads in Myanmar. It also acts as a reminder that the public diplomacy of China still leaves much to be desired.''
Ms. Mu said that China and Myanmar remained committed to strong ties, but that their relations had changed since the United States became more involved in the region.
''The Myanmar government exhibited a strong desire to amend its relationship with the U.S. and Europe probably out of fear of becoming over-reliant on China and turning into a vassal state of an increasingly powerful neighbor,'' she said.
On Wednesday, as Mrs. Clinton traveled to Myanmar, the English-language edition of Global Times ran an editorial on U.S.-Myanmar relations that highlighted the Myitsone Dam fiasco and concluded with this: ''China welcomes the opening-up of Myanmar, but firmly opposes it stepping on China's interests.''
Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, an analyst in Beijing for the International Crisis Group, said there was a range of opinions in China on the American involvement in Myanmar. While many people examining the strategic aspects see efforts by the United States to encircle China, others view Myanmar's desire to diversify its foreign relations and escape sanctions as a natural development. ''On the economic side, there are businesspeople who think they will gain from Myanmar opening up to the rest of the world in terms of a better business environment,'' she said.
Relations between the Chinese Communist Party and the Myanmar government, long run by a military dictatorship, have waxed and waned. In the 1960s, when China was trying to foment Cultural Revolution-style upheaval in Burma, people were suspicious of China, wrote Thant Myint-U, a scholar with a new book on modern Myanmar, ''Where China Meets India.'' Anti-Chinese riots broke out in June 1967. But in the 1990s, when much of the world tried to isolate Myanmar, China kept up relations.
''There is no special dislike of China or Chinese culture; dislike suggests a familiarity that is not there,'' Mr. Thant Myint-U wrote. ''Rather, there is a sense of the dangers of being next to an increasingly powerful and populous nation, whose internal wars and politics have time and again spilled over to wreak havoc on the much smaller country to the southwest.''

HEADLINE: Iranian Protesters Attack British Embassy

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH and RICK GLADSTONE; Robert F. Worth reported from Cairo, and Rick Gladstone from New York. Alan Cowell and Ravi Somaiya contributed reporting from London, and Artin Afkhami from Boston.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Iranian protesters shouting ''Death to England'' stormed the British Embassy compound and a diplomatic residence in Tehran on Tuesday, tearing down the British flag, smashing windows, defacing walls and briefly detaining six staff members in what appeared to be a state-sponsored protest against Britain's tough new economic sanctions against Iran.
The attack was the most serious diplomatic breach since the traumatic assault on the United States Embassy after Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979. Britain's foreign secretary, William Hague, expressed outrage over the attack, saying Britain held Iran's government responsible and promising ''other, further, and serious consequences.''
The scale of the attack -- led by hundreds of students described as members of the Basij militia by the Iranian state media -- appeared to surprise even some Iranian officials. Later in the day, Iran's Foreign Ministry released an uncharacteristic expression of regret that contrasted sharply with the angry rhetorical jabs at Britain issued a day earlier by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 
Iran's leaders, buffeted by the new sanctions, a collapsing economy and increasingly bitter infighting among the political elite, may have welcomed a chance to change the subject, analysts said. But the episode also appeared to be a shot across the bow aimed at the West, in line with Tehran's old policies of escalating defiance.
''Khamenei's philosophy is often to react to outside pressure with provocation, to imply that Western pressure will only further radicalize, not moderate, Iranian behavior,'' said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Security forces initially stood by as students laboriously broke through the embassy's massive main gate and then ransacked the offices, burning British flags and smashing pictures of Queen Elizabeth II. Only later did police officers in riot gear begin a somewhat lackadaisical effort to remove the protesters from the grounds, according to reports on state-supported Iranian news media and images broadcast on state television.
President Obama, speaking about the assault during a meeting with Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands at the White House, said he was ''deeply concerned'' that the Iranian authorities had permitted it to happen. ''For rioters essentially to be able to overrun the embassy and set it on fire is an indication that the Iranian government is not taking its international obligations seriously,'' Mr. Obama said.
The European Union also rushed to condemn the assault, and the United Nations Security Council issued a statement calling on Iran to protect foreign diplomats and embassy property.
Of the three nations Iran's leaders loathe the most -- Israel, the United States and Britain -- only Britain maintains an embassy in the country, making it an easy target. But hostility to the British taps a deep vein in the Iranian psyche. The United States may be the ''Great Satan'' to Iran's theocratic rulers, but it is Britain -- the crafty old colonial power whose designs in Iran go back two centuries -- that is still widely blamed for almost every upheaval in the country. One of the events that helped ignite the 1979 revolution was Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's decision to publish an article accusing Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the revolt's then-exiled spiritual leader, of belonging to a family of British agents.
''The 'British hand' is said to be behind every major event of the past 150 years,'' said Abbas Milani, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Stanford University. ''The Americans are seen as naive malleable tools in the hands of the Brits.''
A day before the embassy assault, Ayatollah Khamenei assailed Britain in a speech as an emblem of Western imperial arrogance, saying it ''has a history of humiliating nations, destroying cultural and civilization heritage and taking control of their resources.''
Britain's new economic sanctions require all contacts to be severed with the Iranian Central Bank, a step that the United States had already taken. The United States and the European Union also imposed new sanctions last week after a United Nations report offered new evidence suggesting that Iran may be developing nuclear weapons and missile delivery systems.
The intensifying struggle over Iran's nuclear program was visible in another aspect of Tuesday's embassy assault: the protesters could be heard chanting the name of Majid Shahriari, an Iranian nuclear scientist who was killed by mysterious assailants exactly a year ago. Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency issued a report on Tuesday accusing Israeli and British intelligence of carrying out the assassination.
Iranian officials have derided the latest United Nations report on Iran's nuclear program as ''propaganda'' written at the behest of the United States to justify airstrikes on Iran.
The attack on Tuesday began when about 50 protesters invaded the offices in the vast walled compound housing the British Embassy and its manicured grounds, situated in a busy neighborhood in the heart of Tehran, Iranian state media reported. Outside the gates, thousands of student protesters chanted religious slogans and demanded the expulsion of the British ambassador. Meanwhile, 200 to 300 others broke into a British diplomatic residence a few miles north of the embassy, called Qolhak Garden. The facility also houses a school.
Fars reported that police officers freed six British staff members who had been surrounded by the Qolhak Garden protesters and that 12 of those protesters were later arrested.
According to Fars, the police eventually used tear gas to disperse some protesters inside the embassy grounds, and a number of protesters were wounded. The agency said the demonstration ended after Brig. Gen. Ahmad-Reza Radan, the deputy police chief, warned any recalcitrant protesters they would face a ''tough police confrontation'' if they did not leave the embassy.
Earlier, television images showed protesters, some armed with gasoline bombs, rampaging through offices strewn with papers, and at least one vehicle burning inside the compound. There could be no mistake about the state's compliance: police could be seen standing by in television footage, and in any case the security forces have maintained strict control over all large protests in Iran ever since the disputed presidential election of 2009.
The Iranian authorities have orchestrated similar political demonstrations against foreign embassies in the past, intervening only after the protest was well under way and the message was clear.
It was the most serious violence aimed at the British Embassy in Tehran since relations were restored in 1990 after a break caused by Iranian outrage over the 1988 publication of ''The Satanic Verses'' by Salman Rushdie, the Indian-British novelist.
The embassy attack came a day after Iran's Parliament approved a measure to expel the British ambassador and downgrade diplomatic relations between the two countries, in retaliation for Britain's new economic sanctions.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 2, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about Iran's passage of a law to downgrade relations with Britain referred incorrectly to the comparative severity of sanctions against Iran by Britain and the United States over Iran's suspect nuclear program, one reason for the downgrade. While new sanctions imposed by Britain include a provision requiring the severing of all contacts with the Iranian Central Bank, as the articles stated, that provision brings Britain's sanctions into line with those already imposed by the United States. It did not make Britain's sanctions ''the most severe,'' nor was it a step that the United States had not taken. (The error was repeated in an article on Wednesday about the attack on the British Embassy in Tehran by Iranian protesters.)

HEADLINE: In Congress, Role Reversal Over Federal Payroll Tax Cut

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In a sharp role reversal, Democrats and Republicans have become divided over whether to extend a federal payroll tax cut enjoyed by every working American last year, with Democrats leading the charge for the tax break and many Republicans demanding that the cut be paid for if it is extended at all.
It is a shift from the recently failed deficit talks when Republicans pushed for extending Bush-era tax cuts without paying for them and Democrats argued against added tax breaks for the most affluent Americans. Now the fight over how to handle the tax cuts as well as added unemployment benefits is set to play out in the final month of the year as the two parties prepare for a politically charged 2012. 
Congressional Republicans have long insisted that tax cuts keep money in the hands of Americans who then funnel it back into the economy, negating the need to offset the revenue loss. Echoing many of his Republican colleagues, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Senate Republican, once said that ''you should never have to offset the cost'' of tax cuts on Americans.
But the party appears to be making an exception for renewing and extending a cut that would reduce the Social Security payroll tax paid by employees by half, to 3.1. percent of wages from 6.2 percent. The position angers Democrats, who see it as unfair given the Republican position on the broader tax cuts that expire at the end of 2012.
''The only place in America that people don't want a fair system are Republicans here in the Senate,'' Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said in a news conference on Tuesday.
Despite the fact that they have signed the now famous pledge not to raise taxes, many Republicans, particularly in the House, oppose the extension on basic principle, arguing that the reduction in the payroll tax paid by employees does not stimulate the economy. They also fear it harms the Social Security fund in the long term, though the losses would be replenished by the general fund.
''I think that it is time we stop with putting these Band-Aids over huge chest wounds,'' said Representative Allen B. West, Republican of Florida. ''We continue to leverage this short-term political gimmick over the long-term viability of Social Security.''
The idea that a tax cut must be paid for -- and the fact that Democrats are not seeking the payroll tax relief without offsetting its costs this time -- reflects the politics of austerity that dominate the 112th Congress, in which deficit spending is the fiscal equivalent of the sun-dried tomato -- extremely passe.
''With this $15 trillion debt we now have,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said Tuesday, ''we have to pay for a measure like this, and I think we will pay for it.''
Indeed in the Senate, where the fight over the payroll tax break began this week, Republican support for the extension is growing, as long as it is paid for in a way that passes muster with the party. Democrats introduced legislation that would pay for the extension -- which would also lower the portion of the tax paid by employers, at a cost of roughly $115 billion -- with a 3.25 percent surtax on income over $1 million, an idea Republicans have already rejected. Democrats openly acknowledge it is little more than a stunt to emphasize the vast policy divisions between the parties.
Mr. McConnell said Republicans would offer an alternative this week; he declined to provide details. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said Tuesday that she had suggested a tax increase on high earners that protected employers from that burden. ''I don't think we should be imposing additional taxes on working families at a time when the economy is so fragile,'' she said.
Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, said his party's plan could involve a small increase in taxes for some high-income people who meet certain criteria.
A similar dynamic -- though with some different features -- is expected to shape the debate over whether to extend unemployment benefits set to expire at the end of the year, as well as other measures.
While many economists say a payroll tax holiday is good for the economy because it allows working- and middle-class Americans to retain hundreds of extra dollars to buy things, detractors argue that most of that money is saved, not spent, and therefore does not jolt the economy.
One Republican up for re-election, Senator Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts, goes further than Democrats who are pushing for the tax cut to stay. ''It wasn't paid for before so why it is paid for now?'' Mr. Brown said Tuesday. ''It will pay for itself.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 3, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about the tax debate in Congress described incorrectly the recipients of the payroll tax reduction that President Obama has proposed to extend in 2012. All working Americans who contribute to the Social Security system through payroll tax withholding receive the reduction; not all workers, as some are covered by other retirement programs. The article also misstated the year the reduction is in effect. It is this year, not last year.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Visit to Myanmar Raises Hopes and Concerns

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
BUSAN, South Korea -- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's trip to Myanmar this week is raising hopes for greater freedom in the isolated country, but also concerns that the Obama administration is rushing to reward the leaders of one of the world's most repressive countries.
''Sending the secretary of state is a pretty big deal,'' said David J. Kramer, the president of Freedom House, which ranks Myanmar among those nations it annually designates as ''not free.'' ''I do worry that we are moving a little too quickly.'' 
Mrs. Clinton's two-day visit is scheduled to begin on Wednesday, after a stop here in South Korea to attend an international aid conference. It comes after a year of political changes inside Myanmar that has startled administration officials and gradually overcome their initial wariness.
Her visit is a test of both the depth of those changes and of President Obama's largely unsuccessful policy of seeking to engage countries long shunned by the United States -- from Iran to Syria to North Korea.
''I see it as an elaborate dance that could have some unexpected consequences,'' said Janet Benshoof, the president of the Global Justice Center, who has long advocated on behalf of democracy in Myanmar.
Mr. Obama announced the first significant shift in American relations with Myanmar in decades during his trip to Asia this month, citing ''flickers of progress'' that merited reaching out. He did so even though Myanmar's government maintains a repressive grip on power and commits what human rights groups say are war crimes in military operations that have displaced more than 100,000 people this year alone.
''Military abuses continue with impunity in ethnic areas,'' Human Rights Watch said in a report released before Mr. Obama's announcement. The report cites government campaigns in Kachin, Shan and Karen, regions of Myanmar where minority groups have clashed with the military rulers for decades. ''The government continues to suppress dissent through a raft of repressive laws and the lack of an independent judiciary.''
The decision to send Mrs. Clinton was debated among the White House, the State Department and members of Congress, following a series of exploratory visits to Myanmar by the administration's special envoy, Derek Mitchell, who was confirmed in the position only five months ago.
While some officials pushed for reciprocal gestures to encourage more changes, others warned that initial efforts to reach out to the country's leaders in 2009 proved fruitless.
The decision came together only after Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama telephoned Myanmar's opposition leader and Nobel peace laureate, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who was released from house arrest last November. Her endorsement of the administration's strategy offers significant political cover to a policy of reciprocal diplomacy that could still backfire. Mrs. Clinton plans to present her with an award from Freedom House, a Washington-based democracy advocacy group, during the visit.
The secretary of state and her aides have said that Mrs. Clinton will raise many difficult questions with Myanmar's new president, U Thein Sein, a former general who was prime minister during some of the harshest periods of the crackdown, including the suppression of protests by monks in 2007.
After taking office in March, Mr. Thein Sein unexpectedly began taking steps to open the country's political process, relaxing restrictions on the media, labor unions and political parties like the one led by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi.
Among the issues Mrs. Clinton will raise are suspicions of illicit military cooperation with North Korea on missile technology and possibly nuclear technology, and the continued detention of at least 1,600 political prisoners. She will also press Mr. Thein Sein's government to open the political process further and to resolve the ethnic conflicts.
''Now, let's not get carried away,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a television appearance after her trip was announced. ''There is still a lot to be done, and it has to be tested.''
Ms. Benshoof, who argues that the government has committed enough violations of international law to warrant a referral to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, said she did not oppose Mrs. Clinton's visit in itself. Its success or failure, she said, would depend on how hard she pushed Mr. Thein Sein to account for the regime's behavior, past and present.
''Look, Chamberlain went to Munich,'' she said. ''I don't condemn him for that. Turning over Czechoslovakia to the Nazis is another matter.''
It has been more than a half-century since an American secretary of state visited the country. John Foster Dulles went to what was then called Burma on Feb. 26, 1955, hoping to enlist it in a defense alliance against China. (The military government changed the country's name to Myanmar in 1989. but most members of the opposition do not recognize the new name; neither does the United States government, as a matter of policy.)
Once the military assumed power in 1962, China became the country's main political and economic partner. Now, Obama administration officials say that they think that the leadership in Myanmar is trying to ease its international isolation at least in part to become less dependent on the Chinese.
Mrs. Clinton will begin her visit on Wednesday in the country's remote capital, Naypyidaw, and travel to its principal city, Yangon, on Thursday. In addition to the new president, she will meet members of the newly installed Parliament, which has held two sessions this year, deliberating to a degree that was unthinkable until recently.
One senior administration official familiar with the evolving diplomacy said he was convinced that the country's leaders were embarking on a path of profound change, but that they were uncertain of how to proceed after so many years under an isolated, dictatorial military junta.
He cited a small but striking scene: Seeking to learn something about legislative and electoral politics, some new parliamentarians were passing around a DVD containing episodes of ''The West Wing.''
''They're coming out of a cave,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Invitation to a Dialogue: Which Way on Taxes?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
President Obama and several Congressional Democrats have called for higher taxes on ''the rich'' as a way to help reduce the budget deficit. But we cannot ignore two negative byproducts that such a move would almost certainly entail. 
First is the increased potential for tax avoidance. High-income earners, when faced with a higher tax liability, will go to great lengths to defer income, incorporate their businesses to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates, or simply stop working, among other things.
Second is the macroeconomic impact of higher taxes on the rich. Taking capital away from the very people who are most likely to create jobs will naturally result in fewer jobs.
This is no trivial matter. Even if the economic effect is ambiguous, lawmakers should ''first, do no harm'' when considering tax changes in a fragile economy.
Instead, the better course of action is comprehensive corporate tax reform. There is strong, bipartisan support inside and outside of Congress to lower corporate tax rates while getting rid of special-interest loopholes.
Such a proposal could be revenue neutral, but its effect on the economy would spur growth because the lower rates would increase production and innovation. And fewer loopholes would reduce the exorbitant compliance costs. Over all, such reform would create jobs, keep the United States competitive in the global economy and help lower the budget deficit.
ANDREW ROTH Washington, Nov. 29, 2011
The writer is vice president for government affairs at the Club for Growth, which advocates pro-growth policies, lower taxes and limited government.
Editors' Note: We invite readers to respond to this letter for our Sunday Dialogue. We plan to publish responses and Mr. Roth's rejoinder in the Sunday Review. E-mail: letters@nytimes.com

HEADLINE: Perry Gains Endorsement From an Arizona Sheriff Tough on Immigration

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.; Ashley Parker contributed reporting from Miami.

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Rick Perry is polling at only the single digits in New Hampshire, and the question on this Tuesday was: Can a hard-nosed Arizona sheriff who was sued by the Justice Department and is known for aggressive pursuit of illegal immigrants -- and for making inmates wear pink underwear -- help him gain traction six weeks before the primary?
Once atop the polls, Mr. Perry, the Texas governor, has sunk to second-tier status, a decline partly attributed, in addition to weak debate performances, to rivals' painting him as soft on illegal immigration. That criticism has largely focused on his support of a plan that allows some children of illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition at Texas public universities. 
But at several appearances here on Tuesday, Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Ariz., praised Mr. Perry as the best man in the Republican presidential race and the staunchest defender of the United States' southern boundary. He said Mr. Perry had demonstrated his credentials by deploying Texas Rangers and other law-enforcement agencies to stop illegal crossings at the Mexican border.
''He's out there right now,'' said Mr. Arpaio, who unabashedly calls himself the ''toughest sheriff'' in the country. ''He's not just talking; he's doing the job. He has a lot of resources that he sent to the border.''
Mr. Arpaio's appearance highlighted how the immigration issue is again at the forefront of the Republican nominating fight. Newt Gingrich, now a front-runner in the field, warned his opponents Tuesday not to make an issue of his recent comments suggesting a softer approach on immigration, while in Florida, Mitt Romney promoted his endorsement by Cuban-Americans, one of whom expressed concerns about Mr. Romney's stance on the issue.
Mr. Arpaio, whose headquarters are in Phoenix, had been courted by Republican candidates including Herman Cain and Representative Michele Bachmann. But he was far from the favorite of everyone in the crowd -- at least those at the Perry campaign's third stop on Tuesday, at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College.
''Someone booing out there?'' Mr. Arpaio, a Massachusetts native, asked as he took the microphone. ''Yes,'' several people answered. ''Uh, O.K.,'' he replied.
It was also clear that Mr. Perry and Mr. Arpaio did not know each other well. The sheriff said he had only just met the governor, though they had spoken on the phone before.
Mr. Perry, for his part, introduced him here by pronouncing his name ''a-ROPP-eh-yay,'' which was not close. (It is are-PIE-oh.) ''Sheriff Joe!'' Mr. Perry quickly added.
Later, Mr. Perry made a minor gaffe by misstating the voting age, which is 18.
''Those of you that will be 21 by November the 12th, I ask for your support and your vote,'' he said, as some in the audience chuckled. ''Those of you who won't be, just work hard.''
In an effort to burnish his immigration credentials, Mr. Perry declared that he would back a federal policy ''to detain and to deport every illegal alien that we apprehend.''
An aide later made clear that the governor was suggesting that people arrested or detained -- and later found to be undocumented -- be expelled from the country after an expedited hearing.
It was far from clear whether the sheriff's endorsement would aid Mr. Perry here. A WMUR Granite State Poll of likely Republican voters recently found that only 4 percent considered immigration the most important issue. It may be more significant in Iowa, where Mr. Perry is investing more time and money.
Paul Scopa, who came to Mr. Perry's appearance here, said he doubted that Mr. Arpaio's backing would have any real effect. Mr. Scopa said he was not keen on Mr. Perry because of his debate stumbles. ''Put him under the gun, and the man does not impress,'' he said.
Mr. Arpaio is also a polarizing figure. Last year, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against him for not cooperating with an investigation into whether the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department is systematically violating the rights of Hispanics. It was the first time in a generation, according to officials, that the federal government filed suit to force a law enforcement agency to cooperate with such an investigation. The sheriff has called it an effort to intimidate him and has said he does not engage in racial profiling.
In Florida, Mr. Romney noted the endorsement of a trio of influential Cuban-American leaders, but one, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, said she did not agree with Mr. Romney on the issue of immigration. He has taken a more pointed tone recently in criticizing candidates like Mr. Gingrich who would support citizenship for law-abiding immigrants who have been in the United States for years. But Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said she was willing to overlook that in these tumultuous economic times.
''I'm never going to find a candidate with whom I agree 100 percent of time with 100 percent of the issues,'' she said, ''but I think the election hinges on the economy. I don't agree with Governor Romney's position on immigration, but I agree with him solidly on the economy, and for me, that's the driving force in this election.''

HEADLINE: Changes in Myanmar Impress Skeptics on Eve of Clinton Trip

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES; Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from Busan, South Korea.

 BODY:
YANGON, Myanmar -- The waves of change sweeping Myanmar are trickling down to the broken sidewalks and potholed streets of this dilapidated city.
Automated teller machines, ubiquitous in the world's major cities but absent here during years of economic stagnation, are now being installed at a handful of banks.
Street vendors hawk coffee mugs, key chains and posters adorned with pictures of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the country's main opposition leader, whose name and image were taboo during two decades of military dictatorship.
The government's changes -- rapid and unexpected, though still far from complete -- are winning over some of the country's deepest skeptics of the military-backed civilian government that came to power in March. 
''What has happened in these last few months is a miracle for us,'' said Daw Cho Cho Kyaw Nyein, an opposition leader and former political prisoner whose family suffered years of persecution by the military.
''To be frank, in the very beginning, I didn't believe a word of what they were saying,'' she said of the new government. ''Now I believe what is happening is for the good of the people.''
In a significant vote of confidence for the new government after years of international ostracism, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is scheduled to arrive in Myanmar on Wednesday, where she will meet with the new president as well as Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. Workers have laid a fresh layer of sod and repainted the gates of the opposition leader's house in anticipation.
Mrs. Clinton's visit is the first by a secretary of state since 1955. The changes in Myanmar have provided an opening to better relations with the United States at a time when the Obama administration is courting Southeast Asian nations as China asserts its influence in the region.
Mrs. Clinton will be touring Myanmar in the midst of what many see as the initial steps in a historic transformation toward democracy.
Since his inauguration in March, President Thein Sein has worked with the country's newly established Parliament to pass a raft of new laws and regulations. Labor unions have been legalized, the Internet has been mostly freed of heavy censorship, and proposals are being drawn up to overhaul the country's dysfunctional banking system. The government has also freed a number of political prisoners.
As the pace of change accelerated in recent months, observers debated why the former military men leading the government would be willing to cede nearly absolute power to pursue democratic changes and embrace dissidents officials have persecuted for decades. Mr. Thein Sein was a member of the junta that repeatedly crushed dissent before becoming president.
The answer, according to one of the president's advisers, is that Mr. Thein Sein realized that the country could no longer ignore the world around it.
''The president was convinced about the global situation; he saw where the global stream was heading,'' said U Nay Zin Latt, the adviser.
In one of the most crucial moves for establishing the legitimacy of the new government, Mr. Thein Sein has successfully courted Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. Her party, the National League for Democracy, recently said it would officially reregister and compete in coming elections for a number of parliamentary seats.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's views carry significant weight inside and outside the country. President Obama called her before announcing Mrs. Clinton's visit. Inside Myanmar, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is a mother figure whose decade and a half of house arrest earned her deep credibility and loyalty.
''When I talk to Aung San Suu Kyi, she says, 'Forget the past,' '' Ms. Cho Cho Kyaw Nyein said. ''She says have faith in Thein Sein. If she says that, we must have faith in him.''
Ms. Cho Cho Kyaw Nyein, who was imprisoned for seven years for opposing the military, has ample reasons to mistrust the government. Her father -- a former deputy prime minister who was in power during the last visit by an American secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, in the 1950s -- was jailed for seven years. Her mother was detained for three years, and so was her former husband.
But in an interview on Tuesday, she said she was very excited about Mrs. Clinton's visit and her meeting with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi.
''Let the two smart women talk,'' she said. ''It's unbelievable that Mrs. Clinton is visiting us.''
Not everyone in Myanmar is so enthusiastic about recent changes in Myanmar, nor are they convinced of the leadership's sincerity. Sitting in the back room of his grocery store in Yangon, U Ko Ko Gyi, another former political prisoner, criticized the government for the continued detention of other proponents of democracy.
Mr. Ko Ko Gyi was released Oct. 12 as part of an amnesty that the government offered as an olive branch to the opposition -- and a way to bolster Myanmar's image abroad. But hundreds of political prisoners remain in detention.
A recent comment at a news conference by Mr. Thein Sein that there are ''no political prisoners -- all prisoners have broken the law'' rankled Mr. Ko Ko Gyi. ''He is denying reality,'' Mr. Ko Ko Gyi said. ''If the government is really democratic, why aren't they releasing the people who were sent to prison for advocating democracy?''
Some international human rights advocates said such imprisonments -- as well as accusations of war crimes in putting down ethnic strife -- made them question whether Mrs. Clinton's trip now is a good idea.
''I do worry that we are moving a little too quickly,'' said David J. Kramer, the president of Freedom House.
Mrs. Clinton and her aides have said they are planning to raise difficult questions about topics like political prisoners with Mr. Thein Sein.
Others who question the country's ability to change quickly stress the difficulties of overhauling the economic system.
Many of the government's changes focus on the economy, which after decades of neglect under military rule and years of Western sanctions, is finally showing early signs of the dynamism evident in the countries that surround it.
Yangon's roughly 170 hotels are filled with potential investors, foreign government delegations and tourists. The country is seeking to privatize its railroads and is continuing a program to sell state-owned real estate.
The government says it will issue licenses for car showrooms -- there are almost none in the country -- and has begun a program to allow the owners of the decades-old cars plying the country's roads to import newer models. Shipments have been arriving from Japan in recent weeks, to much fanfare. But in a measure of Myanmar's disparity with its neighbors, most of the ''new'' cars are more than 10 years old.
Myanmar's financial system remains one of the most rudimentary in Asia. Most transactions are carried out in cash. The country has no credit cards (partly because of Western sanctions, which ban financial dealings by Western companies). The automated teller machines were installed after the government's recent decision to lift a nine-year ban on them.
Longtime observers of Myanmar also worry about potential resistance to change among hard-liners in the government.
Mr. Nay Zin Latt, the president's adviser, said in an interview that Myanmar was no different from any country undergoing radical transformation.
''I don't see hard-liners and soft-liners,'' he said, ''just different points of view.''
''Some people don't want faster change.'' Others, he said, ''say we are very much behind other countries, and we should go fast.''

HEADLINE: S.&P. Cuts Its Ratings For 15 Banks

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG, BEN PROTESS and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
9:37 p.m. Updated
Standard & Poor's on Tuesday downgraded some of the world's largest financial institutions, another blow to an industry that continues to struggle three years after the darkest hours of the financial crisis.
The agency lowered by one notch its long-term credit ratings on some of the biggest and best-known banks in the United States, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase. The action, the result of S.&P. applying new standards to 37 financial firms around the world, prompted a downgrade of 15 banks. Among the eight largest banks in the United States under review by S.&P., only Boston-based State Street was spared. 
''We've been doing a lot of deep thinking, and this goes back to taking account of lessons learned during the financial crisis,'' said Craig Parmelee, head of the agency's North American financial institutions practice.
Rating agencies, which were criticized for being too slow to sound the alarms about the 2008 financial crisis, have recently been carrying out an aggressive wave of downgrades. In September, Moody's cut its credit ratings on three large banks: Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. Moody's said the downgrades were warranted because it believed the federal government was less likely to extend a helping hand to ailing banks as it did in the wake of the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in the fall of 2008.
On Tuesday, S.&P. left 20 other banks unchanged and actually increased the ratings on two Chinese firms, the China Construction Bank and the Bank of China.
But for most financial institutions in the United States and Europe, it has been tough sledding this year.
In the United States, banks have been battling falling profits as economic woes and new regulations have eaten into profits. Overseas, concerns that European countries like Greece and Italy could default on their own debt payments have sent shockwaves through global markets, deepening the problems of American banks.
As the profit engines have slowed, cost-cutting has become a central focus. Over the summer, Goldman said that it would wring out $1.2 billion in costs from its operations by mid-2012, a move that eliminated more than 1,000 jobs. Bank of America, perhaps the most beleaguered of all banks, announced it could eventually lay off 30,000 employees as part of a wide-ranging plan to save $5 billion in annual costs by the end of 2013.
Even before the downgrade by S.&P., which came after the stock market's close on Tuesday, Bank of America's shares were hitting new lows for the year. At one point the stock touched $5.03, before closing at $5.08, a loss of 3.2 percent for the day.
This was the lowest point for Bank of America since the dark days of March 2009, when bank stocks and the broader market hit bottom in the wake of the financial crisis.
Some investors are uneasy that breaking the $5 level will mean a new chapter in Bank of America's troubles, causing some institutional managers to sell and taking the bank into the low single-digit realm usually reserved for faltering companies.
''Bank of America is a microcosm of the crisis of confidence in the industry - in the numbers, the managers and the regulators,'' said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst with Credit Agricole.
Bank of America is not alone in watching its stock price fall. Shares of Goldman Sachs have dropped more than 47 percent so far this year. Its stock closed Tuesday at $88.81.
S.&P.'s decision to issue broad downgrades is hardly surprising. The action come weeks after the rating agency overhauled its method for grading financial institutions. Now, the agency plans to keep a closer watch on whether banks have put away enough capital for rainy days. It also will pay particular attention to the overall health of the economy in the institution's home country, and whether that country's government will step in to bail out firms in times of extreme stress.
Mr. Parmelee of S.&P. likened the change to ''emphasizing the neighborhood before we begin to analyze the house.''
At the time of S.&P.'s announcement of its new rating method earlier this month, the agency signaled that it would lower the long-term ratings of as many as 15 percent of the banks it reviewed and would change the ratings on 40 percent. Investors, analysts said, should also pay particular attention to any short-term rating changes because that affects a bank's cost of daily borrowing.
''We believe that the industry is at a crossroads and that there are several inflection points, and it's too early to tell how each will play out,'' Jayan Dhru, S.&P.'s head of global financial ratings, said in a video explaining the new criteria. ''With more stringent capital and liquidity requirements and restrictions on higher-risk activities, the profitability of banking is likely to be much lower than it was before the crisis. This may be acceptable from a creditworthiness perspective, but the impact of business models and global growth may be significant.''
Investors continue to keep a close eye on Bank of America.
While the firm is in a stronger financial position than it was in 2009, investors remain deeply concerned about its potential losses from harmful subprime mortgages packaged by Countrywide Financial, the mortgage specialist Bank of America acquired in 2008.
In addition, as the second-largest bank in the United States after JPMorgan Chase, it remains vulnerable to any downshift in the United States economy, which has been posting anemic growth. Mr. Mayo said the ratings cut was not ''life-threatening,'' but was another indication that the Bank of America would face higher financing costs in the future. That would eat into its thin profit margins.
Then there is Europe. Bank of America has several billion dollars in direct exposure to Europe, but investors also worry that a deepening of the crisis over sovereign debt will hurt the broader banking group and ripple through financial markets.
Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer, questioned the timing of the downgrade, noting that Bank of America's loan losses and nonperforming assets were at levels well below where they were two years ago, while its capital had nearly doubled.
''They should have downgraded Bank of America back then,'' he said. ''This is confirmation that rating agencies are lagging indicators.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 1, 2011

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about Standard & Poor's decision to lower long-term credit ratings for some large United States and European banks erroneously attributed, in some copies, a distinction to the American banks involved. While the ratings cuts affected seven of the eight biggest American banks under review by S.& P., they are not the eight largest banks over all. The error was repeated in a subheading.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Obama Is Facing a Replay of '08 Hurdles in 'Hillary Country,' Pa.

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
SCRANTON, Pa. -- It was trivia night at Kildare's bar here, and among the teams competing was a group of history teachers from Scranton High School. They easily won the round that tested their knowledge of American presidents, including that the last one with facial hair was William Howard Taft.
But they were slightly stumped when a reporter asked them about their own preferences for president next year.
Brian Harrity, 33, who teaches world and early American history, said he had supported Hillary Rodham Clinton in the state's Democratic primary in 2008 over Barack Obama, and then Mr. Obama in November over the Republican, Senator John McCain. 
But during the last three years, Mr. Harrity said, Mr. Obama has not taken full advantage of the powers of the presidency to ''get things done,'' which means, in Mr. Harrity's view, that he has not put the economy back on track or created more jobs.
''I'm heavily Democratic,'' Mr. Harrity said. ''But if the right Republican came along, I would be open to voting for him.''
This is a common refrain here in what is still called ''Hillary Country,'' where Mrs. Clinton's family roots run deep and 75 percent of Democratic primary voters backed her failed bid for the Democratic nomination in 2008.
It is also a sign of why recent polls show Mr. Obama in trouble here in northeast Pennsylvania and across the state. He is visiting here Wednesday, his first trip to Scranton since he became president.
The northeast is a swing, bellwether region in a state that suddenly seems in play. White, working-class voters, here and elsewhere, have been especially hard hit by the economic downturn. They have little loyalty to Mr. Obama and feel he has not lived up to his promise.
Polls show that fewer than half the voters in Pennsylvania view Mr. Obama favorably and that he is losing support among independents and union households. It is too early for such polls to have much meaning, particularly before there is even a Republican nominee. But Mr. Obama's challenge in Pennsylvania, which has voted Democratic for president in the last five elections, is indicative of what he faces in states across the Rust Belt and could help determine the outcome of the presidential campaign.
His flagging poll numbers suggest how much has changed from 2008. Mr. Obama won the state over Mr. McCain by 10 percentage points; here in Lackawanna County, where Scranton is the county seat, he beat Mr. McCain by 26 percentage points.
Pennsylvania's unemployment rate for October was 8.1 percent, lower than the national average of 9 percent. But here, in this old coal mining region, the rate was 9.7 percent; the Scranton area has the highest unemployment in the state. The city is on the verge of losing 300 postal service jobs. The regional food bank served a record number of meals on Thanksgiving and has had a 25 percent increase in demand over the last year.
Local budgets are so squeezed that Mayor Christopher A. Doherty of Scranton, a Democrat and early Clinton supporter, has proposed raising property taxes by 29 percent. The county is proposing a tax increase of 38 percent.
''People are afraid,'' Mr. Doherty said. ''I remember when Ronald Reagan was president, unemployment was high and interest rates were through the roof. But we always thought things were going to get better. Today, we don't think things will get better.''
He said that under President George W. Bush, the federal government had cut the community block grants to Scranton by 6 percent and he had hoped to receive more financing under a Democrat. But, he said, under Mr. Obama, Scranton has lost 16 percent of that money.
''Four years ago it was about hope,'' the mayor said. ''Now it's about his record.''
Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, is the Republican candidate who fares best in the state in early polls, statistically tying Mr. Obama, in part because he is perceived as more moderate than the rest of the Republican field.
''For many people here, Obama is too liberal,'' said Ed Mitchell, a Democratic strategist based in nearby Wilkes-Barre.
Mr. Obama may have got off on the wrong foot with them when he suggested in 2008 that voters in small towns were bitter about the world passing them by and would ''cling to guns or religion.'' He lost this state's white, working-class voters, those without a college degree, first to Mrs. Clinton in the primary and then to Mr. McCain.
In a speech Wednesday at the high school -- where Mrs. Clinton opened her primary campaign -- Mr. Obama intends to exhort Congress to extend and expand his cut in the payroll tax, a move he says would save middle-class families an additional $1,000 next year.
Some are hoping Mr. Obama will do more to assert himself over Congress.
''Enough with the soft approach,'' said Corey O'Brien, a Democratic Lackawanna County commissioner and early backer of Mr. Obama. ''He's got to say, 'I'm in charge, and I'm going to get it done with or without Congress.' ''
''People are furious,'' Mr. O'Brien added. ''Everybody here is petrified they are going to lose their jobs tomorrow, and I mean everybody.''
Although Pennsylvania has one million more registered Democrats than Republicans, the Republicans swept the state in the 2010 elections. They now hold the governor's office, both houses of the legislature and two-thirds of the Congressional seats, and they control 54 of the 67 counties. This gives them an infrastructure they lacked in 2008.
''I'm feeling pretty good about where we sit,'' Robert Gleason, chairman of the state Republican Party, said in an interview.
The Obama campaign has been on the ground in the state since April and is trying to rebuild and re-energize its base. It has organized events with students and women, and volunteers have made more than 250,000 calls from phone banks and collected more than 35,000 ''I'm in'' cards from Pennsylvanians pledging support, campaign officials said.
The Obama team is also planning to deploy Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has roots in Scranton. Where Mr. Obama may be restrained, Mr. Biden relishes playing to the bleachers and is likely to assume the traditional vice-presidential role of attack dog.
Any feistiness at all will be welcome here by voters like Brian Evans, 74, a retired bus driver.
''Obama doesn't have the moxie to tell Congress to go to hell,'' said Mr. Evans, originally a Clinton supporter. As for 2012, Mr. Evans said he was looking at Republicans.

HEADLINE: Another 'Special' Day, Another Retail Dollar

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: Snappy sales gimmicks attached to specific days of the week may be the country's best hope for climbing out of its economic doldrums. Also, what City Room is reading in other newspapers and blogs. 

 BODY:
 It has become increasingly clear that the country's best hope to climb out of its economic doldrums may be to keep coming up with snappy sales gimmicks attached to specific days of the week. That's what now passes for a recovery plan. New York, with its many retailers, hardly stands apart from the trend.
 We've emerged from Black Friday, when most shoppers did their best not to trample one another, and nearly all managed to pursue bargains without firing sprays of pepper gas. That traditional post-Thanksgiving buying frenzy was followed by a relative newcomer, Cyber Monday, devoted to e-commerce and not to the stuffy old brick-and-mortar variety.
 Spending was reported to have been brisk both days, certainly enough to warm the cockles of Wall Street's heart. The Dow Jones industrial average closed on Tuesday at 11,555.63, which was nearly 300 points higher than where it stood just before the holiday. In the absence of much good news from any other discernible source, one must assume that all that shopping helped do the trick.
 Nor are we done with special days. 
 You probably missed something called Sofa Sunday, which came just before Cyber Monday. The creation of an iPad app called Catalog Spree, it offered a chance to shop while you dropped on the couch.
 But looming is Super Saturday, which by tradition is the last Saturday before Christmas and falls this year on Christmas Eve. "Historically, it has been the busiest day of the year for retailers," said Kathy Grannis, a spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation. But that, Ms. Grannis added, was "before Black Friday took over the title in recent years."
 Even sooner than Super Saturday is Free Shipping Day, Dec. 16, when many merchants pledge to provide, duh, free shipping, in time for their goods to arrive before Christmas. Sooner yet is Mobile Sunday, the second Sunday in December (this year Dec. 11), when people are encouraged to shop using their mobile devices.
 All these attention-grabbing days seem unlikely to bail out an economy burdened with stubborn unemployment and hobbled by useless gamesmanship in Washington. But since the politicians are in no rush to find a way out of the crisis, other than perhaps to pray that Americans spend like mad, the only recourse may be to create still more of these days.
 We could encourage jewelry purchases - with breakfast at Tiffany's? - and call it Ruby Tuesday. There might be a copyright matter to discuss with the Rolling Stones and maybe also with the restaurant chain of that name. But surely something could be worked out.
 Or perhaps designate it Fat Tuesday, not to be confused with Mardi Gras. This could be a device to get people to eat out, the name meant as a whimsical touch, not a slight. The more expensive the restaurant, the better - for the economy's sake, of course. Matinee Wednesday, a Broadway fixture, could become Martini Wednesday as yet another way to shake or stir spending.
 Since Thursday can be traced to the Norse god Thor, it could be a day when people are urged to shop at stores that carry Scandinavian merchandise bearing really hefty price tags. "Big Wednesday," the title of a 1970s movie, could describe the selling of just about anything. So could "Freaky Friday," come to think of it. Saturday is already well spoken for. Surely, on any given Sunday, there are possible gimmicks that wouldn't offend the religious sensibilities of Americans for whom it is a day of rest.
 You get the idea.
 If all this sounds a bit forced, ask yourself if it's any more strained than creations like Sofa Sunday and Mobile Sunday.
 In New York, we might not even be talking about desperate measures like these if the city were still the powerful manufacturing center it once was. But that's an era long gone. We need these Black and Cyber and Super and Sofa days as much as anyone else.
 That's how it goes when your economy is built on getting hard-working people to empty their wallets.

TOP STORIES
For 92nd St. Y, a Break From Wall St. Worry | Clients of John A. Paulson, the billionaire hedge fund manager, have had a brutal year, absorbing losses of as much as 50 percent.
But one of Mr. Paulson's investors, the 92nd Street Y, has nothing to worry about.
That's because Mr. Paulson, a member of the organization's board, has guaranteed he will cover the Y for any losses it incurs in his funds. Barring a sharp recovery, Mr. Paulson will have to write a personal check to the organization for several million dollars.
"This is a very uncommon arrangement," said Andrew M. Grumet, a lawyer specializing in philanthropy. "But the 92nd Street Y isn't your average nonprofit, and John Paulson isn't your average money manager." DealBook 
Once Again, Paulson Regrets the Error | In his third-quarter letter to investors, John A. Paulson, the founder of Paulson & Company, apologized again for his hedge fund's disastrous slide this year.
He noted that 2011 had been the worst in his firm's nearly two-decade history, with the Advantage Plus fund (a de facto misery index for the firm) down 45 percent through the end of October. DealBook

HEADLINE: More Americans Planning Holiday Travel This Year

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: More adults say they will travel for the holidays this year. 

 BODY:
It's that time of year again, and more Americans are saying they will take a trip of at least one night during this holiday season, a recent surveyfound.
Nearly 60 percent of adults were confident they would take a holiday trip this season. That's up from 50 percent last year and more comparable with 2009 levels (61 percent), according to a poll conducted by Ipsos Public Affairs on behalf of Mondial Assistance USA, which sells travel insurance and assistance services.
But while more people said they planned to travel, they expected to spend less on their trips - $980 on average, down from $1,040 last year, the survey found. Whether they'll stick to their budgets, however, remains to be seen. Last year, adults who took a holiday trip reported spending $1,530 on average, well above their initial expectations.
The poll, conducted by telephone in early November, was of a nationally representative sample of 1,000 randomly selected adults. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.
More than half of adults (54 percent) said that an annual holiday trip was important. Those most likely to find it important included parents of children under 18; those with a household income of $75,000 or more; and adults under 35.
Still, about two in 10 of those who said it was important to take an annual holiday trip were not confident that they would take one this year. Still, that was an improvement over the 32 percent who were not sure they would take a holiday trip in 2010, which means the "vacation deficit" has decreased.
Car travel is still the top mode of holiday transportation, cited by 56 percent of those surveyed. A third of travelers plan to travel by plane this year, compared with about a quarter last year. Just 1 percent said they'd take a train.
Of those people who did not take a vacation last year, but feel confident they will take a holiday trip this year, 11 percent say that they are alternating travel year by year to save money.
Will you travel for the holidays this year? If not, is it primarily due to economic reasons?

HEADLINE: Foreclosure Crisis Isn't Even Halfway Over, Analysis Finds

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: An analysis from the Center for Responsible Lending finds the foreclosure crisis isn't even halfway over. 

 BODY:
A new analysis suggests that the tide of home foreclosures isn't going to recede soon.
The report from the Center for Responsible Lending, "Lost Ground, 2011," finds that at least 2.7 million mortgages loaned from 2004 through 2008, or about 6 percent, have ended in foreclosure and that nearly 4 million more home loans (roughly 8 percent) from the same period remain at serious risk.
Put another way, "The nation is not even halfway through the foreclosure crisis," says the report, which analyzed 27 million mortgages made over the five years.
While most of those who have lost their homes are white, the report found, African-American and Latino borrowers have been disproportionately affected. Roughly a fourth of all those borrowers have lost their home to foreclosure or are seriously delinquent, compared with just under 12 percent for white borrowers.
And across the country, low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and neighborhoods with high concentrations of minorities have been hit especially hard, the report found.
The Center for Responsible Lending is a nonprofit group that works to eliminate abusive financial practices.
Its report also noted that certain types of loans have much higher rates of completed foreclosures and serious delinquencies. They include loans originated by brokers; hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages, option ARMs, loans with prepayment penalties and loans with high interest rates (subprime). African Americans and Latinos were more likely to receive a high-cost mortgage with risky features, regardless of their credit. For example, among borrowers with good credit (a FICO score of over 660), African-Americans and Latinos received a high-interest-rate loan more than three times as often as white borrowers.
Accompanying the report is an online mapshowing foreclosures and delinquencies by state.
Are you at risk for foreclosure? How has your neighborhood been affected by the crisis?

HEADLINE: Crunching the Numbers: Exploring the Math of the Debt Crisis

BYLINE: PATRICK HONNER and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Collecting and crunching economic information related to the debt crisis in Europe. 

 BODY:
Overview | What consequences do countries face by being in debt? What obstacles do they face trying to get out? In this lesson, students investigate the mathematics of being in debt by exploring and analyzing debt-crisis data. Through collecting and crunching economic information, calculating debt-repayment, and exploring the concept of financial risk, students apply quantitative skills that will help them better understand the crisis of being in debt, abroad or at home. 
Materials | Computers with Internet access, scientific or graphing calculators, spreadsheet software.
Warm-Up | Working in pairs or trios, students explore the infographic "It's All Connected: An Overview of the Euro Crisis" to become familiar with the basic vocabulary, geography and mathematics of the European financial crisis. 
As they work, they should jot down key vocabulary terms like debtor, creditor, imbalance, default, exposure, borrowing costs and interest rate. In their small groups, they should discuss and define these terms, using, as needed, resources like the Times Topics page on the European Debt Crisis or The Times's Glossary of Financial and Business Terms.
Have students tally the total debt for each country featured in the infographic (scrolling over each node in the graph reveals a list of that that country's debts) and compute the sums of these debts to determine how much each country owes; this figure will be used later. 
After they have explored the graph, have students write down their ideas down about why countries like Greece, Italy, Ireland and Portugal are considered "more worrisome," according to the infographic, and why they owe so much money to other countries. In a brief whole-class discussion, have students share their ideas, and discuss and summarize the relevant vocabulary.
If students need further background or explanation about the debt crisis in Europe, they can read through the Magazine's "Europe's Financial Crisis, in Plain English" and look at the infographic "The Eurozone."
Explain that a conventional solution to a debt crisis is to loan money to a country loaded with debt so that its creditors can be paid. Make a list of the potential benefits and hazards of such action, addressing questions like "Where does the money come from?", "What are the potential consequences for the lenders?" and "What are the potential consequences for the borrowers?"
 Related | The article "Central Banks Take Joint Action to Ease Debt Crisis" explains what the Federal Reserve and other banks have done to try to head off problems that could arise from the European debt crisis:
The Federal Reserve moved Wednesday with other major central banks to buttress the financial system by increasing the availability of dollars outside the United States, reflecting growing concern about the fallout of the European debt crisis. 
The banks announced that they would reduce by roughly half the cost of an existing program under which banks in foreign countries can borrow dollars from their own central banks, which in turn get those dollars from the Fed. The banks also said that loans will be available until February 2013, extending a previous endpoint of August 2012. 
"The purpose of these actions is to ease strains in financial markets and thereby mitigate the effects of such strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses and so help foster economic activity," the banks said in a statement. The participants in addition to the Fed were the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank. 
Read the entire article with your class, using the questions below. 
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension: 

        
What actions are the banks taking to shore up the financial system?
        
Why did the banks decide to take action now?
        
What effect is the program expected to have, and how did some analysts criticize it? 
        
How does the article characterize the debt crisis?
        
What questions do you still have about the debt crisis and its components?
Activity | Explain to students that they will now explore the basic mathematics of loans, interest rates and risk through a simplified model of loan repayment and risk calculation. 
Assign each small group one country experiencing problems with debt, including Greece, France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain. Their task is to tally up that country's total debt using the infographic "It's All Connected: An Overview of the Euro Crisis" and explore the quantitative consequences of the country taking out a loan to repay its debt.
Provide students with the following specifications: 

        
In our simplified model of loan repayment, we assume that the loan will be repaid in one lump sum at the end of the specified term. 
        
The variables to consider are the amount of the loan (P), the length of the loan in years (t), and the yearly interest rate (r).
        
We will use the formula A = P*e^(rt) to compute the amount of the lump-sum repayment of the loan. This is the formula for continuously compounded interest: A will be the amount the country must repay; P is the principal, or the initial amount of the loan; r is the yearly interest rate; t is the number of years; and e is Euler's constant, which is approximately 2.718.
Once students have calculated the amount the country needs to borrow (P), they should then use the formula to explore different loan scenarios based on the values of r and t. Have students compute the value of the lump-sum repayment, A, for 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 20-year loans (the t-values) at interest rates ranging from 2.0% to 6.0% in 0.5% increments (the r-values). Students can review how the formula works, and use an online interest calculator.
Have students compute the difference between the amount borrowed (P), and the amount repaid (A), and display these values in table form, with the different t-values heading the columns and the r-values heading the rows. In our simplified model, these differences represent the lender's profit on the loan, or the price of the loan for the borrower.
Now have students explore the role of risk in lending by taking into consideration the likelihood their selected country will be able to repay the loan.
Here is an example to share with students: 
Let us assume hypothetically that there is a 5% chance that our selected country will not be able to repay the loan. What this means mathematically is that if the country took out this loan 100 times, we would expect the loan to be repaid 95 times; the other 5 times, the country would pay back nothing, or "default" on the loan. The lender therefore assumes some financial risk in making the loan, that is, the risk that it won't be paid back. 
One way lenders handle this risk is by demanding that the borrower pay back more than they originally borrowed. Suppose a country takes out a loan for $200 million, and they are 95% percent likely to pay it back. Using the above reasoning, the lender expects to be re-paid, on average, only 95% of the $200 million. Thus, on a $200 million loan, the lender expects to be repaid (0.95)*$200 million = $190 million on average. (This is the basic idea of expected value.)
In order to avoid that $10 million loss, the lender will ask that the borrower pay back $210.5 million for borrowing $200 million. The $210.6 million figure is a consequence of the following equation: 95% of $210.6 is approximately $200 million. So if the borrower is 95% likely to repay $210.6 million for the loan, then on average, the bank will get back (0.95) * $210.6 = $200 million. That is, they will break even.
Have students apply this elementary risk analysis to their selected country. First, have them choose a set of percentages that represent the country's likelihood to repay the loan (say, 95%, 90%, 85% and 80%). Then, for each percentage, have them compute the new amount the country will have to pay back: for example, if the country needs to borrow P dollars and is 90% likely to repay the loan, then they must pay back P / (0.90) dollars. Use this new amount as P in the formula A = P*e^(rt) to compute the new lump-sum payment, A, for each percentage and interest rate.
Once the data is computed and complied, have students put together a small portfolio on their country, highlighting their current debt situation and the costs of various scenarios for the country to get out of debt. Have the students evaluate the various scenarios and suggest a course of action that the country itself, and its neighbors, should take.
Going Further | In more sophisticated models, loans are repaid in monthly, quarterly or yearly installments. Students can investigate the quantitative consequences of these models by using a more complicated monthly payment formula or loan calculator.
Financial agencies like Moody's and Standard & Poor's rate countries (and companies) on their ability to repay loans. A lower rating means a higher risk of default, and thus a higher price for taking out loans. 
Students can take a look at the ratings that Moody's and Standard & Poor's have issued for countries around the world, and use Times resources like the country and territory pages to research what economic, political and historical reasons might play a role in the country's rating. A model is the article "Ratings Firms Misread Signs of Greek Woes."
The same fundamental ideas govern matters of personal finance, as well. Students can explore this concept by reading the article "College Graduates' Debt Burden Grew, Yet Again, in 2010" and figuring out just how much a large student loan (or home mortgage, or car loan) will cost.

HEADLINE: U.S. Military Press Office Iraq, Signing Off

BYLINE: STEPHEN FARRELL


HIGHLIGHT: With a short email the United States military press office in Baghdad today press released itself out of existence. 

 BODY:
BAGHDAD - With a short e-mail, the United States military press office in Baghdad press released itself out of existence. The announcement on Wednesday was a model of brevity. Of clarity, not so much.
The e-mailed statement was the latest milestone in the accelerating drawdown of American troops in Iraq. It read simply:
"Good Morning;
This email is to inform you that as of today, 30 Nov. the J9 USF-I Media Operations Center will cease operations. Due to our reposture efforts the press desk function will no longer provide releases or
responses.
"For RTQ's please contact the Embassy Public Affairs section."
RTQ's? Even some who made it past "J9" (the military section which deals with political, economic and communications activities) and "reposture efforts" (American troop withdrawal) were stumped by this abbreviation.
It fell to Col. Barry Johnson, a spokesman for the American forces in Iraq, to provide the missing R to the Q.
"Responses to Queries," he responded.
It signifies the end of an office which has existed in various forms since 2003, initially in Qatar and Kuwait before the invasion, and then in Iraq itself. Its first Baghdad home was a Saddam-era convention center that became an early hub of the Green Zone, later moving to a prefabricated cluster of buildings and then into two American Embassy compounds.

HEADLINE: 3 Upper West Side Owners to Shut Illegal Hotels

BYLINE: PATRICK WALL


HIGHLIGHT: A settlement will ensure that the owners comply with a new state law, but it may not end some neighbors' concerns about the buildings. 

 BODY:
Updated, Dec. 2 | After a lengthy legal battle, the owners of three Upper West Side residential buildings have agreed to stop using their properties as low-cost hotels. The city hailed the deal as a victory for the community, but it has raised new concern among some residents about the buildings' future.
The litigation, a zoning suit begun in 2007, long predates a state law passed last year making it illegal to rent out most residential rooms and apartments for less than 30 days. The settlement, reached last week between the city and the three buildings, on West 94th and West 95th Streets, effectively ensures that the owners comply with the new law and levies $600,000 in civil penalties against the owners. Each building has about 200 single-occupancy rooms, with shared amenities.
"It will deter others from illegally renting permanent housing to transient occupants for hotel use, and we hope that it will help preserve affordable housing and enhance quality of life for city residents," Deborah Rand, an assistant commissioner at the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said in a statement on Tuesday. The buildings, as named in court documents, are the Montroyal at 315 West 94th Street; the Pennington at 316 West 95th Street; and the Continental, at 330 West 95th Street.
While some residents might welcome the exodus of backpacking travelers from the neighborhood, others wondered how the building owners would replace the lost hotel revenue and worry that the owners will sell or lease the buildings to the city or private contractors for use as homeless shelters. 
"There is a serious concern among the community that the Bloomberg administration will use a ruling like this to put homeless residents side-by-side" with the buildings' long-term tenants, said Aaron Biller, president of Neighborhood in the Nineties, a local association.
Residents' fears were stoked by events earlier this year, when the Department of Homeless Services signed a contract with a nonprofit group to run a men's homeless shelter at the Alexander, another former hotel on West 94th Street. The plan fell through, but Mr. Biller said he received letters from residents who said they would prefer the budget hotels' fleeting occupants, many of them European tourists, to the residents of homeless shelters or people in drug-treatment programs.
 "If you tell them that there's a choice about noisy tourists or special populations," said Mr. Biller, "they'd tell you in a heartbeat that they'd rather have tourists." The illegal hotel rooms rented for as much as $100 a night.
David M. Satnick, who represents the owners of the three buildings in the new settlement, said he was not aware of any plans to sell or lease the buildings to the city.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeless Services, Barbara Brancaccio, said her agency had no current or past contracts involving any of the three buildings.
Update From 2009 to 2011, though, the department housed about 200 homeless men in the buildings on a per diem basis without the formality of a contract, paying around $80 a night for minimum stays of three months. The department said it did not know the city was involved in a lawsuit against the owners until the spring of this year, at which point it stopped sending people there.
The deal to put a homeless shelter in the Alexander, which was opposed by residents and the community board, was dropped because several long-term residents of the building, including at least one family, refused to vacate their rooms and because other sites were available, Ms. Brancaccio said.
But she added, "That doesn't mean that in the future, if we have a capacity need and the property becomes vacant, the project couldn't very well move ahead."
Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer, who represents the Upper West Side and lobbied against the deal at the Alexander, said that while permanent housing for the homeless is needed, the Alexander and the three buildings involved in last week's settlement are best suited for working people in need of cheap housing.
"Regular, low-income New Yorkers need a place to live, and this is the perfect place," Ms. Brewer said. She added, "But I do not want homeless people. I do not want people sent from the city."

HEADLINE: As Economy Lags, Cuomo Reconsiders Tax Stance

BYLINE: THOMAS KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: In a pair of radio appearances, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo suggested that changing the way New York State taxes residents and businesses could spur growth. 

 BODY:
Faced with a worsening financial climate, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Wednesday that he was contemplating whether to propose changes to the state tax code, and he did not rule out the possibility that he would seek to raise taxes on wealthy New Yorkers.
In a pair of radio appearances, Mr. Cuomo offered no details on what he was considering. But he suggested that changing how the state taxed its residents and businesses could be a way to promote economic growth.
"What I'm looking at is, what do you do with the tax code, and how can you use the tax code to stimulate the creation of private-sector jobs," Mr. Cuomo said in an interview on the Albany radio station WGDJ-AM. He made essentially the same point on "Capitol Pressroom," a program carried by several stations.
As a candidate for governor last year, Mr. Cuomo said, "Raising taxes is not an option - period," and he made similar pledges at his inauguration and in his State of the State address.
But since that time, the state's financial condition has worsened, and many of Mr. Cuomo's fellow Democrats, reinforced by the Occupy Wall Street movement, have urged him to reconsider his decision to allow an income tax surcharge on high earners, a so-called millionaires' tax, to lapse this month.
On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo affirmed his opposition to a state millionaires' tax, but declined to say that he would not seek any tax increases in the legislative session that begins in January.
"I am in discussions, I have ideas, people have ideas, but we have no decisions," Mr. Cuomo said, noting that his budget proposal would be unveiled in a month and a half.
Mr. Cuomo has spoken several times in recent weeks about his desire to ensure "fairness" in the tax code.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that he was considering a proposal that would alter the state's personal income tax brackets to raise additional revenue from the highest-earning New Yorkers while also providing new tax breaks, possibly aimed at the middle class.
The governor criticized that report as "breathless," but he did not say it was inaccurate.
Mr. Cuomo added that he had been talking to economists to get their advice on how to confront the state's difficult financial condition and the chronic challenge of creating jobs, and that "many of the suggestions have to do with the tax code."
Any proposal to change the tax brackets would come with political risks for Mr. Cuomo, who has frequently proclaimed that under his watch, New York would no longer be "the tax capital of the nation." The State Senate is controlled by Republicans, who have opposed extending the millionaires' tax.
"Our position is clear," said Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican. "We support cutting taxes, not raising them."
But Mr. Cuomo's comments drew praise from one Republican state senator.
"If the governor forced the discussion about actually aggressively going back and redoing the tax code with a complete overhaul, that'd be extremely helpful, especially in creating a more hospitable environment for working families and the real job creators," the senator, Gregory R. Ball of Putnam County, said.
Democrats in the State Assembly have pushed for Mr. Cuomo to seek the extension of the tax surcharge on high earners, saying an extension would be an obvious way to address the $3 billion to $3.5 billion budget gap projected for next year.
In a recent interview , the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said he would be receptive to any proposal from Mr. Cuomo to alter the state's tax brackets.
"We have to make it fairer," Mr. Silver said. "People who make $50,000 can't be paying the same tax rate as people making $5 million. It's not right."
In his radio interviews, Mr. Cuomo also lamented what he described as the gridlock that has plagued Washington in recent months. He said he was determined to avoid similar dysfunction in Albany in the budget season that begins next month.
"I'm going to be about coming up with a plan that I believe can forge consensus and compromise and can get passed," he said.

HEADLINE: Congressman Presses California on Fuel-Economy Standards

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: Darrell Issa, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, is investigating a California agency he suspects of wielding unlawful influence over federal fuel-economy standards. 

 BODY:
Suspecting that California regulators may be exerting unlawful influence over the agencies that determine federal fuel-economy standards, Representative Darrell Issa has begun an inquiry into the practices of the California Air Resources Board, or CARB, the agency charged with setting pollution standards for the state.
He is also seeking information from automakers to aid his investigation.
Mr. Issa, a California Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, is pursuing details of the state agency's role in determining the next round of Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, known as CAFE, a process undertaken with the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The standards were formally unveiled Nov. 16 by President Obama and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.
In a Sept. 30 letter to Mr. LaHood, Mr. Issa said the new round of standards, which would require automakers to achieve a corporate fleetwide average of 54.5 miles per gallon for 2025, were possibly "negotiated in secret, outside the scope of law, and could generate significant negative impacts for consumers."
On Monday, Mr. Issa sent letters to 15 automakers, including three domestic manufacturers, asking them to voluntarily provide information by Dec. 12 about the negotiations over the standards and their likely impact on the industry.
In a telephone interview, Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents the interests of the 12 largest automakers in the United States, said that manufacturers were likely to comply with Mr. Issa's request.
"I'm sure automakers will be cooperating with the oversight committee," she said. "We're still looking at the letters and how much detail is requested."
CARB was identified as a target of the committee's investigation in a Nov. 9 letter addressed to Mary D. Nichols, the California board's chairwoman. Mr. Issa had asked Ms. Nichols to testify at a committee hearing on Oct. 12. Citing prior commitments, Ms. Nichols did not attend, prompting Mr. Issa to write in the November letter that the state agency was "unresponsive to Congressional concerns and unappreciative of Congressional priorities."
Among the questions posed by Mr. Issa to CARB in his letter was, "Do you believe that a closed and secretive process is the best approach for regulating an industry that affects nearly every American?"
CARB responded to Mr. Issa's requests on Nov. 23. Stanley Young, a CARB spokesman, said in a telephone interview Tuesday that the agency was preparing to send more documents.
Jeffrey Solsby, a spokesman for the majority staff on the House committee, said in a telephone interview Tuesday that the CARB documents were still under review.
A point of contention between Mr. Issa's committee and CARB is whether California regulates federal fuel-economy standards, an authority exclusively delegated by Congress to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In its response to the committee requests, CARB said it was instead regulating greenhouse gas emissions, a position it said was affirmed in court rulings. "California has not set, and is not setting fuel-economy standards," CARB said.
Even so, Mr. Issa wrote in his letter to CARB that the relationship between fuel economy and tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions was so close that "compliance tests for fuel-economy standards are done by measuring vehicular CO2 emissions."
Mr. Young, the CARB spokesman, said that the board was not operating outside its legal mandate. "We depend on the courts to make a determination, and they have definitively held that California's greenhouse gas standards are not fuel-economy standards." He said that CARB worked together with N.H.T.S.A. and the E.P.A. on a unified program for the round of standards for 2017-2025. During that process, the agencies "shared data, conducted joint technical and engineering studies and had regular staff meetings," he said.
It is the substance of that collaboration that interests the House committee. "In summary, it appears that CARB and the state of California are in the business of regulating fuel-economy standards, in direct contravention of the law," Mr. Issa concluded in his letter to CARB.

HEADLINE: Eclectic as Ever, Sundance Unveils Competition Lineup

BYLINE: BROOKS BARNES


HIGHLIGHT: The features and documentaries chosen to compete at the Sundance Film Festival in January are unveiled. 

 BODY:
11:20 a.m. | Updated LOS ANGELES - Love and sex, not necessarily in that order. Bleak self-scrutiny. Quirk, sometimes in the extreme.
The Sundance Film Festival is nothing if not itself.
Festival programmers announced their competition lineup on Wednesday, and all of those perennial themes are well represented. "The Surrogate" stars John Hawkes ("Martha Marcy May Marlene") as a poet with an iron lung who sets out to lose his virginity. "Hello I Must Be Going" centers on a demoralized woman in her 30s trying to sort out her life. "Filly Brown" tells the story of a Mexican girl who uses hip-hop to cope with the incarceration of her mother.
"The films are more eclectic than ever and better than ever," John Cooper, Sundance's director, said in a telephone interview. He added, "I know I say that every year, but this time I really mean it."
The competition lineup includes 58 films, culled from 4,042 full-length submissions, a 6 percent increase in submissions over last year. (A full list of films in competition, including the world cinema feature and documentary slates, is at the bottom of this post.)
Will more eclectic be more or less sellable? Sundance, the pre-eminent showcase for American independent cinema and a freewheeling bazaar for movie executives, is typically judged - often to the chagrin of its founder, Robert Redford - by how much money distributors are willing to spend on selections.
"Everybody wants to bring it down to what sells and what doesn't, but we don't think about it that way," Mr. Cooper said. "Our focus is putting on a cultural event."
Stars always help pique buyer interest and famous names are sprinkled throughout the competition selections this year as well. The parade of fame in Park City, Utah, in January will include Michael Cera, Amanda Seyfried, Helen Hunt, Blythe Danner, William H. Macy, Danny Glover and Megan Mullally.
Sundance may be sticking close to its brand when it comes to features, but the documentary competition reveals a stark shift. The slate at the last festival was conspicuously lighthearted, with notable entries on music, horse training and the puppeteer behind Elmo. This time, documentary filmmakers appear intensely focused on a rotting America. "We're Not Broke" looks at how multibillion-dollar corporations avoid paying United States income tax. "The Invisible War," directed by Kirby Dick ("This Film Is Not Yet Rated"), examines rape and its cover-up within the United States military. Other selections tackle the war on drugs, the decay of Detroit, hunger among Americans and the country's medical system.
"The documentaries are more comprehensive, with issues examined in an all-encompassing way and not just in microcosm," Mr. Cooper said. He selected "The Queen of Versailles," about a couple whose timeshare empire is hit by the economic crisis, to spotlight as part of the festival's high-profile opening-day offerings.
In keeping with Sundance custom, many of the feature directors in competition are behind the camera for the first time or have limited experience in shorts. Among the 26 first-time filmmakers this time around is Benh Zeitlin, whose drama "Beasts of the Southern Wild" was inspired by coastal erosion in southern Louisiana and centers on a 6-year-old girl searching for her mother.
Sundance has long prided itself on championing female directors - in sharp contrast to Hollywood - and the 2012 festival will be no exception. Ry Russo-Young, whose "You Won't Miss Me" played Sundance in 2009, returns with "Nobody Walks," a drama about an emotionally unraveling family starring John Krasinski, Rosemarie DeWitt and Justin Kirk. Ava DuVernay directed and wrote "Middle of Nowhere," about an African-American woman struggling to maintain her marriage and her identity.
In another indication of just how far Sundance operates from the center of the commercial movie business, many of the competition selections star Hispanic and African-American actors. Lou Diamond Phillips and Edward James Olmos appear in "Filly Brown," while "Luv," the tale of an 11-year-old boy on the streets of Baltimore, features Common and Charles S. Dutton.
Sundance is scheduled to run Jan. 19 to 29. On Thursday, Sundance will unveil its lineup of out-of-competition midnight thrillers and ultralow-budget films.
On Monday, programmers will announce selections for its Premieres program, the noncompetitive and more star-driven part of the festival at which most sales to distributors are made. Trevor Groth, Sundance's director of programming, said comedy would be a strong current in the 2012 Premieres section.
"I sometimes overhear people at the festival saying that we don't show enough comedies," Mr. Groth said. "But we're at the mercy of what gets submitted."

HEADLINE: More Children Need a Free Breakfast, Lunch - and Dinner

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: The moribund economy has driven many middle-class families to apply for school lunch subsidies for the first time. 

 BODY:
"I never thought a program like this would apply to me and my kids." That's what parents in the Gates Chili school district outside Rochester are telling Debbi Beauvais, who administers the school meals program there. In a front-page article on Wednesday, The Times reported that around Rochester and across the country, suburban poverty means that schools are finding themselves serving more free or low-cost lunches - and breakfasts. And last year, when the proportion of students who qualified for free or subsidized lunches in the Hickman Mills C-1 district of Kansas City, Mo., hit 80 percent, the school began offering a third meal after the end of classes, paid for by the state.
The increase comes at a moment when schools are also facing new requirements to raise the price they charge students who pay for their lunches (either full price or at a subsidized rate). Under a child nutrition bill signed by President Obama last December, schools are expected to raise prices annually to bring the cost to families in line with the cost of preparing the lunches. (Another bill proposed by Congress seeks changes in nutritional guidelines for lunches, decreeing that there can be no limits on potatoes and that pizza can remain a vegetable.)
Making meal prices reflect the cost of preparation seems reasonable - why should the government pay even a nickel to subsidize the lunches of kids from well-to-do families? - but in these districts, it's going to mean more kids applying for subsidies, more parents skipping out on their cafeteria bills, and more families, even those still struggling financially, losing eligibility for free or subsidized lunches. That means less money to cover fixed costs like equipment and labor.
It looks like the always complicated equation of school lunches, which cost $10.8 billion in 2010, is about to get even more complicated.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
Is Newt Gingrich a lobbyist? The Republican presidential candidate insists that he is merely a consultant, but Mike McIntire and Jim Rutenberg explain how Mr. Gingrich has amassed much of his personal fortune doing business the same way that lobbyists peddle influence.
Five weeks from the Iowa caucuses, which begin the Republican nominating season, Herman Cain is weighing whether to abandon his bid for the White House. Jeff Zeleny writes that the candidate is struggling to determine whether he can continue after a series of accusations of sexual harassment, reports of an extramarital affair and his blunders on foreign policy.
President Obama's struggle to shore up support in a region of northeast Pennsylvania that backed Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary is emblematic of the challenges he faces across the Rust Belt as he seeks re-election in 2012, Katharine Q. Seelye writes. He is headed to Scranton, Pa., on Wednesday to push for an extension of a payroll tax cut that is set to expire if Congress does not act.
Democrats and Republicans have switched roles in the partisan debate over extending the federal payroll tax, Jennifer Steinhauer writes. Democrats, who once favored allowing the cuts to expire are now calling for an extension. Republicans, who champion lower taxes and tax cuts, are now demanding that the cuts be paid for.
New polls suggest that the Tea Party muscle that helped Republicans increase their ranks in 2010 has weakened and may be a drag on the G.O.P. as the party seeks to reclaim the White House next year, Kate Zernike reports.
Congress could soon send President Obama a defense bill that includes a provision the White House has said he would reject, Charlie Savage writes. The Senate rejected a measure on Tuesday that would remove language requiring terrorism suspects to be held in military custody and allow them to be held indefinitely.
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who has been called soft on illegal immigration, gained an endorsement in the Republican presidential race from a sheriff known for his tough stance against illegal immigration. But, Richard A. Oppel Jr. writes, it is unclear whether that will help Mr. Perry in New Hampshire, where he polls in the single digits, before the Jan. 10 primary.
Happening in Washington:
The Department of Labor will release third quarter measures of productivity and costs at 8:30 a.m., followed by the National Association of Realtors with data on pending home sales at 10.
Also at 8:30 a.m., the Council on Foreign Relations will conduct a live videoconference with the opposition activist Daw Aung San Suu Kyi as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton travels to Myanmar.
At 10:30 a.m., Senators Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, will announce a bipartisan proposal to permanently ban earmarks.
At 1:30 p.m., the first lady, Michelle Obama, will welcome military families to the White House for the first viewing of the 2011 holiday decorations.
At the same time, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip, and other lawmakers will join unemployed workers and labor activists to call for a renewal of federal unemployment insurance programs which are scheduled to begin expiring Dec. 31 without congressional action.

HIGHLIGHT: Why Facebook is planning a public offering, Mitt Romney avoids reporters on the campaign trail and James Murdoch is reappointed chairman of BSkyB. 

 BODY:
DealBook explains some of the thinking behind the report that Facebook (no relation) may be planning an initial public offering in the spring to raise $10 billion, with a company valuation of $100 billion. In short, Steven M. Davidoff, the Deal Professor, writes, Facebook "just has too many shareholders." When a United States company has 500 or more shareholders of record it must soon begin filing reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including audited financial information. Facebook is likely to reach 500 in April 2012, he writes, and most companies conclude that "if they are going to be subject to much of the regulation that comes with being public, they might as well just go ahead with an I.P.O. and get the full benefits of being public."

        
Facebook will be subjected to regular privacy audits for the next 20 years as part of a broad settlement with Federal Trade Commission, which accused the company of engaging in "unfair and deceptive" practices, Somini Sengupta reports. The settlement stems largely from changes that Facebook made to the way it handled its users' information in December 2009. Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, wrote a blog post conceding that the company made "a bunch of mistakes," which he said it had now corrected: "It is my hope that this agreement makes it clear that Facebook is the leader when it comes to offering people control over the information they share online."

Herman Cain's campaign appeared to be reeling after an Atlanta TV station showed an interview with a businesswoman who said she had had a 13-year affair with Mr. Cain. As of Tuesday night, he was said to be weighing dropping out. The 24-hour local news channel NY1 reported that Mr. Cain had "abruptly canceled a private dinner with New York's media elite planned for this Sunday," which was organized by the New York Post columnist Cindy Adams. Among those on the guest list, according to NY1, were Barbara Walters, Matt Lauer, Bill O'Reilly, Lesley Stahl, Senator Chuck Schumer and Greta Van Susteren, who recently interviewed Cain and his family on Fox News. Ms. Van Susteren's husband, the lawyer John Coale, has been an unpaid adviser to Mr. Cain, and, according to Ms. Adams, was the one who called to announce the cancellation.

        
On the trail with Mitt Romney in Tampa, Fla., Ashley Parker writes that Mr. Romney has been blocking out reporters lately:
"Is there a reason you're not responding to reporters' questions?" called out a reporter. "Yeah, there's not a press avail today - this is a chance to meet people," explained Mr. Romney, who has previously made a similar distinction. (There is a time for answering questions, he has said, and a time for talking to voters, and those times do not seem to overlap). "Is there a particular reason you're only speaking to Fox News?" tried another reporter. Mr. Romney offered a fake laugh - "Ha, ha ha," he stated - as a voter came to his rescue: "Because it's the best!" she said.
In testimony before the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics in Britain, Paul McMullan, a former deputy features editor at News Corporation's now-defunct News of the World tabloid, described the brazen tactics he employed to get information for his superiors. Sarah Lyall offers a litany: "Lurking in unmarked vans outside people's houses, stealing confidential documents, rifling through celebrity garbage cans and pretending that he was not a journalist pursuing a story but 'Brad the teenage rent boy,' propositioning a priest." Not that the inquiry was a confessional for Mr. McMullan; he was unapologetic, saying, "Privacy is the space bad people need to do bad things." He said his vision was shared by his two prominent editors, Rebekah Brooks, who resigned in July from her job as chief executive of News International, the British newspaper arm of Rupert Murdoch's empire, and Andy Coulson, who resigned from his job as chief spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron in January. "They should have been the heroes of journalism, but they aren't," he said. "They are the scum of journalism for trying to drop me and my colleagues in it."

        
James Murdoch was reappointed chairman of the satellite broadcaster BSkyB at the company's annual meeting on Tuesday, The Guardian reported, with provisional figures announced at the meeting in London giving him 81.24 percent of the vote, with 18.76 percent against. This tally would mean that nearly a third of BSkyB's independent shareholder voted against him.
"The Artist," a black-and-white tribute to silent black-and-white films, on Tuesday was named best picture by the New York Film Critics Circle, and its director, Michel Hazanavicius, took top honors, The Carpetbagger blog reported. Brad Pitt won for best actor, for both "Moneyball" and "The Tree of Life," while Meryl Streep won for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in "The Iron Lady." The critics circle announced the winners through Twitter, and at least one winner, Albert Brooks, best supporting actor for his performance in "Drive," used Twitter to thank the group. One critic, Dana Stevens of Slate, said "The Artist" represented a compromise selection for her. Asked on Twitter whether she was surprised that it won, she summed up why it might, in fact, be a contender: "That movie will be an awards magnet bc it's super crowd-pleasing but also sort of highbrow."

        
"Beginners" is on an "indie roll," Carpetbagger writes, "earning nominations for best feature, best screenplay and best director at the Film Independent Spirit Awards, the West Coast answer to the Gothams."
Brian Williams's "NBC Nightly News" broadcast on Tuesday was repeatedly interrupted by a fire alarm, which went off just as Williams came on the air and continued throughout the half-hour program. Williams assured viewers that "there is no danger to us" and it was simply a poorly timed test, via the MSNBC show "Morning Joe."

HEADLINE: The Kindle Fire: Clunky but Content-Rich

BYLINE: NICK BILTON


HIGHLIGHT: As gadget reviewers have pointed out, the Amazon Kindle Fire is clunky and slow. But it is also poised to be the second-most-popular tablet in the United States, after the Apple iPad. So why is the Kindle Fire selling so well if it is not so pretty? The answer is price and content. 

 BODY:
As gadget reviewers have pointed out, the newly released Amazon Kindle Fire is clunky and slow -- in keeping with Amazon's sense of style. But it seems it is being purchased in droves by consumers and is poised to become the second-most-popular tablet in the United States, after Apple's iPad.
In a press release issued by Amazon on Monday, the company said, "Kindle Fire remained the best-selling product across all of Amazon since its introduction 8 weeks ago." As is its custom, the company gave no specific numbers.
Based on calculations by Forrester, it is believed that Amazon will sell close to five million Kindle Fire tablets by the end of the holiday season. Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, thinks it will be slightly less,at about four million.
So why is the Kindle Fire selling so well if it is not so pretty? The answer is price and content.
The Kindle Fire costs $200. The least expensive iPad, which only comes with Wi-Fi and 16 gigabytes of memory, costs $500. The Kindle Fire also comes packed with lots of goodies inside, including access to more than 18 million movies, TV shows, magazines and books, according to Amazon.
"It comes down to the content and the strength of Amazon's brand. Amazon is the No. 2 brand, after Apple, among consumers," said Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester research analyst who specializes in mobile computing. "The Kindle Fire is a decent consumer media device for a very good price."
Ms. Rotman Epps pointed out that the Kindle Fire hardware is essentially the BlackBerry PlayBook with one difference: the content.
"You turn the BlackBerry PlayBook on, and it doesn't work because there is nothing to do with it," she said. "The Kindle isn't perfect, but it's a simple out-of-box experience, and most importantly its content is front and center as soon as you start it for the first time."
Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive, predicted the Fire's appeal in an interview with The New York Times last month. "Part of the Kindle Fire is, of course, the hardware, but really, it's the software, the content, it's the seamless integration of those things," he said.
Mr. Bezos and Amazon obviously realized they could not beat Apple by creating better hardware, but Amazon could definitely compete with the company on services, content and price.
Either way, the Fire would jump beyond other makers' tablets, many of which have been ignored by consumers. Apple has sold more than 29 million iPads during its first 15 months on the market.
By releasing a tablet that is inexpensive and works just well enough for consumers, Amazon is helping assert itself as a player.

HEADLINE: The Not-Romneys

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: What drives the anybody-but-Mitt phenomenon? 

 BODY:
David Brooks: Gail, which was your favorite not-Romney boomlet? Did you like the Bachmann Spring, the Cain Supernova, the Trump Tornado or the Gingrich Comet?
Gail Collins: David, we may part philosophical company as this campaign rolls along, but I like to think we will always have Donald Trump, Presidential Front-Runner.
David: I think I liked the Cain moment the best because this was a presidential campaign predicated on the conviction that the candidate was not actually running for president. The whole campaign had a modernist "This is Not a Pipe" absurdity to it, and I'm sorry to see him collapse, though I did see a nice tweet from somebody who observed that the only thing Herman Cain knows about foreign affairs is that he denies having had any.
Gail: Don't you think this says something about the current state of the Republican party? It has a base that's intensely attracted to candidates who are nutjobs.
David: Well, yes, and I know Mitt is in a lull, but I still don't see how he doesn't get the nomination. Sometime between now and Iowa Newt's essential Newtness will emerge - mainly the fact that each successive moment for him has no bearing on the next. This is clearly a time to buy Romney stock on Intrade.
Gail: I agree. But Newt is pretty Newt even before you get to know him. Even if you just ran into him at the shopping center handing out leaflets, you would instinctively understand that this is not a person who's going to be elected president. Yet the most enthusiastic Republican voters appear to like him better than You Know Who.
David: That gives us a chance to talk about Romney and his weaknesses, which are glaring.
Gail: Dog on the roof of the car. Dog on the roof of the car.
David: Besides your favorite episode, he has a class problem. Many Democrats believe that the Republican Party is the party of the privileged. That's wrong. The G.O.P. is the party of the white working class. Republicans win among this group by 15 to 25 percentage points in election after election. If you wonder how working class people - at least if they are not Hispanic or African American - respond to wage stagnation and growing inequality, look at the Republican Party.
Gail: I would argue that the gap is due at least in part to a perception among whites who are not college graduates that the Democrats are a bunch of irritating twits who think they're better than anybody else. Which brings us back to Mitt Romney.
David: Some liberals imagine that there will be a proletarian revolution. They're right. We're in the middle of one and the proletarians have decided to back Gingrich, Bachmann, Cain and the rest. Romney does fine with college educated Republicans, but so far he hasn't won over the working class.
I suspect he will when people actually start to think seriously, but so far the chasm between the Romney and the proletariat is wide open. There are interesting class tensions within the Republican Party.
Gail: If you think there are interesting class tensions now, wait until we've spent eight or ten months discussing the way folks like the executives at Bain Capital improve the economy. Romney made his living buying companies on borrowed money, shrinking the work force and then walking away with so much profit that the companies were, on occasion, left like victims of an overeager vampire. Many people believe this is the way capitalism is supposed to work, but the bottom line is that the working class gets screwed.
David: Meanwhile, the Democrats have apparently given up on the white working class. Our colleague Tom Edsall had the definitive piece on this. Apparently very smart Democrats like Stan Greenberg and Ruy Teixeira believe that the white working class is just out of reach for Democrats. It's useless to try to woo them. Better to build a majority around educated upper middle class types, minorities and the poor. Better to skip Ohio and go for Virginia and Colorado. There's a lot of good sense in that.
Gail: Not my favorite theory. If the Democrats give up on the white working class it plays into all the worst rifts and fears and tensions in the country. As a native Ohioan, I will take it really personally if the Democrats give up on Ohio.
David: I'm a little dubious about electoral strategies based on demographics. I think that if you make the strongest case possible, you'll carry a bunch of different groups in ways you will never understand.
Gail: We are in agreement. Although I'd like to just jump back for a quarter of a second and point out that virtually everybody agrees that a party that turns off the Hispanic vote is in big trouble long-term. And that the guy who's the inevitable Republican nominee seems to be planning to win by screaming "amnesty" at anybody who gets in his way.
David: But the bigger problem is that Democrats may lose the spirit of enterprise. University town voters tend to be put off by the policies favored by the aspiring entrepreneurial classes. They side with the environmentalists over the people who like pipelines and shale gas, for example.
Gail: Not sure that's really the dividing line. I've never thought of Nebraska as a place overrun by the academic elite, but the Nebraskans do not seem to love the idea of that big pipe running through their state.
David: The economically vulnerable naturally enough prefer policies that foster security, rather than policies that foster risk-taking. A party that builds its majority around these groups will eventually lose touch with the forces of disruption and vulgar ambition. It will end up placid and dispirited.
Gail: But the truly economically vulnerable aren't the university town voters. The ones who feels shakiest about their place in society is that white working class.
David: The theme here is that the white working class is likely to end up detached from both presidential candidates. It's still the largest group in the electorate. Something interesting will happen.
Gail: David, if this campaign gets any more interesting, we'll wind up electing a vampire zombie space alien next November.

HEADLINE: Mitt Romney Talks About Himself, Not Obama, in New Ad

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's campaign released its second television ad on Wednesday, a spot that is notable for having what the former Massachusetts governor's last ad did not: a positive message. 

 BODY:

Mitt Romney's campaign released its second television ad on Wednesday, a spot that is notable for having what the former Massachusetts governor's last ad did not: a positive message.
The new 30-second spot, titled "The Right Answer," will be broadcast in New Hampshire where Mr. Romney has spent considerable resources in a bet that he can win and catapult himself to the Republican nomination. The New Hampshire primary is Jan. 10.
"I spent my life in the private sector," the ad opens in a voice-over from Mr. Romney, which was taken from remarks he made at a CNN debate in September. As he speaks, the words "Mitt Romney Conservative Businessman" appear on the screen, an apparent effort to rebut his critics on the right who contend that Mr. Romney lacks true conservative convictions.
"I've learned something about how it is that economies grow. We're not going to balance the budget just by pretending that all you have to do is take out the waste," he says. "The right answer for America is to stop the growth of the federal government, and to start the growth of the private sector."
In his last ad, which also was only broadcast in New Hampshire, Mr. Romney was criticized as misleading viewers. The ad contained an excerpt from a speech President Obama had given, but left viewers with the impression that the president was saying he could not win if he talked about the economy, when in fact he was quoting something said by an associate of John McCain.

HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's campaign released its second television ad on Wednesday, a spot that is notable for having what the former Massachusetts governor's last ad did not: a positive message. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's campaign released its second television ad on Wednesday, a spot that is notable for having what the former Massachusetts governor's last ad did not: a positive message.
The new 30-second spot, titled "The Right Answer," will be broadcast in New Hampshire where Mr. Romney has spent considerable resources in a bet that he can win and catapult himself to the Republican nomination. The New Hampshire primary is Jan. 10.
"I spent my life in the private sector," the ad opens in a voice-over from Mr. Romney, which was taken from remarks he made at a CNN debate last week. As he speaks, the words "Mitt Romney Conservative Businessman" appear on the screen, an apparent effort to rebut his critics on the right who contend that Mr. Romney lacks true conservative convictions.
"I've learned something about how it is that economies grow. We're not going to balance the budget just by pretending that all you have to do is take out the waste," he says. "The right answer for America is to stop the growth of the federal government, and to start the growth of the private sector."
In his last ad, which also was only broadcast in New Hampshire, Mr. Romney was criticized as misleading viewers. The ad contained an excerpt from a speech President Obama had given, but left viewers with the impression that the president was saying he could not win if he talked about the economy, when in fact he was quoting something said by an associate of John McCain.

HEADLINE: Johanns Sees 'Change in Mood' for Tax Increase

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: Another Republican senator has opened the door to tax increases on high earners as a way to pay for a payroll tax cut, showing more movement in the party ranks after resistance all year to tax increases. 

 BODY:
Another Republican senator has opened the door to tax increases on high earners as a way to pay for a payroll tax cut, showing more movement in the party ranks after resistance all year to tax increases.
"I sense a change in mood," Senator Mike Johanns, Republican of Nebraska, said Wednesday. "It's a little more bipartisan. My position has always been, 'Let's not raise taxes,' but on the other hand, I don't want our country to collapses under a mountain of debt. If that means compromise, I am going to do everything to get that done."
Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said Tuesday that she had formulated a plan to pay for the extension of a payroll tax holiday for American workers with a tax increase on high earners that carved out employers, so they would not be hit with higher rates.
Democrats are seeking to reduce the Social Security payroll tax paid by employees by half, to 3.1. percent of wages, a position many Republicans support.
Senate Democrats have introduced a bill, which is expected to reach a vote Friday morning, that would pay for the extension. Their plan would also lower the portion of the tax paid by employers, at a cost of roughly $115 billion, with a 3.25 percent surtax on income over $1 million. Republicans have rejected this mechanism, and dismissed the bill as a political stunt.
But Ms. Collins said Wednesday that she thought her alternative idea would mitigate some Republican opposition by protecting employers from the increase. "What we've been hearing over and over again is that the reason Republicans are opposed to the surtax is because of the concern on its impact on job creation," she said. "Well if you carve out employers you take away that argument."
Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, said Tuesday that his party had discussed a deficit reduction plan that could involve a small increase in taxes for some high-income people who meet certain criteria. Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, has also put together a deficit reduction plan, during his time on the debt-reduction panel, which includes new revenues.
Ms. Collins said she had talked to members of leadership in both parties. "I think some are intrigued by the idea," she said, but would not elaborate, as Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, entered an elevator behind her. "This is in an embryonic stage," she added, before zipping off into her own elevator.
Any tax increase on high earners would have a steep mountain to climb among many other Republican senators and in the House, where many Republicans are opposed to the renewal of the payroll tax cut at all, arguing that it does not stimulate the economy and that it harms the Social Security trust fund by diverting payroll taxes.
Mr. Johanns recently joined a meeting with the original members of the so-called Gang of Six, who tried and failed earlier this year to come up with a deficit reduction plan, followed by similar failed efforts among 12 members of Congress.

HEADLINE: Foreign Aid Is Not a Rathole

BYLINE: EZEKIEL J. EMANUEL


HIGHLIGHT: We're finding more efficient ways to make the world healthier, so don't give up on foreign aid. 

 BODY:
Many Americans feel that foreign assistance is like money poured down a rathole. The United States contributes more money every year - spending nearly a third of all global health aid - while tangible results in developing countries can be hard to see.
But the "rathole" argument is dead wrong. Indeed, this World AIDS Day, Dec. 1, provides a perfect opportunity to assess the results of our global health assistance efforts and to recognize the tremendous amount we have accomplished.
Child mortality has decreased to 7.6 million preventable deaths in 2010 from around 12 million in 1990. That's nearly 12,000 lives saved every day largely because of improved sanitation and water systems and significant increases in vaccination levels for measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus and whooping cough. We have also made big strides on malaria, decreasing deaths to fewer than 1 million per year. The President's Malaria Initiative - started by President George W. Bush in 2005 and a key part of President Obama's Global Health Initiative - and a coordinated strategy of bed nets, indoor anti-mosquito spraying, preventive treatment of pregnant women and rapid testing and treatment is driving the number down even further.
If these data don't put an end to the rathole argument, then today's H.I.V. and AIDS numbers should. We have devoted many resources to the fight. In 2002, a mere 50,000 people all across sub-Saharan Africa were receiving antiretroviral treatment. In 2003, President Bush proposed the creation of Pepfar - the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief - as a five-year, $15-billion program focused on fighting H.I.V. and AIDS and tuberculosis in 15 hard-hit countries, and Congress extended the successful program in 2008. President Obama has been criticized for committing $6.8 billion to Pepfar in his 2011 budget, which activists say is too little because of inflation and increasing demands for treatment. But over all, United States funding for H.I.V. and AIDS has increased steadily, from $2.3 billion in 2003, to $6 billion in fiscal year 2008, to $6.8 billion in fiscal year 2011.
But money is not - nor should it be - the measure of success. In global health, the measure is not dollars, but diseases prevented and lives saved.
When President Obama was elected in 2008, the United States was directly supporting antiretroviral treatment of 1.7 million people around the world. In unveiling his Global Health Initiative, which urged a broader focus on aid to women and children and which I helped design, Mr. Obama promised to finance treatment of at least four million people by 2014. Today, United States government aid has almost reached that ambitious goal - nearly three years ahead of schedule. The United States is putting roughly 50,000 new patients on antiretroviral treatment every month.
The real achievement in the H.I.V. and AIDS arena, the real counter to the rathole argument, is that this has been done more and more efficiently - not wastefully. Today the United States spends around 12 percent more on fighting H.I.V. than it did in 2008. And yet we are providing antiretroviral treatments to twice as many patients. That is much bigger bang for the buck.
This is possible because we have become more efficient. In 2004, the cost to Pepfar of antiretrovirals, blood tests, monitoring and all the related services averaged nearly $1,100 per patient a year. Today, they cost just $335. And costs are still falling. We have reduced the number of supply chains and strengthened the remaining ones, shifted almost exclusively to generic drugs and streamlined management to reduce the number of middle managers. The next improvement in efficiency will occur by better coordinating with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, health ministries in host countries and local nongovernmental organizations to reduce waste caused by duplication and miscommunication.
Gains have been made in other areas, too. From 2001 to 2009, the rate of new H.I.V. infections declined by 25 percent. Over 50 percent of all pregnant women living with H.I.V. in low- and middle-income countries received antiretroviral therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission in 2009, up from just 10 percent in 2004. The United States government's efforts in this area are responsible for preventing more than 114,000 mother-to-child infections last year. Around four million orphans and vulnerable children received care through Pepfar in 2010. We know that male circumcision reduces H.I.V. transmission by 60 percent. So since 2007, a million men worldwide have been circumcised; three-fourths of those procedures were paid for by the United States government.
These are huge successes, but much more should be done to prevent the transmission of H.I.V. Around half a million infants are still born infected with H.I.V. each year, so we need to treat far more than half of pregnant mothers. And the one million circumcisions performed since 2007 represent only a small percentage of the men who would benefit from the procedure in the countries with greatest need.
But in many other areas we are making the world healthier. Under President Obama, the United States government has been doing much more to fight maternal mortality, which is largely due to obstructed deliveries, bleeding and post-delivery infections. And it has also increased its efforts to combat so-called neglected tropical diseases - like intestinal worms and elephantiasis - that afflict over one billion of the poorest people worldwide.
Whatever people think of foreign assistance, it is certainly not a rathole. That the developing world remains in need of assistance does not mean that nothing has changed. Our health aid has made the world a much better and healthier place. And for that we should be proud - and not dismiss it as pouring good money after bad.

HEADLINE: Despite Scandal, Applications to Penn State Rise

BYLINE: REBECCA R. RUIZ


HIGHLIGHT: Applications for admission to Pennsylvania State University are up 4 percent over last year, with applications to the school's flagship campus -- home to the beleaguered Nittany Lions football program -- up by 2 percent. 

 BODY:
The abuse scandal at Pennsylvania State University does not appear to have slowed applications to the school's undergraduate programs.
As of Friday, applications to enroll next year at one of the 20 campuses that comprise the Penn State system were up 4 percent when compared with the same period last year, with applications to the system's University Park flagship in State College, Pa., up 2 percent, Anne Rohrbach, executive director for undergraduate admissions, said in an interview Wednesday.
All told, nearly 28,000 students have applied to be undergraduates next year on the University Park campus, compared to 27,370 who had done so last year at this time, Ms. Rohrbach said. Each is vying for one of about 7,200 seats in the freshman class. Though Penn State accepts applications year-round, on a rolling basis, the deadline for so-called "priority'' applications -- after which some programs will be considered closed out -- was Wednesday.
That same increase in applications, Ms. Rohrbach said, has continued since the first week in November, when Jerry Sandusky, a former defensive coordinator for the university's football program, was arrested on charges of sexually abusing eight boys, setting off a cascade of events that included the firing of its iconic head football coach, Joe Paterno, and the university president. Since then, University Park has received 12,344 applications, she said, compared to 12,311 during the comparable period last year.
"It's tested us in many ways," she said. "But we've held our applicant pool."
Which is not to say that the Penn State admissions office, which has its headquarters just a few blocks from Beaver Stadium, has not had to field questions from concerned applicants and their parents.
During that first week after Mr. Sandusky's arrest, Ms. Rohrbach's office received some 50 phone calls related to the events; eight students have since informed Penn State -- most through their parents -- that they wished to withdraw their applications. But, she said, inquires have since calmed, and those students and their families who do raise the issue of the crisis the school has faced have made a point of acknowledging that it was the making of neither the student body nor the admissions staff.
"We kept thinking, 'What are we going to say?'" Ms. Rohrbach said, in reference to the initial wave of campus visits by prospective applicants in the days after Mr. Sandusky's arrest. "But the people who came were almost empathetic. They didn't want to talk about the story."
The steady stream of applications in the face of scandal may have something to do with the economics of attending Penn State; for the 2011-2012 academic year, its tuition is listed at $15,124 for in-state residents and $27,206 for out-of-state students, each representing a reduction from the average $28,500 that private four-year colleges charge, according to the College Board.
Ms. Rohrbach also emphasized the constancy of the school's academic standing. "Our faculty are all the same," she said. "We just feel that the reasons to choose Penn State haven't changed."
And yet, the full impact on the university's applicant pool will not be known until May 1, the deadline for those accepted by Penn State to inform the institution whether they will attend.
"We've gone through a whole mix of emotions," said Ms. Rohrbach, who has worked in Penn State admissions for 23 years. "But we really will be better and stronger and move ahead. We have to."

HEADLINE: The Huntsman Handicap

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: This week's Campaign Stops column. 

 BODY:
In this week's column for Campaign Stops, I discuss the most electable conservative remaining in the Republican field - the much-overlooked Jon Huntsman:
Huntsman is branded as the Republican field's lonely moderate, of course, which is one reason why he's current languishing at around 3 percent in the polls. But as Michael Brendan Dougherty noted in a summertime profile for the American Conservative, Huntsman's record as Utah's governor isn't "just to the right of other moderates, it is to the right of most conservatives."
Huntsman has none of Romney's health care baggage, and unlike the former Massachusetts governor, he didn't spend the last decade flip-flopping on gun rights, immigration and abortion. Meanwhile, on many of the highest-profile issues of the primary season (the individual mandate, Paul Ryan's House budget, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), he has arguably been more consistently conservative than Gingrich.
At the same time, because Huntsman is perceived as less partisan than his rivals, he has better general election prospects. The gears and tumblers of my colleague Nate Silver's predictive models give Huntsman a 55 percent chance of knocking off the incumbent even if the economy grows at a robust 4 percent, compared to Romney's 40 percent.
In theory, then, Huntsman seems like he could occupy the sweet spot that Gingrich claims to have all to himself. In practice, though, his campaign to date has been an unmitigated disaster.
Read the rest here.
